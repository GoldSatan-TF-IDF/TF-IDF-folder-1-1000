clive cussler lost empire fargo adventures prologue london england the man known as jotun strode purposefully through the predawn fog the collar of his peacoat up and a scarf wrapped loosely around his throat and mouth his breath misted in the air before him he stopped walking suddenly and listened had he heard footfalls he turned his head to the left then the right somewhere ahead he heard a muffled click a boot on cobblestone moving lightly for such a big man jotun stepped back into the shadows between the pillars of an arched gate in the pocket of his coat he tightened his fist around the shaft of his leadandleather cosh the side streets and back alleys of tilbury were never a friendly place and even less so between sunset and sunrisedamn this city jotun grumbled dark dank cold god help me he missed his wife he missed his country but this was where he was needed or so the powers that be said he trusted their judgment of course but there were times when he would gladly trade his current duty for a proper battlefield at least there he would know his enemy and know what to do with him kill or be killed very simple then again despite the distance his wife much preferred his current posting to his earlier ones better to be distant and alive than close and dead shed told him when hed gotten his orders jotun waited another few minutes but heard no further movement he checked his watch threethirty the streets would begin to stir in another hour if his quarry was going to make a run for it it would have to be before then he stepped back onto the street and continued north until he found malta road then turned south for the docks in the distance he could hear the lonely clanging of a buoy and he could smell the stench of the thames river ahead through the fog he glimpsed a lone figure standing on the southeast corner of dock road smoking a cigarette on cats feet jotun crossed the street and strode ahead until he could see more of the corner the man was indeed alone jotun stepped back into the alley entrance then whistled softly once the man turned jotun lit a match with his thumbnail let it flare briefly then crushed it out between his thumb and index finger the man walked over to jotun mornin sirthats debatable fancy indeed it is sir fancy looked down the block then up nervous asked jotun what me what would i have to be nervous about tiny fella like me walking these alleys in the dark of night what could be wrong with that so lets hear it shes there sir berthed as shes been the last four days lines are singled up though i chatted up a mate of mine that does odd jobs down on the docks rumor has it shes moving upriverto where millwall docks millwall docks arent finished yet fancy why are you lying to me no sir thats what i heard millwall later this morning ive got a man at millwall already fancy he says theyre closed down for another week at least sorry sir jotun heard the distinctive scuff of leather on brick behind him in the alley and immediately realized fancy was sorry for a different reason entirely jotun took some solace in the knowledge that this little weasel of a man probably hadnt betrayed him out of spite but rather out of greedrun along now fancy far away out of london if i see you again ill open your belly and feed you your own guts you wont be seeing me again sir for your sake make sure of it sorry again i always liked another word and it will be your last go fancy hurried off and disappeared into the fog jotun quickly considered his options the fact that fancy had lied about the millwall meant he was lying about the ship which in turn meant she was going downriver not up he couldnt let that happen now the question became was it wiser to run from the men who were coming up behind him or to fight them if he ran theyd chase him and the last thing he needed was a ruckus this close to the dock the ships crew was probably already on edge and he needed to catch them calm and unawaresjotun turned around to face the alley there were three of them one a little shorter than him two much shorter but they all had heavy round shoulders and bucketshaped heads street thugs throat cutters had there been enough light for jotun to see their faces he was certain there would be very few teeth plenty of scars and small mean eyesgood morning gentlemen how can i help you dont be makin this harder than it needs to be the bigger of the three said knives or hands or both jotun asked whot no matter its your choice come on then lets get on with it jotun took his hands from his pockets the big one rushed in jotun saw the knife coming up from the mans waist a welltimed slash designed to open up a femoral artery in the leg or tear open the lower belly jotun not only had two inches of height on the man but at least four inches of arms reach and he used it lashing out with his own uppercut blow at the last second he let the palmed cosh swing forward the leatherwrapped lead bulb caught the big man squarely under the chin his head flipped up and he stumbled backward into his partners then dropped hard on his butt the knife clattered across the cobblestones jotun took one long stride forward cocked his knee up to waist height and slammed the heel of his boot down onto the big mans ankle shattering the bone the man started screaming the other two hesitated then but only for a moment often in these circumstances a wolf pack like this disperses once the big dog is put down but these were men accustomed to easy fights the one on the right sidestepped his fallen partner dropped his shoulder and charged forward like a bull the charge was a ruse of course there was a blade hidden in one of those hands the moment jotun grabbed ahold of the man the knife would come up jotun took a quick step back on his left leg coiled it then sprung forward simultaneously swinging his right foot forward the kick caught the charging man fully in the face jotun heard the wet crunch of bone the man dropped to his knees teetered for a moment then collapsed facefirst onto the street the last man was against hesitating and now jotun saw what he was looking for that watershed moment when a man realizes hes going to die if he doesnt make the right decisiontheyre alive jotun said if you dont turn around and run im going to kill you the man stood rooted knife before him come on son did they really pay you enough for this the man lowered his knife he swallowed hard shook his head once then turned and ran so did jotun ran for all he was worth down the street right onto dock road then through a line of hedges and across st andrews a short alley took him to a pair of warehouses he sprinted between them vaulted over a fence landed hard then rolled to his feet and kept going until he heard the pounding of wood beneath his boots the docks he looked left then right but saw only fogwhich way he turned around read the building number above his head then turned on his heel and sprinted south for fifty yards to his right he heard the sound of water lapping he veered that way a dark shape loomed before him he skidded to a stop bumped into the stack of crates stumbled sideways then found his feet he hopped up onto the smallest crate then boosted himself up one more level twenty feet below he could just make out the surface of the water he looked upriver saw nothing then turned to look downrivertwenty yards away he saw the faint glow of yellow light behind a mullioned window above this past the deck rail a ships wheelhouse damn it jotun barked damn it to hell the ship faded into the fog and disappeared chapter chumbe island zanzibar tanzania the sharks darted at the edges of their vision sleek gray shapes that offered sam and remi fargo only glimpses of knifeedged fins and flicking tails before disappearing into the curtain of swirling sand as usual remi had refused to pass up the photo opportunity and as usual shed asked sam to serve as scale as she focused her highspeed underwater camera past him and at the feeding frenzy for his part sam was less worried about the sharks than he was the precipice at his backa hundredfiftyfoot drop off the sandbank into the dark deep of the zanzibar channel remi pulled her face up from the camera smiled with her eyes behind the mask and gave him an ok sign sam thankfully finned forward to join her together they knelt in the sand and watched the show it was july off the coast of tanzania which meant monsoon season which in turn meant the warm east african coastal current eacc was surging from the southeast until it met the southern tip of zanzibar where it split into inshore and offshore currents for sharks this created a food funnel in the eighteenmile gap between zanzibar and the mainland as prey fish were driven northward an irresistible moving buffet remi called it sam and remi took care to stay within what theyd dubbed the safe zone that fiftyyard crystalclear water strip off chumbe island past that was the drop into the channel the demarcation was hard to miss the current moving at six knots or more threw up a roiling curtain of sand as it scraped along the islands sandbar this sam and remi had dubbed the goodbye zone step into this rip current without a safety line and you were in for a oneway trip up the coast despite the dangeror perhaps because of itthis yearly trip to zanzibar was one of their favorites along with sharks prey fish rip currents and underwater sandstorms that lasted for months the eacc offered up treasurealbeit usually bits and pieces worth nothing more than their curiosity factor but this was enough for sam and remi over the centuries ships had been plying africas east coast from mombasa to dar es salaam many of them laden with gold and gems and ivory bound for colonial empire cities countless ships had sunk in and around the zanzibar channel the contents of their holds spilled along the bottom just waiting for the right current to uncover or move them within reach of curious divers such as the fargos over the years theyd recovered gold and silver coins from the roman empire to spain chinese ceramics sri lankan jade silverware from the fascinating to the mundane theyd uncovered it so far on this trip theyd found only one item of note a diamondshaped gold coin so barnacleencrusted they could make out no details sam and remi watched the sharks feed for a few more minutes and then by mutual nod turned and began finning south along the bottom each stopping occasionally to use a pingpong paddle to waft at the sand hoping the lump that had caught the eye might be a hidden bit of history chumbe island roughly six miles long and two miles wide is shaped like a womans boot with the shin ankle and forefoot facing the channel and the back of the calf the stiletto heel and sole facing zanzibar proper just above the ankle there was a break in the sandbar an inlet that led to the lagoon created by the stiletto heel after fifteen minutes of trolling along the sand sam and remi reached this stiletto break then turned west until they were ten yards off the beach then swung north again to resume their search now they became more watchful it was along this stretch of the sandbar that the main channel pushed dangerously close to the beach a bubbleshaped salient that narrowed their safe zone to a mere forty feet remi swam inshore and ahead of sam by a few feet each of them frequently checking to make sure the other hadnt drifted toward the precipice in the corner of sams right eye he saw a glint a fleeting flash of gold he stopped swimming settled knees first into the sand then tapped his dive knife on his tank to get remis attention she stopped swimming turned and finned back to him he pointed toward the spot she nodded with sam in the lead they swam toward shore until the sandbanks came into view a wall of sand nearly twelve feet tall these banks marked a precipice of sorts where the water depth dropped from chest height to twenty feet they stopped before the bank and looked aroundremi shrugged where sam shrugged his shoulders and kept scanning up and down the bank there twenty feet to his right he saw it again a flash of gold they swam to it and stopped again here the goodbye zone precipice was closer still not eight feet behind their backs even at this distance they could feel the surge of the current like a vortex trying to sweep them into the deep jutting from the bank at waist height was what appeared to be six or seven inches of a barrels hoop though tarnished and fuzzy with barnacles in a few places the hoop had been sandblasted by the current exposing shiny metal sam reached out and fanned the area around the hoop the exposed portion widened to eight inches then ten inches before curving back and disappearing into the bank sam moved his paddle upward hoping to uncover some of the barrels staves if the wood hadnt succumbed to rot sam stopped fanning he looked to remi and saw her eyes were wide behind her mask above the hoop was not rotted wood but a curved metal facade mottled green with patina sam dropped to his knees and wiggled forward until his chest was nearly touching the bank then craned his neck and waved his paddle beneath the hoop after thirty seconds of work a cavity appeared gently slowly sam slipped his hand into the hollow and probed the interior with splayed fingers he withdrew his arm and backed away from the object until he was again beside remi she looked at him with expectant eyes he nodded back there was no doubt their barrel wasnt a barrel but rather a ships bellwell that was unexpected remi said a few minutes later after surfacing ill say sam replied after removing his mouthpiece until now the biggest artifact theyd ever found was a sterling silver trencher from a torpedoed world war ii liberty ship she shed her fins and tossed them over the gunwale onto the afterdeck of their rentala commuterstyle twentyfivefoot andreyale joubertnivelt express cruiser complete with lacquered teak woodwork and retro subway windowsthen climbed the ladder followed by sam once theyd shed the remainder of their gear and tucked it away in the andreyales cabin remi fished a pair of water bottles from the ice chest and tossed one to sam they sat down on the deck chairshow long do you think its been down there remi asked hard to say doesnt take long for patina to set in wed have to see the thickness of the growth on the rest of it the interior felt fairly unblemished and the clapper remi asked couldnt feel it looks like weve got a decision to make that we do not only did the tanzanian government have some unorthodox laws when it came to maritime salvage chumbe island was officially known as chumbe island coral park a good portion of which had been partitioned as a reef sanctuary and a closed forest reserve before sam and remi could do anything they first had to determine whether the bell officially lay within either of these protected areas if they passed this hurdle then they could in good conscience proceed to the next step determining the bells provenance andor pedigree a requirement should they want to stake a legal claim before alerting local officials to the bells presence it was a tenuous tightrope on which they tread if they reached the far side they may have a significant historical find on their hands but on either side of the tightrope were laws that could lead to at best having the find snatched away or at worst criminal charges by law they could take any found manmade objects that required no extraordinary excavation methods trinkets such as remis diamondshaped coin were fine a ships bell was a wholly different matter none of this was new to the fargos together and alone privately and professionally sam and remi had been hunting for treasure artifacts and hidden history for most of their adult livesfollowing in her fathers footsteps remi had attended boston college emerging with a masters in anthropology and history with a focus on ancient trade routes sams father whod died a few years earlier had been one of the lead engineers on nasas space programs while sams mother a vivacious lady ran a charter dive boat sam received an engineering degree from caltech along with a handful of trophies for lacrosse and soccer while in his final months at caltech sam was approached by a man he would later discover was from darpathe defense advanced research projects agencythe governments research and development arm the lure of pure creative engineering combined with serving his country made sams choice an easy one after seven years at darpa sam returned to california where sam and remi met at the lighthouse a jazz club on hermosa beach sam had wandered into the club for a cold beer and remi was there celebrating a successful research trip looking into rumors of a sunken spanish ship off abalone cove though neither of them had ever called their first meeting a case of love at first sight theyd both agreed it had certainly been a case of pretty damned sure at first hour six months later they were married where theyd first met in a small ceremony at the lighthouse at remis encouragement sam dove headfirst into his own business and they struck pay dirt within a year with an argon laser scanner that could detect and identify at a distance mixed metals and alloys from gold and silver to platinum and palladium treasure hunters universities corporations and mining outfits scrambled to license sams invention and within two years fargo group was seeing an annual net profit of three million dollars within four years the deeppocketed corporations came calling sam and remi took the highest bid sold the company for enough money to see themselves comfortably through the rest of their lives and then turned to their true passion treasure hunting for sam and remi the engine that drove their lives was not money but rather the adventure and the satisfaction of seeing the fargo foundation flourish the foundation which split its gifting among underprivileged and abused children animal protection and nature conservancy had grown by leaps and bounds over the last decade the previous year donating almost twenty million dollars to a variety of organizations a hefty part of that money had come from sam and remi personally and the rest of it from private donations for better or worse their exploits attracted a fair amount of media attention which in turn attracted wealthy highprofile donors the question they now faced was whether this ships bell was something they could turn into philanthropic funds or simply a fascinating historical diversion not that it mattered of course the pursuit of hidden history held its own joys for them either way they knew where they had to starttime to call selma remi said time to call selma sam agreed an hour later they were back at their rented plantationstyle bungalow at kendwa beach on zanzibars northern tip while remi prepared a fresh fruit salad slices of prosciutto and mozzarella and iced tea sam dialed selma above their heads a sixtyinch ceiling fan churned the air while through the french doors a cool offshore breeze billowed the gauze curtains despite it being four am in san diego selma wondrash picked up on the first ring sam and remi were not surprised having come to believe selma slept only four hours a night save sundays when she slept fivethe only time you call me when youre on vacation is when youre in trouble or about to get into trouble selma said over the speakerphone without preamble not true sam replied last year from the seychelles we called because a troop of baboons had broken into your beach house destroyed the furniture and made off with all your worldly goods and the police thought you were burglars shes right remi mouthed from across the kitchen island using the tip of her knife she tossed sam a chunk of fresh pineapple he caught it in his mouth and she applauded silentlyokay thats true sam told selma a former hungarian citizen whod never quite lost her accent selma wondrash was the stern but secretly softhearted head of sam and remis threeperson research team behind the fargo foundation selma was widowed having lost her husband an air force test pilot in a crash ten years earlier after finishing her degree at georgetown selma had managed the library of congresss special collections division until sam and remi lured her away more than a research chief selma had proven herself a superb travel agent and logistics guru getting them to and from destinations with militaristic efficiency selma ate drank and lived research the mystery that stubbornly refused solution the legend that showed the barest spark of truthso what is it this time selma asked a ships bell remi called they could hear the fluttering of paper as selma retrieved a fresh legal pad tell me she said west coast of chumbe island sam said then recited the coordinates hed locked into his gps unit before heading for the boat youll have to check boundaries of the reserves and sanctuaries yes selma said her pencil rasping on paper ill have wendy look into tanzanian maritime law anything else a coin diamondshaped about the size of a us halfdollar we found it about a hundred twenty yards north of the bell sam looked to remi for confirmation of this and got a nod in return were going to see if we can clean it up a bit but the face is obscured right nowgot it next theres no next thats it as soon as possible selma the sooner we can put a hook on that bell the better that sandbank didnt look all that stable ill get back to you selma replied and hung up chapter mexico city mexico quauhtli garza the president of the united mexican states and the leader of the mexica pronounced in the traditional way mehsheekah tenochca party gazed out the floortoceiling windows and down into the plaza de la constitucion where the great temple had once stood now it was nothing more than beautified ruins a tourist attraction for those who wanted to gawk at the sad remains of the magnificent aztec city of tenochtitlan and the great twelvefootdiameter twentyton calendar stonea mockery quauhtli garza mumbled watching the milling crowds a mockery hed so far been able to correct with only marginal success true the mexican people had since his election gained a better understanding of their lineagehad come to understand the true history of their country that had been all but obliterated by spanish imperialism even the name the aztec party which so many news reporters used to describe mexica tenochca was an insult a nod to falsity hernan cortes and his bloodthirsty spanish conquistadors had named the mexica peoples aztecs bastardized from the name of the legendary home of the mexicaaztlan it was a necessary artifice however for now aztec was a term the mexican people both understood and could take to their collective hearts in time garza would educate them it was in fact a ground surge of preconquest nationalism that had swept garza and the mexica tenochca into power but garzas hopes for mexicos widespread and immediate embracement of its history were starting to fade hed come to realize theyd won the election partly because of the previous administrations incompetence and corruption and partly because of mexica tenochcas aztecan showmanship as one political pundit had termed itshowmanship indeed it was absurd hadnt garza years ago renounced his spanish christian name fernando for a nahuatl one hadnt his entire cabinet done the same hadnt garza renamed his own children in the nahuatl tongue and more literature and images of spains conquest of mexico were slowly being weeded from school curricula street and plaza names had been changed in favor of nahuatl words schools now taught courses in nahuatl and the true history of the mexica people religious holidays and traditional mexica festivals were celebrated several times a year but still all the polling showed that the mexican people saw all of it as noveltiesexcuses to miss work or drink or misbehave in the streets even so that same polling suggested real change could be instituted if they had enough time garza and the mexica tenochca needed another term and to get that garza needed to have the senate the chamber of deputies and the supreme court of justice of the nation more firmly under his thumb as it stood the presidency was restricted to a single term of six years not long enough to accomplish what garza had planned not long enough to accomplish what mexico needed a fully realized history of its own free of the lies of conquest and slaughter garza stepped away from the window strode to his desk and pressed a button on the remote shades descended from the ceiling muting the noonday sun in the ceiling recessed lighting glowed to life illuminating the burgundy carpet and heavy wooden furniture like the rest of garzas life his office reflected his mexica heritage tapestries and paintings depicting aztec history lined the walls here a twelvefootlong handpainted codex detailing the founding of tenochtitlan on a marshy island in lake texcoco over there a painting of the aztec goddess of the moon coyolxauhqui across the room above the fireplace a floortoceiling tapestry showing huitzilopochtli the hummingbird wizard and tezcatlipoca the smoking mirror in union watching over their people on the wall above his desk was an oil painting of chicomoztocthe place of seven cavesthe legendary source of all nahuatlspeaking peoples none of these however kept him awake at night that honor belonged to the artifact standing in the corner of the room perched atop a crystal pedestal in a cube of halfinchthick glass was quetzalcoatl the feathered serpent god of the aztecs of course depictions of quetzalcoatl were commonplaceon pottery and tapestries and in a multitude of codicesbut this representation was unique a statuette the only one of its kind at four inches tall and seven inches long it was a masterwork carved by unknown hands a millennium ago from a chunk of nearly translucent jade garza walked around his desk and sat in the chair before the pedestal quetzalcoatls surface lit from above by an inset halogen bulb seemed to swirl forming mesmerizing shapes and pools of color that were at once there and not there garzas eyes drifted back along quetzalcoatls plumes and scales until coming to rest on the tailor where the tail should have been he corrected himself instead of tapering to a traditional serpents tail the statuette widened for a few inches before ending abruptly in a jagged vertical line as though it had been cleaved from a larger artifact this was in fact the theory garzas scientists had put forth and a theory he had worked hard to suppress this quetzalcoatl statuette this symbol of the mexica tenochca was incomplete garza knew what was missingor more accurately he knew the missing piece would not resemble anything in the aztec pantheon it was this thought that kept him awake at night as the symbol of the mexica tenochca movement since the day garza had founded it this statuette had become a rallying cry for the wave of nationalism that had swept him into office should its credibility be called into doubt it was a question garza didnt dare entertain the thought that a lost nineteenthcentury warship could destroy everything that hed built was unacceptable all of it gone because of a trinket or artifact found by a random snorkeler who in turn shows it to someone with a passing interest in history who then asks an expert a falling domino that destroys a nations restored pridethe buzz of the intercom on garzas desk shook him from his reverie he turned off the cases halogen light and returned to his desk yes he said he is here mr president send him in garza said then turned and sat down behind his desk the double doors opened a moment later and in strode itzli rivera at six feet tall and one hundred fifty pounds itzli rivera appeared unsubstantial from a distancegaunt in the extreme his narrow face of angles and planes dominated by a hawk nosebut as he came closer garza reminded himself how deceptive riveras appearance was it showed in the hard set of his eyes and mouth in his steady purposeful gait and in the taut muscles and the tendons of his bare forearms even without knowing the man an astute observer could easily see itzli rivera was no stranger to hardship of course garza knew this to be true his chief operative had indeed visited hardship upon many poor souls so far most of them political opponents who didnt share garzas vision for mexico luckily it was easier to find a virgin in a brothel than it was to find an incorrupt member of the senate or the chamber of deputies and rivera had a knack for finding a mans weakness then shoving the dagger home rivera was himself a true believer having rejected his spanish name hector in favor of itzli which in nahuatl meant obsidian a fitting name garza thought a former major in the grupo aeromovil de fuerzas especiales or special forces airmobile group gafe and former secretariat of national defences s intelligence second section rivera had left the army to become garzas personal bodyguard but garza had quickly seen riveras wider potential and had put him to work as his own private intelligence and operations directorgood morning mr president rivera said stiffly and to you sit down sit down can i get you something rivera shook his head and garza asked to what do i owe this visit weve come across something you may want to seea video i asked your secretary to cue it up rivera picked up the remote from his desk aimed it at the fiftyinch lcd television on the wall and hit power garza sat down after a few seconds of silence a man and woman in their midthirties appeared sitting together before an ocean backdrop off camera a reporter was asking questions though garzas english was fluent riveras technical people had added spanish subtitlesthe interview was short no longer than three minutes when it was done garza looked to rivera and the significance is those are the fargossam and remi fargo is that supposed to mean something to me do you remember last year the story about napoleons lost cellar the lost spartans garza was nodding his head yes yes the fargos were behind that theyre very good at what they do this got garzas attention he leaned forward in his chair where was this interview taped zanzibar by a bbc correspondent of course the timing could be a coincidence garza waved his hand dismissively i dont believe in coincidences and neither do you my friend or else you wouldnt have brought this to me for the first time since entering the office rivera showed a trace of emotiona thin sharks smile that never reached his eyes true how did you come across this after the revelation i had my technical team create a special program it monitors the internet for certain key words in this case zanzibar tanzania chumbe shipwrecks and treasure the last two of course are the fargos specialties in the interview they were adamant that the trip was simply a diving vacation but this close to the last incident the british woman sylvie radford radford garza thought luckily the idiot woman had had no inkling of the significance of what shed found treating it as nothing more than a trinket showing it off around zanzibar and bagamoyo asking locals what it might be the necessity of her death had been unfortunate but rivera had handled it with his usual carea street robbery turned murder the police had concluded what ms radford actually found had been the thinnest of threads one that wouldve required careful and expert teasing lest it snap but the fargos they knew all about following random threads he suspected the fargos knew how to uncover something from nothing could she have told someone what she found garza asked the fargos have their own intelligence network of sorts i would imagine could they have gotten a whiff of something garza narrowed his eyes and stared hard at rivera tell me itzli did you miss somethingthe gaze that had withered many a cabinet secretary and political opponent left rivera unfazed the man merely shrugged i doubt it but it is possible he said calmly garza nodded though the possibility of ms radford having shared her find with someone was disconcerting garza was pleased rivera had no trouble admitting he may have made a mistake as president garza was surrounded daily by sycophants and yesmen he trusted rivera to give him the unvarnished truth and to fix the unfixable and hed never failed in either respectfind out garza ordered go to zanzibar and find out what the fargos are up to and if this isnt a coincidence they wouldnt be as easy to handle as the british woman im sure youll work it out garza said if history has shown us anything its that zanzibar can be a dangerous place chapter zanzibar after talking with selma sam and remi took a catnap then showered changed clothes and took their scooters down the coast road to stone town to their favorite tanzanian cuisine restaurant the ekundu kifaruswahili for red rhino overlooking the waterfront the red rhino was nestled between the old customs house and the big tree a giant old fig that served as a daily hangout for small boat builders and charter captains offering day sails to prison island or bawe island for sam and remi zanzibar or unguja in swahili personified old world africa the island had over the centuries been ruled by warlords and sultans slave traders and pirates it had been the headquarters for trading companies and the staging area for thousands of european missionaries explorers and big game hunters sir richard burton and john hanning speke had used zanzibar as the base for their search for the source of the nile henry morton stanley had begun his famous hunt for the wayward david livingstone in the labyrinthine alleys of stone town captain william kidd had reputedly sailed the waters around zanzibar as both pirate and pirate hunterhere sam and remi found every street and courtyard had a story and every structure a secret history they never left zanzibar without dozens of fond memories by the time they pulled into the parking lot the sun was dropping quickly toward the horizon casting the sea in shades of gold and red the scent of oysters on the grill drifted in the airwelcome back mr and mrs fargo the valet called then signaled for a pair of whitecoated attendants who trotted over and pushed the scooters away evening abasi sam replied shaking the valets hand remi received a warm hug theyd met abasi sibale on their first visit to zanzibar six years earlier and had become fast friends usually having dinner with him and his family at least once during their yearly visits abasi was never without a smilehowre faraja and the kids sam asked happy and healthy thank you you will come to supper while you are here remi smiled wouldnt miss it i believe they are ready for you inside abasi said just inside the door the maitre d elimu was waiting he too had known the fargos for years good to see you good to see you your favorite table overlooking the harbor is ready thank you sam said elimu led them to a corner table lit by a red hurricane lantern and surrounded on two sides by open windows overlooking the waterfront below stone towns streetlights were flickering to lifewine yes elimu asked you would like the list do you still have that pinot noirthe chamonix yes we have a or a sam looked to remi who said i still remember the as the lady wishes elimu very good sir elimu disappeared its beautiful remi murmured staring out over the ocean i couldnt agree more she turned her head away from the window gave him a smile and squeezed his hand you got a little sun she remarked for some inexplicable reason sam fargo burned oddlytoday only the bridge of his nose and the tips of his ears were pink tomorrow they would be bronze youre going to be itchy laterim itchy now so any guesses remi asked holding up the diamond coin it had spent the afternoon first sitting in a bowl of ten percent nitric acid followed by sams secret formula of white vinegar salt and distilled water followed by a scrubbing with a softbristle toothbrush while many spots remained obscured they could make out a womans face in profile and two words marie and reunion these details theyd relayed to selma before leaving the bungalownot a one sam said an odd shape for a coin though private minting perhaps could be if so its well done nice clean edges good tooling solid weight elimu returned with the wine decanted poured for both of them waited for their nods of approval then filled their glasses this particular pinot noir was south african a rich red with hints of cloves cinnamon nutmeg and something sam couldnt quite placeremi took a second sip and said chicory sams phone rang he looked at the screen mouthed selma then answered evening selma remi leaned forward to listen in morning for me pete and wendy just got here theyre starting on the tanzanian law angle perfect let me guess youre sitting at the the ekundu kifaru staring at the sunset creatures of habit remi said you have news sam asked about your coin you have yourself another mystery sam saw the waiter approaching and said hold a minute they ordered a samakai wa kusonga and walifish croquet and native rice with chapati breadand for dessert ndizi no kastadzanzibarstyle banana custard the waiter left and sam unmuted selmago ahead selma were all ears sam said the coin was minted sometime in the early s only fifty were made and they never saw official circulation in fact they were a token of affection for lack of a better term the marie on the coins face is part of sainte marie the name of a french commune situated on the north coast of reunion islandnever heard of it remi said not surprising its a little lump of an island about four hundred miles east of madagascar whos the woman sam asked adelise molyneux the wife of demont molyneux the administrator of sainte marie from to according to the stories for their tenth anniversary demont had his private stock of gold melted down and minted into these adelise coinsquite a gesture remi said the coins were supposed to represent the number of years demont hoped they would spend together before dying they came close they both died within a year of each other just shy of their fortieth anniversaryso how did this one get all the way to zanzibar sam asked heres where truth gets mixed up with legend selma replied youve heard of george booth i assume english pirate sam said right spent most of his time in the indian ocean and red sea started as a gunner aboard the pelican around then aboard the dolphin around the dolphin was cornered by a british fleet near reunion island some of the crew surrendered some including booth escaped to madagascar where booth and a another pirate captain john bowen combined forces and hijacked the speaker a fourhundredfiftyton fiftygun slave ship booth was elected captain and then around he took the speaker to zanzibar when they went ashore for supplies the landing party was attacked by arab troops booth was killed and bowen survived from there bowen took the speaker back to the waters around madagascar before dying a few years later on mauritius you said the dolphin was cornered near reunion island sam repeated how close to the sainte marie communea few miles offshore selma replied legend says booth and his crew had just finished raiding the commune having made off with the adelise coins remi finished so says the legend and so said demont molyneux in an official letter of complaint to louis xiv the king of france so lets play this out sam said booth and the other escapees from the dolphin take with them the adelise coins then meet up with bowen they then hijack the speaker and head for zanzibar where they what bury their booty on chumbe island dump it in shallow water for later recovery or maybe the speaker never got away remi added maybe the stories are wrong maybe she was sunk in the channelhalf a dozen of one six of the other selma replied either way the coin you found is from the adelise lot the question is sam said does our bell belong to the speaker chapter zanzibar the storm that had closed over the island in the earlymorning hours had moved on by dawn leaving the air crisp and the foliage around their bungalow glistening with dew sam and remi sat on the rear porch overlooking the beach and shared a meal of fruit bread cheese and strong black coffee in the trees around them hidden birds squawkedsuddenly a pinkiesized gecko scaled the leg of remis chair and skittered across her lap and onto the table where it navigated the dishes before retreating down sams chair wrong turn i guess sam remarked i have a way with reptiles remi said they shared one more cup of coffee then cleaned up packed their backpacks and walked down to the beach where theyd grounded the cabin cruiser sam tossed their backpacks over the railing then gave remi a boostanchor she called coming sam squatted beside the augershaped beach anchor wriggled it free then handed it up to remi she disappeared and he could hear her feet padding along the deck and then a few seconds later the engines growled to life and settled into a sputtering idleslow back sam called slow back aye remi replied when sam heard the propeller begin to churn he leaned hard against the hull dug his feet into the wet sand coiled his legs and shoved the boat eased back a foot then another then floated free he reached up snagged the lowermost railing with his hands then swung his legs up hooked his heel on the gunwale and climbed aboardchumbe island remi called through the open pilothouse window chumbe island sam confirmed got a mystery to solve they were a few miles northwest of prison island when sams satellite phone trilled sitting on the afterdeck sorting through their gear sam picked up the phone and pressed talk it was selma good news not so good news she saidgood news first sam said according to tanzanias ministry of natural resources regulations the spot where you found the bell is outside sanctuary boundaries theres no reef there so no protection necessaryand the not so good news tanzanian maritime salvage law still appliesno extraordinary excavation methods its a gray area but it sounds like youre going to need more than pingpong paddles to free that bell ive got both pete and wendy looking into the permit processdiscreetly of course boyfriend and girlfriend pete jeffcoat and wendy cordentan and fit blond californians with degrees in archaeology and social sciences respectivelyworked as selmas apprenticesgood sam said keep us posted after a brief stop at the stone town docks to refuel and gather the days provisions it took another leisurely ninety minutes cruising down the coast and picking their way through the channels of zanzibars outer islands before they reached the bells gps coordinates sam went forward and dropped anchor the air was dead calm and the sky a cloudless blue as zanzibar sat just below the equator july was during winter rather than summer so the temperature wouldnt climb above the low eighties a good day for diving he hoisted the whitestripeonred diverdown flag on the halyard then joined remi on the afterdecktanks or snorkel she asked lets start with snorkel the bell was sitting in ten feet of water lets get a good look at what were up against then regroup as it had been the day before and was ninety percent of the time in zanzibar the water was stunningly clear ranging in shade from turquoise to indigo sam rolled backward over the gunwale followed a few seconds later by remi together they hung motionless on the surface for a few seconds letting the cloud of bubbles and froth dissipate then flipped over and dove once they reached the white sand bottom they turned right and soon reached the lip of the bank where they performed another pike dive and followed the vertical face to the bottom they stopped knelt in the sand and jammed their dive knives into the bottom to use as handholds ahead they could see the edge of the goodbye zone the previous nights storm had not only ramped up the current in the main channel but had also churned up a lot of debris so thick it looked like a solid graybrown wall of sand this at least would keep the sharks away from the shallows the downside was they could feel the draw of the current from where they hoveredsam tapped his snorkel and jerked his thumb upward remi nodded they finned for the surface and broke into the air you feel that sam asked remi nodded felt like an invisible hand was trying to grab us stick close to the bank got it they dove again on the bottom sam checked the readout on his gps unit oriented himself then pointed south down the bank and signed to remi feet resurfacing they swam that way in single file sam in the lead one eye on the gps one eye on his position he stopped again and pointed an index finger down where the bell had jutted from the bank there was now nothing but a barrelshaped crater anxiously they scanned left and right remi saw it first a curved indentation in the bottom ten feet to their right connected to another indentation by a curved line like a sidewinders trail the pattern repeated they followed it with their eyes until twenty feet away they saw a dark lump jutting from the sand it was the bell it took little imagination to piece together what had happened throughout the night the stormdriven waves had scoured the bank slowly but steadily eroding the sand around the bell until it tumbled from its resting place from there the surge had rolled the bell along its mouth physics erosion and time doing their work until the storm passed sam and remi turned to each other and nodded excitedly where tanzanian law had forbidden them to use extraordinary excavation methods mother nature had come to the rescue they swam toward the bell but had only covered half the distance when sam reached out a halting hand to remis arm she had already stopped and was staring ahead shed seen what hed seenthe bell had come to a stop at the lip of the precipice with the waist shoulder and crown embedded in the sand and the sound ring and mouth jutting into empty space back on the surface they got their breath remi said its too big too big for what to move no to belong to the speaker sam considered this youre right i didnt notice the speakers displacement was listed as four hundred fifty tons according to standard measures for the era in question her bell wouldnt have weighed more than sixty pounds their bell was bigger than thatcuriouser and curiouser sam said back to the boat we need a plan they were ten feet from the boat when they heard the rumble of diesel engines approaching from behind they reached the ladder and turned around to see a tanzanian coast guard gunboat a hundred yards away sam and remi climbed onto the andreyales afterdeck and shed their gearsmile and wave sam murmured are we in trouble remi whispered through her smile dont know well soon find out sam continued waving ive heard tanzanian jails are unpleasant every jail is unpleasant its all relative thirty feet away the gunboat came about and drew parallel to them bow to stern sam now saw it was an upgraded sera chinese yulinclass patrol boat they saw yulins several times on each of their trips and sam ever interested had done his homework forty feet long ten tons threeshaft two sixhundredhorsepower diesel engines and a pair of twin mm deck guns fore and aft two sailors in jungle fatigues stood on the afterdeck and two more on the forecastle all bore shoulderslung aks a tall black man in crisp whites clearly the captain stepped from the cabin and walked to the railingahoy he called unlike sam and remis previous encounters with the coast guard this captain was grimfaced no welcoming smile or pleasantries ahoy sam replied routine safety check we will board you now be our guest the gunboats engines gurgled and the yulin angled closer until its bow was ten feet away the engines went back to idle and the yulin glided to a stop beside them the sailors on the afterdeck tossed tire bumpers over the side then reached down grabbed the andreyales railing and pulled the boats together the captain vaulted over the railing and landed catlike on the andreyales afterdeck beside sam and remiyou are flying the diver flag i see he said doing a little snorkeling sam replied this boat is yours no a rental your papers for the boat and diving certificates remi said ill get them then trotted down the steps into the cabin the captain asked sam what is your purpose here on zanzibar or here specifically both sir just on vacation this seemed like a nice spot we were here yesterday remi returned with the documents and handed them to the captain who first examined the rental agreement then their diving certificates he looked up and studied their faces you are sam and remi fargosam nodded the treasure hunters remi said for lack of a better term are you hunting treasure on zanzibar sam smiled thats not why we came but we try to keep our eyes open over the captains shoulder behind the tinted windows of the yulins cabin sam saw a shadowed figure it appeared to be staring at themhave your eyes seen anything on this visit a coin you are aware of tanzanian law regarding these matters remi nodded we are from the yulin a knuckle rapped once on the window the captain looked over his shoulder said to sam and remi wait here then climbed back over the railing and stepped into the yulins cabin he reappeared a minute later and jumped back downthe coin you have founddescribe it without hesitation remi said round copper about the size of a fiftyshilling piece its badly pitted we havent been able to make anything of it do you have it with you no said sam and you say you are not hunting for any shipwrecks or specific treasure thats correct where are you staying on zanzibar sam saw no point in lying they would doublecheck the answer a bungalow on kendwa beach the captain handed back their papers then tipped his cap to them good day and then he was back over the rail and inside the yulins cabin the gunboats engines rumbled the sailors pushed off and the gunboat came about and steered west toward the channel sam took two long strides ducked into the cabin and reemerged with a pair of binoculars he lifted them to his eyes and trained them on the yulin after twenty seconds he lowered the binocularswhat remi asked there was someone in the cabin giving orders the knock on the window remi said did you get a look at him sam nodded not black and not in uniform he looked hispanicmaybe mediterranean thin hawk nose thick eyebrows what kind of nontanzanian civilian would have the power to order about a coast guard gunboat and her crew someone with deep pockets as much as they loved tanzania and zanzibar and their people there was no arguing that corruption was common the majority of tanzanians made a few dollars a day military personnel only slightly more lets not get ahead of ourselves though right now we dont know anything just curious remi whyd you lie about the coingut reaction remi replied you think i should have no i had the same instinct the tanzanian coast guard has two yulin gunboats to cover the central coast the main channel and zanzibar i got the impression they were specifically looking for usme too and as safety checks go that one was worthless didnt ask about life preservers the radio or our dive gear and when was the last time we met a tanzanian official that wasnt all smiles and geniality never sam replied about the adelise coin remi unzipped the side pocket of her dive shorts withdrew the coin and held it up with a smile thats my girl sam said you think theyll search the bungalow sam shrugged so put it all together and whats it mean remi pondered no idea but were going to watch our step from here on out chapter zanzibar for the next hour they sat on the afterdeck sipping icecold water and enjoying the gentle rocking of the andreyale and listening to the waves lapping at the hull within the first thirty minutes of the yulins departure it appeared twice more a mile out cruising first north to south then south to north it had not returnedcant help but worry the bells tumbled over the edge remi said i can see it in my minds eye me too but id rather risk that than have them come back while were in the middle of raising it lets give it another twenty minutes worst case we can probably still get to it true but at a hundred fifty feet things start getting dicey getting down there wouldnt be so hard finding it might be as massive as the bell was after bouncing down a hundredfiftyfoot slope it could end up almost anywhere like a dropped childs marble thats lost in the dining room but ends up under the refrigerator in the kitchen and once we find it getting it up to the surface is a different can of worms altogether better dive gear compressor lift bags winch sam was nodding there would be no chance of hiding that level of activity from curious or prying eyes simply renting the equipment in stone towneven anonymouslywould set the rumor mill in motion by days end there would be onlookers both on the shoreline and in boats offshoreincluding perhaps the yulin gunboat and her mysterious passengerlets hope it doesnt come to that he said they moved the andreyale to within thirty feet of the bells location sam went over the side and wedged the anchor behind a rock outcropping and then back aboard they uncoiled the hundred feet of solidbraided threequarterinch anchor rope theyd purchased earlier in stone town they looped the rope over the port and starboard rear gunwale cleats then secured the loop in the center with a screwlink d ring the remainder of the coil they tossed over the stern two minutes later they were in their snorkel gear and finning along the surface dragging the rope behind them to their mutual surprise they found the bell where theyd left it perched on the edge of the precipice but they immediately found the situation was more precarious than theyd anticipated the sand beneath the bells mouth was eroding before their eyes wisps of sand and chunks of rock being ripped away by the currentremi fed the end of the rope through the d ring on her dive belt then handed it to sam who did the same then clamped the ropes screwlink d ring between his teeth they finned to the surface grabbed a half dozen lungfuls of air then dove again sam signaled to remi pictures if the worst came to pass and they lost the bell pictures would at least give them a chance at identification as remi started shooting sam finned forward until he could see over the edge the slope was not quite vertical but rather sixty or sixtyfive degrees not that it mattered as remi had earlier guessed the bells weight surpassed that of the speakers by twenty or thirty pounds if the bell decided to go over the edge the slopes angle would slow its descent only slightlyand then as if on cue the sand beneath the bell gave way the crown tipped upward hovered for a split second then the bell began sliding mouth first down the slope on an impulse he immediately regretted sam coiled his legs gave a sharp dolphin kick and followed the bell over the edge he heard fleetingly remis muffled scream of sam and then it was gone replaced by the rush of the current sand peppered his body like a thousand bee stings tumbling now head over feet sam reached out in what he hoped was the direction of the bank the outstretched fingers of his right hand struck something hard and he felt a sharp pain shoot through his pinkie finger ignoring the pain he could feel the bell picking up speed now the bulldozerlike effect of the mouth losing to the physics of momentum his eyesight began to swim as his lungs began consuming the last molecules of oxygen his heart pounded in his head like cannon fire working from feel alone he slid his hand up the bells waist then over the head his fingers found the opening of the crown he lifted his left hand up to his mouth grabbed the d ring and fed it through the crown he curled it around the line and then using his thumb spun the screw link closed the bell jerked to a stop the rope let out a muffled twang sam lost his grip and he began sliding downward hands slapping at the bells surface fingers scrabbling for purchase there was nothing then suddenly a ridge slid beneath his palm he felt another stab of pain in his pinkie finger the bead line he thought his curled fingertips had landed on the bead line just above the mouth of the bell he reached up with his other hand gripped the line then chinned himself upward both legs kicking against the draw of the current until the anchor line came into view a braid of pure white in the swirl of sand he grabbed it he felt fingers touch the back of his hand out of the gloom a face appeared remi his eyesight was sparkling now and dimming at the edges remi pulled herself down the anchor line reached down clamped onto his right wrist and tuggedinstinctively sam latched onto rope and began climbing ten minutes later he sat in the deck chair eyes closed and head tilted back into the sun after two minutes of this he brought his head level again and opened his eyes to find remi sitting on the gunwale watching him she leaned forward and handed him a bottle of waterfeeling better she asked gently yes much pinkie fingers jammed though smarts he held it up for inspection the digit was straight but swollen he curled it and winced its not broken nothing a little athletic tape wont curenothing else wrong sam shook his head good glad to hear it said remi sam fargo youre a dummy pardon me what were you thinking going after that thing i just reacted by the time i realized what the hell i was doing it was too late in for a penny in for a oneway trip to the bottom of the ocean remi countered with a scowling shake of her head i swear fargo sorry sam said and thanks for coming to get me dummy remi repeated then got up walked over and kissed him on the cheek but youre my dummy and you dont need to thank mebut youre welcome anyway tell me we still have it sam said looking around do we still have it he was still a tad woozy remi pointed off the stern where the anchor line taut as piano wire arced down into the waterwhile you were taking your catnap i dragged it off the slope it should be resting about five feet from the edge nicely done dont get too excited we still have to raise it sam smiled have no fear remi physics is our friend before they could apply sams idea however they had to exercise some brute force with sams newly damaged pinkie wrapped in duct tape he stood in the stern taking up slack in the anchor line while remi reversed the andreyales engine and followed his hand signals until they were almost directly above the bell he uncoiled the line from the cleats took up the remainder of the slack then looped and locked down againsam called all ahead slow nice and easy you got it remi eased the throttle forward a quarter inch at a time sam leaning over the stern his face mask in the water watched the bells progress as it bulldozed through the sand when it was twenty feet from the edge of the precipice he called all stop remi throttled down sam settled the mask over his face and dove down to examine their prize he resurfaced a minute later looks good not much barnacle growth which means its probably been embedded in that bank for quite a whileremi extended her hand and helped sam aboard she asked damage none that i could see its thick remiprobably closer to eighty pounds she whistled softly big boy okay by standard measure thatd make the ship what a thousand tons displacement between that and twelve hundred much bigger than the speaker the proximity of the adelise coin and the bell is pure coincidence with the bell no longer in danger of dropping into the channel they disconnected and steered the andreyale north a hundred yards then eased their way through the inlet at the islands ankle and emerged in the stiletto lagoon only a half mile wide and long the lagoon was actually a mangrove swamp jutting from the water were a couple dozen floating islands mushroom caps of earth sitting atop buttresses of exposed gnarled mangrove roots ranging in size from standingroomonly to a double garage all were covered in thick weeds and most supported miniature forests of scrub trees and bushes at the southern end of the swamp was a narrow beach and beyond that a copse of coconut palms it was eerily quiet the air dead stillnow this isnt something you see every day remi murmured any sign of the mad hatter or alice no knock wood lets get moving daylights burning the made their way through the floating islands dropped anchor just off the beach and waded ashore how many are we going to need remi asked with one hand she deftly curled her auburn hair off her neck and snapped a rubber band around it making a neat topknot sam smiled its like magic how you do that we are a wondrous species remi agreed with a smile and wrung the water from her shirttails so how many six no five and youre sure we couldnt get what we need in stone town and sneak back here you want to risk it something tells me that gunboat captain would be only too happy to arrest us if he thinks we were lying to him true okay gilligan lets make your raft they had no trouble finding plenty of downed trees but a harder time finding ones of a manageable size sam identified five candidates all roughly eight feet long and about as big around as a telephone pole he and remi dragged each log down to the beach where they arranged them in a row sam went to work the construction was simple enough sam explained he grabbed a nearby piece of driftwood and inscribed the plan in the sand not exactly the queen mary remi observed with a smilefor that sam replied id need at least four more logs why the protruding ends two reasons stability and leverage for what youll see right now i need some linea few dozen sixfoot lengths remi saluted as you command after an hours work sam straightened up and stared at his creation his narrowed eyes told remi her husband was running equations in his head after a minute of this sam nodded okay should be buoyant enough he proclaimed with about twenty percent in reserve with the raft in tow they slipped back through the inlet to the islands western side and headed south along the coast until they were again over the bells resting place using the gaff hook sam maneuvered the raft around to the landward side of the andreyale and secured it to the cleats my gut tells me were due for another driveby sam said sitting down in a deck chair remi joined him and together they drank water and watched the water until thirty minutes later the yulin appeared to the north a half mile out good call remi said the yulin slowed to a walking pace and from their afterdeck sam and remi could see a figure in a white uniform standing on its afterdeck sun glinted off binocular lensessmile and wave sam said together they did just that until the figure lowered its binoculars and disappeared into the cabin the yulin came about and began heading north sam and remi waited until it disappeared around the curve of the island then went back to work with the already prepped anchor in one hand sam donned his fins and mask and rolled over the side after a bit of wrangling he centered the raft over the bell he knotted the end of the anchor line to the far side of the raft dove at an angle until the line was taut then jammed the anchors flukes into the sand back on the surface he caught the line remi tossed to him then looped it over the rafts center beam dove down and clamped the d ring onto the bells crown a minute later he was back on the afterdeck where he secured remis line to both cleatshands on his hips he appraised the setup remi smiled sideways at him youre very pleased with yourself arent you i am you should be my intrepid engineer sam clapped his hands together once lets do this with remi at the wheel sam called slow ahead slow ahead remi repeated the water beneath the stern turned to froth and the andreyale eased forward a foot then two the cleated line began rising from the water with a muffled squelchpop the rope cinched down on the rafts crossbeamlooking good sam called keep going the raft began moving closing the distance to the stern come on sam muttered come on on the far side of the raft the anchor line quivered with tension as it negated the andreyales drag on the raft sam donned his mask bent over the side and stuck his face in the water twelve feet below the bell was hovering a few inches off the bottomremi called howre we doing a thing of beauty keep going one careful foot at a time they lifted the bell until finally the crown broke the surface and thunked into the crossbeam slow to idle sam ordered just enough to hold position idling remi replied sam grabbed the sixfoot length of line from the deck and dove over the side three strokes brought him to the raft five loops through the bells crown and a bowline knot over the crossbeam and the bell was secure sam lifted his hands triumphantly like a cowboy whod just roped a calfdone he called the andreyales engines sputtered and went silent remi walked onto the afterdeck smiled and returned her husbands thumbsup congratulations fargo she called now what sams smile dropped away not sure still working it out how did i know you were going to say that chapter zanzibar in truth there was nothing to work out they didnt dare tow the bell back up the coast to their bungalow the needed a safe place to stash it while they made some decisions and arrangements while they both recognized their encounter with the yulin might be a molehill theyd built into a mountain theyd also come to trust their instincts and on this issue sams and remis gut reactions were in agreement neither the yulins initial visit nor its repeated appearances were happenstance also her captains questions were variations on a theme were the fargos looking for something specific this suggested someoneperhaps the shadowy figure hiding in the yulins cabinwas concerned that something of note was at risk of discovery was it the bell or the adelise coin or something else entirelythe question is sam said do we want to wait and see what they do or shake the tree a little bit im not fond of sitting on my hands i know me neither what did you have in mind behave like were people with something to hide we are people with something to hide remi replied a twohundredpound ships bell suspended from a homemade raft at this sam laughed his wife had a knack for cutting to the heart of a matter if were not blowing all of this out of proportion theywhoever they arehave probably already searched the bungalowand found nothing right so theyll watch and wait for us to come home remi was nodding smiling we dont come home right if they come looking for us weve got confirmation the games afoot did you say the games afoot really sam shrugged thought id try it out see how it plays oh sherlock remi said rolling her eyes with the bell and raft in tow they retraced their course through ankle inlet and to the mangrove lagoon nightfall was only a couple hours away they spent an hour of this time tooling around the lagoons perimeter looking for a suitable hiding spot for the raft which they found along the eastern shoreline where a cluster of cypress trees were growing diagonally from the bank using the gaff they eased the raft beneath the overhanging branches then sam dove in and tied it off to one of the trunks hows it look sam called from behind the screencant see a thing theyd have to get in there to find it they returned to the mouth of the inlet where sam used a dead line to catch four small red snappers then they returned to the lagoon and waded ashore to the beach remi who had the better filleting skills cleaned and prepped the snapper while sam collected wood for the fire before long the fillets were sizzling and as the sun dropped behind the coconut palms they were eatingyou know i think i like roughing it remi said flaking off a piece of fish and putting it in her mouth to a degree that is i understand he did remi was a trouper shed never withered before a challenge and had stood side by side with him in mud and snow under gunfire and pursuit and she rarely failed to find a bright side for all that however she also loved her comforts as did he once we get things settled with our mystery bell well head over to dar es salaam get a suite in the royal drink gin and tonics on our balcony and bet on the cricket matchesremis eyes lit up the moevenpick royal palm was dar es salaams only fivestar hotel she said youre singing my song sam fargo but first he replied looking at the sun and checking his watch we need to get ready for our guests with the arrival of nightfall the lagoon came alive with the trilling of crickets in the trees along the shorelines and in the shrubbery atop the floating islands fireflies winked at them sam had steered the andreyale between two of the bigger floating islands and dropped anchor with the bow facing west the sky was clear a black backdrop sprinkled with pinpricks of light and a halfmoon surrounded by a hazy prismatic ringcould rain tomorrow sam observed does that wives tale apply to the southern hemisphere guess well find out they sat on the afterdeck sipping coffee in the dark and watching the insect light show from their position they could see both the mouth of the lagoon and the beach where theyd erected a makeshift aframe tent from a canvas tarp theyd found in a storage locker behind the canvas came the faint yellow glow of a lantern and a few feet outside the tent was a small bonfire sam had enough coconut palm logs to keep embers glowing all nightremi yawned long day go below and get some sleep sam said ill take the first watch youre a doll wake me in two hours a peck on his cheek and she was gone the first two watches were uneventful nearing the end of the sixth hour shortly before three am sam thought he heard the faint rumble of engines in the distance but the sound faded five minutes later it returned this time louder and closer somewhere to the north sam scanned the mouth of the lagoon through binoculars but could see nothing save ripples on the waters surface where the current surged through the inlet the engines faded again no not faded sam corrected himself died as if theyd been shut down he lifted the binoculars to his eyes again a minute passed two minutes and then at the fourminute mark a shadow appeared in the inlet like a bulbous sharks snout the object seemed to float a few feet above the surface moving at less than a walking pace the zodiac raft glided noiselessly from the inlet and into the mouth of the lagoon thirty seconds later another zodiac appeared followed by a third in single file they drifted for fifty feet before turning in formation to starboard and entering the lagoon proper on flat feet sam ducked down the ladder stepped to the bunk and touched remis foot her head popped up from the pillow sam whispered company she nodded once and within seconds they were back on the afterdeck and sliding over the gunwale into the water on impulse sam reached back over the side and grabbed their only possible weapon the gaff pole from its bracket having already rehearsed their plan it was a short tensecond breaststroke to the nearest floating island with remi in the lead they wriggled their way between the exposed mangrove roots and picked through the maze until they reached a hollow in the center their earlier inspection of the cavity showed it to be three feet in diameter and almost eight feet tall rising to the underside of the earthen mushroom cap around them rattail roots and vines drooped and curled the air was heavy with the tang of mold and loamthrough the tangle of roots they could see the andreyale ten feet to their right so close they were almost hugging sam and remi rotated themselves until they could see the mouth of the lagoon at first there was nothing dark moonlit water and silence then a faint almost imperceptible hum sam put his lips to remis ear zodiac rafts with electric trolling motors moving very slowly zodiacs probably mean a mother ship remi whispered back her point was well made while zodiacs could manage zanzibars coastal waters most trolling motors had limited range and a top speed of four to five knots whoever their visitors were theyd launched from somewhere nearby remis guess of a larger boat seemed the most likely scenariosam said you left the goodies out for santa she nodded theyll have to look around a bit but everythings there two minutes passed before the first zodiac appeared two hundred yards away and to their right the second appeared at the same distance but to the left a few moments later the third slid into view coming down the center of the lagoon none showed a speck of light but in the gray moonlight sam and remi could see a single silhouetted figure sitting in the stern of each raftthree zodiac rafts traveling in a line abreast with neither a spoken word nor a flashlight among them these were not tourists on a nocturnal water safari you see any weapons sam whispered remi shook her head for the next few minutes they watched as the trio of zodiacs weaved their way between and around the floating islands until they were fifty yards from the andreyale the figure in the middle zodiac raised his hand made a strange gesture and the other two zodiacs responded by coming about and converging on the andreyalesam tapped on remis shoulder to get her attention then jerked his thumb downward together they submerged until only their eyes and noses were above the surface the middle zodiacthe leaders boat it seemedreached the andreyale first gliding up to the bowsprit and the leader grabbed onto the rail with one hand now in profile the mans face was visible the gaunt face and hawkish nose were unmistakable here was the mystery man from the yulin as if flying in formation the other two zodiacs slid down the port and starboard sides of the andreyale and came together at the stern within seconds both men were over the rail and standing on the afterdeck the one closest to sam and remis hiding spot reached up to his shoulder grabbed something and lowered his hand moonlight glinted off steel a kniferemis hand found sams underwater and squeezed he squeezed back in her ear he whispered were safe the two men disappeared into the cabin then reemerged a minute later one of them leaned over the gunwale and signaled to hawk nose who gestured back then pushed off brought his zodiac about and headed for the beach once there he too drew a knife moving slowly but steadily he padded up the beach to sam and remis lanternlit tent he peeked inside straightened up then scanned the beach and the coconut palms for half a minute before returning to the zodiac two minutes later he was aboard the andreyale with the other two for the first time one of the group spoke hawk nose muttered something in spanish and the other two ducked back into the cabin the andreyale began rocking cabinet doors opened and slammed shut glass broke through the portholes came the glow of flashlights moving about after five minutes of this the two men reappeared on the afterdeck one of them handed hawk nose a small object which he examined briefly before tossing it back down the cabins ladder it pinged down the steps the second man handed hawk nose a yellow legal pad hawk nose studied it handed it back the other man produced a digital camera and flashed a picture of the page in question the legal pad was tossed back into the cabinin remis ear sam whispered hook line sinker hawk nose and his companions climbed back into the zodiacs and pushed off to sam and remis surprise the group didnt head for the inlet but rather began a search of the lagoon starting with the shorelines flashlights skimmed over the banks and through the trees as one of the zodiacs drew even with the bells hiding place sam and remi held their breaths but the boat never slowed and the flashlight never wavered finally the trio reached the mouth of the lagoon and finished their examination of the shoreline but instead of heading for the inlet they turned again formed a line abreast and started checking the floating islands flashlights scanning each mangrove buttress before moving to the nextthis could be bad sam muttered very bad remi agreed the drawn knives had told sam and remi everything they needed to know whoever these men were they had no compunction about using violence had sam and remi been either aboard the andreyale or in the tent they would be dead nowhead back to the andreyale remi suggested if they decide to board her again well be trapped im open to suggestions sam thought for a moment then said how about two birds with one stone he explained his plan risky said remi ill make it work okay but only if theres no other way agreed they watched the progress of the zodiacs if they continued on their current paths the one to their right would reach their hiding spot in less than two minutes the other two were ahead by half a minute with luck theyd finish their searches first and turn back toward the mouthcross fingers sam said to remi already there she replied and kissed him on the cheek for a little more luck sam ducked underwater and pulled himself back through the root system and into open water doing his best to keep all three zodiacs in view he maneuvered himself around to the back side of the roots thirty seconds later to his left hawk nose and his partner slid into view each man scanned his final floating island then turned and headed back toward the inlet the last zodiac was still on course forty feet awayapurate hawk nose called hurry up sams target raised a hand to acknowledge the order thirty feet away twenty feet sam kept moving pulling himself clockwise around the mangrove roots he stopped peeking around the edge the zodiac was ten feet away sam watched waited until the nose of the zodiac disappeared around the opposite side then glanced back up the lagoon the other two zodiacs were a hundred yards away and still moving sam took a deep breath ducked under with the gaff pole kicked twice pulled himself around the roots and let his eyes pop above the surface the rear of the zodiac was five feet away moving slowly the driver sitting with one hand on the motors throttle as he leaned sideways and scanned the mangrove with his flashlight sam did a half kick with his feet and closed to within a foot of the zodiac he reached out gently placed his left hand on the rubber side then raised the gaff from the water cocked it back and flicked it forward as though casting a fishing lure the gaffs steel tip caught the man on the side of his head just above the ear he let out a gasp then slumped over the side his head drooping in the water before sam could make another move remi was there lifting the mans head and rolling the body back into the zodiac sam looked over his shoulder hawk nose and his partner were two hundred yards away nowyaotl hawk noses voice echoed over the water hurry sam said to remi then climbed aboard the zodiac and took a seat at the motor stay on the port side ill drag you back to the andreyale remi swam around and grabbed the oar hook with two fingers sam revved the motor and the zodiac glided out from behind the mangrove sam found the mansyaotlsflashlight where it had fallen picked it up and aimed it at the other two zodiacs which come to a halt sam flashed the beam twice and raised a casual hand praying it would be enough he held his breath nothing from the zodiacs ten seconds passed and then the double wink of a flashlight followed by a raised hand yaotl apurate sam guided the zodiac to the andreyales stern using the length of the boat to hide their movements remi climbed aboard and together they rolled yaotl over the gunwale he landed with a thump on the afterdecknow what remi asked tie him up hands and feet to the cleats and search him ive got to catch up with my new friends remi opened her mouth to protest but sam interrupted i need my mask and the binoculars she went into the cabin with both items and traded them for sams gaff dont worry remi ill keep my distanceand when you cant any longer ill have a terrible mishap he gave her a wink revved the engine and motored away hawk nose and the other man had continued on by the time sam reached the midpoint of the lagoon they were turning west into the inlet sam mentally recalled the twists and turns of the inlet did a few quick calculations and kept going fifty feet from the entrance he slowed to idle and listened no sound of the other motors he revved up kept going and made the turn a hundred yards ahead the other two were moving single file through the inlet beyond them about a half mile away sam could see the inlet widening into chumbe islands shoals he lifted the binoculars to his face and scanned the channel nothing was moving and no lights were visible within ten milessave one a mile to the southwest a single white light hovered thirty feet off the waterthe international signal for a boat at anchor the boat itself was bow on rake stemmed with a gleaming white superstructure clearly a luxury yacht the mother ship perhaps hawk nose and his partner veered left and disappeared from view momentarily time to prepare for the mishap sam throttled down veered left and let the zodiac ground itself on the sand a quick glance around gave him what he needed a daggershaped rock he grabbed it shoved the zodiac back into the inlet jumped aboard and took off again so far sams luck was holding aside from a few backward glances to make sure yaotl was following neither hawk nose nor his partner slowed to let him catch up the remainder of the transit took ten minutes and soon enough sam could see the other two zodiacs jostling as they moved into the shoalscome on guys show me where youre going sam muttered now clear of the shoals hawk nose and his partner veered left and headed toward the yacht two minutes later sam was himself in the shoals but he put on a few more degrees left rudder steering the zodiac nearly parallel to the bank in which theyd found the bell onshore landmarks began looking familiar he was within twenty yards of the precipice it was time he grabbed the rock from between his feet leaned over the side stabbed the tip into the rubber sidewall and heaved backward he repeated the process twice more until hed created a ragged eightinch gash he tossed the rock over the side and checked the progress of the other two zodiacs they were a few hundred yards out into the main channel and still heading for the yacht it took only twenty seconds for sams sabotage to take effect the zodiac began slowing shuddering and wallowing as water gushed into the sidewall he gave the throttle one last twist then let out what he hoped would sound like a panicked scream then rolled over the side he ducked underwater settled the mask over his face blew it clear then clamped the snorkels mouthpiece between his teeth he went still now floating with just his eyes and the tip of the snorkel above the surface his scream had done the trick hawk nose and his partner had reversed course and were heading at top speed toward the rapidly deflating zodiac which was now drifting twenty yards to sams leftand directly over the precipice when the rescuers were fifty yards away flashlights blinked on and began scanning the surfaceyaotl hawk nose called yaotl the other man joined in sam had been hyperventilating his lungs for the past minute now he took one final deep breath ducked beneath the surface and finned toward the bank he was there in ten kicks he turned so hawk nose and the other were on his right then begin finning north along the bank occasionally glancing back to check the location of the flashlight beams both zodiacs had converged on the remains of the thirdyaotl sam heard through the water then again this time more strident yaotl sam kept swimming behind him the deflated raft was being dragged from the water and into one of the zodiacs sam stopped held still he felt the ache of oxygen depletion in his lungs and a tingle of panic in his neck he quashed it and remained stillafter what seemed like minutes but was no more than thirty seconds the zodiacs revved up came about and headed back into the channel sam finned for the surface chapter zanzibar twentyfive minutes later when sam climbed back aboard the andreyale he found remi sitting in a deck chair casually sipping a bottle of kenyan tusker beer their guest yaotl lay like a defeated game fish on the deck back bent wrists bound to his feet these in turn knotted to the nearest cleat he was still unconsciouswelcome back she said handing him a beer howd the mishap go they seemed to have bought it hows he bad lump on the side of the head but hes breathing fine aside from an ugly headache thatll last a day or two hell survive he was well armed she nodded to two objects lying at her feet one was the knife they knew about the other a semiautomatic pistol sam hefted itheckler and koch p nine millimeter fifteenround magazine how in the world do you know sam shrugged no idea i store trivia cant help it unless im mistaken this isnt a civilian gun theyre only sold to law enforcement and military so our guest here is or was either a cop or a soldier or someone with backchannel influence did you find anything else on him not so much as pocket lint no wallet no identification and his clothes and shoes are local i checked the tags professionals then seems so remi said as for the cookies we left for santa we saw what they thought of the adelise coin tossed it away like a penny but the ginnedup notepad was another story before setting the stage for their guests sam and remi had decided there were five possibilities the mystery man hawk nose was interested in one the adelise coin two the bell three the fargos themselves four something he was worried they might find or five nothingthe molehillmountain scenario their ruse had ruled out numbers one and five and seemed to rule in numbers two three and four sam and remi had filled the notepad mostly with nonsensical scribbles and numbers save one area a sideview diagram of a ships bell and below it a time pm a place chukwani point road and a phone number provided by selma that when called would be answered by mnazi freight amp haul if hawk nose took this bait they could be reasonably certain his interest lay with the bell this of course raised the questions of how hawk nose had learned about the bell sam and remi had told no one except selma since hawk nose hadnt paid his visit before theyd raised the bell using sams raft could it be attributed to someone having spotted the bell as they moved it to the lagoon but then again theyd seen no one in the area either onshore or offshoreitll be dawn soon sam said lets gather our booty and find a place to lie low until we can find us some different accommodations and him remi asked nodding to yaotl wed better move him inside dont want him getting broken do we once yaotl was secure in the cabin they raised anchor and crossed the lagoon to where theyd hidden the bell raft after towing it closer to the beach sam jumped over the side and maneuvered it until the bell was floating a foot off the bottomleverage sam muttered to himself remi i need the hatchet from the toolbox she collected it and handed it down sam then waded ashore and disappeared into the trees with a flashlight remi listened as he moved about in the darkness twigs breaking the thunk of wood striking wood a few hushed curses then a few minutes of chopping five minutes later he returned carrying a pair of palm saplings each eight feet long and four inches across into each end he had chopped a notch he handed the poles to remi then climbed aboardcare to share your plan she asked sam gave her a wink dont want to spoil the fun were going to need daylight though the wait was short ten minutes after they watched the first yelloworange tinges of sunrise over to the east they went into action sam untied the raft jumped into the water and rotated the raft so the side with the three protruding logs were facing the beach he straddled the outer log causing it to sink six inches and called all back slow all back slow remi replied the engines rumbled to life the andreyale backed up until the transom bumped into the raft keep coming sam called between his weight and the andreyales horsepower the protruding logs dipped beneath the surface and began burrowing into the sand the water beneath the andreyales stern turned to froth when the logs were embedded a foot into the sand sam called all stop remi throttled down and walked to the stern sam ducked under the raft and emerged in its center beneath the transom im going to push up on this crossbeam and youre going to pull he saidgot it working together they manhandled the log onto the gunwale with the protruding ends jutting over the afterdeck remi stood back and wiped her hands i think i see where youre going with this she recited give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it and i shall move the world sam finished archimedes using the hatchet sam chopped a notch into each end of log resting on the gunwale next he picked up one of the saplings handed it to remi then grabbed his own now the trick part sam said each of them placed the notched tip of a sapling into the corresponding notch on the log then braced the other end against the port and starboard cleats respectively care to do the honors sam asked where are you going to be in the cabin with you if those saplings let go we dont want to be anywhere near them slow back if you will remi engaged the throttle and eased the andreyale backward slowly the front edge of the raft began rising the saplings trembled and bent like a pair of bows being drawn the logs groaned inch by inch the bell rose from the water until its mouth was even with the gunwale hold here sam said steerageway only he grabbed the remainder of the anchor line and padded onto the afterdeck his eyes darting from one trembling sapling to the other at the transom he leaned out knotted the line around the bells crown then backed into the cabin uncoiling line as he wentall back slow he murmured remi leaned back and whispered in his ear if we drop that thing through the deck im pretty sure were going to lose our deposit sam chuckled weve got triple a the andreyale eased backward the saplings kept bending creaking gingerly sam took up the slack in the line the bell slid over the gunwale bounced on the lip and started swingingsam remi warned i know sam muttered hold it here easy he spun around darted down the ladder and emerged ten seconds later carrying a mattress in a doublehanded bowlers motion he slid the mattress down the deck to the transomgun it he called remi jammed the throttle to its stops sam heaved back on the line like overlapping gunshots the saplings snapped and twirled away with a dull thunk the bell crashed into the mattress rolled onto its side and went still chapter zanzibar we lost a man itzli rivera said into the phone oh president quauhtli garza replied even from ten thousand miles away his disinterest was palpable yaotl he drowned his body was lost in the channel he was a good soldier mr president who gave his life for a greater cause its fitting in nahuatl yaotl means warrior you know he will be greeted by huitzilopochtli and reside for eternity in omeyocan garza replied referring to the aztec god of war that kept the sun moving in the sky and the most sacred of the aztecs thirteen heavenly realms is that not reward enoughof course mr president itzli please tell me thats all you have to report no there is more the fargos may have found something a ships bell what do you mean may have found we searched their boat on a pad of paper we found a diagram of a ships bell describe it is it the right one the drawing was generic they may not even know what they have either way it appears theyre going to try to get it off the island next to the diagram was a notation about a freight company and a time the pickup location is just south of zanzibars airportthat cant happen itzli that bell cant leave the island the fargos investigation needs to end here and now i understand mr president you know where theyll be and when theyll be there well have all our bad eggs in one basket thats one pampered ships bell remi said standing across from her on the shaded cobblestone patio sam nodded for the last hour they had been swaddling the bell in sheets soaked in a warm solution of water and nitric acid now it sat draped and steaming in the center of a slowly expanding slick of graygreen marine growth dissolved by the acidhow long until we swap sam checked his watch ten more minutes three hours earlier after dismantling the raft and scattering the parts theyd left the mangrove lagoon and headed south along the coast past fumba point into menai bay with remi at the wheel sam called selma and brought her up to speed and then explained what they needed forty minutes later as they were rounding zanzibars southern tip selma called backits a little smaller than your bungalow but its secluded and the agent promised to leave the keys under the mat youre paid up for the week what and where a villa on the eastern side of the island two miles north of the tamarind beach hotel the awning over the porch is redandgreen striped theres an old stone quay on the beach youre a wonder selma sam said then hung up and dialed again this time abasi sibales home phone number without a question abasi agreed to meet them on the villas beach with his pickup truck upon seeing the ships bell sitting on the andreyales afterdeck he merely smiled and shook his head someday he said you will come to our island and have a perfectly boring timeill go check on our guest sam now said ill make sure our bell doesnt get away remi replied if it tries let it gladly they were both tired and this bell having both resisted their efforts and attracted some dangerous attention had become the enemy their outlook would improve with sleep and some answers which would hopefully come after a couple more hours of nitricacid swaddlingremi smiled leave the gun sam smiled back and walked across the patio and through the french doors the villa selma had rented for them was just under two thousand square feet and tuscan style with faded mustard plaster walls climbing vines and a red tile roof the interior was decorated in a mishmash of contemporary and craftsman sam walked to the back bedroom where their visitor yaotl was bound hand and foot to a fourposter bed yaotl saw sam and lifted his head hey whats going on where am i depends on who you ask sam replied as far as your friends are concerned youre either floating facedown somewhere between here and mombasa or making your way through a sharks digestive systemwhat does that mean well after we knocked you out i dont remember that how did you do that he sounded slightly amazed i snuck up on you then hit you with a big stick now your friends think youve been dead about sam checked his watch six hours they wont believe it theyll find me dont bet on it what kind of name is yaotl its my name are you hungry thirsty no sam chuckled theres no crime in admitting it just do what youre going to do get it over with what exactly do you think were going to do to you asked sam torture me if thats your first guess you must keep some nasty company then why did you take me id hoped youd be willing to answer some questions for us youre american yaotl said how could you tell my winning smile your accent and im guessing youre mexican no response and based on the gun you were carrying and how you and your partners moved youre either current or former military now yaotls eyes narrowed youre cia me no i have a friend who is though this was true during his time at darpa sam had undergone covert operative training at the cias camp perry facility the hope being that by seeing how field operatives work darpas engineers could better supply their needs going through the program at the same time was a cia case officer named rube haywood he and sam had become friends and remained close ever since and that friend has friends sam added in places like turkey and bulgaria and romania i think they call it rendition youve heard of rendition im sure grimfaced guys in black jumpsuits shove you aboard a plane you disappear somewhere for a few weeks then come back with an aversion to electricity and power drillsthe rendition part was of course a bluff but sams presentation had the desired effect yaotls eyes were gaping his lower lip trembling abruptly sam stood up so how about some food is bread okay yaotl nodded sam fed him a half loaf of chapati bread and a liter of mineral water from a sports bottle then asked about that friend of mine should i call him or will you answer a few questionsill answer sam took him through the basics his full name the names of his partners including hawk nose who they worked for had they come to zanzibar looking for him and remi what were they supposed to accomplish the name of their mother ship most of the questions yaotl could answer only partially he was simply a civilian contractor he claimed a former member of mexicos special forces airmobile group or gafe hed been recruited four days earlier by a man named itzli rivera aka hawk nose also a former member of gafe to come to zanzibar and find some people hed been given no further background nor had rivera explained why sam and remi had been targeted nor was he sure whether rivera was working for himself or someone elsebut you saw him on the phone several times correct sam asked did it sound like he was reporting in its possible i only overheard parts sam questioned him for another ten minutes at the end of which yaotl asked what will you do with me ill let you know but you said you wouldnthey wait sam left the room and rejoined remi on the patio he recounted his conversation with yaotl she said sam electricity and power drills thats mean no doing it would be mean i just planted the seed and let his imagination chew on it for a while yaotl said four days ago right he got the call from rivera four days ago yes that was our first day on the island sam nodded before we found the bell then its us theyre interested in and the bell perhaps our ruse with the legal pad clearly got their attention but how did they know we were here remi asked then answered her own question the bbc interview right after we landed could be lets put it together rivera and whomever hes working for find out were here they got worried we might find something and they came to investigate its a big island though remi replied theyd have to be awfully paranoid to think wed stumble onto whatever theyre worried about even if its something as big as our bell its a proverbial needle in a haystack the interviewer asked us where we were planning on diving we told her chumbe island maybe that was the magic phraseremi considered this and like it or not weve got something of a reputation weve had some great luck finding treasure that didnt want to be found sam smiled you call it luck i call it you know what i mean so its the combination of us zanzibar and chumbe island that got their attention they went silent for a minute each examining their whatif scenario from various angles finally remi broke the silence sam our friend inside his name is yaotl his bosss name is itzli and the third is named nochtli and theyre from mexico so he said those arent spanish names so i guessed ill have selma do some double checking for me but im almost certain those are nahuatl in origin nahuatl aztec sam nahuatl was the language of the aztecs they stood in silence for the next ten minutes watching the steam rise from the sheet draped around the bell sam checked his watch and said time using his fingertips sam uncoiled the sheet from around the bell then dragged it away and piled it at the edge of the patio he turned back to see remi kneeling before the bellsam you need to see this he walked around to her side and leaned over her shoulder though still heavily mottled the nitric acid had removed enough patina that they could make out the lettering engraved in the bronzeophelia ophelia remi repeated in a whisper whats ophelia sam took a deep breath let it out i have no idea chapter zanzibar cant you two just have a normal uneventful vacation rube haywood asked over the speakerphone we have plenty of those remi replied but we only call you on the abnormal ones i dont know if i should feel complimented or offended rube muttered the former sam said youre our goto guy what about selma our goto gal remi shot back okay so let me see if ive got this straight you found a diamondshaped coin that once belonged to the governess of a french commune on some island near madagascar but was stolen by a pirate then you found a ships bell belonging to some mystery ship then a gunboatful of mexican mercenaries with aztec names showed up and tried to kill you and now youve got one of the bad guys tied up in your spare bedroom is that the gist of itthat about covers it remi said with three minor corrections sam added the adelise coin has nothing to do with it we dont think and selmas doublechecking the aztec angle as for the name ophelia we dont think it was the original first of all the engraving is very rough not professionally done second once we were able to clear away more of the muck we picked up a couple engraved letters beneath ophelia an s and two h si feel like im on one of those practicaljoke shows rube said okay ill play along what can i do to help you first take our guest off our hands how if youre thinking about all that rendition business sam i i was thinking you pull some strings in the tanzanian ministry of home affairs and have the police detain him on what charges hes got no passport no money and he was carrying a weapon rube went silent for a moment knowing you two as i do im guessing you not only want him out of the way but want to see who shows an interest in him it had crossed our minds sam replied you still have the gun yes okay let me make some calls what else he claims his bosss name is itzli rivera former mexican army itd be nice to know more about him and the yacht they were using he claims its homeported out of bagamoyo the njiwaspell it remi did so its swahili for pigeon oh good thanks remi ive always wondered what the word for pigeon was in swahili rube said somebodys cranky what are you going to do with the ships bell leave it here sam replied selma booked the villa anonymously and wired cash not much chance of them finding iti already know the answer to this but i feel obligated to ask any chance of you two just taking the bell and going home we might do just that sam replied were going to do a little more research and see where it takes us if nothing pans out well head home miracle of miracles rube said you two be careful ill call you when i have info he hung up remi said to sam were going to have to get him something extraspecial for christmas right about now i can guess what hes wishing for whats that a new unlisted phone number they took the andreyale south to uroa village found a ramshackle hardware store gathered what few supplies they needed and were back at the villa before noon remi left sam with his hammer and nails and wooden planks and went inside to check on yaotl who was sound asleep she found a couple cans of clam chowder heated them up and took the bowls out to the patio sam was nailing the last two planks into placewhat do you think he asked as a box sam its wonderful its supposed to be a crate crate box whatever sit down and eat half a mile from the end of chukwani point road itzli rivera pulled the rented range rover onto the shoulder then down into the ditch and up the other side into the trees the terrain was rugged and heavily choked with scrub brush but the rovers fourwheel drive handled it easily he turned southwest toward the clearing on chukwani point time he asked nochtlijust after one an hour before the fargos were set to meet the truck from mnazi freight amp haul plenty of time to find a vantage point that provided not only a good line of sight but also an easily accessible route to cut off any escape attempti see the clearing nochtli said binoculars lifted to his eyes theres something there what see for yourself he handed the binoculars to itzli who focused them on the clearing sitting in the middle of the dirt road was a wooden crate tacked to the side of the crate was a cardboard sign theres something written on it he said then zoomed in after a moment he muttered que madres what asked nochtli what does it say merry christmas itzli drove through the trees down into the ditch and back up the side into the clearing he stopped the rover and walked over to the crate he nudged it with his toe it was empty he ripped off the cardboard sign and flipped it over written in block letters was a messagelets meet and talk about bells nyerere road cricket grounds bench southwest corner pm chapter zanzibar sam saw itzli rivera appear at the northern side of the cricket grounds walking through the trees bordering the parking lot behind him another man was walking east through the lot but sam could not make out his face the purposefulness of his stride made him stand out this would be nochtli sam thought in the middle of the field a pickup cricket match of teenagers was under way their laughter and shouts echoed across the park rivera strolled down the sidewalk on the west side of the grounds and stopped before the bench on which sam satyou came alone rivera said seeing rivera up close and in daylight immediately altered sams measure of the man while sam had never doubted riveras prowess his chiseled face and sinewy build suggested a rawhidelike toughness his black eyes regarded sam impassivelyan expression sam suspected rarely changed whether rivera was eating a sandwich or murdering another human beinghave a seat sam said amiably despite the flutter of fear in his belly he felt like he was handfeeding a great white shark rivera did so this is your meeting he said sam didnt reply he watched the cricket match a minute passed rivera broke the silence your prank with the crateamusing something tells me you didnt laugh though no where is your wife mr fargo running an errand you can signal your friend to stop circling the grounds he wont find her rivera considered this for a few moments then lifted his hand off the back of the bench and made a fist across the park nochtli stopped walking lets talk about our problem sam said and what do you imagine that problem is you think we have something you want tell me exactly what do you think you have abruptly sam stood up i enjoy the occasional verbal joust as much as the next man but not todayall right all right sit down please sam did so rivera said the people i work for have been looking for a shipwreck we believe it was lost in this area which ship the ophelia tell me about it a steamsail passenger ship it was believed to be sunk in these waters in the s thats all you know about her more or less how long have you been looking for her seven years actively yes actively in and around zanzibar of course im assuming you have salvage experience or else they wouldnt have hired you i have experience the people you work for whats their specific interest id rather not say something of monetary value i assume sam asked something the ophelia carried in her hold when she went down that would be a safe assumption and you think whatever we may have found belongs to the ophelia its a possibility my employers would like to explore sam nodded thoughtfully for the past few minutes sam had been trying to get rivera to commit himself to make statements he and remi could then use in doing their own research sam said this must be one hell of a prize youre after you bribe the captain of a tanzanian gunboat to first intimidate then surveil us then when night falls you sneak into the lagoon and board our boat with knives drawnthis caught rivera off guard he took a deep breath and let it out with a frustrated sigh sam said we watched the whole thing from where does that really matter no i suppose not please accept my apologies my friends are exsoldiers some habits are hard to break the excitement of the job got the better of them ive already chastised themall three of them yes of course sam didnt buy riveras mea culpa but he said fair enough what was your plan to steal whatever you think we found at that point we didnt know what youd found sam paused for a long ten seconds then said i cant decide if you think were idiots or if youve got a shorttermmemory problem pardon me youre sitting here because of the sign i left on the crate you found that crate because of the notations we left next to a diagram of a bell you found on our boat you think we found a ships bell why not just come out and say itconsider it said then i can tell you this the bell we found doesnt belong to the ophelia youll forgive me if i dont take your word for it will i sam asked id like to inspect the bell myself the same bell you and your men would have killed us for had we been aboard our boat im going to have to decline ive been authorized to offer you a finders fee should the bell turn out to be the one were looking for no thanks weve got all the money we can use take me to the bell let me inspect it and my employer will donate fifty thousand dollars to a charity of your choosing no riveras eyes turned cold and he let out muffled growl mr fargo youre making me angry they have pills for that i prefer a different approach rivera lifted his shirttail to expose the butt of a pistol a heckler amp koch pjust like the one they took off yaotl sam saw were leaving now rivera muttered dont make a scene or ill shoot you dead well be gone before the police are even notified the police sam repeated as in the police in that station house across the road behind us rivera glanced over sams shoulder his mouth tightened the muscles of his jaw pulsatedsam said you should have done your homework i realize its an old schoolhouse but how hard would it have been to check im sure this is embarrassing for you cabron sams grasp of spanish slang was slim but he suspected rivera had just called his parentage into question he said if you look a little closer youll see a man and woman sitting on a bench near the stations stepsi see them sam pulled out his phone hit speed dial let it ring twice then hung up a moment later remi fargo turned on the bench faced the cricket grounds and gave a single wavethe man shes talking to is a tanzanian police superintendent from dar es salaam police can be bought just as naval officers can be bought not this one he happens to be a close personal friend of the fbis legal attache in the us embassy youre bluffing right now my wife may or may not be telling the superintendent about a man named yaotl who tried to break into our vacation home last night he was armed with a gun identical to the one youre carrying and had no passportriveras brows knitted together the accident the raft that wasnt yaotl sam shook his head how did you do it i took a few theater classes in college it doesnt matter he wont talk even if he does he knows nothing just your name and appearance both of those can be changed give me the bell and return my man to me and youll never be troubled againlet me think about it ill call you by days end tomorrow if you bother us before then ill call our superintendent friend care to tell me where youre staying rivera smiled grimly and shook his head no i would not he recited his phone number i expect to hear good news sam stood up you can expect anything you like he turned and walked away sam walked across the street to the police station remi wrapped up her conversation with the superintendent with a warm handshake and a thankyou the man gave sam a nod and a smile then strode awaylovely man huru remi said told us to give his regards to rube what did you tell him sam asked sitting down beside her that we thought someone had tried to break into our house last night he said to call him personally if we have any more trouble how did your chat with the human skeleton go as can be expected he claims hes been working for some deep pockets whove been looking for the ophelia for years problem is he claims to know almost nothing about her pedigreehe tried to wing it remi said he thought he could bluff you anyone who spends even a modicum of time chasing shipwrecks finds themselves well versed in every facet of a vessels history that rivera feigned ignorance about the ophelia told sam and remi that the ship was vitally important to rivera and his employerdid he mention the hidden engraving no that could be telling its another thing an experienced hunter would know he didnt mention it because hes hoping we missed it any hint as to what specifically theyre after he implied it was something in the ophelias hold treasure of some kind even offered us a finders feehow very kind of him where does this leave us rivera claimed he had salvage experience which may or may not be true but he also claimed his patrons have been actively looking for the ophelia in the world of treasure hunting an active search is a specific beast that involves mounting expeditionsgetting wet and dirty while laying out grids doing magnetometer passes picking through muck and slime not to mention the dry but no less daunting research work interviewing relatives scouting locations and sitting in dusty old libraries looking for the slightest clue as to the targets possible locationif riveras been at it that long remi said therell be public records news stories permits my thought exactly we find those we get a better idea of what rivera and his people are really after they sat under the shade trees outside the police station for ten minutes as sam watched rivera and his partner leave the cricket grounds parking lot then overtly make a circuit around the police station sam and remi gave them a parting wave on the last pass once sure they werent returning sam and remi walked east to an openair market where they gathered food and necessities and walked the labyrinthine alleys while watching for signs of pursuit finding none they walked three blocks north to a rentalcar agency their reservation a toyota land cruiser was waiting for them forty minutes later they were back at their uroa beach villasams phone trilled as they were walking up the driveway remi gestured for the bag of groceries he was carrying and continued into the villa sam checked the caller id rube morning rube early early morning how did your meeting go fine huru told us to say hello a good man huru did you turn your guest over to him not yet sam replied then recounted his conversation with rivera we already called selma shes working on shipwreck databases for the area tomorrow were going over to the university for a little homework well i know i already said this once but be damned careful i did some digging into itzli rivera the military stuff you already know but he was also in their defense departments intelligence section he retired about eight years ago and went private heres the kicker according to the chief of station in mexico city riveras been arrested six times by the policia federal but never indictedwhat charges burglary bribery blackmail murder kidnapping and all related to nationallevel politics so hes a hatchet man a militarily trained hatchet man its a distinction to keep in mind nobody can pin down who he works for howd he beat all the charges the usual witness recantation either by change of mind or change in corporeal status as in sudden and unexpected death sam chuckled yes rube i get it the rest is pretty standard stuff mislaid evidence technicalities etcetera safe to say riveras got a heavyweight in his corner a heavyweight with a fetish for shipwreck artifacts whatre you going to do with the bell we havent decided yet the truth is i dont think they really care about the bell itself whether theyre after the ophelia or the ship belonging to the mystery engraving it doesnt change where we found the thing thats whats got them worried well that and the fact that we arent willing to leave it alonemaybe its not about something theyre looking for rube said but rather something they dont want anyone else to find interesting sam said rube continued that charitable donation business he wanted you and remi and the bell together in one place why not just accept an emailed picture of the bell and if all they wanted was to find the ophelia why not hire you everyone knows how the fargos work a large percentage of the find goes to charity and nothing to you personally sam i think this is about hiding something not finding something chapter university of dar es salaam the universitys central campus sat northwest of the city center on a hill having called ahead sam and remi found the librarys director amidah kilembe a beautiful black woman in a ferngreen pantsuit waiting to greet them on the stepsgood morning mr and mrs fargo welcome to our facility pleasantries were exchanged as ms kilembe took them up the steps and through the main doors at which point she gave them a walking tour of the building which eventually took them to the thirdfloor reference area the decor was a mixture of old world colonial and traditional african dark furniture and paneling that glowed from decades of polishing surrounded by splashes of colorful tanzanian art and artifacts save a few of the library staff the building was empty its a school holiday ms kilembe explainedwere sorry sam said we thought oh no no for the staff it is a regular workday in fact as chance would have it youve chosen the perfect day to visit i myself will be assisting you we dont want to impose remi said im sure you have other ms kilembe smiled broadly not at all i have read of and enjoyed several of your exploits i will of course keep my silence about what we discuss here today she touched an index finger to her lips and winked if youll follow me i have a quiet room set aside for you they followed her to a glassenclosed room in the center of which sat a long walnut table and two padded chairs before each chair sat a twentyinch apple imac computer ms kilembe saw their surprised expressions and chuckled three years ago mr steve jobs himself visited the campus he saw that we had very few computers and all of them old so he made a generous donation we now have forty of these wonderful machines and broadband internet very well i will let you get started first i will bring you coffee i have you both set up with guest logins for the catalogues most of our materials have been digitized back to those that have not been will be in our basement archives area you tell me what you need and i will bring it so good huntingand then ms kilembe was gone pulling the door shut behind her where do we start sam wondered aloud lets check in with selma sam doubleclicked the ichat icon on the screen and typed in selmas address the computers isight camera turned green and in ten seconds selmas face appeared on the screenwhere are you she asked university of dar es salaam behind selma pete and wendy were sitting at the worktable they waved remi said were getting ready to dig in do you have anything for us the last search is finishing now onscreen pete walked across to a computer workstation tapped the keyboard a couple times then called coming over to you selma sam and remi watched as selma studied the document her eyes darting across the screen at last she said not much there we checked all the major shipwreck databases and found only eighteen sites in the waters around zanzibar we even extended the grid fifty miles on all compass points of the eighteen fourteen are identified and only one of those comes even remotely close to the assumed same time frame as the ophelia go on the glasgow commissioned in after the sultan of zanzibar lost his fleet to the storm it was delivered in the summer of but the sultan was unimpressed so it sat abandoned and unused at anchor off zanzibar until the anglozanzibar war of when the british sunk her with naval gunfire in the wreck was reduced to her bottom frames by a salvage company and the majority of the pieces dumped at sea in the seventies the glasgows engine block propeller shaft some crockery and a few ninepound shells were found on the sitewheres the site remi asked about two hundred yards off the stone town beach in fact you were within sight of it at the restaurant the other night so about fifteen crows miles from where we found the ophelia s bell sam said so scratch the glasgow what else four of the wrecks in the database are unidentified one is sitting in the pangani river thirtyfive miles to the north the next two are in tanga bay fifty miles to the north the last one is sitting off bongoyo island in dar es salaams msasani bay as far as i can tell none of them is any deeper than thirty feet thirty feet of clear water sam added well check with area dive shops chances are someones identified them but never bothered to say anything probably nothing more than dive attractions nowsorry i came up empty selma said you didnt remi replied ruling out is just as important as ruling in two other things mrs fargo you were right about those names they are nahuatl traditional aztec names for what its worth its been something of a trend in mexico city for the last few years the mexica tenochca party remi finished she saw sams confused expression then added the current president is an ubernationalist a prespanish invasion nationalist aztec names history courses taught in schools religious observances art in addition to everything else rivera and his pals are political zealots sam replied drily just what we need what else selma i studied the pictures of the bell you sent i assume you noticed the clapper you mean that its missing sam asked we noticed sam disconnected then turned to remi so newspapers she nodded newspapers sam and remi were believers in the pyramid theory of research start with the top of the pyramid the specific and work your way down to the base the general the first search terms they tried were ophelia wreck and discovered not surprisingly all they got were stories selma had covered next they tried famous shipwrecks and zanzibar and got the expected results fluff stories about the glasgow and the el majidi another ship belonging to the sultan of zanzibar that had been lost during the hurricane and the hms pegasus sunk in following a surprise attack by the german cruiser konigsberg ms kilembe returned with a carafe of coffee and two mugs asked if they needed anything then disappeared again remi said we forgot chumbe island sam were assuming the bbc interview brought rivera here right sam combined the previous search terms with chumbe island and got zero hits he tried again with the terms diving artifact and discovery he scrolled through the stories then stopped huh he mutteredwhat probably nothing but its curious two months ago a british woman named sylvie radford was found murdered in stone town an apparent mugging gone wrong shed come to do some diving off chumbe listen to this according to the womans parents ms radford had been having a wonderful diving vacation having already found several artifacts including what she thought might be part of a romanstyle sword a romanstyle sword remi repeated interesting her words or the reporters do you think i dont know either way its a pretty specific description most laypeople would just say swordremi leaned closer to the screen then jotted down the reporters name it might be in her notes sam started tapping the keyboard again this time with some urgency into the search box he entered southern zanzibar diving and death and set the time frame from present day to ten years earlier dozens of stories appeared on the screenlets split them up remi said then typed the terms into her own search box start with the oldest sam nodded in years ten through eight four deaths were linked to their search terms in each case however independent eyewitness reports confirmed they were accidental one shark bite one diving mishap and two vehicle accidents both involving alcoholhere remi said seven years ago two people both tourists on diving vacations where exactly it just says the southwest coast of zanzibar one of them was killed by a hitandrun driver the other one fell down some steps in stone town no alcohol involved no witnessessix years ago sam said reading from the screen two dead one suicide one drowning again no witnesses and so it went with year five up to the present day tourist divers most of them spending time near or around chumbe island dying in strange accidents or muggings gone wrongi count five remi said ive got four replied sam they were silent for a few moments remi said has to be a coincidence right sam simply stared at his screen so remi said otherwise what are we saying rivera and whoever he works for have been murdering divers that show an interest in chumbe island no it cant be that they would number in the hundreds the thousands maybe its the people who declare their finds or take them to local shops for identification if were right about this these people have to have something else in commonthey told someone about what they found remi offered and it was the right kind of artifact something to do with the ophelia or the ship with the blottedout name either way if shed sunk off chumbe artifacts would be washing up on the beach every monsoon there would be debris just sitting on the bottom waiting for someone with a pingpong paddle to come along true said sam but there are plenty of people who find something and never mention it they go home and put it on their mantel as a souvenir in fact that describes most casual treasure divers they find something make a minor effort to identify it but if its not something obviously treasureish they treat it as a keepsake our week in zanzibarthis is a huge leap were talking about sam i just remembered something rivera said hes been looking for the ophelia for seven years about the same time the strange deaths started exactly i need to call rube we need to find out how good tanzanian immigration and customs are at recordkeeping sam made the call and explained their request to an incredulous but willing rube haywood who said so your theory is that rivera was in zanzibar around the time all the deaths would have taken placeits worth a shot even if the records dont show he was here every time he may not have traveled under his own name ill look into it wouldnt hold your breath sam thanked him and disconnected a few minutes later ms kilembe knocked on the door and peeked her head inside do you need anything they thanked her and declined she was turning to leave when sam asked ms kilembe how long have you been with the librarythirty years and how long in this area all my life i was born in fumba on zanzibar were looking for anything on a ship called ophelia does that name mean anything to you ms kilembe furrowed her brow after ten seconds of thought she said i assume youve been to the blaylock already the blaylock the blaylock museum in bagamoyo theres a charcoal sketch there of a ship unless my memory fails me the ships name is ophelia chapter bagamoyo of the two cities within easy reach of zanzibar dar es salaam and bagamoyo the latter was sam and remis favorite with a population of thirty thousand bagamoyo is a microcosm of both traditional african and colonial african history without the bigcity bustle of dar es salaam and its two and a half million inhabitants founded by omani nomads in the late s bagamoyo has at times been home to arab and indian traders of ivory and salt christian missionaries slave traders the german east africa colonial government and big game hunters and explorers bound for morogoro lake tanganyika and usambara heres something we didnt know remi said reading from the guidebook as sam drove david livingstone in all his years in africa never visited bagamoyoat least not alive he was brought to bagamoyo after he died and was laid out in the old church tower now called livingstone tower to wait for high tide so they could ship his body to zanzibar interesting sam said id always assumed hed used bagamoyo as a staging area just like everyone else okay were on the outskirts whered ms kilembe say the museum was remi plucked the postit note from inside the guidebook and read two blocks from the old german boma a fortwhich one there are two i think the guidebook said remi flipped over the note thats all she wrote guess well have to check them both they found the first a few hundred yards north of three of bagamoyos biggest tourist attractions the crocodile farm the kaole ruins and a fivehundredyearold baobab tree they parked on the dirt road before the crumbling whitewashed fort and got out a teenage boy walked by with a donkey on a lead he smiled broadly and said jambo habari gani hello how are youin halting swahili sam replied nzuri unasema kiingereza yes i speak little english were looking for the blaylock museum oh yes crazy man house no im sorry the blaylock museum yes same thing other boma one kilometer up livingstone cross yes yes asante sana sam replied youre welcome byebye with a click of his tongue the boy continued on with his donkey your swahili is improving remi remarked just dont ask me to order food you wont like what we get what did he mean crazy man house guess well find out they found the other boma with little trouble following glimpses of its whitewashed battlements until they reached its crushedshell parking lot here there were more locals going about their business selling food and sundries from storefronts and awningcovered carts sam and remi got out and began walking looking for a sign that read either blaylock or crazy man after twenty minutes of fruitless searching they stopped at a vendors cart bought two icecold bottles of cola and asked for directionsyes crazy man house the man said he pointed west down a narrow dirt alley two hundred meters there find wall then thick trees turn right find path find place asante sana remi said starehe as promised they found a waisthigh mudbrick wall before a grove of acacia and wild lavender they turned right and twenty feet down came to an opening in the wall on the other side a winding path took them through the grove to a white picket fence beyond which stood an old schoolhouse long and narrow with a butter yellow exterior and heavy shutters in dark blue a blackonwhite handpainted sign above the porch steps read blaylock museum and curiosity shop the last three words were clearly written in a different hand as though added later as an afterthought a bell above the door tinkled as they entered handhewn support posts ran down the center of the space supporting rafters from which hung dozens of poorly stuffed african birds in poses that sam and remi assumed were meant to represent midflight sitting on the rafters above their inanimate cousins were several animate pigeons their cooing filled the space the walls were dominated by wicker shelving units no two sharing the same height or width or shade of wood spaced at intervals down the buildings midline were eight rickety card tables covered with threadbare sheets on both the shelves and card tables were hundreds of knickknacks wooden and ivory statuettes of giraffes lions zebras dikdiks snakes and people collections of knives ranging from the standard pocket variety to daggers carved from bone handpainted fetishes covered with feathers and bits of tree bark handdrawn maps on hide charcoal pencil portraits and landscapes compasses water bags made from animal stomachs and several models of webley revolvers and bullets of varying sizeswelcome to the blaylock museum and curiosity shop a voice called in surprisingly good english at the far end of the room was a lone card table they hadnt noticed sitting behind it was an elderly black man wearing a baltimore orioles baseball cap and a white got milk tshirtthank you remi replied sam and remi walked over and introduced themselves i am morton the man replied forgive us but what exactly is this place sam asked it is the blaylock museum and curiosity shop yes i know but to whom is it dedicated the greatest unsung african explorer to ever grace the shores of the dark continent the man replied clearly hed delivered this pitch many times the man to whom hundreds owe their lives and the lives of their grandchildren winston lloyd blaylock the mbogo of bagamoyothe mbogo of bagamoyo sam repeated the buffalo of bagamoyo that is correct the cape buffalo what can you tell us about him remi asked mbogo blaylock came from america to bagamoyo in to seek his fortune he stood four inches over six feet weighed twice as much as the average tanganyikan man at the time and had shoulders as wide as the mbogo for which he is named is that him sam asked pointing to a grainy blackandwhite daguerreotype on the wall above morton it showed a tall broadshouldered man in hemingwayesque safari clothes in the background were a dozen maasai warriors kneeling with assegai spearsthat is him morton confirmed the complete history of the mbogo is available in this fine leatherbound volume morton swept his hand toward a wicker shelf on the righthand wall remi walked over and lifted one of the books from the stack the cover was not leather but rather naugahyde crudely stapled into place glued to the front was a reproduction of the wall photo well take two sam said and brought their purchases back to the card table as he was paying remi asked we were told we might find something about a ship here the ophelia morton nodded and pointed to a threebyfivefoot framed charcoal sketch of a steamsail ship the hunt for the ophelia was mbogo blaylocks first great adventure it is all in the book i wrote the index myself it took me three yearsthats true dedication said remi how did you come to be here did your family know mr blaylock for the first time since they entered morton smiled proudly my family is mbogo blaylock i am second cousin to mbogos greatgrandson pardon me sam asked youre related to winston blaylock of course doesnt it show sam and remi didnt know how to respond after a few moments morton slapped his knee and laughed got you yes yes you did sam replied so youre not no that part is true the resemblance is difficult to see however you may see my birth certificate if you wish before they could answer morton produced it from a lockbox beneath the card table he unfolded it and slid it across to them sam and remi leaned over to study it then straightened upthats amazing remi said so he married took a tanzanian wife back then it was still called tanganyikabefore the germans came you see and no he did not take a wife but he did take six concubines and had many children that too is in the book sam and remi exchanged dumbfounded glances sam asked morton what happened to himno one knows he disappeared from here in his grandson claims he was chasing a treasure what kind of treasure that is a secret he shared with no one some people in town called it the crazy man house morton said its not an insult the word doesnt translate well into english in swahili it doesnt mean crazy so much as freespirited wild all these artifacts belonged to him remi asked yes most he killed made or found with his own hands others are gifts and offerings offer a fair price and i will consider it i dont understand youre selling his belongings i have no choice i am the last of mbogo blaylocks descendants at least that is still here my two children live in england they are going to school im sick and not long for this worldwere very sorry to hear that sam said may we look around of course ask questions if you have them sam and remi walked away she whispered you think its all true the picture does look an awful lot like hemingway why dont you call ms kilembe and ask remi went outside returned five minutes later and walked over to sam who was staring at a walking staff mounted on the wall she says its all legitimate the museums been here since sam didnt respond he remained still his eyes fixed on the staff sam did you hear me sam whats so fascinatingdo you see anything unusual about it he murmured remi studied it for a few moments no not really look at the head the metal part with the rounded end she did she cocked her head squinted her eyes then is that sam nodded a bell clapper they stared at it for another long ten seconds then sam turned to morton and said how much for all of it chapter zanzibar pardon me selma said over the speakerphone say that again you want what shipped back here from the passenger seat of their toyota remi said not the whole museum selma just the contents in all it should weigh about she looked to sam who said five to seven hundred poundsselma said i heard she sighed who do i the owners name is morton blaylock were putting him up in the moevenpick royal palm in dar es salaam while you two make arrangements by this afternoon hell have an account set up at barclays wire thirty thousand dollars to him from our business account then another thirty when everythings packed up and on its way to yousixty thousand dollars selma said you paid him sixty thousand do you know how much that is in tanzanian shillings its a fortune did you haggle with him at least he wanted twenty sam replied we talked him up selma hes a dying man and hes got grandkids to put through college sounds like a con man to me we dont think so remi replied the staffs seven feet tall made of black ironwood and topped with the bronze clapper from the ophelias bell is this pullajokeonselma day sam replied youll see it for yourself mortons including it in the first shipment from the museum were also fedexing you a copy of blaylocks biography we need you to work your magic on it dissect it crossreference every name place and description you know what to doi havent heard you two this excited since you called from that cave in the alps we are excited remi replied it appears winston blaylock spent a good portion of his adult life chasing a treasure and unless were wrong its something rivera and his boss dont want us to find blaylock could be our rosetta stone sam turned the land cruiser onto the road leading to their villa then slammed on the brakes a hundred yards away through the windshield they saw a figure walk across the patio and disappear into the bushesremi said selma well have to call you back then hung up is it them sam its them check out the patio the bells gone ahead and to the right the figure emerged from the bushes bordering the beach and began sprinting toward the waterline where a twentysevenfoot rinker powerboat sat alongside the quay across from their andreyale a half mile out the yacht njiwa sat at anchor standing on the rinkers afterdeck were two figures between them was the ophelias belldamn it sam muttered how did they find us remi said no idea hold on he punched the gas pedal the tires bit into the dirt and the land cruiser lurched forward sam watched the speedometer climb past fifty then swung the wheel left then right aiming the hood squarely at the brushcovered bermoh boy remi said she pressed her hands against the dashboard and her head against the rest the berm loomed before them the land cruiser tipped backward sky filled the windshield then they were tipping forward again soaring through the air the engine roaring as the tires spun freely the cruiser crashed to the earth sand peppered the windshield sam jammed the accelerator to the floorboard and after a momentary groan of protest the engine responded and they were again moving forward albeit at half speed as the tires struggled to find purchase in the dry sandahead the running figure had nearly reached the quay he glanced over his shoulder saw the land cruiser and stumbled it was yaotl guess he didnt like our hospitality sam called cant imagine why replied remi yaotl was back on his feet he charged up the quays steps taking them two at a time then dashed toward the waiting rinker where rivera and nochtli were waving their arms urging him on sam kept going jostling the wheel and trying to feel his way to firmer ground the quay was fifty yards away yaotl reached the rinker and jumped aboard thirty yards to go nochtli moved to the drivers seat and settled behind the wheel smoke burst from the exhaust manifold quite casually rivera stepped past the panting yaotl gave him a clap on the shoulder then stepped to the transom he stared at the approaching land cruiser for a moment then raised his hand as if to wavesam muttered son of a remi said hes got something what in his hand hes holding something sam slammed on the brakes the land cruiser slewed sideways and shuddered to a halt sam shifted the transmission into reverse his foot ready to move from the brake to the accelerator his eyes never leaving theirs rivera smiled grimly then reached up pulled the pin on the grenade turned and tossed it into the andreyale ahead of a rooster tail of water the rinker shot away from the quay and headed for the njiwa with a dull crump the grenade exploded a geyser of water and wood splinters shot upward and rained down on the quay the andreyale settled lower in the water then slowly disappeared beneath the surface in a cloud of bubbles after backing the suv over the sand and dunes to the road they watched rivera and his men tool out to the njiwa within minutes the anchor was weighed and the yacht got under way heading south down the coastid started to grow attached to that bell sam muttered and you dont like losing remi said when sam shook his head she added me neither sam leaned sideways across remis lap and retrieved the h ampk p from the glove box then said ill be right back he climbed out walked down the road to the villa then slipped inside he emerged two minutes later and gave remi the ok sign she scooted into the drivers seat and pulled the toyota into the drivewaydid they toss the house she asked climbing out sam shook his head but i know how they found us he led her through the villa to the guest room where theyd been keeping yaotl sam walked to the headboard and pointed to the loop that had been secured around their guests left wrist it was stained a dark reddish brown the remaining three loops had been untiedthats blood remi said he worked his way free then called rivera sam added ill give him this much hes got a high tolerance for pain his wrist must be raw down to the bone why didnt they ambush us hard to say riveras no dummy he knows weve got yaotls gun and didnt want to risk attracting the police i think were a secondary concern they got what they came for without that all weve got is an interesting story sam what in the world can be so important about that bell erring on the side of caution they agreed the villa was no longer safe they packed what few belongings were left inside got back into the toyota and drove eight miles south to chwaka a small town whose only claim to fame seemed to be that it was home to the mysteriously named zanzibar institute of financial administration they found a beachfront restaurant with airconditioning and went inside they asked to be seated in a quiet area near an aquariumremi pointed out the window is that sam looked two miles offshore they could see the njiwa still steaming south at a leisurely pace sam grumbled a curse under his breath and took a sip of ice waterwell what do you want to do about it remi prodded sam shrugged i cant decide if my ego is just bruised because they stole something we worked so hard to get thats not much of a reason to put ourselves back in their gunsights its more than that we know how badly they dont want people to know about the bell or the ship it was attached to they probably murdered for it theyre going to either destroy it or dump it in the deepest part of the ocean where itll never be found again its a piece of history and theyre going to treat it like garbage sams phone rang he said selma to remi then answered and tapped the speakerphone button as was her way selma jumped in without preamble that bell youve got is an interesting findhad sam replied we dont have it anymore he explained remi said tell us anyway selma do you want the fascinating news or the astounding news first fascinating wendy used her photoshop wizardry skills and ran the pictures through some filters or something most of what she said was greek to me under all that marine growth theres engraved writingwhat kind asked sam we dont know for sure there are bits of symbology some words in swahili a smattering of german pictographs but not enough of any one of them to make sense from the looks of it most of the bells interior is covered with it okay now astound us remi said wendy was also able to pull a few more letters from the name beneath the ophelia engraving in addition to the first twos and h and the last one h she was able to pull two letters from the middle a pair of ns separated by a spaceas selma had been talking remi had grabbed a napkin from the holder and she and sam were working the anagram selma continued we fed the letters and arrangement into an anagram program and crossmatched the results against our shipwreck databases and came up with shenandoah sam and remi said in unison chapter zanzibar the confederate states ship shenandoah had long fascinated sam and remi but theyd never had the time to explore the mysteries behind the saga now it appeared fate had handed them a bronze invitation in the form of a ships bell a ton steam cruiser shenandoah was launched at the alexander stephen amp sons shipyard in river clyde scotland in august of under the name sea king ironframed teakplanked and blackhulled sea king was fully rigged for both sail and auxiliary steam power designed as cargo transport for the east asia tea trade routes tea hauling did not lie in her future however a year after her commissioning in september sea king was covertly purchased by agents of the confederate secret service and on october eighth she sailed with a full complement of merchant sailors ostensibly headed for bombay on her maiden trading voyage nine days later sea king rendezvoused near the island of madeira off the african coast with the steamship laurel which had been lying in wait aboard laurel were the officers and the nucleus of the sea kings new crew all loyal and experienced sailors either southerners or sympathetic british citizens their captain was lieutenant james iredell waddell a fortyoneyearold north carolinian and graduate of the united states naval academy the laurels cargo of naval guns ammunition and general stores were quickly transferred aboard sea king whose dumbfounded and angry crew were given the option of joining this new expedition at higher wages or being transferred to the laurel and subsequently deposited on tenerife an island in the canary archipelago off the coast of morocco in the end however waddell was only able to enlist enough of laurels seamen to bring the newly commissioned commerce raider shenandoah to half her normal sailing complement despite this shenandoah left the madeira islands on october twentyfirst and set about her task of destroying or capturing union ships wherever she found them through the fall of and into the winter of shenandoah sailed through the south atlantic around the cape of good hope and into the indian ocean and across to australia destroying and capturing unionflagged merchant vessels before setting her sights on the unions pacific whaling grounds sailing north from new guinea into the sea of okhotsk and the bering sea in the nine months shenandoah sailed under the confederate flag as a warship she accounted for the destruction of some three dozen enemy ships on august some four months after lees surrender at appomattox shenandoah learned of the wars end by the passing british barque barracouta captain waddell ordered shenandoah disarmed then set a course for liverpool england where he and shenandoah s crew surrendered in november the following march she was sold through intermediaries to sayyid majid bin said albusaid the first sultan of zanzibar who renamed her el majidi after himself for sam and remi it had always been this part of the shenandoahs history that they found so intriguing there were three accounts of el majidi s final disposition one had her being scuttled in the zanzibar channel shortly after being damaged in the hurricane the next her sinking six months later while being towed to bombay for repairs the last her going down in november of after striking a reef near the island of socotra on the way home from bombay this raises more questions than it gives answers sam said for starters was it blaylock or someone else who renamed her ophelia and why was she renamed remi added and why is there no record of her anywhere and the biggest question why did we find the bell at all what do you mean asked remi after waddell surrendered the shenandoah wouldnt she and everything aboard her have been the property of the union including the bell including the bell sam echoed maybe the union sold her to the sultan of zanzibar lock stock and barrel could be but that was in the el majidi didnt sink for another six or thirteen years depending on which account you go with hell the sultan named the ship after himself does he sound like someone who would hang on to a bell with another ships name on itno he doesnt maybe whoever refitted her just tossed the bell overboard for the sake of expediency remi was the devils advocate of the couple she often did her best to poke holes in their thinking if after going through the remi gauntlet the theory remained afloat they then knew they were on to something sam considered this possible but im trying to put myself in the shoes of the sultans shipfitter hes probably not the wealthiest of guysoverworked and underpaid unsurprisingly the sultan demands the ship meet his royal standards including a shiny new bell what would this shipfitter do with a ninetypound solid bronze bellsell it selma chimed in lets put a pin in that remi said it seems safe to assume blaylock himself came across the bell at some point if it was still attached to the vessel he either bought it or stole the ship then changed the name to ophelia if the bell had been discarded by the sultan it means blaylock salvaged the bell blotted out the shenandoah name and engraved it with ophelia and did what with it stared at it the charcoal sketch at the museum suggests he saw that ship as the ophelia sam snapped his fingers were overthinking this remi boot up your laptop selma email us pictures of the shenandoah and the el majidi as they were waiting sam plugged his camera into remis laptop and she called up the photo theyd taken of the ophelia sketch no wifi signal remi said sam stood up and walked around checking beneath nearby tables there are ethernet plugins he said then walked toward the hostess he returned two minutes later with an ethernet cable which he first plugged into remis laptop then into the closest plug its dialup internet but it should do sam saidover the phone selma said images on the way it took four minutes for the jpeg images to load remi arranged the pictures on her screen and they spent a few minutes rotating and zooming and playing with colors until they were certain same ship remi said i agree sam agreed blaylocks ophelia is also the shenandoah and the el majidi the question is at what point in the time line did blaylock appear and why are there no records of any of thisclearly rivera and his friends are interested in our bell but is it the bell itself or the ship or ships it had once been attached to theres only way to find out sam said we have to steal it back before rivera destroys it or loses it they immediately realized that like many things in their line of work this task was much easier said than done sam rummaged around in his pack and came up with a pair of binoculars he stood up and aimed them out the window after thirty seconds he lowered the binoculars shes still headed south about to slip behind pingwe point still in no big hurrythey know theyve got us beat sam grinned never say die he picked up his phone and dialed rube haywood sam i was just about to call you rube said great minds i hope were on the same wavelength i have information on the yacht the njiwa bless you it belongs to a guy named ambonisye okafor one of the ten richest men in the country you name a tanzanian export and hes got a major stake in it cashews tobacco coffee cotton sisal precious gems minerals how did a hatchet man like rivera get hooked up with someone like okafor hard to say exactly but i did a little digging in the last five years the mexican government has sharply increased its importation of tanzanian goods most of it from companies controlled by ambonisye okafor that tells me rivera has powerful friends in mexico city sam you two arent up against a few mercenaries youre up against a government and a tanzanian millionaire with a whole lot of influencetrust me rube were not going to ignore that but right now all we want is to get back that bell what does that mean they stole it all we want is to get back the bell and head home that may be easier said we know what else can you tell us about the njiwa its one of two yachts okafor owns this one is homeported on sukuti island about thirty miles south of dar es salaam as the crow flies okafor has a vacation estate there owns the whole islandof course he does over the years sam and remi had found one of the most common traits among megalomaniac millionaires was their aversion to fraternization with the great unwashed masses owning a private island was an exceedingly effective way to accomplish thisrube said i dont have to ask what youre going to do next do i probably not okay but im going to throw in my obligatory be careful well call you when we can sam disconnected and recounted the conversation to remi after a few moments thought she said cant hurt to check it out on one condition name it that discretion will trump valor if we get in over our heads well retreat of course were assuming the njiwa is headed to sukuti sam nodded if shes not were probably out of the game if she is we need to get to the bell before they do something nasty to it chapter tanzania the njiwas negligible head start quickly became insurmountable as sam and remi came up against tanzanias geography where road travel along the coast and in between population centers was fairly easy they realized navigating off the beaten path would be a nightmare the only passable road heading south from dar es salaam was the b which ran the length of southern tanzania never straying closer than ten miles from the coast until it reached somanga village ninety miles south of sukuti island after realizing they would neither reach their destination by road nor before the njiwa they mentally regrouped now aware rivera had some powerful friends on his side they decided to err on the side of slight paranoia if rivera was playing the worstcasescenario game he might assume theyd take up pursuit from zanzibar or dar es salaam and having come to the same conclusion about road travel as they had he would expect them to arrive by boat by nightfall after half a dozen fruitless phone calls they found a bush pilot who agreed to take them from the ras kutani airstrip outside dar es salaam to mafia islands airstrip the next morning from there it would be a half days boat ride north to sukuti island a detail they left in selmas expert logistical hands such was africa the fargos knew though theyd heard the term african mile before this was the first time theyd experienced it firsthand what elsewhere would have been a thirtymile jaunt down the coast had turned into a convoluted hundredfiftymile journey with a night to kill sam kept his promise and booked them into the presidential suite at the moevenpick royal palm overlooking the ocean following an afternoon in the hotels spa they shared a late dinner in loliveto the hotels italian restaurantit feels like weve been away from civilization for months remi said across the table you dont look it sam replied ever resourceful remi had found a simple but elegant zac posen little black dress in the hotels boutique thank you sam the waiter arrived and sam gave him their wine selection sam said to remi i saw you were reading blaylocks biography at the spa any revelations its slow going it wasnt written by blaylock i can tell you that much unless his grasp of english was tenuous at best im guessing morton penned it but from what source one thing that struck me theres no mention of blaylock before he arrived in africa it begins the day he set foot in bagamoyo no personal details about his life up to that point interesting hows the index remi shrugged what youd expect im sure selma pete and wendy will have more luck with it i did check for any mention of the bell or the ophelia there was nothing odd if hes the one that took the time to inscribe all the hieroglyphics on the bell youd think it would at least warrant a mention sounds like a man trying to hide a secreta big secret remi added so big the mexican government may have been murdering people over it for the last seven years the airport shuttle dropped them off at the ras kutani shortly after dawn aside from a few maintenance people moving about in the morning fog the airstrip was quiet and devoid of life as the shuttle pulled away a figure emerged from the mist and approached them he wore safari khakis calfhigh jungle boots and a baseball cap emblazoned with the us army rangers insignia he had closecropped black hair and a thick mustacheed mitchell he said without preamble sam and remi fargo sam replied youre american more or less expatriate i guess youd call it that all you got he said nodding to sam and remis backpacks theyd left the majority of their baggage with vutolo an old friend and the concierge at the moevenpickthis is it sam replied okay im ready if you are mitchell turned and started walking sam and remi followed him to a sturdylooking but weathered bush air cessna mitchell loaded their gear aboard got them buckled into the backseat and did a rote preflight check within five minutes of arriving they were airborne and headed southdiving mitchells voice said over their headsets pardon remi replied thats why youre going to mafia i assume oh right sam said mr mitchell how long have you been in africa names ed twentytwo years i guess came here with rand to do a radar installation back in fell in love with it and decided to stay i flew spads and hueys in nam so bush flying seemed like a good fit set up shop and the rest is historysounds familiar remi replied which part falling in love with africa it has the tendency to get into your blood every few years i go back to the states to see friends but i always end up coming back early for the first time mitchell chuckled i guess thatd make me an africa junkiewhat do you know about sukuti island sam asked great diving prickly owner a guy named ambonisye okafor you thinking about going there thinking about it we can fly over he owns the island not the airspace itd only cost us fifteen minutes or so mitchell made the course adjustment and within a few minutes the island came into view out the lefthand window sukuti is actually part of the mafia archipelago and depending on who you ask theyre part of the spice chain along with zanzibar mitchell said big and little sukutithe big one situated to the north the little one to the south see the little waterway between them since its only fifty or sixty feet wide theyre officially considered a single landmass all in all about five square miles see the other one there four miles to the south thats north fanjoveand the long one sitting between them remi asked thats more atoll than islanda reef and sandbar doesnt really have a name that i know of its just so close to the surface that it looks solid you can walk across it but youd be wading up to your knees are those craters sam asked peering out the window yep back before world war one german battleships and cruisers used to use sukuti and fanjove for target practice in some places they punched holes straight down the water table thats why fanjove is so popular with cave divers they rope down into the craters and explore every year three or four die doing it are youno sam replied just regular diving watch yourself okafor claims two miles all around sukuti hes got patrol boats and a few armed guards he even tries to warn people away from fanjove but hes got no legal claim there theres his house there on the peak sam and remi craned their necks to take a look ambonisye okafors island vacation home was a fourstory italianstyle villa surrounded by a chesthigh stone wall neatly groomed crushedshell paths branched out from the estate like crooked wheel spokes if set sixtyfive years earlier and dropped into the pacific ocean big sukuti could have easily passed for a japanese fortress island during world war ii shaped like a cone whose rear quarter had been cleaved down to the waterline the islands southern lower reaches were devoid of plant life save the occasional scrub brush and completely without cover save the occasional boulder a half mile from the shore the moonscape gave way to a swath of rain forest that ended where the estates grounds began replace that villa with a bunker complex and youve got a smaller version of iwo jima sam said keeping that jungle at bay probably requires a fulltime maintenance staff two of the islands paths caught their attention one led to a dock on the islands northwestern side the njiwa was tied up alongside the pier opposite her were two rinker speedboats like those rivera and his men had used during the theft of the bell they could see several figures moving along the njiwas deck but at this altitude couldnt make out any faces the other significant path led to a clearing bordered by whitepainted stones in the center more stones these embedded in the earth formed a giant h a helicopter landing padremi said ed is that a yep he owns a eurocopter ec topoftheline bird okafor doesnt drive anywhere if he can help it a status thing i suspect either of you fly ive got my singleengine sam replied ive taken helicopter lessons i have ten hours in the cockpit its a tougher adjustment than id imaginedboy you got that right i dont see many guards or fences down there remi said odd for a man who enjoys his privacy hes got enough of a reputation that he doesnt need as much protection now he prosecutes trespassers without mercy rumor has it a few of them have even disappeared after pushing their luckyou believe that sam asked i tend to okafor was a general in the tanzanian army before he retired tough scary guy seen enough yes sam replied the remainder of the flight was quiet punctuated only by eds occasional utterances over their headsets as he pointed out landmarks and offered bits of african history just before seventhirty they touched down on mafia islands gravel airstrip and taxied up to the terminal a whitewashed building with dusky blue trim and a brickred tin roof beside the building a pair of uniformed immigration officials sat in the shade of a baobab as the engines wound down ed climbed out and retrieved their backpacks from the cargo compartment he handed them his card said safe travels fargos call me if you run into trouble then gave them a smile they could only describe as conspiratorialsam smiled back you know something we dont no but i know adventure hounds when i see them id say you two can handle yourselves better than most but africa is an unforgiving place the number on my card is my satellite phone ill leave it onthanks ed they shook hands then ed turned and headed toward a quonset hut whose window displayed a flickering red neon beer sign they grabbed their backpacks and headed toward the terminal but were intercepted on the sidewalk by the two officials from under the baobab after a cursory glance at their passports the officials poked through their belongings then stamped the passports and offered a welcome to mafia island in halting english you need taxi one of the officials asked without waiting for a response he raised his hand and whistled from the turnaround outside the airport entrance a rustriddled gray peugeot growled to lifesam said thank you but no well find our own transportation hand still raised the official looked quizzically at sam eh sam pointed to the peugeot and shook his head la asante no thanks the official shrugged then waved off the taxi driver and said sawa okay he and his partner walked back to the baobab what was that all about remi asked they were in cahoots at best we get a padded fare at worst we get taken to a private alley and robbed remi smiled sam fargo wheres your trust in humanity right now its the same place as my walletwell hidden while mafia island was a popular destination for extreme scuba divers it was also a hub for the tanzanian black market sam explained this to remishe said youre a font of trivia where did you come across this tidbit i downloaded the cia world factbook to my iphone very handy come on well walk its not far whats to stop us from getting mugged on the street sam lifted the tail of his shirt to expose the butt of the h ampk remi smiled and shook her head just go easy tex no ok corral reenactments please according to their maps the mafia island airstrip bisected the islands largest town kilindoni into north and south portions the former situated more inland the latter hugging the coast that was where selma had told them they would find the docks and the boat shed rented for them despite it being not yet eight in the morning the sun shone brightly in a clear blue sky and within minutes of leaving the airstrip both sam and remi were sweating they felt eyes watching their every step many of which belonged to curious children who paralleled their path waving and smiling shyly at the white strangers whod come to their village after twenty minutes of walking down hardpacked dirt roads lined with ramshackle huts that ranged in composition from tin to brick to cardboard they arrived at the beach equally dilapidated boat sheds and warehouses lined the dunes overlooking the water a dozen woodplank docks jutted into the surf thirty to forty boats from decadesold motor cruisers to skiffs to dhows both sail driven and motorized bobbed at anchor in the harbor near the waterline clusters of men and boys worked repairing nets scraping hulls or cleaning fishi miss the andreyale remi murmured well now that its got a grenade hole in the center of the afterdeck we own it sam replied maybe well pull it off the bottom well call it a souvenir he turned and scanned the row of buildings along the dune were looking for a bar called the red bird there remi said pointing fifty yards down the beach to a thatch longhouse fronted by a blackpainted fourbyeightfoot plywood sign sporting a crow painted in bright red they walked that way as they approached the wooden steps a quartet of men stopped their animated conversation and looked at them sam said morning were looking for buzibafor a long ten seconds none of them spoke unazungumza kiingereza remi said do you speak english no response for the next two minutes sam and remi used their limited knowledge of swahili to try to start a dialogue but to no avail a voice behind them said buziba dont be a jackassthey turned to see a grinning ed mitchell standing behind them he had a tusker beer in each hand are you following us sam asked more or less were probably the only three americans on the island right now thought a little solidarity couldnt hurt i know old buziba here ed said nodding to the grayhaired man sitting on the top step he speaks english playing dumb is his bargaining strategy ed barked out a sentence in swahili and the other three men got up and wandered back inside the barnow be a gentleman buziba ed said these are friends the old mans dour expression dropped away he smiled broadly friends of mr ed are friends of me i told you not to call me that mitchell said then to sam and remi he saw reruns of the tv show he gets a laugh out of comparing me to a talking horse remi said to buziba your english is very good fair indeed yes better than your swahili eh without a doubt sam replied a friend of ours called you about a boat buziba nodded miss selma yesterday i have your boat four hundred dollars per day eh ed said something in swahili and buziba responded ed said four hundred to sell he gave up fishing last year been trying to sell the thing ever since the bar brings in plenty of money for himsam and remi exchanged glances ed added youd probably pay that for two days rental from anyone else here lets see it sam said the four of them walked down the beach to where an eighteenfoot aquamarine blue dhow sat atop a half dozen vshaped sawhorses a pair of young boys were sitting in the sand beside the dhows hull one was scraping while the other was painting buziba said look inspect sam and remi walked around the dhow checking for signs of decay and disrepair sam poked the seams with his swiss army knife while remi tapped the wood sounding for rot sam walked to the stern climbed up the ladder leaning against the transom and stepped onto the afterdeck he reappeared two minutes later and called down the sails have got some roteh buziba replied ed translated listened to buzibas response then said hell throw in a new set for fifty dollars remi asked sam hows the cabin cozy in the extreme not the moevenpick but weve seen worse and the engine old but well maintained should give us six or seven knots remi walked to the transom and inspected the propeller and shaft im betting the bearings could use repacking ed translated listened then replied he says another fifty and hell have it done in two hours twentyfive sam countered he gives me the supplies and the tools and ill do it myself buziba jutted out his lower lip and stuck his chin in the air thinking fifty i add potable water and food for two days three days remi replied buziba considered this then shrugged three days chapter indian ocean okay shut her down sam called remi turned off the ignition key and the dhows engines sputtered out sam hoisted the sails and they held their collective breaths for a few seconds until the canvas caught the wind and billowed out the dhows bow lifted slightly and the boat lurched forward sam crabwalked aft and dropped onto the afterdeck beside remiwe have liftoff sam said heres hoping we dont have to call houston with a problem remi said and handed him a bottle of water it was already midafternoon and they were only five miles north of mafia island while remis discerning eye had noticed the propeller shafts bearing problem it hadnt been until sam had gotten it apart that they realized how much time the repair would require as remi supervised the boys in finishing up the maintenance and changing out the sails sam and ed worked under the shade of a makeshift sheet awning once done buziba and another dozen boys appeared and carried the dhow down to the waterline where they tested the engine and took the dhow for a test drive around the harbor an hour later the dhow fully stocked with water supplies and food sam and remi waved to buziba and ed and set outhow long until we get there remi asked sam got up retrieved the chart theyd found inside the cabin and unfolded it in his lap he checked the readout of his handheld gps unit and plotted their position another thirtynine miles were doing about five knots if we run all night well get there shortly after midnight or we could find someplace to lie up tonight then set out early and get there about dawn theres an unnamed island about twelve miles south of fanjovethats my vote without radar were asking for trouble agreed we wouldnt be able to see anything of sukuti until daylight anyway they sailed north for another five hours caught a tailwind for the last hour and found the island just as the upper rim of the sun was dipping behind the horizon sam steered the dhow into a small cove and dropped anchor once the boat was secure remi ducked into the cabin for a few minutes emerging with a lantern a camping stove and two cans of foodwhat can i serve you el capitan baked beans or baked beans and franks sam pursed his lips choices choices lets celebrate our not sinking lets have both a fine choice and for dessert fresh mango the surprisingly comfortable double army cot combined with the salt air and the gentle rocking of the dhow at anchor lulled them into a deep restful sleep at four am sams watch chimed and they got up and moving sharing a breakfast of leftover mango and strong black coffee before weighing anchor and setting out again they lost an hour of progress to sluggish predawn winds but shortly before sunrise the air picked up and before long they were clipping north at a steady six knots that brought them within sight of north fanjove island by seven am a half hour later they drew even with the atoll mitchell had pointed out here they secured the sails switched to engine power and spent another nerveracking forty minutes picking their way through the reefs until they reached the south side of little sukuti island sam tooled along the coast until remi spotted a mangrovechoked cove they hoped would shield the dhow from prying eyes following remis hand signals from the bow sam steered into the cove he shut off the engine and let the dhow drift forward until the bow gently wedged itself between two mangroves jutting diagonally from the bank having listened to the steady putputput of the dhows engine for the last hour the sudden silence was jarring they stood still for half a minute listening until the jungle around them slowly came back to life with a cacophony of squawks and buzzesremi secured the bowline to one of the tree trunks then headed aft to join sam on the afterdeck whats the plan she asked were assuming the bell is still aboard the njiwa thats the bestcase scenario with any luck we wont have to set foot on the island itself either way we have to wait for nightfall for now i say we do a little reconnaissance and have a little picnicreconnaissance and a picnic remi repeated with a smile every womans dream date unlike its larger alter ego little sukuti island was all mangrove swamp and jungle save a lone jagged peak that on the vertical was no more than five hundred feet above the oceans surface but as sam and remi had learned many times a fivehundredfoot ascent on rough winding trails could turn into a three or fourhour hike by ten am already sweating profusely and covered in bug bites and mud they emerged from the swamp and pushed their way into the jungle with sam in the lead they pushed north until they came across what they were looking for a stream water meant animals and animals meant game trails it took them only a few minutes to find one heading northwest toward the islands summit shortly before one in the afternoon they broke free of the jungle and found themselves at the foot of the escarpmentthats a relief remi said staring upward the rock face was manageable fifty feet tall no steeper than fifty degrees and with plenty of crags and cracks they could use for footand handholds after a short water break they headed upward and were soon nestled in a little rock alcove beneath the peak they each pulled a pair of binoculars from their packs rose up and looked aroundthar she blows sam muttered a mile away and a hundred feet below them was okafors home painted a butter yellow with stark white trim it sat in a nearperfect circular clearing of reddish brown dirt at this distance they could make out details theyd missed from the air as sam had predicted a trio of men in green coveralls were working along the eastern side of the grounds two hacking at the encroaching foliage with machetes the third mowing a strip of lawn the villa itself was massive easily fifteen thousand square feet with wraparound balconies on each floor at the rear of the property was what looked like a radio antenna satellite tv towerdo you see that remi asked what on the roof eastern corner sam pointed his binoculars where remi had indicated and saw a pair of big eyes naval binoculars mounted on a tripod well sam said the bad news is to the southwest they can see anything coming ten miles away you see the coaxial cable attached to the housing i see it its for remote control and monitoring im guessing probably from a control room in the house the good news is i dont think theyre nightvision capable they continued panning their binoculars moving down the slope to the helicopter pad at the edge of the white stone perimeter a lone man in khaki coveralls sat in a lawn chair leaning against his left thigh was an ak assault rifle hes asleep remi said that and the missing helicopter tell us the boss is away sam panned his binoculars again after a moment he said ive got movement on the njiwa i see it remi replied theres a familiar face there was no mistaking itzli riveras gaunt ropy frame and sunken face he stood on the yachts foredeck a satellite phone to his ear after a minute of listening he nodded checked his watch said something into the handset and disconnected he turned aft cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted something ten seconds later nochtli and yaotl came jogging through the arch on the portside weather deck and stopped before rivera who spoke to them for a few minutes before they rushed off againlooked like rivera was passing on some orders from on high lets hope its about the bell our bell remi corrected him with a smile i like the way you think lets do a guard count they spent the next fifteen minutes doing just this and came up with four one at the helicopter pad one patrolling the road to the dock and two strolling around the villas perimeter unless they missed someone it appeared no guards were watching the islands approacheswe cant forget rivera and the other two stooges sam said theyre probably staying aboard the boat if so we might have to find a way to get them off that wont be easy based on how much trouble theyve gone to get the bell theyre probably sleeping beside it they spent the remainder of the afternoon drawing a detailed map of the island and enjoying their ersatz picnic of fruit nuts and bottled water shortly after five they heard a faint chopping sound to the east they focused their binoculars and soon enough the sound took the shape of a helicopter ambonisye okafors eurocopter ec jetblack with tinted windows swept over the island and did a slow circuit as though the man aboard were surveying his kingdom before stopping in a hover over the pad and touching down the guard on duty was already standing at attention spine erect an ak held at port arms as the rotors spooled down the eurocopters side door opened and out stepped a tall lean african man in a crisp white suit and mirrored sunglassesfuns over sam said dads home clearly our host went to the idi amin school of fashion remi said id be willing to bet his closet is packed with clones of that outfit sam smiled behind his binoculars then again whos going to risk telling him hes a cliche okafor strode across the pad and snapped off a salute to the guard as he reached the path an electric golf cart pulled to a stop before him he climbed in and the cart headed up the hill toward the villasam said now well see if okafors return stirs up any action after another ten minutes the cart returned down the hill turned onto the dock road and stopped beside the njiwa rivera strode down the gangplank and got into the passenger seat and the cart returned to the villa where rivera disappeared inside he emerged twenty minutes later and the golf cart returned him to the njiwa sam and remi kept their focus on the yacht five minutes passed then ten then twenty there was no movement on the decks no reaction to riveras meeting with okaforthat was underwhelming remi said looking sideways at sam i can see the gears turning in your head you have a plan of attack over the years sams and remis complementary personalities had molded the planning of the dicier parts of their adventures sam would develop the plan and remi would play devils advocate running the plan through her steeltrap mind until they decided it workable and would minimize the likelihood that theyd find themselves in over their heads so far the system had worked well though the water frequently reached their chinsalmost sam said he lowered his binoculars and checked his watch we better start back down itll be nightfall in four hours the return leg of the hike was easier going partially because they werent fighting gravity and partially because theyd already blazed the trail back at sea level they circumnavigated the mangrove swamp to the south turned north again at the beach then swam the last quarter mile they were nearing the mouth of the cove when remi stopped swimming and said quiet listen sam heard it a few moments later the faint rumble of a marine engine somewhere to their right they turned to see a rinker speedboat coming around the headland a hundred yards away one man was behind the wheel a second stood behind him scanning the shoreline through a pair of binocularsdeep breath sam said to remi together they gulped a lungful of air then curled under the water and dove six feet beneath the surface they leveled off and began stroking toward the cove arm outstretched sam reached the bank a few seconds before remi he curled his fingers around the roots jutting from the mud then turned grabbed remis hand and pulled her in sam pointed above their heads where a tangle of dead brush floated on the surface together they let themselves float up they broke into the air and looked aroundyou hear the engine sam whispered in remis ear no wait there they are sam looked in the direction of remis nod through the twigs he could see the rinker sitting still in the water about fifty feet away the engine coughed once sputtered then went dead the driver tried again but got the same result he pounded his fist on the wheel his partner stepped to the stern knelt down and lifted the engine hatchengine trouble sam whispered theyll move on soon it was either that they both knew or these two would have to call for a tow which meant sam and remi wouldnt be going anywhere for a while cross fingers remi replied aboard the rinker the second man turned and said something to the driver who tried the engine again it coughed and died spark plug sam muttered in the corner of his eye he saw remis head move slowly leaning backward until her face was pointing upward sam slowly turned his head looked at her and followed her gaze he found himself staring into a pair of beady brown eyes not six inches away the eyes blinked once then narrowed slightly it took a moment for sam to realize what he was seeingmonkey he whispered to remi yes sam i noticed capuchin colobus i think juvenile from the direction of the rinker they heard the engine turn over again this time it caught sputtered then settled into a steady idle above them the colobus jerked its head up at the noise its tiny hands clamping down on the branches it looked back down at sam and remiremi cooed easy little the colobus opened its mouth and began shrieking and shaking the branches so wildly that leaves rained down on them sam lowered his head and peered through the brush pile aboard the rinker both men were standing up rifles at the shoulder muzzles aimed in their direction suddenly a crack one of the muzzles flashed the bullet zipped through the foliage above their heads the colobus shrieked louder and flailed at the branches sam groped underwater found remis hand squeezed itshe whispered are they i dont think so theyre looking for lunch crack more shrieking and shaking silence sam could hear the colobuss hands and feet pattering away theyre turning our way sam whispered get ready for a deep breath through the brush they watched as the rinkers bow came around until it was pointed directly at them it began gliding forward slowly closing the gap the second man was now standing beside the driver rifle braced on the windshields framewait sam rasped wait when the rinker was fifteen feet away he said deep breath under they submerged together each one clawing for handholds as they dragged themselves back first down the bank when their feet sunk into the mud they craned their necks back on the surface the rinkers bow was shoving its way into the brush pile sam and remi heard muffled voices then the cracking of branches leaves fluttered down and dotted the surface finally after nearly a minute the rinkers propeller reversed and began churning the boat began backing out sam and remi waited until the bow swung around and the rinker began moving away before resurfacing they caught their breath and watched as the boat disappeared around the bendthey didnt get him did they remi asked sam turned and smiled at her thats my girl animal lover until the end no he got away come on lets get out of here chapter sukuti island there remi called from the bow all stop back slow with his view blocked by the mast sam throttled to neutral let the dhow drift a bit then reversed and eased backward around the knob of shoreline theyd been following thats good she called theyre about a mile ahead of us another ten minutes and theyll make the turn north forty minutes earlier after beaching their dhow in the cove theyd wasted no time in getting under way sam and remi hoped the rinker was on a route that would take it along sukutis southern coast and back to okafors docks as their planned approach would take them around the northern side of the island they were anxious to reach the relative safety of the inlet that separated little sukuti from big sukutiproviding that too wasnt on the rinkers route while a straight shot along the southern coast would have been the quickest route to the docks it would also have left them exposed to any observant eyes and ears by following the inlet north and shadowing the coast around to the western side they would be invisible to anyone not standing atop the escarpmentthey sat in silence watching the sun on its slow downward arc to the horizon until finally remi checked her watch and said slow ahead sam started the engines and goosed the dhows throttle easing them from behind cover on the bow remi lay on her belly with the binoculars trained along the coast theyre gone she said were clear sam shoved the throttle forward and the dhow surged ahead another ten minutes passed remi called out there it is sam leaned sideways over the rail until he could see a couple hundred yards away the mouth of the inlet no more than fifty feet wide the channel looked as much like a tunnel as it did an inlet its banks overgrown with jungle and trees arcing over the water to form an impenetrable canopy save a patch of tenfootwide sky down the centersam eased the dhows wheel to starboard the bow came about remi walked aft ducked under the boom and dropped to the deck beside sam jungle cruise she said pardon the inlet remember the disney world jungle cruise thats what this reminds me of sam chuckled my favorite ride as a kid sam its still your favorite ride true within minutes theyd closed to within a hundred yards of the inlets mouth they felt the dhow shudder beneath their feet and it leapt ahead picking up five knots in as many secondsgood call remi said to her husband having already experienced the power of the current off zanzibar sam had earlier worried about similar conditions here positioned as it was along the coast with the tide surging from the south the mouth of the inlet was a hydraulic vacuum sucking ocean in from the south and spitting it out to the north sam switched off the engine to save gas and gripped the wheel tighter he said the good news is we probably dont have to worry about running aground this currents digging a pretty deep trench in there the dhow bucked to the side and the stern slipped sideways sam corrected first to starboard then to port and the bow realigned on the mouth of the inlet with both hands clamped on the rail remi was leaning over the side a smile on her face auburn hair streaming behind herhow fast are we going she called ten twelve knots sam replied laughing this close to the waters surface it felt much faster better make your way forward im going to need your eyes aye captain she made her way to the bow fifty yards to go she called steady on to starboard sam watched a fourfoot wave crash over an exposed sandbar surge coming he warned remi and turned the wheel a few degrees to meet it the wave hit them on the starboard bow pushing the dhow sideways the bow started to swing around off course sam muscled the wheel hard to starboard compensating until the surge passed and the bow found the line againlooking good steady on remi called twenty yards sam leaned over the starboard rail and looked down the indigo water was thirty to forty feet deep but six feet to the right he could see the white sand bottom through the turquoise water he leaned to port and saw the samewe havent got much room to spare sam called forward how does it look ahead narrower still want a little drag sure remi shimmied around on her belly retrieved the danforth anchor from its mount tossed it over the bow and let the line stream between her hands until she felt it skipping along the bottom she hauled in a few inches of line and secured it to the pulpit rail the dhow began slowing until they were moving in a jerkandsurge fashionten yards remi called and then as if the sun had suddenly been eclipsed the dhow slipped inside the inlet to the left and right walls of green closed in around them above a ragged ribbon of blue sky sam looked aft and felt a surge of vertigo as the entrance to the inlet seemed to close like an iris door on a spaceship turn coming up remi called fortyfive degrees to starboardsam faced forward again ready when you are three two one turn sam gave the wheel a quarter spin to port and held it starboard turn remi shouted sam spun the wheel again hold it there remi ordered a few seconds passed okay start easing back to port keep going more good steady on as if on cue the current died away until the dhow was skimming ahead at a walking pace the inlet widened out slightly leaving fifteen feet on both beams haul anchor sam called i think were okay remi retrieved the danforth and returned to the cockpit from the banks came the sounds of the jungle easing into twilight the plaintive squawks of parrots the croaking of frogs and the buzz of insectsits so peaceful remi said looking around a little spooky but peaceful sam grabbed the map from its compartment and unfolded it on the roof of the cabin remi clicked on a flashlight sam skimmed his index finger around the island we need the circumference remi retrieved the dividers and walked them around the coastline occasionally marking headlands and landmarks with a pencil once done she scribbled some calculations in the margins then said big sukuti is nine miles give or take little sukuti about five sam studied his watch for a moment well reach the other mouth in twenty minutes if that rinker makes another patrol right away itll be passing the northern side of this inlet about twenty minutes after that if it doesnt show up it probably means no more patrols for the night or theyre only doing them every few hoursthats a big if remi replied if the latter it means we might run into them somewhere along the coastline wed better hope we see them before they see us sam nodded do me a favor find every nook and cranny along the coast well need to be ready to hide on a moments notice it took remi ten minutes to finish the task she said therere plenty to choose from but no depth markings i can only be certain of six or seven being deep enough for our draftwell have to play it by ear so about your master plan wish i had one sam replied therere too many variables we have to assume theyll be moving the bell sooner rather than latereither shipping it somewhere or dumping it somewhere for that they have three choices one of the rinkers the njiwa or okafors helicopter well start with the njiwa whatever they do thats where the bell will stay until they decide to move it if they use a rinker or the njiwa i say we put on our pirate hats and stage a hijackingand if its the helicopter same plan we just put on our flying scarves sam my dear you dont have much time logged on helicopters i think i can manage the four or five miles to the mainland wed be across the channel in six minutesprobably before they could even organize a posse we find a secluded clearing somewhere put her down andremi smiled play it by ear sam shrugged and smiled back its the best chance we have remi agreed but youve left out a lot of big potentially disastrous ifs i know for example what if were spotted well be outgunned and outmanned i know and of course the biggest if what if the bells already been moved sam paused then the games over if we dont intercept it here its gone for good remi were a democracy if its not unanimous we dont go im in sam you know that on one condition though name it we take out some insurance the sun was setting by the time the mouth of the inlet came into view a rough oval of golden orange light at the end of the tunnel when they were ten feet away remi steered the dhow toward the righthand bank and jostled the throttle until the overhanging limbs draped over them standing atop the cabin sam manhandled the thicker branches around the mast and boom until the dhow was nestled against the bank he crawled forward to the pulpit and peeked through the foliagegot a perfect view he called back the sun had dropped behind big sukuti casting the western half of the island including the inlet in twilight sam added if theyre doing another circuit theyll be here in fifteen or twenty minutesim going to pack our gear and do some scrounging remi went below sam could hear her moving about in the cabin she returned to the cockpit sat down and began humming summer wind by frank sinatra they got through hotel california by the eagles in the midnight hour by wilson pickett and were halfway through hey jude by the beatles when sam raised his hand for silenceten seconds passed what is it remi asked nothing i guess no there hear it remi listened for a few moments then there it was the faint rumble of a marine engine the pitch sounds right she said its coming from the northwest our guest may be en route of the scenarios theyd considereda delayed second patrol meeting the rinker along the northern coast or an immediate patrol that would pass before they headed out from the inletthe third was ideal by knowing the rinkers route and its average speed they could be reasonably sure of their foes location at any given time barring the unforeseen they would reach the docks long before the rinker did lying on his belly binoculars raised sam kept his eyes focused on the headland a quarter mile away the grumble of the engine grew in intensity until finally the rinkers bow appeared as expected it was occupied by a driver and a spotter also as expected the boat turned southeast following the coastlinea spotlight glowed to life were okay he said half to himself half to remi they wont see us unless theyre on top of us odds ninetyfive percent maybe ninety sam were okay keep your head down and cross your fingers the rinker kept coming it was now a hundred yards from the inlet and heading straight for them the spotlight skimming along the bank and over the trees anytime boys sam muttered nothing to see here move along the rinker closed the gap to fifty yards forty yards thirty yards sam took one hand off the binoculars slowly reached backward and grabbed the h ampk from the thigh pocket of his cargo shorts he brought the gun up and laid it on the deck beneath his shoulder he flicked off the safetythe rinker was twenty yards away sam whispered remi you better get below sam please remi he felt the dhow rock slightly as she crept down the ladder sam lowered the binoculars he wiped his right palm on his pant leg then grabbed the h ampk extended it through the branches and took aim on the shadowed form behind the rinkers wheel sam let the scenario play in his head driver first then the spotlight then the second man before he had a chance to take cover or return fire two shots for each then pause and wait for signs of lifethe rinker kept coming sam took a deep breath suddenly the rinkers engine revved up the bow rose up and pivoted to port and within five seconds the boat disappeared from view sam exhaled he knocked twice on the cabins roof a few seconds later remi whispered clear clear check the map how long until they clear the northern tip of little sukuti there came the crinkle of paper in the darkness followed by the scratching of a pencil remi said its a little over a mile twentyfive minutes and we should be okay for safe measure they let thirty minutes pass before shoving off and motoring out of the inlet for the next forty minutes they glided along the northern shoreline never straying more than fifty feet from the beach and never exceeding a quiet but frustrating three miles per hour leaning over the map on the deck penlight clamped between her teeth remi was walking the dividers she looked up took the penlight out of her mouth the rinker should be reaching the southern tip of little sukuti weve got at least twenty minutes on themthey reached big sukutis northern tip paused there for a binocular scan of the coastline ahead then set out again the docks are less than a mile away remi told sam what do you think stop at half a mile sounds good they covered the distance in twelve minutes to port the islands sloped moonscape rose from the beach to meet the rain forest sam slowed the dhow as remi scanned the shoreline this looks good here she said then scrambled to the bowsam turned to port aimed the bow at the beach and followed remis curt directions until she called all stop sam throttled down then collected their packs from the deck and met remi at the pulpit she lowered herself over the side then sam grabbed her wrists and lowered her the rest of the way the water was waisthigh he handed down their packscome here remi said what come here i said he smiled then leaned his head over the side until she could crane her neck and kiss him on the cheek she said be safe no drowning allowed noted ill see you in a few minutes the next part of their plan turned out to be anticlimactic sam reversed the engines brought the bow around and took the dhow a few hundred yards off the coast then turned off the engine and dropped anchor he estimated there was fifty feet of water beneath the keel he went below and opened each of the dhows five scuttle valves when the water reached his calves he went topside and dove over the side and began swimming five minutes later he stood up in the shallows and waded ashore to where remi was waitingtogether they watched the dhow settle into the water and sink from view sam gave it a salute then said ready remi nodded lead on chapter big sukuti island with sam in the lead they walked in silence for fifteen minutes keeping to the harder wet sand until they came upon a twentyfoothigh rock outcropping bisecting the beach sam scaled up the slippery rocks found a flat spot below the ridge and peeked over after a few seconds he turned and motioned for remi to join him together they poked their heads above the rocks a few hundred yards down the beach they could see the dock jutting into the water on one side the njiwa was still moored her interior cabin lights glowing yellow through sheer curtains opposite her both rinkers were tied up as well there was no sign of either the driver or passengerthey must have cut a few corners to get back so quickly remi said they probably move at a pretty good clip along the southern side with the big eyes we saw on the roof earlier nobodys going to be sneaking up from that direction and at least we know where everyone is remi added i dont see any activity you nothing weve got two choices by land or by water theres too much loose rock on the slope and no cover remi said agreed water it is howre we getting aboard the njiwa sam zoomed his binoculars until he could see the yachts companion ladder while it was less than five feet tall its head was attached to the deck right in front of the cabins sliding doornot by the ladder sam said he thought for a moment back on the dhow i saw a sea anchor in the cabin remi reached over her shoulder and patted the backpack in here improvised grappling hook you read my mind we hook the stern rail and shimmy up they climbed back down to the sand then waded into the surf and set off perpendicular to the beach in a quiet energyefficient breaststroke once theyd covered fifty yards they turned south parallel to the beach until they drew even with the dock they stopped and treaded watermovement sam asked i dont see any head for the rinker they set out again arms sweeping them forward their eyes scanning the dock area for movement soon they reached the rinkers transom they took a moment to catch their breath listening and looking from the njiwas cabin they heard muffled voices then a pounding sound silence more poundingsomeones hammering sam whispered touch that engine remi touched the rinkers outboard with the back of her hand cold why this one will have more gas wait here time for our insurance policy he took a breath ducked under and swam alongside the first rinker to its twin at the head of the dock he grabbed the gunwale chinned himself up and looked around no movement he boosted himself over the side onto the deck then crawled forward to the drivers seat he checked the ignition not surprisingly the keys were missing he rolled onto his back opened the maintenance hatch beneath the dashboard and wiggled inside he clicked on his penlight and studied the wiring bundle just like old times sam muttered five months earlier hed found himself doing the same thing with another speedboat on a lake in the bavarian alps luckily like that boats this rinkers wiring was simple ignition wipers navigation lights and horn using his swiss army knife sam severed each wire taking as much length as he could he rolled them into a tight ball and tossed it over the side then wriggled back out and closed the hatch he crawled back to the gunwale did a quick check then rolled back into the water and returned to remiokay if all goes well thisll be our getaway boat we grab the bell disable the njiwa if we can then bring the bell back here how ill manage it somehow well worry about the hernia later we bring the bell back here and slip away before anyone knows whats happened and if all goes unwell never mind i already know we play it by ear they stroked around the dock to the njiwas stern and immediately realized the yacht was bigger up close the stern rail was ten feet above the waterline remi fished the dhows sea anchor from her backpack sam examined it too short he whispered into her ear then gestured for her to follow they stroked back to the rinkers transom time for plan b sam said ill try the ladder remi opened her mouth to speak but he pushed on its the only way if i jump from the dock itll make too much noise get into the rinker and be ready to take offno if i get caught run i said you run and get back to civilization and call rube hell know what to do with you missing rivera will assume youve contacted the authorities he wont kill menot right away hes too smart for that dead bodies are more trouble than theyre worthremi frowned and gave him a withering stare lets call all that plan c plan b is you dont get caught were up to our chins sam i know keep a sharp eye out ill signal you when its clear if i raise my hand and spread my fingers its safe to come a raised fist stay where you are he took off his shirt and shoes stuffed both in his backpack and handed the pack to remi whatre you doing she asked clothing drips and shoes squeak sam have you been taking commando classes on the side just watching the military channel he kissed her then ducked beneath the surface stroked under the rinker and resurfaced under the dock another breath and another duck brought him alongside the njiwas white hull he stroked forward beneath the companion ladder then paused he could hear muffled voices coming from the cabin two men perhaps three he strained to catch any words or isolate the voices but failed he boosted himself onto the dock laid flat waited and listened then got up and crept up the ladder below the top rung he paused poked his head up saw nothing and crawled onto the deck he stood up and pressed himself against the bulkhead the sliding door opened a rectangle of yellow light angled onto the deck heart in his throat sam did a rapid sidestep along the bulkhead and around the corner to the forecastle where he froze and took a few calming breaths he heard the clump of footsteps on the deck the door slid shut again followed by footsteps clanging down the companion ladder sam stepped forward peeked aft and saw nothing so he took another step and peeked over the rail a figure was walking down the dock at the end of a dock in a small clearing sat a green gaspowered cushman flatbed cart and directly behind it a white golf cart ahead of them the trail curved up and away toward the helicopter pad and the main housethe figure leaned over the cushman removed a rake and a pair of shovels and tossed them into the brush beside the path making room for cargo sam muttered to himself he turned toward the rinker raised a stay put fist for a few seconds then ducked down and waddled back to the bulkhead footfalls clicked on the wooden dock then back up the ladder followed by the sliding door opening and closing three minutes passed the door slid open again more clomping now multiple feet grunting something heavy sliding across the deck sam peeked around the corner and saw three men in the light from the cabin door rivera nochtli and yaotl between them sat a crate roughly the size of the dummy crate sam had created on zanzibar yaotl the biggest of the three backed down the ladder in front of the crate while rivera and nochtli shoved it forward sam drew back into the shadows and listened as they manhandled the crate down the ladder to the dock sam crabwalked to the rail and peeked over nochtli and yaotl were moving down the dock each gripping one of the crates rope handles rivera walked a few paces behind the trio reached the clearing the crate was placed onto the cushmans flatbedrivera began speaking in spanish sam caught only snippets take it helicopter there shortly the cushmans engine started tires crunched on the shell path after a few seconds the engine faded and died away sam risked a peek over the railing rivera was striding down the dock toward the ladder sam backed away and took cover against the bulkhead rivera climbed the ladder and went into the cabin sam considered his options he had little desire to tangle with rivera a trained and accomplished killer but as soon as the man reached the helicopter it would lift off with the bell aboard more important whatever he and remi did next would be easier with rivera out of the equation the h ampk was out of the question sam knew because the noise could attract the attention of the other guards hed have to do it the hard way he took a deep breath and crept aft along the bulkhead to the sliding door he took a few moments to mentally rehearse his actions then reached out pressed his thumb against the doors handle and shoved with a hiss the door slid openfrom inside riveras voice nochtli yaotl sam took a half step backward balled up his right fist and cocked it over his shoulder a shadow blocked out the cabins light riveras nose appeared from behind the doorjamb followed by his chin and eyes sam lashed out with a straight punch aiming for riveras temple but the mans reflexes kicked in and he twisted his head sideways sams fist glanced off riveras temple wary of him recovering and grabbing whatever weapon he was sure to be carrying sam pivoted through the door out of the corner of his eye sam saw rivera to the right as predicted rivera was reaching for something behind his back years of judo training took over instinctively sam assessed riveras posture and stance and saw the weak point still slightly stunned rivera was leaning against the bulkhead trying to regroup all his weight concentrated on his left foot sam ignored riveras weapon hand and instead lashed out with a deashiharaia forward foot sweepthat caught him just below the left ankle rivera collapsed sideways and slid down the bulkhead but still his weapon hand was coming around sam saw the gun in it reached up grabbed the wrist and used the arms momentum to slam riveras hand against the wall sam heard the crack of bone the gun fell away and bounced across the carpeted deck hand still clamped on riveras wrist sam took a big step backward dropped his center of gravity and twisted his hips whipping riveras body flat across the floor sam released the wrist and dropped onto riveras back he snaked his right arm around the throat going for a rear naked choke rivera reacted immediately lashing backward with an elbow punch that caught sam below the eye his eyesight sparkled and dimmed he turned his face away felt another elbow crash into the back of his head sam breathed through it and curled his forearm sliding farther across riveras throat using his legs as counterweights sam rolled left taking rivera with him then rivera made his mistake he panicked he stopped throwing elbows and started clawing at the forearm around his neck sam extended the choke clamped his right hand onto his left bicep then squeezed while pressing his head forward forcing riveras chin toward his chest and compressing his carotid arteries almost immediately riveras flailing weakened another second and he went limp sam held on for three more beats then let go and shoved rivera aside sam got to his knees and checked the mans pulse and breathing alive but in a deep sleep sam took ten seconds to catch his breath then climbed to his feet he reached up and touched his cheekbone his fingers came back bloody he shuffled out the door looked around to make sure all was clear then held up five fingers he returned inside remi stepped through the door sixty seconds later she glanced at riveras motionless body then to sam then dropped their backpacks she strode to sam and they embraced she pulled away she used her index finger to tilt his face sideways she frownedit looks worse than it is sam said how do you know what it looks like youre going to need stitches my pageant days are over remi nodded to rivera is he just sleeping hes going to be one angry man when he wakes up then lets not be here i assume were going with the helicopter hijacking they were kind enough to load the bell aboard itd be rude to let that effort go to waste the rinker did you jerked out the wires and tossed them overboard what now tie him up no time weve got surprise on our side if anyone comes back looking for him thats gone sam looked around he walked forward and opened a door revealing a ladder leading upward thatll be the bridge go up and do some damage to their communicationsremi said shiptoshore phone and radio right sam nodded ill go below and see if therere any bazookas lying around pardon were going to have company at the helicopter pad and i doubt theyll be happy to see us something big and loud and scary might change their minds sam knelt down retrieved riveras gunanother h ampk semiautomaticand handed it to remi she examined it for a few moments then deftly ejected the magazine checked the ammunition slid the magazine back into place flipped on the safety and shoved the h ampk into her waistbandsam stared at her she said home and garden television okay then well meet back here in two minutes remi headed up the ladder and sam went belowdecks he ransacked each of the six sleeping quarters and found only one weapon a magnum revolver he went back up the ladder remi was waitinghowd you do he asked i ripped both handsets out of their sockets and tossed them overboard thatll work okay everyones waiting for rivera at the pad with luck itll be yaotl nochtli the guard and the pilot four people at most we drive up and hope they dont get suspicious until its too lateand if theres a big party waiting for us we retreat chapter big sukuti island okay sit tight sam said to remi he brought the cart to a halt and set the parking brake ahead he could see the crest of the path he walked forward until he could see over the rise a hundred feet down the path was a clearing where the road forked up to the main house to the right of the clearing sitting under the glow of a polemounted sodiumvapor lamp was the helicopter pad sam walked back to the cart remi asked how many i only saw three the guard nochtli and yaotl all standing together at the edge of the pad theyve all got aks but theyre slung over their shoulders as for the pilot no sign hes either at the house or sitting in the helicopter waitingno offense sam but i hope its the latter if we convince him to fly us no offense taken what about the bell its not on the cushman looks like theyve done the heavy lifting ill take the first three you head straight for the helicopter you ready as ill ever be she crouched on the golf carts floor and ducked her head beneath the fiberglass dashboard she looked up at him you dont look much like rivera as long as we get close enough fast enough it wont matter sam withdrew the and the h ampk from his pockets tucked one each beneath a thigh then released the parking brake and depressed the gas pedal the cart eased forward and within seconds they were over the crest and heading for the clearing he resisted the impulse to jam the accelerator to the floorboardsfifty feet to go he muttered to remi still havent seen us at thirty feet yaotl looked up and spotted the cart he said something to the other two they turned around all eyes were on the cart now still no reaction sam said hold on tight im going in he stomped on the gas pedal and the cart accelerated covering the final twenty feet in a matter of seconds sam slammed on the brake locking the parking mechanism took his hands off the wheel grabbed both guns and jumped out before the trio just outside the glow of the pole light he raised both gunsevening gentlemen he said its you said yaotl us sam corrected without a word remi climbed from the cart and joined sam who told the group everyone act natural nothings changed just three guys hanging around big smiles everyone he and remi had decided it was best to assume the pad was under observation from the big eyes binoculars on the main houses roof to avoid arousing suspicion yaotl and the other two would have to keep their weapons until sam and remi were ready to leaveremi see what you can do about that light careful to stay at the edge of its glow remi stepped forward and studied the pole no switch but the cables are coming up from the ground it looks like standard oneten voltage sam said nice of okafor to cut corners for us while twotwentyvolt lines carried enough juice to electrocute oneten lines carried only enough to cause a painful jolt do you think you can make it to the helo without being seeni think so be right back she walked back down the road and ducked into some bushes alongside the helicopter pad thirty seconds later she appeared on the opposite side and using the helicopter to screen her movements sprinted to the pilots door with the pilot under her h ampk she retraced her course and returned to where sam stood the pilot was a short black man in dark blue coveralls his expression was one of genuine fearremi said the crates aboard all strapped down yaotl asked sam wheres rivera napping the guard moved his hand trying surreptitiously to unsling his ak sam raised the gun and pointed it at his head dont sam said then added in swahili usifanye hivyo the guard stopped let his hand dropremi do you have them i have them sam stepped backward and motioned for the pilot to join him whats your name jingaro youre okafors pilot yes your english is good i went to missionary school i want you to fly the helicopter for us i cannot do that yes you can if i do okafor will kill me if you dont ill kill you not in the same way he will and perhaps my family too please i just fly for him thats all im not part of this you see i dont have a gun i just fly the helicopter are you lying about your family no it is the truth im sorry i cannot help you i do not like mr okafor but i have no choice sam studied jingaros eyes and decided he was telling the truth is the helicopter ready to fly yes are you a pilot sam shrugged on rotary im not much past takeoff hover and touchdown jingaro hesitated then said this one is equipped with a hover coupler on the far right side of the dash it is labeled hvcp as long as your flight level is steady you can engage the coupler and the craft will go into auto hover also the rudder pedals are heavy i like them that way it is harder to overcompensate do not be afraid to step on them keep your airspeed below one hundred knots shes much easier to handle thanksyou are welcome now hit me what hit me if okafor suspects i i understand good luck and you sam cocked his hand back and slammed his palm on the tip of the pilots nose the blow wasnt enough to break bone but blood began gushing immediately the pilot stumbled backward and sprawled onto his backstay there sam barked dont move remi can you see the big eyes from there she reached her hand behind her withdrew the binoculars from her packs side pocket and aimed them at the houses roof i see them theyre pointing to the south right now panning slowly this way another thirty seconds or so and theyll have the pad in sightsam looked at the guard unazungumza kiingereza he said in swahili do you speak english bit english sam pointed at the sheathed machete strapped to his belt and said kisu bwaga ku knife throw it down sam pointed at his feet and barked now the guard unclipped the machete and tossed it toward sam who picked it up to the group he said heres the plan everybody were going to walk to the helicopter well go first and youll follow feet behind us spread out in a linewhy asked yaotl youll be the sandbags if anyone starts shooting at us yaotl make sure the other two understand you wont get away with maybe not but were going to give it the old college try if we say no this came from nochtli since you brought it up youll be the first one i shoot yaotl said i do not think you will even if you do the rest of okafors guards will be here in under a minute probably so but you wont be around to see it sam took a step forward and leveled the on yaotls chest remember your stay at our villa yes we treated you decently yes well were all out of nice to punctuate his point sam raised the so it was level with yaotls forehead care for some proof yaotl shook his head make sure the others understand the plan yaotl translated first to nochtli then to the guard in pigeon swahili both men nodded yaotl said where will you go mr fargo if you knew how to fly you wouldnt have been talking to the pilot if you stop now and surrendersam interrupted weve had enough of nightmare island were leaving and were taking our bell with us the bell is it so important you are willing to die for it remi spoke up is it so important that you murdered nine tourists for it sam hes stalling us sam nodded keep an eye on them im going to see about making those carts disappear yaotl take the laces out of your boots and give them to me yaotl bent over removed the laces balled them up and tossed them forward sam retrieved them and walked to the golf cart thirty seconds later the steering wheel was locked down by one of the laces sam released the parking brake braced his arms on the front bumper and pushed the cart over the crest of the hill where it started rolling on its own after a few seconds it disappeared into the darkness he then repeated the process with the cushman and returned to remis sideready he asked a relative term that i dont know how quickly well get a reaction once the light goes out so lets be quick sam watched the big eyes on the roof until they moved toward the light pole remi stopped him hold on sam then to yaotl and the others turn around and face the helicopter the group complied now look up and stare at the light again the group complied she said to sam to ruin their night visionsam smiled yet another reason why i love you through his binoculars he watched the big eyes on the roof until they were pointed to the southwest then strode forward knelt beside the light pole took a breath and slammed the edge of the machete into the power line there was a hissing pop and a shower of sparks sam jerked his hand back the light went darkremi asked are you all right yes but it got my attention okay lets go they separated walking clockwise and counterclockwise until they were facing the group walk toward us sam ordered blinking and shaking their heads against the sudden loss of their night vision yaotl and the others started forward with remi in the lead and sam walking backward his h ampk trained on the group they began moving toward the helicoptertwenty feet away remi told sam then ten feet sam stopped walking stop spread out he ordered to remi im doing preflight ive got them covered sam tossed their packs into the cabin then opened the pilots door and climbed inside using his penlight he scanned the controls and panels doing his best to ignore the eurocopters dizzying array of options and concentrate on the essentials after thirty seconds hed found what he needed he flipped on the battery switch the interior lamps and control panel glowed to life next he turned on the fuel pump followed by the auxiliary power switch which began the prestart of the turbine after a few seconds of whining the turbine kicked in and began to spool up the rotors begin turning slowly at first but with increasing velocity as the rotor rpm gauge began climbingsam leaned out the window and said to remi collect their guns remi passed the order on to the group and one at a time each man stepped forward and tossed his weapon into the helicopters cargo cabin using hand signals she backed them up until they were just outside the helicopters rotor radiusin the cockpit sam saw the rotor rpm hit a hundred percent time to say goodbye he shouted to remi gladly she yelled back and climbed aboard with one eye trained on the group she shoved the weapons into the safety webbing on the bulkhead grab ahold of something sam called she wrapped her free hand around the webbing done sam tested the helicopters cyclic control between his legs then the collective stick at his side gauging the blade pitch then finally the antitorque foot pedals until he had a feel for them he engaged the collective and slowly the helicopter lifted off he tested the cyclic moving the helicopter first left then right then nose up and downremi yelled sam weve got a problem what look right sam glanced out the side window it took a few moments for him to register what he was seeing yaotl and the others were scattering across the pad as a dark rectangular shape bumped over the pads rocklined perimeter and headed toward the helicopter it was the cushman sam caught a glimpse of rivera in the moons pale glow hunched over the wheelnap times over remi called i knew id forgotten something sam shouted the keys he returned his attention to the controls working the collective to gain altitude in his haste he jerked the cyclic to the right and pressed the rudder pedal the helicopter dipped right and the tail spun around he overcompensated the helicopter dropped straight down bounced off the pad rose again sam risked another glance out the side windowthe cushman was thirty feet away and closing fast to one side a figurenochtli it looked likedashed across the pad and threw himself into the cushmans cargo bed slow them down sam called aim for the engine bigger target in the back remi opened up with one of the aks firing controlled threeround bursts into the ground ahead of the cushman but got no result she switched targets bullets pounded into the carts front end sparking off the bumper guards and shredding the fiberglass steam gushed from the engine compartment the cushman stuttered and began slowing but not before it slid from view beneath the helicoptersam lifted the collective trying to gain altitude i cant see them anymore remi called sam glanced out one side window then the other where suddenly the helicopter lurched sideways and down the open side door facing the ground remis feet slid out from under her and she skidded toward the opening instinctively she released her grip on the ak to latch onto the safety harness the rifle slid down the deck bounced off the bells crate and disappeared out the door we lost an ak remi called a moment later a hand appeared in the opening clawing at the deck for a handhold nochtlis head rose into view and weve got a passenger remi shoutedsam glanced over his shoulder kick him what smash his fingers remi coiled her leg and lashed out slamming her heel into nochtlis pinkie finger he screamed but held on with a grunt he heaved his upper torso onto the deck and reached for the tiedown straps attached to the crate remi curled her leg for a second strike from below came three overlapping cracks bullets thunked into the cabins doorwaysam i hear it hold tight im going to try to shake him sam jerked the helicopter to the left and looked out both side windows trying to locate the source of the gunfire below and to the right rivera stood in the cargo bed of the cushman with remis fallen ak tucked into his shoulder the muzzle flashed orange sams passengersside cockpit window spiderwebbed he shifted the cyclic again continuing to slide the helicopter left toward the trees at the edge of the pad he pulled up on the collective to gain altitude in the cabin remi cocked her leg again and heelkicked nochtli in the thigh nochtli grunted and collapsed facefirst onto the deck shattering his nose with one hand still entwined in the safety webbing she reached over her head groping for one of the weapons sam looked left saw the dark outline of the treetops looming before the window a bullet tore through the passengerseat headrest zipped past sams chin and punched through the windshield he grunted and lifted the collective but it was too late tree limbs scraped the belly of the helicopter come on come on he grumbled remi can youlittle busy here a branch snagged on the helicopters tail boom and the craft spun clockwise like a top alarms began blaring in the cockpit red and orange lights flashed on the dashboard sam worked the cyclic and collective trying to compensate tree limbs slapped at the cockpit window remis hand touched the wooden butt of one of the aks she grabbed it pulled hard and it slid from the webbing it stopped she craned her neck back the aks front side was snagged on a strap in the doorway nochtli was pushing himself upright he hooked one of his knees over the edge of the doorway and began dragging himself toward remi her hand slipped off the aks butt her fingers touched something metallic tubulara pistol barrel she grabbed it jerked it free of the webbing nochtli latched his free hand onto her ankle remi set her teeth and swung the pistol in a backhand the butt caught nochtli on the side of the chin his head snapped sideways and his eyes rolled back in his head still kneeling he teetered for a moment then tipped backward and disappeared through the doorway she called to sam hes goneyou okay she gulped a few breaths and replied shaken and stirred but still here bullets peppered the fuselage sam saw an opening in the canopy and worked the cyclic and rudder pedals crabbing the nose around until it was pointed in the right direction then nosed down and lifted the collective with the shrieking of wood on aluminum the helicopter lurched forward and into the clear now he lowered the collective and dropped the helicopter below the tree line he stopped in a hover twenty feet above the slope looked around for the hvcp jingaro had mentioned and flipped it on the helicopter shuddered slightly slid sideways dipped then settled into a steady hover the alarms and the flashing lights stopped sam tentatively took his hands off the controls and exhaled heavily in the back remi scooted sideways and slid the door shut the thumping of the rotors fadedsam turned in his seat and extended his hand between the gap remi grabbed his hand and pulled herself toward him sam asked you okay yes you he nodded lets get out of here i think weve fully worn out our welcome chapter big sukuti island they had just cleared the islands southern coastline when sam realized riveras gunfire had caused more than cosmetic damage the rudder pedals felt spongy and the collective and cyclic were sluggish responding to his commands with a slight delaywhat do you think remi asked her face pressed between the seats hydraulics maybe he scanned the gauges looking for oil pressure temperature revolutions per minute engines running a little hot too and the oil pressure looks dodgywhats that mean nothing good how far to the beach three miles give or take we should assume rivera isnt giving up i agree whether they call someone and how fast they respond is the question or how fast they can get the rinkers working again true let me see if i can get her settled down carefully sam worked the controls dropping both altitude and speed until they were a hundred feet off the water and moving at sixty knotsroughly seventy miles per hour below them the sea was flat calm and black save the reflection of the helicopters navigation strobesremi said sam theyll be able to track the lights lights or no lights theyre tracking us through the big eyes once we cross the beach ill switch them off against the backdrop of the land well be invisible youre assuming theyll come after us have to he did a quick scan of the gauges the engine temperatures come down a little bit but the oil pressure is still hinky the controls are still soft hydraulics then at the very least any one of those can put us in the drink all we need is another four minutes or so and a noncrash landing remi added and that slowly through the windshield they could see africas east coast turn from a dark smudge to identifiable bits of landmass trees white sand beaches rolling hills and rivers and streams zigzagging across the terraina half mile from the beach sam felt the cyclic jerk in his hand followed by a thumpbang above their heads the cockpit and cabin began shaking an alarm shrieked yellow and red lights flashed thats a tad ominous remi said with a tight grin just a tad sam agreed grab ahold of something its going to get bumpy he lifted the collective and dropped the nose pushing the helicopter past eighty knots through the windshield he saw the shoals slip beneath the fuselage then the beach then the blackgreen of the forest he reached forward and flipped off the navigation strobestheres a big sandbar ahead on the riverbank he called think you can manage the bell define manage shove it out the door that i can do whats the plan i hover you the guns our packs and the bell get off on the sandbank and you im going to put down in the river what no sam you said it yourself theyre coming after us if we can ditch this thing theyll have nowhere to start looking can you do it if i can get the rotors shut down quickly enough more ifs remi replied im beginning to hate ifs thisll be the last one for a while uhhuh ive heard that before when youre on the ground find the thickest tree trunk around and get behind it if the rotors dont spool down enough before she flips over theyll tear free and turn into shrapnel flip over what do you mean helicopters are topheavy as soon as she touches the water shes going to roll i dont like this the sandbars coming up get ready youre infuriating you know that i know remi mumbled a half curse under her breath then turned around and released the tiedown ratchets around the crate she crabwalked around it braced her back against the bulkhead and her legs against the crate and shoved it across the deck until it bumped up against the doorready she called sam bled off airspeed and altitude until they were thirty feet off the sandbar and crawling ahead at fifteen knots the helicopter was wobbling now the earlier thumpbang had settled into an ominous threesecond cycle that shook the fuselage from stem to sternits getting worse remi said were almost there sam eased the helicopter downward a foot at a time check the distance he asked remi slid the cabin door halfway open and poked her head out twenty feet fifteen ten can you make that sam asked i may be well past my gymnastics days but i can still do ten feet blindfolded sam flipped on the hover coupler he took his hands off the controls the helicopter lurched sideways quivered dipped then steadied itself okay go sam called give me a wave when youre down and safe remi hunchwalked forward stuck her head between the seats kissed him said good luck then walked back and shoved the door the rest of the way open try to miss the skids sam said remi put her shoulder to the crate took a deep breath and shoved the crate tumbled through the opening and disappeared the guns went next remi gave sam a final glance and jumped out ten seconds later sam spotted her farther up the sandbar she gave him a thumbsup and dashed off into the darkness sam counted to sixty to give her time to find cover then grabbed the collective he disengaged the hover coupler and seized the cyclic he dipped the nose slightly and let the rotor blades pitch angle ease him across the sandbar and over the river when he reached a section that was both wide and deep enough for his purposes he pulled the nose up and worked the collective into a hover he took one final look around once the helicopter submerged the interior would be black with no visual reference points hed have to escape by feel alone he checked his seat belt to ensure he knew how to unhook it then studied the cabindoor latch then rehearsed his movements in his minds eye he lowered the collective ever so slightly and felt the helicopter drop he pressed his face against the door window the skids were about five feet off the water close enough any closer sam feared and hed have a zero margin for errorhere goes everything sam muttered he released the cyclic shut off the engines pulled the collective up to its stops to slow the blades and grabbed the collective again sam felt his belly shoot into his throat with a crash the helicopter struck the surface he was thrown forward against the restraints he felt the helicopter tipping right thought collective and he jerked the control to the left the effect was immediate with the blades already fully pitched the rotor assembly responded to sams command by angling to the left and shifting the helicopters center of gravity water rushed up the windshield horizontally at first then diagonally as the helicopter pitched sideways sam tucked his chin to his chest grasped the restraints with both hands and set his jawhe felt a boneshaking jolt white light burst behind his eyes then nothing he awoke coughing water filled his throat he jerked his head back sputtered again and forced his eyes open seeing only blackness he felt a moment of panic he squashed it forced himself to breathe he reached out fingers extended until he touched something solidthe tip of the cyclic gravity was pulling his head to the left the helicopter was lying on its side the river hadnt been deep enough for the helicopter to completely capsize that was the good news the bad news was that he could hear water gushing into the cabin behind him already the level had reached his facemove sam he muttered he extended his right arm up felt the upholstery of the passenger seat and kept groping until his fingers found the safety belt he latched on then dipped his left hand beneath the water and punched the release button on his restraints he fell sideways then brought his free hand up joined it with his left hand and chinned himself from the water until his knees reached the gap separating the cockpit from the cabin toes pointed he shoved his legs through the opening and stretched to his full length until his feet touched the cabins bulkhead he let go of the restraints and slid the rest of the way into the cabin now that he was standing hunched over the water was at his chest he extended his arms upward felt the cabin door and traced its outline with his fingertips water was spurting through the seams he found the latch tested it with slight downward pressure it seemed operabledeep breath sam told himself he sucked in a lungful of air shoved the latch down and slid the door open water crashed onto his head he stumbled backward and slid beneath the surface he let the wave shove him against the cabin wall using the momentum to coil his legs beneath him the pressure subsided he kicked off arms spread before him hands grasping at the doorframe and pushing feet kickinghis head broke the surface sam he heard remis voice he opened his eyes and turned in the water trying to get his bearings sam she called again he turned again saw her standing on the bank waving at him diles she yelled what crocodiles swim sam did just that pouring his last shred of energy into a sprint for the bank he touched sand shoved himself to his knees then to his feet then stumbled forward into remis arms together they slogged up the sand onto level ground before collapsingforgot about crocodiles sam said a couple minutes later me too i spotted them in the shallows about fifty yards upstream the commotion must have woken them up are you okay any broken bones dont think so howd i do remi pointed toward the middle of the river sam focused on the spot but it took several seconds for his eyes to adjust all that remained visible of the helicopter was a branchlike shard of rotor blade jutting a half foot above the surfacethe rest of the chunks went into the water just as i planned sam said with a weary smile planned hoped hows the bell aside from a few cracks in the wood the crates surprisingly intact i collected our packs and the guns lets find some cover in case we have visitors chapter wary of leaving telltale drag marks they chose to leave the crate where it sat unintentionally theyd dropped it in an ideal locationa dry rivulet near the riverbank they covered it with scrub brush and then using bundled foliage to obscure their tracks they backwalked off the sandbar to solid ground and into a copse a hundred feet inside the tree line they found a tenbytenfoot depression surrounded by fallen logs it gave them a vantage point of not only the crate but the open ground down to the beach after probing the area with the muzzles of the rifles to drive off any snakes or sundry creepy crawlies they settled into their bolthole while sam kept an eye out for visitors remi took inventory of their packs remind me to send a thankyou letter to ziploc she said most everything is dry the satellite phone looks okayhow much battery life enough for one call maybe two sam checked his watch it was just after two in the morning it might be time to take ed mitchell up on his offer remi fished mitchells card out of her pack and handed it over sam dialeda gravelly voiced mitchell picked up on the fourth ring yeah ed its sam fargo huh sam fargoyour mafia island charter a couple days ago oh yeah hey what the hell time is it about two i dont have much time we need an evac thats a word i aint heard in a while you in trouble you could say that where you at on the mainland about four and half miles due east of big sukuti sam replied then gave him a description of the area you guys get around mitchell said hang on a minute sam heard the sounds of paper crinkling then silence mitchell came back on the line you know youre sitting smackdab in the middle of crocodile hell dont you we do now cant get a fixed wing in there ill have to use a helo thatll take a little doing well make it worth your while i know you will but thats not my worry i probably wont get there until just after sunrise can you hang onwell have to sam said are folks going to be shooting at me when i get there no guarantees there was ten seconds of silence then mitchell chuckled ah what the hell lifes a daring adventure or nothing at all sam laughed at this it is indeed okay keep your heads down ill be there at first light just in case ive got some competition at the lz ill drop blue smoke so you dont shoot at me sam disconnected beside him remi said here drink sam turned took a deep gulp from the canteen then accepted a piece of beef jerky he recounted his conversation with mitchell remi said that mans on our permanent christmas list so hell be here in another four or five hourswith luck they sat in silence chewing for several minutes sam checked his watch its been forty minutes since we left the island you dont think they sam held up his hand remi went quiet after a few moments she said i hear them two of them somewhere offshore sam nodded hard to tell but it sounds like the rinkers wed better assume so how far inland are we a quarter mile maybe a little more they listened for a few more minutes the sound of the engines rose in volume then suddenly went silent theyre ashore sam said they checked their weapons two aks one with a full magazine the other missing the dozen or so rounds remi had fired at the cushman the magnum and the h ampk p whether these would be enough should a firefight erupt was an unknown theyd been lucky so far with rivera and his men but neither sam nor remi were under any illusion in a headtohead contest they had little chance of besting special forces soldierslets get comfortable sam said and invisible remi added after shoving their packs under a rotting log and covering them with loam they did the same for themselves lying lengthwise headtohead so that each of them could see the approaches from the beach sam handed remi a handful of mud to cover her face then smeared some on his ownpromise me something sam remi said slathering herself a suite at the moevenpick he guessed i was going to say a hot shower and a big breakfast but since you offered ive been composing a list peering through a gap between the logs remi spotted a speck of light a few hundred yards to the east she tapped sam on the shoulder mouthed flashlight and pointed the flashlight beam seemed to float through midair disappearing and reappearing through the trees as the owner picked his way inlandill say this much for rivera sam whispered hes like a dog with a bone hes probably said the same thing about us but in less congenial language are we waiting until we see the whites of their eyes no were crossing fingers they dont even wander this way why wouldnt they in africa darkness and forest equals predators i could have done without that tidbit sorry as if on cue somewhere in the distance they heard the deepthroated huffhuffhuff of a big cat it was a sound theyd both heard before but either on organized safaris or from the safety of a lodge here in the open and alone the sound was chillingsam whispered its a long way off soon a second flashlight joined the first then a third and a fourth the men were moving in a line abreast like flushers leading a hunting party soon the party was close enough that sam and remi could see the figures behind the flashlights not surprisingly each man appeared to be carrying an assault rifle another five minutes brought the group to the sandbar where they converged one of the menrivera perhapsappeared to do most of the talking gesturing first up and down the shoreline then inland they shined their flashlights along the bank and over the water twice the beams appeared to skim over the helicopter blade jutting from the water but it generated no response suddenly one of the men pointed across the river almost in unison each of the men unslung his riflethey spotted our fanged friends remi whispered weapons up and ready the group backed off the sandbar until they were on the scrub ground they conferred for another minute then separated one pair walking downriver the other upriver this was the pair sam and remi watched closely as the river abutted the copses northern edge the pairs path would take them within fifty feet of the hiding spotsam whispered i took a look as we flew in the nearest crossing is a mile downstream now well see how determined they are clearly wary of what other dangers the river might hold the two men kept a safe distance from shore walking from left to right across sam and remis field of vision until the river curved east and merged with the copse here they turned southeast shining their flashlights along the tree line as they walked now only twenty yards away their figures were more distinct one of them was more distinct than the other tall and gaunt he moved with the economical purposeful gait of a soldier it was itzli rivera suddenly sam felt clawed feet crawling over his ankle before he could resist the impulse he kicked his foot the unseen creature squealed and skittered off through the underbrush rivera stopped suddenly and held up a closed fist the soldiers universal hand signal for halt his partner stopped in his tracks and in unison they slowly dropped to one knee the flashlights were doused each mans head began rotating looking listening the flashlights popped back on again and began skimming over the trees pausing occasionally here and there rivera looked over his shoulder and gestured something to his partner together they stood up turned and began picking their way into the trees heading directly for sam and remis hiding spotsam felt remis hand on his shoulder he reached up gave it a reassuring squeeze rivera and his partner kept coming they were thirty feet away now twenty feet ten feet they stopped looked left and right and flashlight beams probed the gaps between the logs around sam and remi twigs cracked rivera whispered something to his partner sam and remi felt the log over their heads sink a couple inches the tips of a pair of boots appeared at the edge of the log and a flashlight beam swept over the depressionfive long seconds passed the flashlight clicked off the boots pulled back followed by a double thump as rivera dismounted the log slowly the footfalls faded sam counted to one hundred then slowly lifted his head until he could see through the gap silhouetted by the glow of their flashlights rivera and his partner were back at the tree line and moving south toward the sandbar sam watched them for another minute and turned his head so his mouth was closer to remis ear theyre moving off well stay put in case they double back for the next twenty minutes they remained still wedged as tightly as possible in their bolthole until finally they heard in the distance the rinkers engines growling back to lifesam whispered just a little longer he gave it another five minutes then rolled out from under the log im going to have a look around he crawled out of the depression and disappeared he returned ten minutes later theyre gone he helped remi out from her hiding spot she exhaled heavily that bell better be worth it another few hours and were home free ed mitchell was as good as his word if not a little better just as the sun was peeking through the forest to the east they heard the thump of helicopter rotors as a precaution sam and remi scrambled back into their boltholes occasionally peeking out as the rotors grew louder to the west they saw a yellowandwhite bell helicopter sweep in over the beach and turn inland following the course of the river when the helicopter reached the sandbar the pilots door opened a moment later blue smoke began drifting over the groundsam and remi rolled out together and stood up sam asked ready for home remi shook her head and he chuckled right sorry hot shower and breakfast an hour later with the crate strapped safely to the bells deck they touched down at the ras kutani airstrip while mitchell trotted off to collect his vehicle for the ride back to dar es salaam sam and remi used the sat phone to place a longoverdue call to selmawhere have you been their chief researcher said over the speaker ive been sitting by the phone is that your way of saying you were worried about us remi asked yes it is now explain yourselves sam briefly recounted the last few days ending with their recovery of the bell selma sighed i wish i could say positively you havent wasted your time what do you mean sam asked we got the first shipment from mortons museum yesterday in with the miscellanea we found what looks like a journal of sortsblaylocks journal to be exact thats good news remi said then added tentatively right it would be selma replied if not for the fact that im pretty sure winston lloyd blaylock the mbogo of bagamoyo was certifiably insane chapter goldfish point la jolla california exhausted and wanting to hit the ground running when they got home sam and remi spent the majority of the flights home sleeping and eating and generally trying to keep their minds off selmas proclamation regarding winston blaylock their chief researcher wasnt prone to hyperbole so they took seriously her suspicion which if true cast a pall on their efforts to recover the shenandoahs bell of course while the bell was of significant historical value regardless the cryptic inscription on the bells inner surface and blaylocks obsession with the ship either under the guise of the ophelia the shenandoah or the el majidi had suggested to them a deeper mysteryone that had apparently prompted itzli rivera and perhaps someone in the mexican government to murder nine touristsas promised pete jeffcoat and wendy corden were waiting for them in the baggage claim area pete took their carryons you look tired you should have seen us eighteen hours and a couple dozen time zones ago sam replied what happened to you wendy asked gesturing to sams swollen cheekbone and his taped finger while the latter was now properly bandaged with medical tape the cut on his cheekbone was crusty with super gluea remedy ed mitchell swore was better than stitchesi burned a casserole and remi got mad sam said he got a light punch on the arm from his wife in return remi said to wendy boys being boys thats what happened were glad youre home pete said selmas been pulling her hair out dont tell her i told you the baggage carousel started turning and pete wandered off to collect sam and remis luggage sam asked wendy any word on the bell its en route should be halfway across the atlantic by now with luck well have it the day after tomorrow care to give us a hint why selma thinks blaylock is a fruitcake wendy shook her head shes been up for almost three days straight trying to piece this together im going to let her explain sam and remis home and base of operations was a fourstory twelvethousandsquarefoot spanishstyle home with an open floor plan vaulted maplebeamed ceilings and windows and skylights enough that they bought their windex in tengallon buckets the upper floor held sam and remis master suite and below this one flight down were four guest suites a living room a dining room and a kitchengreat room that jutted over the cliff on the second floor was a gymnasium containing both aerobic and circuit training exercise equipment a steam room a hydroworx endless lap pool a climbing wall and a thousand square feet of hardwood floor space for remi to practice her fencing and sam his judo the ground floor sported two thousand square feet of office space for sam and remi and an adjoining workspace for selma complete with three mac pro workstations coupled with thirtyinch cinema displays and a pair of wallmounted thirtytwoinch lcd televisions on the east wall was selmas pride and joy a fourteenfoot fivehundredgallon saltwater aquarium filled with a rainbowhued assortment of fish whose scientific names she knew by heart selmas other love tea she approached with equal passion an entire cabinet of the workroom was devoted to her stock which included a rare phoobseringosmanthus darjeeling hybrid that sam and remi suspected was the source of her seemingly boundless energy in appearance selma wondrash was eclectic in the extreme she wore a modified s bob hornrimmed glasses complete with a neck chain and a default uniform of khaki pants sneakers and a tiedyed tshirtas far as sam and remi were concerned selma could be as strange as she wished there was no one better at logistics research and resource scrounging sam and remi walked into the workspace to find selma leaning over the tank writing something on a clipboard she turned saw them held up a finger then finished writing and set aside the clipboard my centropyge loricula is looking sickly she said then translated flame angelfishthats one of my favorites remi said selma nodded solemnly so welcome home mr and mrs fargo sam and remi had long ago given up trying to convince selma to call them by their first names good to be home sam replied selma walked to the long mapletopped workbench that ran down the center of the room and sat down sam and remi took the stools opposite her blaylocks massive walking staff was lying lengthwise on the tableyou look well selma said pete and wendy disagreed i was comparing your current condition to how i imagined you over the past few days everything is relative true enough remi said selma are you stalling selma pursed her lips im not fond of handing you incomplete information sam replied what you call incomplete we call mysterious and we love a good mystery then youre going to love what i have for you first a little background with pete and wendys help i dissected indexed and footnoted mortons biography of blaylock its on our server in pdf format if you want to read it later but heres the condensed version selma opened a manila folder and began reading blaylock arrived in bagamoyo in march with nothing but the clothes on his back a few pieces of silver a caliber henry rifle a bowie knife big enough to chop down a baobab tree stuck in his boot and a short sword strapped to his hipclearly morton had a creative streak remi said she looked to sam do you remember the story we read about the murdered british tourist sylvie radford sam finished remember what she found while diving sam smiled a sword its a long long shot but maybe what she found had once belonged to blaylock selma can you their chief researcher was already jotting a note ill see what i can find out a short sword and a bowie knife could easily be confused maybe morton got it wrong sorry selma keep going evidently blaylock terrified the locals not only was he a foot taller and wider than almost everyone he wasnt prone to smiling on his first night in bagamoyo half a dozen thugs got together and decided to separate blaylock and his money two of them died and the rest required medical attentionhe shot them sam said no he never picked up his henry the bowie or the sword he fought with his bare hands after that no one bothered him which was probably the point sam replied doing that to six men while unarmed tends to create an impression indeed within a week he was serving as a bodyguard for a rich irishman on safari within a month hed started his own guide business as good as he was with his hands he was even better with the henry where other european guides and hunters were using bigbore hunting rifles blaylock could take down a charging cape buffaloa mbogowith one shot from his henry about two months after blaylock arrived he contracted malaria and spent six weeks on his back near death while his two mistressesmaasai women who worked in bagamoyonursed him back to health while morton never came out and said as much blaylocks brush with death seemed to have left him slightly touched in the head after the malaria blaylock would disappear for months on end on what he called vision quest expeditions he lived with the maasai took concubines studied with witch doctors lived alone in the bush hunted for king solomons mines and timbuktu dug fossils in olduvai gorge followed the trail of mansa musa hoping to find his staff of gold theres even an anecdote that claims blaylock was the one who found david livingstone first according to mortons account blaylock sent a runner to bagamoyo to alert henry morton stanley shortly after that the pair had their famous dr livingstone i presume moment near lake tanganyikaso if were to believe morton remi said winston lloyd blaylock was the indiana jones of the nineteenth century sam smiled hunter explorer hero mystic casanova and indestructible savior all rolled into one but this is all from mortons biography right right by the way were assuming morton was named after the mortonas in henry morton stanley right again in fact according to the family tree in the back of the book all of blaylocks direct descendants were named after africa in some fashionthe places the history the largerthanlife characters if you got all this from the biography what about the journal you mentioned asked sam i used the word journal for lack of a better term in fact its a potpourri diary field sketchbook can we see it if youd like its in the vault off the workspace selma had a temperature and humiditycontrolled archive area its in bad shapeinsecteaten soiled waterdamaged pages stuck together pete and wendy are working on the restoration were photographing and digitizing what pages we can before we start work on the damaged portions theres one more thing it appears the journal also served as blaylocks captains logpardon me remi said while he never mentions the shenandoah or the el majidi many of his entries clearly indicate he was at sea on and off for long periods blaylock does however mention ophelia quite oftenin what context she was his wife that would explain his obsession i suppose sam said not only did he mentally rename the shenandoah he also carved ophelias name into the bellophelia is a distinctly unafrican name remi said it had to be the name of his wife back in the us selma nodded theres no mention of her in the biography and he never speaks in detail about her in the journaljust little snippets everywhere whether he was simply yearning for her or its something more i dont know but she was never far from his mindare there dates in the journal asked sam anything we can crossreference with mortons biography in both books only months and years are used in the journal those are far and few between were trying to do some matching but its turning up discrepancies for example we found a time where in the biography hes trekking in the congo while according to the journal hes at sea its slow going so farsomething doesnt add up said sam just one thing remi replied my list is longer than that mine too but on the captains log angle if were thinking blaylock might have been at sea aboard the shenandoahel majidi i meanthen weve got a contradiction by all accounts after the sultan of zanzibar bought the shenandoah in he all but abandoned her at anchor until she was destroyed either in or i think someone would have noticed her missing good point selma said jotting down a note another point of curiosity sultan majid died in october and was succeeded by his brother and bitter rival sayyid barghash bin said by default he became the owner of el majidi some historians find it curious that sayyid didnt change the ships name let alone keep it aroundsam added can we put together a time line of the shenandoah el majidi be easier to visualize the events selma picked up the phone and dialed the archive room wendy can you throw together a rough time line of the shenandoah el majidi thankswe also need to find out more about blaylocks life before africa remi said im working on that as well said selma i reached out to an old friend who might be able to help wendy stepped out of the archive room smiled at them held up a just one second finger then sat down at one of the workstations she tapped away at the keys for five minutes and said on your screenselma used the remote control to find the new graphic march shenandoah sold to sultan of zanzibar november shenandoah arrives zanzibar renamed el majidi november october el majidi spends most time sitting at anchor or on occasional merchant voyages october first sultan dies brothers reign begins october april el majidi presumed at anchor april hurricane damages el majidi sent to bombay for repair july el majidi reportedly sinks en route to zanzibar july november six years lost time disposition unknown november en route to bombay el majidi reportedly sinks near island of socotra sam said weve got two seemingly reliable accounts of her sinking that contradict each other and over six years where the el majidi is unaccounted forselma whats the earliest date in blaylocks journal as best we can tell august about five months after he arrived in africa on our time line thats a month after the el majidis first reported sinking and at the beginning of her lost yearssix years remi echoed where was she all that time mexico city mexico fifteen hundred miles to the south itzli rivera sat in president garzas anteroom waiting to be summoned as he had been for the past hour garzas executive assistant a doeeyed girl in her early twenties with glossy black hair and an hourglass figure sat at her desk typing her index fingers wandering over the keyboard and occasionally punching a key her expression was one of puzzlement as though shes trying to finish a masterlevel sudoku puzzle rivera thought clearly the womans administrative skills had not been a priority during the hiring process hoping to kill some time rivera wondered if garza had ordered the woman to take a mexica name if so what would it be as if on cue president garzas voice came over the intercom on the womans desk answering riveras questionchalchiuitl you may send mr rivera in yes sir she smiled at rivera and gestured toward the door with one of her ridiculously long fingernails you may i heard him thank you rivera walked across the carpet pushed through the double doors and closed them behind him he strode to garzas desk and stopped at semiattention sit down garza ordered rivera did i was reading your report garza said do you have anything to add no sir let me summarize if you dont mind go ahead sir that was rhetorical itzli you and your men after being outwitted for days by these treasure hunters these fargos you finally manage to take possession of the bell and transport it to okafors island only to have it stolen out from under your noses rivera noddednot only did they steal back the bell but they also stole okafors fourmilliondollar helicopter and i lost a man nochtli fell from the helicopter and broke his neck president garza waved his hand dismissively you were vague about how the fargos managed to get aboard the helicopter at all can you elaborate where were you when all this was happeningrivera cleared his mouth and shifted nervously in his seat i was unconscious pardon me the man sam fargo attacked me aboard okafors yacht he surprised me he clearly has some martial arts training clearly garza rotated his chair and gazed out the window he drummed his fingers on his desk blotter for a minute then said we have to assume theyre not going to give up that could work in our favor if theyre as clever as they seem we know theyll be visiting at least one of the areas weve already searchedagreed start reaching out to your contactsimmigration officers airport employees anyone who will alert us when the fargos appear yes sir ill start with antananarivo anything else garza stared hard at his underling you mean are there going to be any repercussions for your failure yes sir garza chuckled humorlessly what are you expecting itzli something from the movies perhaps for me to pull out a pearlhandled revolver and shoot you or open a trapdoor beneath yourivera let himself smile garzas expression went cold for now youre still the best man for the job the best i have in fact now i want you to prove that my faith isnt wasted ideally that would involve sam and remi fargo ending up deadyes mr president thank you one more thing before you go i want to make memorial arrangements for nochtli rivera said yes sir i no no for the other oneyaotl it seems he and his wife died in a car accident this morning rivera felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up what sad isnt it he lost control and drove his car off a cliff they were both killed instantly they had a child a fiveyearold garza pursed his lips as though weighing the question oh the girl shes fine she was at school at the time i suppose well have to find her new home youll see to that as wellyes mr president chapter library of congress washington dc their first lead into winston blaylocks life prior to his arrival in africa came in the form of an old friend of selmas julianne severson whod taken over the library of congresss special collections division after selmas departure severson met sam and remi at the second street researchers entrance of the jefferson building the other two buildings that made up the librarys campus the adams and the madison sat a block to the east and the south respectivelyafter shaking hands severson said its a pleasure having you mr and mrs fargo sam and remi said remi wonderful im julianne ive been a fan of yours for quite some time you probably dont realize this but your adventures spark a lot of interest in history particularly among childrenthank you julianne sam replied she handed them a pair of laminated badges attached to neck lanyards reader identification cards she explained with a shrug and a smile all part of the csp collections security program ever since nineeleven the protocols are much more strictwe understand if youll follow me they started walking ill be helping you personally while youre here thats kind of you remi said but we dont want to take up your time nonsense the library runs smoothly on its own my assistant will handle anything that comes up severson turned up a marble stairway and sam and remi followed how much do you know about the libraryweve visited several times but never as researchers believe it or not remi replied the tour alone was a breathtaking experience sam and remi knew the oldest federal institution in the country the library of congress was founded in and located in the capitol building until when british troops lit the building on fire and destroyed the librarys core collection of three thousand volumes a year later congress voted to reestablish the loc and purchased thomas jeffersons personal library of some six thousand books the librarys collection had since grown significantly books and printed materials recordings photographs maps pieces of sheet music and manuscriptsin all representing almost languagessome items altogether on miles of bookshelvesit almost seems more a cathedral than a library remi said the architecture is aweinspiring severson finished exactly the marble floors and columns the arches the vaulted ceilings the artwork severson smiled i think selma once referred to this place as part cathedral part museum part gallery with a little bit of library thrown in for good measure i suspect grandeur was foremost on the congresss collective mind in after the british sacked everything i imagine there was a well show them mentality during the reconstructionbigger better more ostentatious architectural nosethumbing if you will remi said severson laughed are we going to the main reading room sam asked no were going to the second floorrare book and special collections the main room is hosting a tour for local elementary schools its going to be a bit wild in there today they reached a door numbered and walked through if you want to take a seat at the worktable ill man the workstation while our catalogue has gotten more userfriendly over the years it might be easier if i do the legwork okay selma emailed me some of the documents and gave me a little bit of background winston lloyd blaylock wife named ophelia believed to be in the united states prior to march anything elsewe have a rough physical description said remi everything helps six feet four inches tall around two hundred fifty pounds probably also he carried a caliber henry rifle sam added as i understand it those werent very common certainly not as common as winchesters remingtons or springfields the henry wasnt standardissue during the civil war but many union soldiers used their own money to buy one the government did however issue them to scouts raiding parties and special forces units the confederate soldiers hated the henry it could hold sixteen rounds and a trained soldier could fire off twentyeight in a minute back then that was as close to a handcarried machine gun as you could get do we know if blaylock was adept with itaccording to our source he was a crack shot severson nodded she started typing and for the next five minutes there was silence save for the clacking of the keyboards keys and the murmur of fascinating or interesting from severson finally she looked up i have a service record here a microfiche copy from the national archives two sources actually the cmsr or compiled military service record and publications m and m which are the service of military units in volunteer union organizations for both the union and the confederacyany mention of blaylock ive got fiftynine entries in fact since blaylock carried a henry rifle lets start with the union list first severson started typing again the problem is many of the abstract entries list only the first name middle initial and last name ive got several w blaylocks and two w l blaylocks the first one has an attachment a medical record did your blaylock have any woundsnot that we know of smiling severson tapped the screen clearly excited by what shed found right leg amputated at field hospital during the battle of antietam guess that rules him out huh oh sorry that sounded morbid didnt itits okay sam said you and selma share the same love of research were used to it okay heres the other entry well this is interesting this blaylock was detached from the union army in september but theres no reason listed he wasnt transferred or wounded just detachedwhat does that mean remi asked im not sure let me see if i can find more than an abstract on him fifteen minutes later severson again looked up from her workstation got it a full service record this might be your man william lynd blaylock thats close sam said conspicuously close his physical description is close as well six feet four inches two hundred ten pounds it wouldnt be hard to gain thirty or forty pounds after leaving the army remi observed severson was frowning parts of the record are missing ive got early details of his training and unit assignments promotions campaigns he was involved in evaluations but after his assignments are all listed as supplementary servicethat sounds very james bondish said remi youre not far off severson replied when it comes to civil warera records the term supplementary service is usually associated with guerrilla unitswhat wed call special forces todaysam said like loudoun rangers quantrills raiders the kansas jayhawkers severson nodded right combine that with this blaylocks mysterious detachment from the union army in and i think youre looking at a soldier turned spy the afternoon wore on as severson sat at her workstation typing jotting notes and occasionally sharing her progress with sam and remi at four pm severson stopped and looked at her watch oh my time flies its almost closing time theres no reason you should have to sit here for this why dont you go back to your hotel and have dinner ill call you if i find anything correction when i find somethingplease julianne you go home as well remi said im sure you have other plans nope my roommate will feed my cat and ill grab dinner here sam said we cant are you kidding this is like going to disney world for me that sounds familiar remi said with a smile are you sure you and selma arent related were part of a secret society librariansinarms severson replied you two go and let me do my thing ill be in touch as they did every time they stayed or passed through washington sam and remi had booked the robert mills suite at the hotel monaco twenty minutes after leaving the library of congress their taxi slowed before the monacos redawningcovered steps the doorman had the door open a moment after the car stopped rolling sam and remi got out the monaco once the us general post office building and now a registered national historic landmark is located in washingtons nineteenthcentury neighborhood known as penn quarter within walking distance of the mall the smithsonian american art museum the j edgar hoover building the us navy memorial and fivestar restaurants enough to keep a gourmand enraptured for years welcome mr and mrs fargo the doorman said he walked to the rear of the cab and collected their luggage from the trunk ill have your bags brought up immediately if youd like to step inside i believe youll find the concierge is expecting you ten minutes later they were in their suite still fatigued from their african odyssey they took an hourlong nap then showered dressed for dinner and walked down to the street they found the monacos restaurant the poste moderne brasserie around the corner on eighth street through a carriageway portal set into the building after a glance at the wine list and menu they settled on a bottle of domaine de la quilla muscadeta zesty crisp wine from the loire valleyarugula salad with basil mint and parmesan and steamed bouchot mussels in white wine saffron mustard and garlic confit as was visiting the monaco itself the choice of fare was something of a tradition for the couple remi took a sip of wine she closed her eyes and let out a sigh i have a confession sam i love adventure as much as the next gal but theres something to be said for good food and a warm bed with clean sheetsyoull get no argument from me remis iphone chimed she checked the screen then set it aside selma she found another aztec symbol in blaylocks journal before leaving for washington theyd asked her to focus her search on anything that remotely resembled the miquiztli glyph for selmas reference remi had downloaded from the internet a highresolution image of the twentyfourton aztec calendar the sun stone on display in mexico citys national museum of anthropologythat makes four symbols so far remi said any discernible pattern any annotations near the symbols none shes says theyre isolated at some point youre going to have to give me a primer on all things aztec ill see what i can do there arent many ancient peoples with a more complex history and culture even after a full semester of it i felt like id barely scratched the surface every symbol has multiple meanings and every god multiple identities it doesnt help that most of the historical accounts are biased toward the spanishvictors write the history sam said sadly true sam took a sip of wine it seems a safe bet that rivera and whoever hes working for share an obsession with blaylockeven separated by a hundred forty years dont ask me how though the aztec angle cant be a coincidence or are we too close to the foresti dont think so sam its the one common denominator that links blaylock the ship the bell and rivera the question is where do the middle two fit into it the waiter appeared with their salads sam said we still dont know how rivera got interested in the shenandoah in the first place hell we dont even know if it is the shenandoah aside from ophelia which is blaylocks own invention the ship had two other names the sea king and el majidi were not only dealing with what but also when what if they stumbled onto something to do with blaylockanother journal or some letters for example worse still what if selmas right and blaylocks bout with malaria left him insane and the doodling in his journal is pure fantasyin other words sam said we could all be on a wildgoose chase after dinner they shared a wedge of strawberryrhubarb pudding cake and finished with two cups of decaf ethiopian coffee they were back in their room shortly before nine the message light on the telephone was blinking remi said i knew i forgot something i didnt give julianne our cell phone numbers sam dialed into the hotels voicemail system and turned on the speaker sam remi this is julianne its about eightthirty im going to go work from home but ill be back at the library by six tomorrow morning come by around eight i think ive found something chapter library of congress they arrived at the researchers entrance at seven fortyfive and were met by a security guard who checked their credentials then escorted them to the special collections room on the second floor they pushed through the door and found julianne severson sitting at her workstation head resting on the desktop she was wearing the same clothes as the day beforeas the door clicked shut she jerked upright and looked around she saw them blinked rapidly a few times then smiled morning remi said oh julianne please dont tell us you never went home i almost did i meant to really but i was following a thread that turned into another and another you know how it goes we do sam replied if it helps we brought a venti starbucks dark roast and bagels and cream cheese he held up the box seversons eyes widened after gulping down half the coffee and most of a bagel severson wiped her lips ran her fingers through her hair and joined sam and remi at the worktable better she said thanks beside her was a manila folder stuffed with printouts and a yellow legal pad covered in notesbefore were done here ill of course print out all the reference material ive found so right now ill just give you the highlights the good news is everything i found had long ago been declassified and is now open source i spent the night connecting dots using private archives university collections war and navy department documents secret service records nonfiction books and periodicals you name it i checked ityouve got our full attention sam said first let me show you a picture of my blaylock tell me if it matches yours she pulled a photo from the folder at her elbow and slid it across the table on her iphone remi pulled up a scanned version of the blaylock photo theyd found in the bagamoyo museum seversons version showed a tall broadshouldered man in his late teens or early twenties wearing a union army officers uniform sam and remi compared the photossam said thats him in ours hes older a little grayer and weathered but its the same man severson nodded and took back the photo the man you know as winston lloyd blaylock was in fact named william lynd blaylock born in boston in graduated from harvard two years early at the age of nineteen with a degree in mathematicsspecifically topologywhich is remi asked sam replied its spatial mathematicscurved surfaces deformed areas the mobius strip is a good example then its no surprise blaylock had a thing for the fibonacci spiral sorry julianne go on a month after he graduated he was hired by the war department as a cryptologist remi predicted right by all accounts blaylock was a genius a prodigy sam and remi looked at each other given the references to the fibonacci sequence and the golden spiral theyd found in blaylocks journal theyd wondered if there were more to the journal than met the eye namely hidden messages or codes over the years they had learned many things about those who hide and hunt treasure but one lesson stood above all people will go to extraordinary lengths to keep their obsession from prying eyes if this were true in blaylocks case he would likely use the method he knew bestmathematics and topology severson continued a few days after fort sumter was attacked in april blaylock quit his job and joined the union army after initial training he emerged as a second lieutenant and was immediately thrown into the fray fighting throughout july and august in several battles rich mountain carricks ford first bull run apparently he proved himself much more than your average math nerd he was promoted to first lieutenant and acquired a chestful of medals for gallantry the following spring in he was transferred to the loudoun rangers and served under samuel means who was in turn under the direct aegis of secretary of war edwin stanton sam as you already mentioned the loudoun rangers were the equivalent of a modernday special forces they worked in a small unit behind enemy lines living off the land conducting raids sabotage missions and intelligence gathering they were a tough bunch shortly before the rangers were absorbed into a regular army unit in secretary stanton tapped blaylock and a few others for recruitment into the secret service a few months after that blaylock surfaced in liverpool england under the name winston lloyd babcock where he worked undercover for a man named thomas haines dudleysam said lincolns spymaster you know him severson asked ive read a few books where hes featured he was quaker as i recall us consul in liverpool he ran the secret service spy network in the uk severson added he had almost a hundred agents all of whom were dedicated to stopping the covert flow of supplies from great britain to the confederacy while england was officially neutral during the war there were a great many southern sympathizers both in and out of the government care to guess what blaylocks primary assignment wasremi answered both she and sam had been reading between the lines the reflagging of merchant ships for confederate navy use she said right again replied severson specifically blaylock ran a cell that was focused on a ship called the sea kinglater known as the css shenandoahthe one that got away sam said not only that but got away and spent the next nine months wreaking havoc with union shipping until after the end of the war severson continued for blaylock it was a personal and professional disaster professionally sam repeated was he reprimanded relieved of duty i found no evidence of that in fact quite the opposite thomas haines dudley was an avid supporter of blaylocks he wrote several glowing evaluations of him in an letter to the chief of the secret service william wood he called blaylock one of the finest agents i have had the pleasure to have in my employ i suspect blaylock simply took the failure so personally that it impacted his work two weeks later he boarded a ship in london for the return voyage home when he got there he discovered that his wife ophelia had died while he was in transit in a bit of tragic irony shed been killed during a raid by a confederate guerrilla band known as mosbys rangersone of the very units blaylock had fought against during his time in the loudoun rangersmy god remi whispered that poor man do we know whether ophelia had been the target did mosby and his men seek her out because of her husband it doesnt appear so by all accounts she was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time so not only did blaylock come home in disgrace but he came home to find the love of his life snuffed out sam said remi im starting to think the malaria was only part of his mental problemsi agree its understandable as is his obsessive personality severson added selma emailed me the ship sketch he did to rename a ship after a woman thats true love remi asked julianne did they have children no what happened after he got home theres not much to tell i found only one record of him in he was hired by a newly founded school called the massachusetts institute of technology it appears blaylock settled back into civilian life as a math teacheruntil march when he resurfaced in bagamoyo and four years after the shenandoah was sold to the sultan of zanzibar remi said then added wryly a mother of all coincidences unless blaylocks grief had turned to rage the shenandoah got away on his watch and his wife died in the process if he was actually insane he may have somehow come to blame the shenandoah for his loss its a stretch but the human mind is a mysterious thing you may be right only blaylock could answer that severson said but i can tell you this much i dont think he went to africa on a whim i think he was sent thereby whom sam asked secretary of war william belknap remi and sam were silent for several seconds as they absorbed this information finally sam said how do you know this i dont know with certainty severson replied at this point my case is circumstantial and based on private letters between belknap secretary of the navy george robeson and the director of the secret service herman whitley in a november letter to both belknap and robeson whitley cites a recently received intelligence report he doesnt mention the source but there were three lines that jumped out at me first intelligence reports that suggest apostles of captain jim following in his footsteps second our man in zanzibar playing us for the fool and third i have it on good authority the anchorage in question is frequently emptyremi said our man in zanzibar could be sultan majid ii and captain jim could be the shenandoahs captain james waddell replied sam whitleys choice of language is interesting apostles a man like him wouldnt have risen to his position without a firm grasp of language an apostle is a firm believer someone dedicated to following a leaders example as for the empty anchorage that could refer to where the sultan had supposedly abandoned the newly renamed el majidi said remii agree theres more severson replied in a letter that followed a few days later both belknap and robeson encouraged whitley to contact our quaker friendthomas haines dudley im guessingand ask if he might have any agents that could investigate the vessel in question six weeks later whitley replied according to the quakers sources the vessel in question was spotted but not at its anchorage it was in dar es salaam returning to portand i quotefullyrigged for sail steam and cannon and crewed by skilled sailors of caucasian descent sam and remi were silent for ten seconds finally sam said unless im seeing something thats not there id say captain waddells apostles remanned the shenandoah for war the best parts yet to come severson said in that same letter whitley informs belknap and robeson that hes ordered the quakerdudleyto dispatch his best man to investigate the situation in dar es salaamand we know who dudley considered his best agentblaylock who arrives in bagamoyo a couple months later remi added it seems to fit but you said it yourself julianne its all circumstantial at this point i havent finished cataloging all the letters but in the interim i think i know someone who can help how do you two feel about a trip down to georgia chapter savannah georgia after listening to the remainder of julianne seversons presentation and her hunch about where they might unravel the next portion of blaylocks story sam and remi booked an earlyafternoon flight out of dulles they touched down in savannah shortly before threewhile sam stood at the hertz counter and made arrangements for a car remi checked her voice mail car keys in hand sam walked up to her selma got the bell this morning remi announced sam smiled and let out an exaggerated sigh i have to admit after all we went through to get that thing i had visions of it falling off the plane and dropping into the oceanme too she says its in great condition she called dobo hes coming to pick it up alexandru dobowho preferred to be addressed only by his last namewas a fulltime surferbeach bum parttime restoration expert and their goto guy for projects beyond their expertise as the former curator of romanias ovidius universitys architecture restoration and conservation department and the primary consultant for constantas romanian navy museum and the national history and archaeology museum dobo had yet to encounter an artifact he couldnt restoreas selma was herself from romanias nextdoor neighbor hungary she and dobo liked to both reminisce and quarrel about the old country she said hes going to work on it throughout the night remi added what the surfs bad terrible howre they doing on the journal all she said was still working in selmaspeak that meant slow but steady progress that could be imperiled by any further questions she also mentioned the spiral and the fibonacci sequence theyre finding both of them repeated everywhere like a mantra what an interesting man blaylock sam jingled the keys and said lets get moving what did you get cadillac escalade sam hybrid okay for sam and remi savannah epitomized southern charm and historyit was in every turn of her shaded oak and spanish moss lined streets in her cherry blossomfilled squares and around her welltended monuments dripping from balconies and stone walls in the form of hydrangea and honeysuckle and in the facades of the pillared greek revival plantation houses and the sprawling neoclassical estates even the buzz of cicadas was part of savannahs charm in fact it was their love of savannah that led them to accept seversons travel suggestion without question when pushed for a hint the librarian had merely smiled and said i think youll find something familiar there despite the heat they kept the escalades tinted windows rolled down so they could admire the scenery with one hand on her fluttering beach hat remi asked where exactly are we goingwhitaker street near forsyth park very close to the heyward house i think the former summer house of a onetime plantation owner and one of the signatories of the declaration of independence heyward house was just one of the many landmarks in the citys blufftons national register historic district a stroll in bluffton was a stroll through history they parked on the east side of forsyth park under a sprawling oak and walked a block south to a taupecolored house with mint green shutters sam checked the address against the one severson had given themthis is it a handpainted sign above the porch steps said in flowing cursive miss cynthias museum and gallery as they mounted the steps a bony whitemuzzled coonhound lifted its head from the mat on which it was lying let out a single howl then put its head back down and went back to sleep the front door opened revealing a wizened woman in a white skirt and pink blouse standing behind the screen door afternoon folks she said in a melodic georgia drawlgood afternoon remi replied bubba is my doorbell you see hes good at it said sam oh yes he takes his job very seriously please come in she unlatched the screen door and pushed it open a few inches sam opened it the rest of the way then followed remi through im miss cynthia the woman said and extended her hand remi fargo yes and you would be mr sam fargo yes maam how did you julianne told me to expect you and i dont get many visitors you see so it was a safe guess please come in im making tea in an unsteady yet strangely elegant shuffle she led them into what sam and remi could describe as a parlor the heavy ornate furniture lace curtains and velvetcovered settees and chairs could have been taken straight from the set of gone with the wind sam asked miss cynthia how do you and julianne know each other i try to make it up to washington once a year i love its history i met miss julianne about five years ago during a tour i guess she found my pestering questions endearing so we stayed in touch whenever i find a new piece i cant identify i call her for help shes been here to visit excuse me while i check on our tea she disappeared through another door and returned two minutes later its steeping while were waiting let me show you what you came to seeshe led them back out of the parlor across the foyer down a short hall and through a door into a spacious sunlit room painted snow white welcome to miss cynthias museum and gallery she said much like in mortons museum and curiosity shop in bagamoyo miss cynthia had assembled a plethora of artifactsthese all related to the civil warfrom musket balls and rifles to uniform patches and daguerreotypes i collected all of this with my own hands miss cynthia said proudly on battlefield sites garage and estate sales youd be surprised what you find if you know what youre looking for oh my that sounded very wise didnt itsam and remi laughed remi said it did indeed those bits come to you now and again as you age well you can look around at your leisure later but let me show you this miss cynthia walked to the rooms northern wall which was packed from floor to ceiling with framed photographs and sketches she stood before it lips pursed as she scanned her eyes back and forth ah there you areshe hobbled to the corner reached up and took down a blackframed fourbysixinch image she shuffled back and handed it to sam a grainy daguerreotype showed a threemasted wooden ship sitting at anchor my god remi breathed its her remi look at this sam brought the picture closer to their faces in the photos lower righthand corner etched in faded ink was a single word ophelia five minutes later in the parlor teacups in hand they were still staring dumbfounded at the photograph sam said how did you where that julianne has quite a memoryeidetic i think its called photographic memory yes she spent hours in my museum this morning she sent me a pencil sketch through the email whatsahoozit and asked me to compare it to mine i assume the sketch was yourssomething tells us its more yours than ours remi replied miss cynthia smiled waved her hand i told julianne the two could be twins despite the difference in media the same right down to the inscription ophelia yes sadly we never knew much about her pardon me said sam my apologies im getting ahead of myself you see william lynd blaylock was my greatgreatgreatim not sure how many greats but he was my uncle miss cynthia smiled sweetly and took a sip of tea sam and remi exchanged glances remi pursed her lips thinking then said youre a blaylock oh no no im an ashworth so was ophelia until she married william after aunt ophelia was killed my greatgreatmy grandmother constance stayed in touch with william it was never more than a friendship of course but i imagine there was some fondness there he wrote her often starting a few months after he got back from england and all the way until the end around i thinkthe end sam repeated you mean his death oh i dont know in fact no one knows what became of him im simply talking about the last letter he sent grandmother constance miss cynthias eyes brightened goodness there are dozens of them with the most wonderful postmarks and stamps from all over he was quite the character always on some kind of adventure or quest as i understand it grandmother constance was worried that he was a bit touched in the head she took all his stories with a grain of saltyou mentioned letters remi said do you still oh yes certainly theyre in the basement would you like to see them sam not trusting himself to speak merely nodded they followed her through the kitchen and down a set of narrow steps near the back door predictably the basement was dark and dank with rough stone walls and a veined concrete floor using the light streaming down the stairs miss cynthia found the light switch in the center of the basement a single sixtywatt bulb glowed to life the walls and floor were stacked with cardboard boxes of all sizes and shapesyou see the three shoe boxes there miss cynthia said beside the christmastree box yes said sam thats them back in the parlor sam and remi opened the boxes and were immediately relieved to find the letters had been divided and stored in gallonsized ziploc baggies sam said miss cynthia youre our hero nonsense now i have one condition she said sternly are you listening yes maam said sam take care of them and bring them back when youre done i dont understand remi replied youre letting us of course julianne said you were decent people she said you were trying to find out what happened to uncle blaylock in africaor wherever he ended up its been a mystery in our family for a hundred twentyseven years it would be nice to have it solved since im too old for that kind of adventure at least i can hear about it later from you providing you promise to come back and tell me everythingwe promise sam said chapter la jolla california pete wendy get these into the vault and do a quick assessment selma said she slid the shoe boxes across the worktable and her assistants picked them up and disappeared into the archive chamberunsure of the blaylock letters condition sam and remi had resisted temptation and refrained from opening the ziplocs before they got home a fruitful trip it seems selma said your friend julianne is one of a kind remi said tell me something i dont know if im ever hit by a bus she should be your first call for a replacement before or after we call sam said youre a funny one mr fargo this ashworth woman she seemed genuine she did replied remi between blaylocks journal and mortons biography we should be able to definitively prove or disprove the letters bona fides selma nodded while pete and wendy are working with those care to see what progress weve made on the journal cant wait said sam the three of them sat down at the worktable facing the nearest lcd screen and selma used the remote to scroll into their server she located the file she wanted and doubleclicked it it filled the screen wow sam murmured thats a busy mind could be the thoughts of a genius or a nut or someone who did a lot of daydreaming remi said but in this case blaylock doesnt strike me as the fanciful type he was a type a personality before the term was coined selma said this is a fairly representative page some have nothing but writing but the majority are a mishmash of notes and drawings some freehand and some probably done with a template or drafting tools clearly the image in the upper lefthand corner is a handdrawn map sam said and some text in the middle of it great green jeweled bird to the right of that some more textcant make it outthen some geometric symbols in the corner have you tried enlarging the textselma nodded i had wendy work on itshes the graphics wizard the more we enlarged it the fuzzier it got whats at the bottom right was orizaga there selma have you seen that elsewhere the name in many places remi stood up and walked closer to the screen in the middle on the left and right leonardo the liar and great men between them these numbers here boy talk about crypticthe bottom right is clearly a bird of some kind selma added the great green jeweled bird remi suggested could be as for two images in the middlethe one that looks a little like a cave painting and the arc below ittheyve appeared on dozens and dozens of pages so far the three fell silent staring at the screen for several minutes eyes narrowed sam stood up and walked to screen and tapped the number sequence remi had pointed out i must be more tired than i thought he said these numbers are the fibonacci sequence knowing his wife didnt share his love of math sam explained when added together the sum of the first two digits equals the third digit you add the third and fourth digit together and get the sum of the fifth digit and so on he walked back to the worktable and scribbled on a pad you get the idea he said its also the basis of whats known as the golden ratio or the golden spiral or even the fibonacci spiral here ill show you he walked to one of the computer workstations did a quick google search and doubleclicked a thumbnail it filled the screen you simply build a grid with whatever fibonacci numbers you choose and overlay it with an arc sam said your first box could be an inch square or a foot square anythingthats whats on the journal page remi said a fibonacci spiral sam nodded part of one at least the spiral is central to a lot of sacred geometry theories you see the spiral in naturethe way shells form in the buds of flowers the greeks used the spiral in a lot of their architecture even web designers and graphic artists use it to create layouts thereve been scientific studies that show the golden spiral is inherently pleasing to the eye no ones exactly sure whythe question is remi said why was blaylock obsessed with it what else can it be used for sam anything to do with geometry really i read that the nsa uses the fibonacci sequence and the spiral in cryptography but dont ask me how thats far outside my wheelhouse selma are there any more images that repeat in response selma picked up the phone and dialed the archive vault pete do you remember image twelvealphafour right thats the one how many repeats so far have you digitized it yet good put it on the server will you i want to show it to mr and mrs fargo ill hold a few moments later thanks selma hung up grabbed the remote and used it to scroll back into the servers file system the image weve named twelvealphafour has repeated nine times so far usually in the margins but sometimes as a central image here it is wendy worked her magic and plucked it off the page its still pretty messy on the screen selma moved the pointer over a thumbnail and doubleclicked it the image enlarged looks like a skull sam said my thought as well replied selma sam looked at remi who was staring at the image her head cocked to one side eyes narrowed he said remi remi she blinked her eyes and looked at him yes i know that expression whats happening in your head she didnt reply but shook her head absently without a word she got up walked to one of the workstations and sat down her fingers began working the keyboard without turning she said just had a moment of deja vu ever since we ran into rivera and his men their names have been stuck in my head why aztec names i thought it was just an oddity i did a semester of ancient mesoamerican studies at bc so i knew id seen that image before she tapped a few more keys and murmured there you are she turned in her seat and pointed at the tv screen its called miquiztli in nahuatl the aztec language it represented death chapter thats more than a little ominous sam said after a moment it also doubled as the symbol for the afterlife its all about context selma do we have others yes three selma brought them up on screen remi peered at them for a few moments then said do we have images we can use to compare selma picked up the phone to check remi went on unless im wrong theyre all aztec too the one on the right is tecpatl which represents flint or obsidian knife the middle one is cipactli or crocodile the last one is xochitl or flower it represents the last day of the twentyday monthsam asked selma and these were isolated like the first one no annotations selma was off the phone none wendys uploading some clean images onto the server now selma used the pointer to back out of the current image files until she found the new onesthey were labeled flint crocodile and flower they look like a match to me selma said me too replied sam remi all of these are from the aztec calendar correct it might be useful to see the whole thing i have the one remi downloaded for me selma said she scrolled around the screen found the correct file and doubleclicked it now thats a calendar sam muttered how in the hell did they make sense of that patience i would imagine remi replied the symbols weve found so far all belong to the month ring its the fourth one from the edge no wonder the one in mexico citys so big how big exactly twelve feet in diameter and four feet thick itd have to be that big for anything to stand out its fascinating more so when you realize its over five hundred years old three hundred of those it spent buried under the main square workers found it while doing repair work on the cathedral its one of the last vestiges of aztec culturethe three of them went silent selmas cell phone rang she answered listened then said well be here bring it to the side gate ill have pete meet you she disconnected and told sam and remi dobos on his way with the bellthat was fast said remi feels like christmas morning sam replied twenty minutes later pete jeffcoat and dobo came through the workrooms side door one pushing and the other pulling a chesthigh wheeled enclosure constructed of twobyfours hanging inside it was the shenandoahs bell aside from a few darkened patches the tarnish and barnacles were gone swept away by dobos magic the bronze exterior fairly glowed under the workrooms halogen pendant lightsstanding arms akimbo in his denim coveralls and white tshirt dobo surveyed his handiwork nice yes beautiful work dobo said sam if not for his frequent and easy smiles alexandru dobo would have looked sinister with his bald pate and thick drooping mustache he was remi had once observed a cossack lost in time thank you my friend he clapped sam on the back sam took a steadying step then one moreaway from dobo you see inside the romanian asked see inside pyotr helpdobo and pete unlatched the bell from its hook lifted it free turned it upside down then returned it mouth up to the cage look look sam remi and selma stepped forward and peered into the bells interior remi sighed after a few moments sam said wish i could say i was surprised me too replied remi carved haphazardly into the bells bronze interior were dozens perhaps hundreds of what appeared to be aztec symbols after a few moments sam muttered all aboard the blaylock crazy train sam and remi gathered their team around the worktable and over the next few hours and a pair of familysized pies from sammys woodfired pizzas they mulled over the mystery before them the crux of the issue they decided could be summed up in two questions did blaylocks apparent mental instability cast into doubt all theyd found were rivera and his people on a fools quest based on blaylocks influence or on other evidence clearly rivera was either searching for something or trying to keep something hidden something that was probably aztec in origin pete jeffcoat said if youre right about the tourists they murdered then it seems clear theyre trying to hide something its hard for me to believe theyd do that just because of blaylock wouldnt they have been asking the same questions about the guy that we aregood point sam said if thats the case wendy said then maybe blaylock wasnt insane maybe he was just eccentric and there was something to his aztec obsession as well as his fixation on the ship selma added remi said okay lets take that as a given how and why we dont know but blaylock became obsessed with the shenandoah or el majidi at some point after that his mind turned to all things aztec before we go any further we need to find out when that happened and what caused itsam asked pete and wendy howre we doing on miss cynthias letters another hour or so and we should have them all examined wendy replied another two hours to scan them and have the computer do an optical character recognition search after that well be able to easily sort them by date and search by key wordsam smiled got any big plans tonight i guess we do now pete replied accustomed to how her husbands brain worked remi was not surprised to awaken and find him sitting up at the edge of the bed apple ipad propped on his knees the nightstand clock read amlightbulb moment she asked i was thinking about chaos of course you were and how most mathematicians dont believe in it they know it existstheres even chaos theorybut i think secretly they all believe in underlying order even if its not obviousi can buy that then why would blaylock go to all the trouble of randomly carving aztec glyphs on the bells interior and why the bell remi said i assume thats a rhetorical question im working through it did you read this poem from blaylocks journal i didnt know there was one i just found it pete and wendy just uploaded it sam said then recited in my loves heart i pen my devotion on engais gyrare i trust my feet from above the earth turns my day is halved words of ancients words of father algarismonot bad for a mathematician observed remi i wonder if he used the bell because its durable unlike paper i also wonder if he used it because of its shape youve lost me the first line of his poemin my loves heart i pen my devotionhes got to be talking about his wife about ophelia which is what he renamed the el majidi remi caught on and a ships bell could be considered the heart of the ship right now the second line on engais gyrare i trust my feet in swahili engai is one of the spellings for the maasais version of god and gyrare is latin for gyre its a synonym for vortex or spiralas in the fibonacci spiral gods pattern in nature thats what i was thinking blaylock was using the spiral to guide himself put the lines together and maybe youve got blaylock inscribing the bell with the source of his devotionhis obsessionand using the fibonacci spiral as some kind of encoding technique and since by the time he made the inscriptions his wife was dead and hed found the shenandoah his devotion was something else altogether said remi what about the gyre how exactly would that fit inpicture a golden spiral okay now picture it superimposed on the interior of the bell starting at the crown and spiraling downward and outward toward the mouth remi was nodding and wherever the spiral intersects a symbol it means she shrugged what i dont know something to do with the last three lines of the poem maybe im still working on that all i know is that two of the most frequently repeated items in his journal are the fibonacci spiral and aztec symbols if hes hiding something theyre probably involved they got up made a carafe of coffee and headed down to the workroom selma was asleep on a cot in the corner the overhead halogen lights were dimmed pete and wendy sat at the worktable laptops open the screens glow illuminating their facescoffee guys sam whispered wendy smiled shook her head and nodded toward the collection of red bull cans on the table were almost done pete said those ziploc bags must have done the trick its just a guess but id say the letters have been protected in one way or another for most of their lifeyou got them all remi asked wendy nodded aside from some illegible spots here and there well have everything uploaded and sorted in a couple hours sams got a hunch he wants to play remi said were all ears replied wendy sam explained his theory pete and wendy considered it for a few moments then nodded in unison plausible pete said ditto wendy added blaylock was a mathematician those guys love order within chaos from across the room selmas scratchy voice said buy what go back to sleep remi said too late im up buy what she got off the cot and shuffled to the worktable remi poured her a cup of coffee and slid the mug down the table selma palmed it took a sip sam reexplained his spiralbellsymbol theory its worth a shot selma agreed the crown of the bell would be the likely place to start the spiral but how do we know how big it is and youre assuming it would unravel and end at the bells mouth what if it doesntsam smiled wearily killjoy the group began brainstorming at the top of their list was the question of scale a fibonacci spiral could be built to any scale if blaylock was in fact using a spiral he wouldve used a reference size for the first box in the grid they tossed around ideas for an hour before realizing they were getting nowhereit could be anything sam said rubbing his eyes a number a note a doodle or something we havent even seen yet remi added something weve overlooked across the table an exhausted pete jeffcoat laid his head down on the wood and stretched his arms before him his right hand struck blaylocks walking staff which rolled off the edge and clattered to the floordamn pete said sorry no problem sam knelt down to retrieve the staff the bell clapper had torn free of its leather bindings and was hanging by a single thong sam picked them up together he stopped and peered at the head of the staff he frownedsam said remi i need a flashlight wendy pulled out a storage drawer and handed an led across to sam who clicked it on and shone it onto the staffs head its hollow he muttered i need some longhandled tweezerswendy retrieved a pair handed them over gingerly sam inserted the tips of the tweezers into the opening wriggled them around for a few seconds then began withdrawing them grasped between the pincers was a corner of parchment chapter oh sure sam muttered it couldnt have been something easy like a map with a big x on it wary of damaging the remainder of the parchment or anything else that might lie hidden inside blaylocks walking staff pete and wendy had taken it into the archive vault for extraction and triage preservation ten minutes later a digital image of what sam had grabbed with his tweezers appeared on the workrooms lcd screen pete came out of the vault he said we had to reduce it the maps actual dimensions are roughly six inches wide by ten longwhat about those notations along the coast sam asked once we get the map digitized wendys going to work her photoshop magic and try to clean them up based on their placement and the capital r suffix theyre probably river namesin french by the looks of it the partial word in the upper lefthand cornerrunesmight be something we can work with tootheres another notation pete continued see the arrow i superimposed yes remi replied theres some microwriting overtop that little island were working on that as well the archive vault door opened and wendy emerged carrying a rectangle of parchment sandwiched between two panes of lexan clear polycarbonate whats this remi asked the surprise behind door number two replied wendy this was rolled up at the bottom of the staff she laid the pane on the worktable sam remi and selma gathered around it and stared in silence for ten seconds finally remi whispered its a codex an aztec codex faced with two seemingly disparate artifacts they divided forces pete and wendy settled down at a workstation to identify the map while sam remi and selma tackled this new parchment remi began codex is latin for a block of wood but over time it became synonymous with any type of bound book or parchment its the model for modern book manufacturing but before binding became common practice anything could be considered a codexeven a single piece of parchment or several folded togetheryou see when the spanish invaded mexico in sam interrupted maybe now would be a good time for an aztec course okay bear in mind among historians theres a lot of debate about the aztecs from the trivial to the significant ill give you the condensed middleofthe road version aztec is the popular name for a group of nahuaspeaking peoples that some historians refer to as the mexicasounds like mehsheekahwho migrated into central mexico from somewhere to the north in the sixth century somewhere to the north is rather vague selma observed remi nodded yet another source of controversy ill cover that in a minute so the aztecs continued their migration into the valley of mexico displacing and absorbing other tribesincluding some of their mythology and cultural practices this went on until around the twelfth century at the time most of the power in the region was concentrated in the hands of the tepanecs in azcapotzalco fastforward power trades hands alliances are made and broken and the aztecs are fairly low on the power ladder until when legend has it that the aztecs were shown a vision of an eagle with a snake in its mouth perched atop a cactus after a few more years of wandering the aztecs come across a swampy barely inhabitable island in the middle of lake texcocowhich is mostly gone today it sits beneath mexico city its on this island they supposedly see the eaglesnakecactus vision they stop wandering and start building they called their new city tenochtitlan despite their new capital being as much marsh as it was land the aztecs pulled off an engineering marvel tenochtitlan occupied about five square miles on the west side of lake texcoco they built causeways to the mainland complete with rising bridges to accommodate water traffic they built aqueducts to supply the city with fresh water there were plazas and palaces residential areas and business centers all connected by canals when the population got too big to feed with crops grown on the mainland aztec engineers created floating gardens called chinampas that could produce up to seven crops a year this went on another fifty years or so until the late s when the triple alliance among tenochtitlan texcoco and tlacopan was formed all the tribes outside the alliance were subjugated as the alliance grew in strength then slowly over the next century the aztecs and tenochtitlan rose to the topand then cortes arrived sam said right in the spring of within two years the aztec empire was all but destroyed whats the rest of the controversy selma said about the aztecs where they came fromnorth or south or from how far away many of the classical and preclassical mesoamerican culturesthe toltecs the maya the olmecsshare similarities with the aztecs its a chickenoregg situation was it simply a matter of cultural crosspollination or was one of these peoples the precursor to all the rest there are a lot of historians who think the aztecs were mesoamericas true progenitorssam and selma took all this in then sam said okay you were talking about codices right remi said when cortes invaded and the aztec empire collapsed there were a lot of codices written most of them by jesuit and franciscan monks some by soldiers or diplomats and even a few by aztecs as dictated to others those are fairly rare and usually discountedor at least they were until the last couple hundred years aztec codices tended to stray from the spanish party line which was that aztecs were savages and that their conquest was wonderful and dictated by god you get the ideaagain victors write the history sam said you got it selma said youre talking about the codex borbonicus the mendoza the florentine right there are dozens usually they depict aztec life either before during or after the spanish conquest some are just tableaus of routine activities while others are meant as historical accounts of cortess arrival of battles fought or ceremonies and so onremi grabbed a magnifying glass from a drawer and bent to examine the codex she spent ten minutes poring over every square inch then stood up and sighed in theme this ones a lot like the boturini codex allegedly the boturini was written by an anonymous aztec author between and about ten years after the aztecs fell its supposed to tell the story of the aztecs journey from aztlan to presentday mexicoaztlan asked sam one of the two mythical ancestral homes of the nahua peoples which include the aztecs many historians disagree about whether aztlan is a legend or an actual physical locationyou said two homes the other ones called chicomoztoc or place of the seven caves its important in aztec lore and religion take a look at our codex you see the hollowedout flower shape in the lower righthand corner sam and selma noddedthats how chicomoztoc is usually represented but this ones a little different i think ill have to do some comparisons if im reading this right sam said its meant to represent a sea voyage i assume the canoe is a metaphor hard to say but do you notice the comblike object on the side of it i saw it thats the glyph for the aztec number one hundred people or vessels given its placement i assume the latter a hundred ships sam repeated sailing from chicomoztoc to where wherever that bird and the object below it live selma offered what is that i cant quite make it out looks like a sword sam offered or a torch maybe selma said i dont know about that but that bird looks familiar it should remi replied its from blaylocks journal theres something else you should all recognize too sam tapped the roughbrushed shape occupying the upper half of the codex also from blaylocks journal a gold star for mr fargo and one more remi said handing him the magnifying glass the inscription sam lifted the glass to his eye and bent closer to the codex he recited my spanish isnt the best but here goes dado este vo dia de julio ano de nuestro senor por su alteza cuauhtemotzin javier orizaga sj sam looked up remiroughly translated it says given this twelfth day of july the year of our lord by his highness cuauhtemotzin javier orizaga sj orizaga thats another tidbit from blaylocks journal was orizaga here here where selma asked chicomoztoc anyones guess remi replied youre missing the real bombshell though without another word she walked over to a workstation brought up the web browser and spent five minutes navigating through pages on famsiorgthe foundation for the advancement of mesoamerican studies finally she turned in her seat obviously the sj in orizagas name means society of jesus he was a jesuit monk the date july is twelve days after what the spaniards called la noche triste the sad night it marks their emergency withdrawal from the aztec capitol of tenochtitlan after cortes and his conquistadors massacred hundreds of aztecsalong with their king moctezuma iiat the main temple the templo mayor it was a watershed moment for the aztec empire in august of the following year tenochtitlan was razed to the ground and the aztecs last king cuauhtemotzin was captured and torturedcuauhtemotzin sam repeated then turned back to the codex for a moment thats who orizaga claims dictated this codex selma murmured cuauhtemotzin saw the handwriting on the walls he knew his people were doomed and he wanted someone to know selmas voice trailed off remi nodded if this codex is genuine we may be looking at the last will and testament of the aztec people chapter madagascar indian ocean africa again sam muttered pulling the range rover to a stop off the dirt road he shut off the engine and set the parking brake had to be africa dont let the locals hear you say that remi replied were three hundred miles off the african coast as far as these folks are concerned madagascars a world unto itself sam raised his hands in surrender he knew she was right their marathon san diegoatlantajohannesburgantananarivo route had given them plenty of time to read up on madagascarthey climbed out walked to the rear of the rover and began gathering their gear the identity of the map inside blaylocks walking staff had remained a mystery for only a few hours as pete and wendy scoured the vast cartographical databases the fargos had acquired over the years as it turned out the map in question was but a section of a larger chart penned by a french explorer named moreau in some twentythree years after frances armed annexation of the island the partial word in the upper lefthand corner was in fact prunesfrench for plumsthe name given by an explorer to a series of atolls along the coast from there pete and wendy had had little trouble matching up the river names and isolating the section of coastline in question what remained a mystery however was why madagascar had been so important to blaylock it was a question sam and remi hoped to answer while selma the wonder twins and julianne severson at the library of congress continued to dissect and analyze blaylocks journal his letters to constance ashworth and the newly named orizaga codex for their part aside from a current topographical chart all sam and remi had to go on was a laminated copy of the moreau map and an enlargement of the area around the miniaturized annotationwhich theyd matched to blaylocks handwritingthat pete had discovered penned over a cove in the coastline having grown accustomed to blaylocks penchant for thought fragments theyd been unsurprised to find the jot consisted of only seven words spans into the lions mouth the fourthlargest island in the world madagascar was in many ways a world apart for instance it was home to five percent of the worlds plant and animal species of these eighty percent were found nowhere else on earth lemurs of every stripe and size cavedwelling crocodiles carnivorous plants and spitting beetles and giant centipedes thirtytwo species of chameleon two hundred two species of birds and an array of baobab trees that seemed plucked from the mind of a sciencefiction movie director and for all that not a single endemic poisonous snake called the island home madagascars history was no less unique while the islands official history began in the seventh century with bantus using encampments along madagascars northern tip as trading posts for passing arab merchants archaeological finds in recent decades had to probe deeper suggesting madagascars first settlers had arrived from sulawesi in indonesia between and ce over the next eleven hundred years madagascar became the melting pot of africa populated mostly by portuguese indian arabic and somalian settlers until the age of exploration arrived and the scramble for africa began european colonial powers and pirates alike rushed to madagascar and the island saw a series of ruling dynasties until the late eighteenth century when the merina family managed with the help of the british to gain control of most of the island in a hegemony that ended almost a century later with frances invasion in and what became known as the francohova war in france annexed madagascar and the merina royal family was exiled to algeria they gave their gear a onceover then donned their packs before standing back to take in the scenery the drive from the antananarivo airport had taken them east on route and down from the central highlands that ran roughly north to south down the islands spine to where they stood the coastal lowlands a twomilewide ribbon of rain forest and ravineladen terrain buttressed by fifteenhundredfoot escarpments interlaced with waterfalls at their back was the canal des pangalanes a fivehundredmilelong chain of natural and manmade lakes and coves connected by canals it was in this section of the pangalanes that they hoped to find the spot blaylock had indicated with his cryptic notation from there it would be only a matter of pacing off spans which they assumed and hoped referred to blaylocks staff on a compass bearing of and looking for a lions mouth into which they could leap or stare or whatever blaylock had in mind the problem was moreau the author of the map had clearly missed cartography day in explorers school his sense of scale and distance was nearly nonexistent sam and remis exploration would have to be trial and errorit never sounded simple remi now said but looking at this place her voice trailed off and she shook her head in frustration sam nodded the land that time forgot in the lead sam stepped off the road onto what resembled a game trail which evaporated after a hundred yards at which point he unsheathed his machete and began bushwhacking through the headheight brush with every step sawtoothed leaves nicked their exposed skin while spiked stems plucked at their clothing frequently requiring them to stop to free themselves after thirty minutes theyd covered a quarter mile when a garagesized clearing opened before them remi took a reading from their handheld gps looked around to get her bearings then pointed they set off again sam hacking a path while remi navigated thirty minutes turned into an hour sweat beaded on their pinpricked skin and their clothes became so saturated they might as well have just stepped from a swimming pool despite the blazing sun each of them felt slightly chilled after another thirty minutes sam stopped suddenly and held up his hand for quiet he glanced back at remi and tapped his nose she nodded smoke somewhere nearby was a campfire then somewhere off to their left came a rustling sound something was moving in the underbrush they stood stockstill barely breathing trying to pinpoint the location it came again but sounded farther awaysuddenly a male voice called out are you good folks lost by chance sam looked back at remi who shrugged sam called back i wouldnt so much call it lost as serendipitous exploration the voice chuckled well thats a first if you feel like a break ive got coffee on sure why not where look to your left they did so a moment later the flaming tip of a branch jutted up from the undergrowth thirty feet away if you keep going straight for ten or twelve more paces youll run into a game trail itll take you straight inon our way five minutes later they pushed their way off the trail into a clearing surrounded by dwarf baobabs strung between two of them was a netted hammock in the center of the clearing hemmed in by a pair of fallen logs for seating a small campfire crackled a midseventies man with silver hair and a goatee smiled up at them his eyes were a mischievous greenwelcome have a seat sam and remi shrugged off their packs and sat down on the log opposite the man they introduced themselves the man nodded smiled and said everybody calls me kid sam nodded at the revolver strapped to the mans hip because of that more or less a webley good eye model mark vi caliber circa enough gun talk boys remi said we appreciate the invitation it feels like weve been out there for two days in madagascar time thats about two hours sam checked his watch youre right sam noticed what looked like a twofoothigh pyramid of dirt clods lying at the mans feet may i ask ah these madagascar truffles finest in the world never heard of them remi replied most of them get sold to japan a thousand dollars a pound sam said looks like youve got a few thousand dollars sitting beside your boots give or take how do you find them asked remi smell location animal tracks after ten years its more a feeling than anything else ten years not out here the whole time i hope the kid chuckled no truffle seasons only five weeks long the other fortyseven weeks ive got a little place on the beach near andevoranto do a little fishing a little diving a little hiking and a lot of staring at sunsetssounds wonderful it is indeed madam whats not wonderful however is the nice collection of scratches there sam and remi glanced at the red crisscrosses on their arms and legs the man reached into an old canvas backpack leaning against the log rummaged around and came out with an unmarked glass tube he tossed it across to remi local recipe the kid said works miracles just dont ask whats in it sam and remi dabbed the greenish foulsmelling ointment on their scratches immediately the sting disappeared sam said smells a lot like animal urine and the kid smiled i told you not to ask he poured them each a cup of coffee from the sootburnished percolator sitting at the edge of the fire so if you dont mind me asking whatre you folks doing out herewere looking for a spot that may or may not exist sam replied ah the siren song of lost lands as it happens imaginary places are one of my specialties sam reached into the side pocket of his pack withdrew the moreau map and handed it across the kid studied it for thirty seconds then handed it back good news bad news pick your poisonbad news remi replied youre about eighty years too late that area of the pangalanes was swallowed up after an earthquake in and the good news its dry land now and i can probably get you to within a few yards of the spot you seek they finished their coffee then the kid kicked dirt over his fire and packed his gear and the three of them set out with the kid in the lead remi in the middle and sam trailing the kid required neither machete nor compass as he headed northeast following trails that at first glance seemed like nothing more than gaps in the foliage despite his years he moved at a steady economical pace that told sam and remi their guide had spent more of his life outofdoors than inafter forty minutes of walking in companionable silence the kid called over his shoulder this place youre looking for whats so special about it remi glanced back at sam with a questioning look on her face sam gave it a moments thought then replied you strike me as an honest man kid am i wrong about that the kid stopped walking and turned around he smiled youre not wrong ive kept more confidences than steps ive taken sam held his gaze for a few moments then nodded lead on and well tell you a storythe kid turned around and started walking again sam said have you ever heard of the css shenandoah after another hour the underbrush began to thin out and they soon found themselves surrounded by savanna dotted with clusters of baobab a mile to their left the grassland again gave way to rain forest that rose to meet the escarpment while to their right they could see the canal des pangalanes beyond that the blue of the indian oceanthey stopped walking and took a water break after a gulp from his canteen the kid said so this blaylock fella he sounds like quite a character remi nodded the problem is we still dont know how much of his story is real and how much is malaria and griefinduced fantasy thats the blessing and the curse of adventure the kid replied as far as im concerned one should never miss the chance to take the road less traveled sam smiled and held up his canteen cheers to that they clicked canteens why dont you two take a break im going to do some scouting i think were close but i need to do some checking around the kid dropped his pack and walked off through the kneehigh grass sam and remi plopped down on the ground and listened to the waves crashing on the beach a cluster of rainbowhued butterflies drifted across the tops of the grass fluttered above their heads for a few moments then continued on from a nearby baobab a ringtailed lemur hung upside down staring at them after two minutes of this he slowly climbed up and out of view without a sound the kid reappeared behind them eureka he simply saidit was a fiveminute walk away as they topped a small steepsided hillock the kid stopped and spread his hands here sam asked here after the earthquake the cove closed up and the water evaporated leaving just the upper part of the island exposed eighty years of ocean silt and storms filled in the depressionsam and remi looked around thankfully the hillock measured no more than four hundred square feet remi said i suppose we find the center point and start walking the kid asked how many spans did blaylock indicate fourteen hundred fortytwo a little under two miles the kid checked the sky in madagascar time thats three or four hours most of it back in the rain forest my recommendation we settle in for the night chapter madagascar indian ocean they were up shortly after dawn at the kids insistence sam and remi wandered down to a tidal pool for a rinse off while he threw together a meal of truffles and cassava hash browns they returned to camp just as the percolator was beginning to boil remi poured three cups while sam helped the kid serveprobably should ask you the kid said between forkfuls how much do you know about the situation here you mean politically sam replied not much aside from what we read in the papersa coup a new president and an angry expresident in exile thats the short of it what you dont know is the expresident is back from exile rumor is hes back and has set up shop in maroantsetra up the coast if he manages to put together enough men and guns therell probably be a civil war if he doesnt itll be a massacre either way its not the best time to be a white face on the island around the cities youre okay but out here the kid shrugged might want to keep a sharp eye outfor what asked remi mostly guys with aks riding around in pickup trucks so we should hope we see them before they see us that would be the idea even if not if you look like youre more trouble than youre worth they might move on whenever politics get stirred up like this the underdogs sometimes look at kidnapping as an incomeandleverage opportunitysam said with luck well be back in antananarivo before nightfall the kid smiled after youve found whatever there is to find or find that theres nothing to find remi added shortly before eight they packed up their gear trudged up the hillock took a bearing on then set out single file across the savanna with the kid in the lead remi in the middle and sam bringing up the rear with his handheld gps which hed calibrated to bearing countdown mode spans of blaylocks foottall walking staff which would equal feet or milesheres hoping blaylocks staff hasnt shrunk or expanded in the last hundred thirty years sam called or that he was no good with a tape measure remi added they hadnt crossed half the savanna before their boots and pant legs were soaked with dew by the time they reached the edge of the rain forest the suns lower rim had broken free of the eastern horizon they felt its heat on their backs the kid stopped before the wall of jungle said wait a moment then walked the tree line first north for fifty yards then south this way he called sam and remi joined him not surprisingly hed found a trailten feet inside the trees the sun dimmed behind them leaving only faint stripes and splotches on the foliage around them fiftyfive hundred feet down fortysix hundred to go sam announced they walked on soon the grade increased as the terrain began its climb toward the highlands the trail narrowed first to shoulder width then to a foot forcing them to sidestep and duck in places the razorsharp leaves and prickly stalks returned with a vengeancethe kid called a halt do you hear that he asked sam nodded a stream somewhere to the left ill be right back the kid ducked off the trail and was swallowed by the forest he returned ten minutes later its about thirty yards south i think itll roughly parallel your course how far to gosam checked the gps three thousand feet nine thousand on the madagascar scale remi added with a game smile the stream will be easier going just watch out for crocs youre kidding remi said nope youve heard of the madagascar cave crocodiles we werent sure if they were a wives tale or not sam replied not madagascars the only place on earth that has them see alligators and crocodiles are ectothermic they rely on the environment to regulate their body temperaturessun for warmth water and shade for cool our crocs dont need that national geographic was out here a few years ago to look into them but its still a mystery anyway sometimes in the morning theyll use underground streams to come out to hunt before the sun gets too hotand well spot them how exactly remi asked look for logs floating in the water if the logs got eyeballs its not a log make a lot of noise look big theyll take off the stream was calf deep and sand bottomed so they made rapid progress slowly winding down the gpss screen until it read feet the stream curved first south then back north then west again before broadening out into a boulderlined lagoon on the west side of the pool a fortyfootwide waterfall crashed onto a rock shelf sending up a cloud of spray sam checked the gps two hundred feetbearing remi asked in answer sam pointed at the waterfall after a few moments of silence remi said do you see it what replied sam the lions head she pointed at the point where the water tumbled off the rock ledge the two outcrops are the eyes below them the mouth and the water if you watch it long enough some of the streamers look like fangsthe kid was nodding ill be darned shes right sam sam chuckled she usually is maybe your blaylock isnt crazy after all well see sam dropped his pack stripped to the waist and donned a waterproof headlamp he clicked it on pointed the beam at his palm and clicked it off just an exploratory probe right said remi right five minutes no more hold on a second the kid said he dug into his pack and came out first with a marine flarecrocs hate thesethen another revolver this one similar to his own webley crocs hate these even moresam hefted the weapon studied it i dont recognize it another webley the webleyfosbery automatic revolver one of the first and only wheelgun semiautomatics breaktop design caliber six rounds not much good past fifty yards but whatever you hit goes downthanks sam said exactly how many webleys do you have last count eighteen kind of a hobby antique revolvers and rare truffles remi replied you are an interesting man sam shoved the flare into one of his shorts cargo pockets the webley into the other then began picking his way around the lagoons edge hopping from boulder to boulder and doing his best to avoid wet patches a task that became harder the closer he came to the waterfall when he was within arms length of the cascade he turned gave a short wave to remi and the kid then ducked into the deluge and disappearedfour minutes later he reappeared hopped onto a nearby boulder shook the water from his hair then made his way back to the beach theres a shallow grotto behind the falls he announced its about twenty feet deep and fifteen wide its clogged with backwashbranches rotting logs heaps of grass thatve formed into a loose dambut behind all that i found an opening its a horizontal gap really like a stone garage door that didnt close all the waythere goes our streak remi replied with a smile pardon me asked the kid sam said so far on this particular adventure we havent had to go subterranean which is rare given what we do before there were barable doors and lockable vaults if you wanted to keep something safe or a secret you had only two reliable choices bury it or hide it in a caveremi added still pretty common today might have something to do with genetic memory when in doubt burrow so youve never had a completely aboveground adventure sam shook his head remi said its why we stay current on our climbing and spelunking skills well caves are far down my list of favorite places the kid said so if you dont mind im going to let you two have all the fun ill mind the fort ten minutes later armed with the appropriate gear sam and remi returned to the waterfall and ducked behind it into the grotto the sunlight dimmed behind the curtain of water they clicked on their headlamps sam stepped close to remi and said over the rush stand to one side im going to see if weve got any company be ready with a flare remi stepped to the other side of the grotto while sam selected a long branch from the dam pile and pulled it free systematically he began probing the debris jamming the branchs tip into holes and gaps and wiggling it about he got no reaction nothing moved he spent another two minutes heelkicking the larger logs trying to illicit a response but fared no betteri think were okay sam called they got to work slowly dismantling the pile until they cleared a path to the rear wall they knelt before the fourfoottall gap a shallow runnel trickled past their boots and across the grotto before joining the waterfall proper sam jammed his branch into the opening and rattled it about again nothing moved he pulled the webley from his pocket leaned forward pressed his face to the rock and panned his headlamp from right to left he straightened up and gave remi the ok signonce more into the breach she yelled we two we happy two sam answered in kind nothing like a little bastardized shakespeare to set the tone chapter madagascar indian ocean their entry was thankfully short after five feet of hunched walking they saw that the rock ceiling abruptly sloped upward and found themselves standing in an elongated oval cavern a hundred feet wide with a thirtyfoottall stalactiteriddled ceiling their headlamps werent strong enough to penetrate more than thirty feet ahead but from what they could see the space appeared to be loosely divided into rooms by mineral columns that shone pearlescent gray and butter yellow in the beams of their lamps the quartz inclusions in the walls winked and sparkled the floor a mixture of jagged rock and silt that crunched under their boots was split by a narrow winding creekseems like a natural place to start sam said and remi nodded using the creeks path as a guide they began moving into the cave somewhat anticlimactic remi said after a few minutes i know the day is young though their last spelunking adventure had ended with not only the solution of the mystery of napoleons lost cellar but also a discovery that was helping rewrite parts of ancient greek history they continued on covering a hundred feet then two hundred sams headlamp picked out a wedgeshaped wall ahead from whose base the creek gushed on either side of the wall a tunnel curved back into darknessyour pick sam said left or right right they hopped over the creek and started down the righthand tunnel after twenty feet the floor sloped down and they found themselves standing in calfdeep water sam shined his beam over the surface there was a slight eddying current they kept walkingremi stopped and put her index finger to her lips she clicked off her headlamp sam did the same then following ten seconds of silence a sound something moving in the darkness ahead like leather scraping against stone more silence then another sound like a heavy wet towel striking rock sam and remi looked at each other and in near unison mouthed crocodile the leather was scaled skin rubbing on rock the wet towel a heavily muscled tail slapping stone splashingheavy feet plodded through water sam drew the webley and pointed it into the darkness together he and remi clicked on their headlamps twenty feet away and sloshing directly toward them was a crocodile snout just behind the snout a pair of heavylidded eyes staring back at them farther back at the edge of their headlamp beams they could see a half dozen scaly bodies writhing about eyes flashing mouths agape tails whippingflare sam said remi didnt hesitate with a hiss the tunnel filled with flickering red light remi lowered the flare to knee level and waved it before the oncoming crocodile which stopped opened its mouth and let out a low hissthe kid was right she said they dont care for it for now start backing up slowly dont turn your back on it in lockstep with remis eyes fixed on the approaching crocodile they began retreating sam glanced over his shoulder another ten steps and were at the ramp then the narrow partokay when we get there plant the flare in the sand well see how they like that when they reached the spot sam patted remis shoulder she knelt down jammed the flare into the silt then stood up and kept backstepping with sams hand still on her shoulder halfway up the ramp the crocodile stopped six feet before the hissing flare it scrabbled first to the left then to the right then stopped again it let out another hiss then backed down the ramp and into the water after a few seconds it disappeared from viewhow long do flares last remi asked that kind ten or fifteen minutes with luck long enough for us to check the other tunnel and if not then we get to see how good i am with the webley pausing to listen every ten paces or so they proceeded down the lefthand tunnel after forty feet the tunnel suddenly broadened out into a roughly circular chamber remis headlamp swept over a dark elongated object on the floor they both started and backpedaled ten steps their feet skidding in the sandremi whispered was it i dont think so he took a deep breath and let it out enough to get my heart going though come on they moved forward until their beams again found the object looks like a rotted telephone pole remi said and it did but almost immediately sam noticed what looked like a trio of wooden cross braces affixed to the pole then bindings of some kind mostly crumbled to dust but intact enough to retain their basic shapeits an outrigger remi whispered sam nodded and kept panning his headlamp along the cross braces to a point where they merged with an elongated heap of partially rotten wood this one a few feet longer than the telephone pole and four to five times its diametersam thats a canoe he nodded a big one at least thirty feet long together they sidestepped around the craft to the other side where they found a corresponding cross braceoutrigger setup the body of the canoe was five feet wide and four feet tall from keel to gunwale with a tapered bow and jutting bowsprit and a squaredoff stern at midships rising eight feet from the hull was what looked like a shattered mast the upper part about ten feet long lay on the ground its end propped up on the gunwale ahead of the mast the hull was topped by a shallow doublepitch roofsam step back remi whispered he followed her back a few paces she pointed at the ground beneath the vessel what theyd taken for simply a high point in the floor was in fact a twofoothigh platform constructed of carefully placed stonesthis is an altar he said after a quick check on their anticroc flare which had burned down to the halfway mark they got busy examining the outrigger remi taking in situ pictures for scale and design before moving in for closeups using the tip of his swiss army knife sam took trace samples of the wood and the bindingseverythings coated in some kind of resin he told remi sniffing the material its thick at least an inch that would explain its remarkable condition she replied sam stepped over the starboard side outrigger walked to the gunwale and peered inside the craft lying around the base of the mast was a mound of what he could only describe as decomposed canvas mottled brown and gray the material had partially congealed into a gelatinous massremi you need to see this she joined him at the gunwale big sail she said and began taking pictures sam unsheathed his machete and with remi hanging on to his belt lest he fall in leaned forward and gingerly slid the blade into the pile its like onion skin he muttered he lifted free a tattered section of the material remi was ready with an empty ziploc bag as he slid the sample inside it broke into three sections remi sealed the bag and walked back to her pack to deposit it with the other samples sam stepped around to the stern jutting from the transom was a bulbous wooden object like a gnarled football leaning forward on a kickoff tee like almost everything else about the outrigger it took sam several seconds and several tilts of his head before he realized what he was seeing remi came up behind himour mystery bird she said sam nodded from the orizaga codex and blaylocks journal what did he call it the great green jeweled bird remi mused though i dont think this is what he was talking about she took a dozen pictures of the carving with her digital camera lets check the bowsprit said sam when it comes to boats these kinds of things often come in pairs they walked to the bow as sam had guessed the bowsprit also bore a carving this one in better condition than its counterpart in fact the bowsprit itself was the sculpture a serpent its mouth agape feathered plumes streaming backward from its headsam do you know what this resembles remi asked no should i probably not i suppose its less elaborate and stylized but its the near spitting image of quetzalcoatl the great plumed serpent god of the aztecs crazy like a fox sam muttered after a few seconds pardon blaylock crazy like a fox clearly he hid the moreau map and the codex together in his walking staff for good reason he was obsessed with something all right but it was about more than the shenandoah or the el majidi maybe it started out with them remi agreed but somewhere along the line he must have found something or learned something that changed his focus the question is how did whoever brought this canoe here get it in the caveunless theres another entrance beyond crocoville down there they must have dismantled it brought it in through the waterfall then reassembled it thats a lot of work were two miles from the beach and it weighs a couple thousand pounds sailors tend to get attached to their vessel especially if its seen them through rough seas and a long voyage we might know more once we get these samples tested but if were buying into blaylocks odyssey this could be an aztec boat which would make it what at least six hundred years old were talking about rewriting history sam there are no accounts of the aztecs traveling beyond mexicos coastal regions let alone across the pacific and around the cape of good hopewere thinking at crosspurposes my dear how so youre thinking west to east and the sixteenth century im thinking east to west and much earlier than that you cant be serious remi you said it yourself historians arent entirely sure where the aztecs originated what if were standing in front of a protoaztec migration ship chapter madagascar indian ocean remi was about to open her mouth to reply when the crack of a gunshot echoed through the cave to their left they heard something plunk into a stalagmite they doused their headlamps and dropped to the ground perfectly still barely breathing they waited for more shots none came at the mouth of the righthand tunnel the flare was sputtering almost consumed red light flickered over the walldo you see anything remi whispered i think it came from outside wait here ill be right back sam got to his feet hunched over he dashed to a mineral column stopped to look and listen then moved on zigzagging from cover to cover until he was pressed flat against the wall beside the entrance he drew the webley and ducked into the entrancecrack a bullet struck the floor beside him and ricocheted off into the cavern hurrying now he ran out into the grotto then sidestepped left until he reached the spot where theyd entered he fell to his belly and crawled between a pair of boulders until his head slipped beneath the cascade eyes squinted against the torrent he peered ahead until the lagoon came into view six men all armed with assault rifles stood on the beach they were dressed in torn jeans ratty tshirts and combat boots to a man each wore a white bandanna with reddyed corners tied around his forearm two of them knelt beside sam and remis packs sorting the contents into piles sam scanned the lagoon area and surrounding trees but saw no sign of the kid one of the menthe leader sam assumed based on his mannerisms and the semiautomatic pistol he wore on his beltbarked something to the others then pointed toward the waterfall the five subordinates began picking their way around the lagoonsam backcrawled holstered the webley and hurried back into the cavern he found remi where hed left her he said six men all armedthe rebels the kid mentioned did you see him no i think he got away good theyre coming in to investigate weve got a minute maybe two how many five bad odds for a gunfight id suggest we go down the other tunnel and look for an exit but im not in the mood to be devoured sam grinned im sure our visitors will share your sentiment you look for a better hiding spot and ill go stir up some trouble be back in a flash sam dashed across the cavern hopped the creek then started down the righthand tunnel after snatching the flare from the sand he dashed down the ramp to the waters edge stopped and clicked on his headlamp twenty feet away he saw a jumble of scaly tails clawed feet and fanged snouts he counted at least three crocodiles they hissed and thrashed as the light panned over themsorry about the intrusion sam murmured he cocked his arm and heaved the sputtering flare down the tunnel his aim was true the flare landed on the nearest crocodiles back then bounced into their midst the hissing and thrashing became frenzied en masse the crocodiles began scrabbling away from the flare and moving toward the ramp sam doused his headlamp turned and ran as he reached the creek he saw remis headlamp flash once near the far wall he ran that way and found her hunched between a crescent of boulders just as he skidded to a stop and dropped to his knees he heard the echo of voices at the cavern entranceare the natives restless remi whispered into sams ear more like enraged if that flare stays lit our visitors should head straight for it and into an ugly surprise lets just hope their surprise doesnt turn on us it took less than a minute for their visitors to make their presence known having grown accustomed to the steady if muffled rush of the waterfall sam and remi heard its pattern change as bodies moved through the cascade this was followed by the sound of boots in the grotto then whispered voices through the entrance and in the main cavern the whispering stopped followed by the barely perceptible scuffing of feet on stone sam whispered in remis ear one man a scout this was a watershed moment for their plan if the scout decided to investigate the flare on his own the crocodile reception would probably send him and his compatriots running if however they came en masse the reception and its resulting pandemonium could easily engulf sam and remi as well sam and remi sat still listening the sound of the footfalls went quiet a single voice called out something more silence then more footfalls overlapping moving through the entrance tunnel now the crunch of footfalls moving across the loose rock and sediment the group was moving deeper into the cavern with their eyes already well adjusted sam and remi could plainly see the faint red flickering of the flare down the righthand tunnel how soon this group would see the light was the questionsam and remi turned their heads this way and that trying to triangulate the location of the party remi whispered theyre near the far wall the crunch of footfalls stopped a single voice called something in what sam assumed was malagasy and while the word made no sense the inflection was one of surprised announcement as in sam imagined look a flare whatever was said it had the desired effect the group continued but their pace seemed more cautious soon sam and remi saw the first figure move into the sputtering glow of the flare then a second and so on until all five men had moved into view one by one the men started down the ramp boots splashed in watersam whispered any second a guttural scream echoed through the cavern now sam finished the first scream was joined by a second then shouting remi managed to catch one of the words a curse someones developed a bladder control problem she whispered sam drew the webley and propped the barrel on the rock before him across the cavern came the sounds of splashes in the water then boots pounding up the stone ramp then the first gunshots tentative at first then in full automatic the poppoppop bouncing off the cavern walls the mouth to the righthand tunnel blinked orange with overlapping muzzle flashes caught in the strobe light men backing up stumbling scrambling back to their feet i count five of them sam whisperedme too once back on level ground the rebels turned and sprinted most of them heading straight for the entrance one however clearly panicked rushed headlong across the cavern toward sam and remis hiding spot the man stumbled into the creek fell then crawled across to the other side the man got to his feet took a few steps toward sam and remi then stopped and looked aroundsilhouetted by the flare the man was a mere outline sam placed the webleys front sight on the center point between the mans shoulders turn damn you while both he and remi had taken lives before neither enjoyed the feeling necessary or not it was an ugly thing turn sam murmured from the main entrance a voice called rakotomalala the man spun around paused a moment then sprinted toward the entrance sam lowered the webley and let out a deep breath he and remi waited until they heard the interruption of the waterfall again then sam got up and picked his way to the entrance and through to the grotto he crawled back between the boulders and inched his head through the cascade until he could see the lagoon so panicked was the group that none of its members had bothered with the boulders had rather chosen to swim back they were just now reaching the beach gesticulating wildly and shouting they related the crocodile story to the head honcho who glared at them for a few moments then barked an order the men gathered sam and remis packs and the group marched away in single file heading downriversam watched until they disappeared around the bend then waited another five minutes for good measure he returned to remi theyve moved on how can we be sure we cant but we either move on now or wait for nightfall and im not keen on staying weve pushed our luck far enough with our reptilian hosts remi glanced toward the righthand tunnel the crocodiles had settled slightly but the hissing and the overlapping thwap of tails told sam and remi the group was far from calm might be better to make a break now remi conceded something moved on the ramp and slowly the elongated snout moved from the shadows the mouth opened slowly then closed and the snout retreated back into darknessdefinitely better to make a break now remi said chapter madagascar indian ocean they took their time on the way out pausing first in the grotto then repeating sams peek through the cascade before sliding on their bellies through the boulders and into the lagoon they stroked across to the beach and climbed from the water while remi wrung the water from her hair sam took off his boots and drained themleaning forward her head tilted to one side remi murmured to sam theres someone waving at us where remi pointed with her eyes toward what looked like a pile of undergrowth from which was jutting a hand and forearm the hand was holding a webley model mark vi it gesticulated wildly as though trying to warn them awaysam put his hand on the butt of the webley in his waistband crack a bullet thumped into the sand between his legs sam froze as did remi her hands still tangled in her hair at the pile of undergrowth the kids arm slowly withdrew into cover guess they doubled back remi observed seems so did you happen to read the manners and etiquette section of the madagascar guide i thought you did that skimmed it slowly sam raised his hands above his head and turned around remi did the same predictably standing above the waterfall atop the lions head were the six rebels standing near the ledge arms akimbo the leader called down no move understand no movesam nodded called back no move under the watchful eye of the lone sniper atop the lions head the other five rebels made their way down via some unseen trail in the rocks soon they were standing in a semicircle around sam and remi the leader stepped forward scrutinized sams eyes then glanced over and gave remi a foottohead onceover the leader reached out plucked the webley from sams waistband then lifted it up for examinationgood gun he proclaimed in his broken english good gun sam agreed you are who sam tolotra who is woman a bit of madagascar etiquette popped into sams head carefully he lowered his right hand and pointed to remi careful to keep the tip of his index finger curled back toward himself my wife remi sams gesture was not lost on tolotra he looked at remi then back to sam then nodded thoughtfully tolotras next statement told sam that his recognition of a madagascar custom wasnt going to be a getoutofjailfree cardsam remi hostages now one of the rebels drew two lengths of rope from his belt and stepped forward as if to bind sam and remis hands tolotra waved the man off and said to sam you run we shoot no run you promise evidently sams bent index finger had done some goodin response sam raised his right hand up ceremoniously crossed his index and middle fingers then nodded solemnly not on your life he said beside him remi rolled her eyes oh god tolotra studied sams gesture for a moment then smiled and mimicked him not on your life tolotra turned and showed the gesture to his men not on your life not on your life the men cheered back remi whispered if any one of them has an english phrase book were dead you know that dont you they were placed in the middle of a wellstaggered singlefile group and marched away from the lagoon passing within five feet of the kids hiding place before turning onto a trail that paralleled the river whatever language advantage sam and remi might have had was offset by the bandits hostagewrangling skills they were never under the guns of fewer than two men who always maintained a minimum tenfoot gap moreover the groups navigation skills were on par with those of the kids and soon sam and remi had lost whatever landmarks to which theyd been clinging after walking for forty minutes the jungle thinned and the trail broke into sunlight they were back on the savanna sam realized but how far from the one he remi and the kid had used earlier that day he had no clue the ocean was on their left the forested escarpment on their right they were heading southafter another twenty minutes they were back in the jungle this time following a fairly straight trail so sam was able to maintain his bearings i think were near the road he whispered to remi thats probably how they found usthey found the rover have you seen you know who no but hes out there walking at the head of the line tolotra turned around and barked no talking he held up his crossed fingers as if to lend gravity to the order sam returned the gesture remi murmured how nice you made a friend hope i dont have to shoot him with what an invisible rubberband gun no my webley sam grumbled his eyes fixed on tolotra after i take it away from him no talking sams guess about their location was right a few minutes later tolotra reached an intersection of trails and turned right the grade increased until they were pulling themselves up using exposed roots and lowhanging branches the terrain had no effect on the bandits discipline however whenever sam and remi looked around they found themselves staring down at least two rifle muzzles the trail leveled out and reached a set of natural root steps in the hillside sam and remi reached the top and found themselves standing on a gravel road a quarter mile to the south a rusted white chevy pickup truck sat on the shoulder ahead of it sam and remis range rover and looming above both the three wise menwhere now sam asked tolotra he and remi were under no illusions while their hands being unbound was an advantage this was not a hollywood movie without a major distraction any attempt to get the jump on any of these rebels would not only fail but likely end with them dying their chances would only worsen once they were put in vehiclessecret place tolotra replied you want ransom yes yes how do you know were worth anything tolotra considered this for a moment as though sorting through his grasp of english packs clothes cameraall expensive car expensive its a rental remi said eh nothing sam still trusting his hunch that the kid hadnt abandoned them had been surreptitiously scanning their surroundings now out of the corner of his eye he glimpsed movement on the slope above the road he saw a flash of silvery hair appear between a pair of boulderssam said we have gold this had the desired effect those in the group that hadnt been paying attention to the conversation turned to face sam tolotra took a step closer gold where how much the kids head popped up from behind the boulder he caught sams eye winked pointed toward the vehicles down the road then ducked from view again sam looked to remi her expression told him shed seen the kid sam said how much do you think remi i dont know a couple dozen double eagle coins this was enough for tolotra eyes narrowed he nodded sagely where our hotel in antananarivo you give us coins you go free this was a lie sam assumed but it was a step in the right direction even if the worst happened and the kid was unable to intervene here he and remi would fare much better moving toward civilization than away from it no doubt tolotras secret place was good enough to keep them hidden from government forces if however tolotras discretion overwhelmed his greed en route to antananarivo sam and remi would find themselves back to square onewe go now tolotra announced again the group fell into formation with sam and remi in the middle using their peripheral vision sam and remi kept watch for the kid but there was no sign of him whatever the old truffle hunter had planned they would have to be ready to react and improvisethey drew even with the chevy pickup truck and stopped sam and remis packs were tossed into the bed sam whispered to remi stay sharp tolotra and four of the others clustered around the tailgate and began conversing the sixth man stood ten feet behind sam and remi his rifle trained on their lower backs based on tolotras gestures sam assumed they were trying to decide how best to execute the drive into antananarivoessentially the enemys capital remi was the first to realize the kids plan was unfolding with her eyes she guided sams gaze over the roof of the chevy and up the middle wise man to the top at first sam saw nothing and then almost imperceptibly a barrelsized boulder began inching toward the edgesam whispered when i move go for the range rover tolotra turned and glared at sam sam shrugged and smiled apologetically remi whispered okay atop the wise man the boulder had reached the edge where it stopped sam and remi took a deep breath waited the boulder wiggled forward paused momentarily then tipped over the edge and started falling the pillars face was a slope angled slightly backward and smooth save some bumps near the bottom the combination of the face gravity and the boulders kinetic friction kept it adhered to the face the engineer in sam knew that would end as soon as the boulder hit its first bump at which point the boulder would become a stone artillery shell knowing no malagasy sam did what he hoped would cause the most panic he let out a distinctly unmacho highpitched scream pointed at the boulder and shouted boulder in unison tolotra and his men glanced up lacking the advantage of the foreknowledge sam and remi had everyone froze and stared in awe sam having kept his eye on tolotra for most of the hike and having rehearsed his actions took two leaping steps forward heelkicked tolotra in the back of the knee and as he fell jerked the webleyfosbury from his waistband behind him remis guard screamed something that sam assumed was stop which he further assumed would be followed by the guard drawing a bead on the fleeing remi sam never gave him the chance with the webley now free sam latched his left hand onto tolotras collar and pistolwhipped him in the side of the head tolotra grunted and went limp sam spun on one heel and dropped to his knees putting tolotra between him and four other men two of whom were backing across the road the other two scrambling around to the chevys opposite side sams spin naturally brought the webley around to point in the general direction of remis guard as sam had feared the man was jerking the rifle up to his shoulder the barrel tracking remi as she sprinted toward the range rover sam fired once hitting the man on the sternum like a puppet whose strings had been cut the man dropped straight down dead sam wrapped his left forearm around tolotras throat pulled him tighter then shifted his aim toward the two rebels backing across the road both had their rifles trained on sam obviously trying to decide whether to risk the shot sam shifted the webleys sights from one man to the next on the other side of the truck he could hear the other two men moving through the high grass along the shoulderboom the ground shuddered followed by the snapping of limbs another shudder like a giant was on the march sam felt it in his belly remi shouted boulders bouncing where coming your way boom closer this time on the other side of the truck the two rebels shouted theyre running remi called the two in front of sam did the same turning and sprinting back down the road boom hold tight sam its almost on you three two one sam curled into a ball above his head there came the wrenching of steel glass shattered he felt the chevy lurch to the side shoving him and tolotra over the gravel a shadow passed overhead boom the boulder struck the far side of the road bounced once then disappeared over the shoulder bulldozing trees as it went after another ten seconds the sound stopped sam looked up glanced around down the road the four remaining rebels had stopped running after a brief huddled conference they started back toward sam and remi sam having watched tolotra pocket the rovers keys dug them outremi better start the rover he called he tossed the keys up the road then pointed the webley down the road and took aim on the four advancing rebels one of them stumbled sideways clutched his thigh and crumbled to the road followed a split second later by a basso pop though sam had never heard that particular sound he surmised it was the report of a caliber bullet from a circa webley model mark vi revolverthe remaining three rebels stopped whirled toward the wise men a second bullet struck this one between the legs of the center man he backed up a few steps followed by the second man the third man however was a slow learner half crouching his eyes scanning the high ground he slowly brought his rifle to his shoulder he got a bullet in the left kneecap for his trouble he screamed and toppled over from the direction of the wise men a disembodied voice shouted something the two stillarmed rebels dropped their guns another shout the ablebodied men helped their comrades to their feet and the group began limping off down the road sam shoved the unconscious tolotra off him and climbed to his feet remi walked up together they stared at what remained of the chevy aside from the four twisted stumps that formed the cab the pickup had been decapitateda voice called looking at it youd think thats exactly what i had planned a figure emerged from the trees at the base of the wise men and began striding toward them didnt you sam asked the kid ill never tell remi said you certainly know how to create a distraction the kid stopped before them it was all mother nature my dear and the luck of the bounce of course thanks for not deserting us said sam dont mention it sam hefted the webleyfosbury in his hand appraised the weapon for a moment then handed it to the kid who frowned and shook his head shes yours now pardon me until today shed never been fired its a tradition you see chinese if i recall remi smiled i think youre thinking of save a life and youre responsible for it the kid shrugged either way mr fargo shes yours now thanks ill treasure it what should we do with these two sam asked pointing to tolotra and the dead man on the road leave them the sooner you get to antananarivo the better the kid read sam and remis somber expressions dont give it a second thought they wouldve killed you how do you know that for sure remi said in the last five years thereve been sixtythree kidnappings here ransom paid or unpaid not one came back alive trust me it was you or them sam and remi considered this then nodded sam shook the kids hand then grabbed their packs from the trucks bed as remi gave their savior a hug they turned and headed toward the range roverone more thing the kid called sam and remi turned back the kid dug into his pack and came out with a small burlap bag he handed it to them truffles for your troubles the kid said then he crossed the road and disappeared into the brush sam turned the burlap bag over in his hands stamped on the side in red ink was a logothe letter c and beside it in smaller letters ussler trufflesremi said thats nice of him but whats an ussler chapter madagascar indian ocean they were almost halfway back to antananarivo and approaching a village named moramanga at the junction of routes and when their satellite phone trilled in the passenger seat remi answered its rube she said after a moment then put it on speakerphonehi rube sam called where are you madagascar damn i was afraid of that remi said something tells me its not just a general dislike of madagascar thats got you bothered someone flagged your passports at the antananarivo airport when asked remi a couple days before you arrived what exactly does that mean sam asked we werent stopped when we went through immigration thats whats got me worried if it was a governmentlevel request you would have been stopped there in spookspeak the flag you got is called a noteandnotify somebody just wanted to know when you got thereand it doesnt have to be someone in the government sam said in third world countries where the average annual income is a few hundred dollars you can buy a noteandnotify for the price of a cup of coffee and since riveras already shown hes got connections in africa understood sam replied recommendations assume somebodys actively looking for you assume theyll find you dont go back to antananarivo have selma track down a private airstrip and a pilot who doesnt mind working for cash and wont bother with passports such was the downside of being who they were while far from famous sam and remi had something of a reputation in the adventurer treasurehunting community and while naturally they had a few detractors they were widely respected getting caught sneaking into and out of countries on false passports could potentially cause more trouble than it was worth jail expulsion headlines being labeled persona non grata and perhaps most important the evaporation of invaluable contacts in the academic world by playing it mostly aboveboard sam and remi were often easy targets for anyone willing and able to bribe the right person in the right placeremi said we know about the political situation how does that affect things badly stay near civilization and know where the police stations are that could be a problem were a little off the beaten path right now why am i not surprised okay give me a second the line went silent for two minutes then rube returned best guess puts the rebels about a week away from being ready for a major attack but that doesnt rule out skirmishes most of the cities within fifty miles of antananarivo should be okay the bigger the better head south if possible the rebels are clustered in the north the downside isrivera and his goons will be thinking the same thing and looking in those places sam finished right wish i could be of more help rube youre the best dont ever doubt it well call when were safe their next call went to selma who listened asked a few questions and said im on it then hung up now remi studied the map as sam drove weve got two options she said after a few minutes one take one of the dozens of roadsand i use that term very looselythat head generally south or close to within a couple miles of antananarivo theres a twolane blacktop that circles the city to the east and then links up with route heading southhow do the unnamed roads look as youd expect dirt and gravel at best multiple choices make for a harder trail to follow sam observed and if were aiming for route itll add five or six hours onto our travel time which takes us well past nightfall my vote is blacktop sam said seconded different subject the fact that rivera flagged our passports here of all places means something remi was nodding its not hard to guess what that is they knew there was something here to find but is it the outrigger we found or something more well know that when we know what got them interested in madagascar in the first place my guess theyve been here before and didnt find what they were looking for which begs the question where else have they been the afternoon wore on past moramanga moving ever westward and upward they passed mile after mile of rice paddies and drove through village after village each one bearing a quaint name that remi described as part malagasy part french with a dash of italian andranokobaka ambodigavo ambatonifody ten miles east of anosibe ifody the terrain began to change yet again giving way to tropical forest interspersed with rugged brown hills that reminded sam and remi of tuscany jagged escarpments glowing brownish gold in the sun rose above the treetops to the north and south shortly after three oclock they stopped at a jovenna gas station on the outskirts of manjakandriana remi went inside for snacks and water while sam pumped the gas down the block a white volkswagen passat police vehicle came around the corner and headed toward the gas station moving at a sedate twenty miles per hour the passat slowed as it drew even with the range rover after a few more seconds the passat sped up and continued down the block where it pulled to the side of the road and parked through the rear window sam saw the driver pluck something off the dashboard and bring it to his mouthremi came out with four bottles of water and a few bags of pretzels sam got back in the drivers seat youre wearing your frowny face remi observed it may be exhaustion or paranoia or a combination of the two but i think that police car is interested in uswhere down the block under the awning with the old cocacola sign remi checked the side mirror i see him he slowed beside us then parked and got on the radio sam started the engine they sat in silence for a few minutes what exactly are we doing remi asked giving him a chance remi caught on if its official business hell stop us here if not noteandnotify right sam put the rover in gear time to play navigator again remi were backtracking to where hopefully nowhere if he doesnt follow us well turn around again and if he follows us then were on the run well be needing one of those unnamed roads you mentioned were on the run remi announced a few minutes later facing backward shed been staring through the rear window since theyd left manjakandriana hes a mile backweve got some dips and turns coming up let me know each time you lose sight of him why if we sprint while hes watching us hell know were running this way we may be able to get some distance before he realizes it tricky fargo only if it works what if he tries to stop us i dont even want to think about it for the next fifteen minutes sam followed remis cues flooring the gas pedal for a ten count when remi said go before slowing back down to the speed limit slowly but steadily they put an extra half mile between them and the passatare any of those roads not gravel or dirt sam asked remi studied the map hard to tell but this one coming up looks a tad thicker than the others so far on this map thats usually meant blacktop of some kind why do you askno dust trail from a quick turn remi said that could work both ways sam frowned good point tell me when the turns coming up for the next few minutes remi matched passing roads and signs against the maps markings should be the next turn to the south she measured the distance with her fingernail a quarter mile give or take should be just over this hillhows our friend hard to be sure but it looks like hes picked up speed they crested the hill and started down ahead sam saw the turnoff remi had indicated sam jammed the accelerator to the floorboard and the range rover surged forward her eyes wide remi braced herself against the dashboard a hundred yards from the turn sam switched his foot to the brake pressing as hard as he dared without skidding and brought the rover down to sixtyfive kilometers per hour or forty miles per hour hang on sam said then slewed the wheel right despite the rovers high center of gravity the tires clung to the road but sam could see hed overshot the turn he eased the wheel left then tapped the brakes and jerked the wheel right again the rovers tail whipped around the driversside rear tire slipped off the shoulder they felt the rover tipping sideways sam resisted the impulse to correct right and instead steered into the skid dropping the driversside front tire off the shoulder now even with each other the two shoulderside tires bit down together sam gunned it jerked the wheel to the right and the rover vaulted back onto the roadsharp right remi called pointing at a gap in the foliage off the shoulder sam reacted instantly braking hard the rover shuddered to a stop sam switched into reverse backed up ten feet switched back to drive and turned into the gap shadows engulfed them foliage scraped the cars sides he eased forward a few feet until the bumper tapped a wooden cattle gateremi climbed over the center console into the backseat and poked her head up so she could see out the side window sam asked are we off the road barely he should be along anytime now thirty seconds later there he goes she turned around in the seat slumped back and exhaled can we sit here for a from down the main road came the shrieking of brakes then silence sam and remi froze in the distance an engine revved and tires squealed sam groaned youve got to be kidding me buckle up remi the road while in fact blacktop was narrow and winding with no centerline and with ragged shoulders with the range rover at top speed they gained a half mile before they heard the passat skid into the turn behind them as they rounded the next corner a sign flashed pastremi caught it narrow bridge ahead sam gunned the engine eating up the straightaway before the bridge on either side the jungle seemed to close in around them the green tips of branches lashed the side windows through the windshield the bridge appearedthey call that a bridge remi called spanning a narrow gorge the bridge was anchored to each bank by a pair of steel cables but there were neither center stanchions nor support pylons fencepostandrope handrails lined each side the bridges surface was little more than parallel twelveinch planks with nothing but air and the occasional crossbeam between them fifty yards from the structure sam slammed on the brakes he and remi glanced out the side windows there was nothing no breaks in the foliage no turnoffs nowhere to hide beside them a sign read in french single vehicle crossing only bridge speed limit kph essentially a walking pacesam looked at remi who forced a smile like a bandaid she said dont think just do it right sam aligned the rovers wheels with the bridges planks then stepped on the accelerator the rover rolled forward behind them came the sound of tires squealing remi turned in her seat and saw the passat skid around the corner fishtail slightly then straighten out ten to one he was counting on this bridge no bet sam replied fingers white on the steering wheel the rovers front tires thumped over the bridges first crossbeam and onto the planks the wood groaned and creaked the rovers back tires crossed over point of no return sam said is he slowing down still turned in her seat remi said no okay he is hes not stopping though sam depressed the accelerator the speedometer needle rose past twelve kph remi rolled down her window stuck her head out and looked down sam called do i want to know its about a fiftyfoot drop into a river a lazy river right whitewater class at least okay sunshine enough narrative remi pulled her head back inside and took another look through the rear window hes almost on the bridge clearly the sign doesnt worry him lets hope he knows more than we do they crossed the halfway point a moment later they felt the range rover dip slightly now double loaded the bridge began undulating like a jump rope being flicked vertically at both ends while the movement was but inches the differing weights and positions of the vehicles began to feed upon each otherinterference wave sam muttered pardon physics when two waves of disparate amplitude combine bad things happen remi finished i get it the range rover was rising and falling erratically now six inches in each direction sam estimated remi felt her stomach rise into her throat do we happen to have any seasickness pills sorry my dear were almost there the bridges opposite side loomed before the windshield twenty feet ten sam set his jaw waited for the rover to begin its downward plunge then goosed the accelerator the speedometer shot past twentyfive kph the rover bumped over the last crossbeam and onto solid groundremi glanced out the rear window her eyes went wide sam he turned without the rovers compensatory weight the police passat was absorbing all the motion the bridge lurched upward then dropped suddenly leaving the car suspended for a split second it was just enough the passat dropped but landed slightly off line the driversside front tire dropped into the center gap with a gunshotlike crack the nearest crossbeam gave way the passat tipped sideways onto the drivers door and slipped farther into the rift the forward third of the car including the engine compartment was now dangling in spaceremi murmured oh god on impulse sam opened his door and got out sam what are you doing for all we know hes just a cop doing what he was ordered or hell happily shoot you when you walk up to his car sam shrugged then walked back and opened the rovers tailgate he rummaged through his pack and found what he was looking for a fiftyfoot coil of quarterinch utility paracord careful to stay on the passats up side he walked down the plank until he was even with the passengerside door below him the river rushed past frothing and sending up plumes of spray he crouched down and examined the chassis the situation was more precarious than hed anticipated the only thing keeping the passat from falling was the driversside rear tire which was wedged between a plank and a crossbeamsam called do you speak english after a few moments hesitation the cop replied in a frenchmalagasy accent a little english im going to get you out yes thank you please dont shoot me okay repeat what i just said you are going to help me i will not shoot you with my gun here here i will drop it out the window sam walked to the rear of the car and peeked around the bumper so he could see the drivers door a hand holding a revolver appeared through the open window the revolver dropped through the gap and tumbled into the mist below sam walked back to the passenger door okay hang on he uncoiled the paracord doubled it up knotted the loose ends together then tied square knots at threefoot intervals down its length once done he gave the bridges side railing a test tug then tossed one end of the paracord through the passenger windowwhen i say go im going to pull and youre going to climb understand i understand i will climb sam looped his end of the paracord around one of the posts gripped it with both hands then called go and started pulling the car began rocking and groaning wood splintered keep climbing sam ordereda pair of black hands appeared through the passenger window followed by a head and face the passat lurched sideways and slipped a foot glass shattered faster sam yelled climb now sam gave the paracord one last heave and the cop came tumbling out the window he landed in a heap his torso lying across the plank his legs dangling in space sam leaned forward grabbed his collar and dragged him forward with a series of overlapping pops and cracks the crossbeam gave way and the passat slid through the gap and disappeared from view a moment later sam heard a massive splashpanting the man rolled onto his back and looked up at sam thank you youre welcome he began coiling the paracord youll forgive me if i dont offer you a ride the cop nodded why were you following us i do not know we were given an alert from the district commander that is all i know how far did this alert go antananarivo and outlying communities when did you last report in when i realized you had turned onto this road what did they say nothing the cop said are there any main roads ahead that come from the north the cop thought for a moment asphalt roads yes three before the main road west to tsiafahy do you have a cell phone sam asked it was in the car sam said nothing continued to stare at the cop i am telling the truth the cop patted his front pockets rolled over did the same to his back pockets it is gone sam nodded he finished coiling the paracord then turned and headed for the range rover thank you the cop called again dont mention it sam called over his shoulder i mean it dont tell them i helped you the people who are paying your district commander will kill you chapter madagascar indian ocean do you really think they will remi asked when sam climbed back into the car and recounted the conversation i dont know but if he thinks so hell be more likely to keep his mouth shut i hope remi leaned over and kissed sam on the cheek that was a good thing you did fargo sam smiled somebody probably offered him a months salary to just follow a pair of tourists cant blame him for that if were going to get intercepted the car will probably come from one of three blacktop roads he mentionedagreed remi unfolded the map and studied it a moment tsiafahy is south of antananarivo on route if we can get there how far to the tsiafahy turnoff sixty kilometersabout thirtyseven miles another twenty west to tsiafahy sam nodded and checked his watch we might make it before nightfall almost immediately they realized their optimism was probably unwarranted past the bridge the road continued to wind through the jungle a mix of gentle bends and switchbacks that slowed their pace dramatically they passed the first blacktop road intersection without incident and soon found themselves driving along a boulderstrewn riverthe same one they assumed theyd crossed thirty minutes earliernext intersection coming up remi announced two miles five minutes later sam saw the intersection remi pointed through the windshield i saw something a flash of sunlight its a bumper sam said between his teeth duck if were not a couple maybe remi scrunched down in her seat as they drew even with the blacktop sam pressed himself back into the headrest and cast a glance out remis window the vehicle a dark blue nissan suv was parked on the shoulder a few feet back from the intersectionwhats happening remi asked sam glanced in the rearview mirror hes pulling out hes behind us remi sat up grabbed the binoculars from the floor between her feet and focused them through the back window a driver and a passenger the silhouettes look male i see a europcar rental sticker on the bumper all bad signs are they speeding upno just keeping pace you know what they say sam for every rat you see he nodded if in fact this nissan was pursuing them the chances were good there would be a second and perhaps a third car up ahead how far to the next blacktop road remi checked the map four miles it took nearly ten minutes to cover the distance a few hundred yards behind them the nissan was still matching their speed remi alternated between checking the map and studying their possible pursuers through the binocularswhat are you expecting them to do sam asked with a smile either go away or raise the skull and crossbones intersections coming up should be around this next bend remi turned to face forward sam took his foot off the gas eased the rover into the turn then accelerated again sam fifty yards away sitting broadside across the road was a red nissan suv theres your skull and crossbones sam called he eased the rover slightly left taking the center of the road and aimed the hood directly at the nissans passenger door he stepped on the accelerator and the rovers engine roaredi dont think theyre going to move remi said hands braced on the dashboard well see remi glanced over her shoulder our tail has closed the gap how close a hundred feet and coming fast hold on remi with his thumb depressing the button sam lifted the emergency brake handle in the space of two seconds the rovers speed dropped by half the nissans driver seeing no brake lights to alert him was slow to react the nissan loomed in sams rearview mirror he jerked the wheel right tapped the brakes and the nissan swerved left to avoid the collision sam glanced in his side mirror and saw the nissan coming up alongside he yanked the wheel left and was rewarded with a crunch of metal on metal the red nissan filled the rovers windshield sam torqued the wheel hard right swerved around the nissans bumper onto the shoulder then drove back up onto the roadcut it a little close there fargo remi said sorry about that do you see the blue one remi checked hes still there about two hundred yards back the red ones getting turned around within two minutes both nissans were back on their tail and trying to close the gap while the rovers engine probably had more horsepower the nissans lower center of gravity gave them the advantage on the corners slowly but steadily the nissans ate up the distanceideas remi asked im openminded remi opened the map and began tracing her finger along their course while murmuring to herself she pulled one of their guidebooks from the glove compartment flipped pages and continued murmuringshe looked up suddenly is there a left turn coming up were on it now take it sam did as instructed braking hard then slewing the rover onto the intersecting dirt road a sign flashed past lac de mantasoalake mantasoa sam asked are we going fishing theyve got ferries remi replied she consulted her watch next one leaves in four minutes sam checked the rearview mirror the two nissans were skidding into the turn something tells me were not going to have time to purchase tickets i figured you could pull off something tricky ill see what i can do the road devolved into a series of descending switchbacks bordered on both sides by steep embankments the jungle canopy closed in above them blotting out the sun they passed a brownpainted sign with a yellow p a car pictograph and malmost there remi said lets hope for a busy lot sam brought the rover through the last switchback and the road widened into a small parking lot covered with diagonal white lines to the right was a forested embankment to the left beyond a strip of wellmanicured grass was a river this one flat and calm there were eight cars in the parking lot at the far end sitting before a wall of trees was a gazebolike ticket hut to the right of this was what appeared to be a service road blocked by a chain draped between two fence postsi dont see the ferry sam said accelerating across the lot it just left remi pointed to the left of the ticket hut sam saw a fan of froth on the rivers surface he rolled down his window and they could hear the distinct overlapping chop of paddle wheels theyre here remi said sam glanced in the rearview mirror the blue nissan accelerated out of the last switchback closely followed by the red one ive got a tricky idea sam said or a really dumb one either way its better than sitting here sam slammed the gas pedal to the floor swerved around the parked cars like a slalom racer then bumped over the curb and onto the grass before the ticket hut the tires slipped on the damp grass the rear end fishtailed sam corrected eased right and aimed the hood at the entrance to the utility roadcross your fingers those posts arent buried deep he said here we go remi hunched down in her seat braced her feet against the dashboard the rovers bumper crashed into the chain sam and remi were thrown forward against their seat belts sams forehead bonked into the steering wheel he looked up half expecting them to be sitting still but was instead greeted by the sight of tree branches whipping past the windshield remi checked the side mirror both entrance posts had been uprooted like rotten stumpsare they following sam asked not yet theyre both still sitting in the parking lot good let them debate it what sam had thought was a service road was in fact little more than a rutted trail barely wider than the rover as in the parking lot the right side was bordered by an embankment to the left through a veil of trees was the riverbank he gripped the steering wheel tighter and tried to keep the rover from lurching off the pathyouve got a knot on your forehead remi said touching the spot whats the plan get ahead of the ferry and race to the next landing thats where you and your guidebook come in she began flipping through it its less than thorough im afraid theres no stop listed remi shook her head then checked the map and according to this theres no road interesting were on a road that doesnt exist going nowhere are our friends nonexistent as well remi glanced back and ducked her head this way and that to see through the trees no sorry theyre coming the ferry no i dont wait there it is about two hundred yards behind us her eyes brightened its a mississippistyle sternwheeler sam the tract slanted upward and the ground grew more cratered until the rover was bumping over exposed roots at the top of the rise the ground flattened out sam slammed on the brakes twenty feet ahead stood a wall of trees paralleling this a hiking trailsam said the trail to the left goes down to the river sam shifted the rover into park and pushed the tailgate button the tailgate popped open take everything weve got they gathered their belongings raced around to the back and grabbed their backpacksdown the slope the blue nissan rounded a bend in the road and started climbing sam handed remi his pack can you manage these yes run remi took off sam returned to the drivers seat switched the transmission into reverse then jogged beside the rover steering until the rear tires bumped over the lip of the slope he slammed the door and jumped aside the driver of the nissan saw the rover rolling toward him and slammed on the brakes the transmission ticked as he switched into reverse behind him the red nissan came around the corner and skidded to a stoptoo late sam said the rovers back tires bumped over a bundle of exposed roots the tail vaulted then crashed down onto the nissans hood the drivers door opened sam drew the webley crouched down fired a round into it the door slammed shut sam adjusted his aim put a bullet through the red nissans hood for good measure then turned and ran sam caught up to remi a minute later theyd been mistaken the trail didnt go down to the river but rather over it remi stood at the head of the footbridge as sam drew alongside her she handed him his pack behind them through the trees voices called to one another in spanish looks sturdier than the last bridge remi said the construction was remarkably similarplanks crossbeams ropes and two suspension cables to their left they could see the bow of the ferry coming around the bend its funnel belching black smoke aside from a dozen or so people lining the rails and a few on the forecastle the ship was emptycome on sam said and took off in a sprint remi at his heels they stopped in the center of the span the ferry was a hundred feet away sam looked back down the bridge through the trees he glimpsed movement arms flailing someone was trying to climb the sloperemi was leaning over the handrail the drops too far to the forecastle it is sam agreed see the upper deck behind the wheelhouse its fifteen feet maybe less why not the wheelhouse roof its only were trying to stow away wave remi attract attention why riveras less likely to start shooting if hes got an audience always the optimist they started waving smiling hooting people on the forecastle and along the rails saw them and waved back the ferrys bow slid beneath the bridge ten seconds sam told remi hug your pack as soon as you hit the deck bend your knees and roll into it okay up you go sam helped her over the guardrail ready remi gripped his hand youre coming right absolutely when youre down find some cover in case they start shooting the wheelhouse roof disappeared beneath their feet followed a moment later by the funnel black smoke billowed around them sam glanced left through the haze he saw itzli rivera skid to a stop at the head of the footbridge their eyes met for a moment then sam turned away gave remis hand a squeeze and said jump remi fell away into the smoke sam felt the bridge shiver beneath his feet with the pounding of footfalls rivera and his men were coming sam climbed over the railing looked down through the gaps in the smoke he saw remi on the deck scrambling clear on her hands and kneessam pushed off he hit the deck hard bounced once off his pack then rolled right from out of the smoke remi scrambled forward and latched onto his forearm this way he followed her crawling blindly until he bumped into what he assumed was the wheelhouses aft bulkhead they sat together gulping oxygen until their heart rates returned to normal now that they were past the bridge the funnels exhaust cleared fifty yards away rivera and three of his men stood at the bridge railing staring down at them one of the men reached for something in his belt and pulled out a semiautomatic pistol sam reached into his own belt drew the webley held it above his head in profile and gave it a wagglerivera barked something at the man who holstered his gun sam said wave to the nice men remi chapter goldfish point la jolla california mysteries have been solved and enigmas fathomed selma announced walking into the workroom with pete and wendy trailing still on madagascar time sam and remi sat at the worktable each nursing a double espresso as before theyd slept through most of the transatlantic flight home but still they were exhausted after jumping from the bridge onto the paddlewheel steamer they decided to simply act the part of tourists and after cleaning themselves up as best they could strolled the decks and took in the scenery with their fellow passengers not only did no one ask to see their tickets but they were served cocktails and a supper by whitecoated stewards in the main salon after having spent the day crawling through caves wrangling crocodiles fighting rebels dodging falling boulders and being chased through the madagascar countryside sam and remi relished the chance to simply sit and be pampered two hours after they jumped aboard the steamer docked at a pier jutting from a forested peninsula sam and remi disembarked with everyone else and walked through a stone archway onto a wellgroomed gravel path at the end of this they found a fourstory mansion whose architectural style landed somewhere between antebellum plantation house and french country a postmounted plaque read hotel hermitage dumbfounded at finding such a place in the middle of the madagascan wilds sam and remi lingered as the rest of the ferrys passengers proceeded through the pergolacovered lobby entrancebehind them a female voice said in flawless french welcome to the hotel hermitage sam and remi turned to see a smiling black woman in a blue skirt and a crisp white blouse standing before them remi said parlezvous anglais of course madam can i be of assistance sam said it seems weve gotten separated from our tour group might you be able to arrange transportation for us back to tsiafahy the woman smiled bien sur an hour later they arrived in tsiafahy one call to selma took them to a private hostel for the evening and the next morning they were on a charter flight to maputo mozambiquenow selma took a stool beside them you two look tired sam said perhaps we didnt properly regale you with the details of our madagascan adventure selma nodded and waved her hand crocodiles rebels boulders yes i remember meanwhile weve been hard at work unraveling the unravelable thats not a word did we mention the bridge we remi intervened selma you have our full if not fully animated attention good first things first we sent your samples from the outrigger to the lab in point loma we should have results in a couple of days remi as you requested i emailed your pictures of the outrigger and a scan of the orizaga codex to professor dydell he said hell have some preliminary thoughts sometime tomorrowremi saw sams questioning expression and said stan dydell my anthropology teacher at boston college selma did you i didnt give him any details i simply said you wanted him to do a cursory examination moving on to the mysterious mr blaylock selma continued pete and wendy and myselfmostly us wendy said have read through most of blaylocks letters to ophelias sister constance miss cynthia was wrong we think there was love between blaylock and constancemore on her part than his thoughwhy do you say that the first couple of letters blaylock mailed from africa were mostly travelogue blaylock is affectionate in a restrained way he mentions that he wishes he could reciprocate constances feelings but that he wasselma consulted the legal pad before herafraid my grief over my dear ophelia would turn to heartrending guilt he talks a lot about his early days in bagamoyo and even mentions my mission several times but doesnt go into detailor so we thought pete added right after the initial ones we noticed that each of blaylocks letters contained random dots beneath characters within the text sam was nodding a code pull out the marked characters and combine them in a hidden message yes but blaylock ever the mathematician didnt make it that simple ill spare you the details but he used the dates and page numbers to create a subtraction filter for example if the filter is a three you take the letter g subtract three characters and get the letter done of the first things we learned wendy said is that constance ashworth was working for the secret service she was his conduit to the powers that be sam chuckled i did not see that coming how did you find out the hidden message in blaylocks third letter read inform camden ship in bombay for repairs crew maximilian men all quartered stone town what are maximilian men asked remi sam answered after the civil war ended emperor maximilian i of mexico opened his doors to confederate soldiers who wanted to fight on at the time the us was backing partisans who were trying to overthrow maximilian he offered the confederates quid pro quo fight for me first then well take on the us government estimates vary on how many confederates went down there but it was enough that washington was concerned when you combine dudleys report that white men were crewing the el majidi with blaylocks mention of maximilian it adds up to a rogue confederate intelligence operation someone went down to mexico recruited some sailors and dispatched them to zanzibar where the el majidi was waitingto what end to continue where the shenandoah left off i imagine that ship did immense damage while she was active and there were plenty of powerful factions in the confederacy that swore to fight on regardless of the surrenderwendy said what confuses me is how did they get access to the el majidi hard to say one thing we do know is the second sultan of zanzibarthe brother of the man who initially bought the shenandoahhad no love for either his brother or that ship and yet when he had a chance to scuttle her after the hurricane he didnt do it in fact he had her towed to bombay and repaired at what was probably great expensemaybe this secret confederate cabal had already purchased her and the sultan had no choice said pete sams brows furrowed at this he stood up and walked to one of the computer workstations where he began typing after a couple minutes he turned in his seat before he died the first sultan of zanzibar had started to secretly crack down on the slave trade in his country when his brother took over the policy was reversed selma was nodding so if against all odds the confederacy rose again the second sultan would have a builtin market for his slave industryits all speculation of course but the pieces seem to fit okay go back to blaylocks first coded message remi said he mentions camden whos camden camden new jersey is where thomas haines dudley was born selma replied we think it was blaylocks nickname for him rather than an official code name in fact dudley had his own moniker for blaylock jotunits from norse mythology wendy added jotun was a giant with superhuman strength of course sam said jotun i dont know how i missed that remi lightly punched his arm smart aleck dont mind him wendy go ahead selma in another letter to dudley via constance dated july blaylock reported that the el majidinow redubbed shenandoah we presumehad returned to port with her crew already aboard blaylock suspects the repairs on the ship had been completed at least a month prior and that the ship and crew had been at sea since thenwere there any unaccountedfor attacks or losses in the area during that time asked sam dozens for a long time the indian ocean was a bigger pirate haven than the caribbean but we werent able to connect the shenandoah ii to any of the losses its at this point the story gets stranger blaylock ends his report with this line have acquired reliable vessel and received sharpsas in sharps carbines sam asked selma nodded dudley must have arranged for them to be shipped to blaylock selma went on nilohamitic crew learning rapidly and overcoming fear of water expect to be fit to give chase by months end intend to catch them redhanded nilohamitic sam repeated never heard of them i have remi replied nilohamitic is an outdated name for the maasai tribe it appears our mysterious mr blaylock recruited a guerrilla army of maasai warriors to chase down the shenandoah iiwell ill give him this much sam said the man had a flair for the dramatic according to mortons biography of blaylock he lived with the maasai for a while he did selma replied as far as we can tell from his letters he explored the area inland from bagamoyo and became friendly with some maasai thats how he started the recruitmentokay so its july the shenandoah ii has a new crew and shes prepped for battle what then most of what happened next we got from blaylocks coded reports and some of it we matched against what few dated entries we found in his journal a couple weeks later blaylock and his crew put to sea in a boumessentially a large twomasted dhowand begin hunting the shenandoah ii which slipped out of port a few days ahead of them this catandmouse game goes on for a month blaylock hears a report that a ship matching the shenandoah ii s description has sunk two usflagged cargo ships near the gulf of aden according to our databases two ships were sunk in that area around the dates blaylock mentions the losses were attributed to piratesnot far off the mark sam observed though blaylock isnt a seaman he proves an able captain and the maasai an adept crew blaylock knows he doesnt dare attack the shenandoah ii either directly or at sea so all through july and august he does his best to shadow her he gathers intelligence reports and bides his time until the night of september sixteenth he catches the shenandoah ii at anchor off sainte anne island in the seychelles about thirteen hundred miles east of zanzibar blaylock anchors his boum in a nearby cove then he and his men go ashore sneak across the headland and in true pirate fashion swim out to the shenandoah and take her by storm not a single shot is fired but the maasai being the warriors they are show little mercy of shenandoah iis crew of seventyeight only six survivethe captain another officer and four enlisted men blaylocks official report of the capture reaches the us in november he tells dudley that he put the shenandoah iis survivors ashore on sainte anne islanddo we know what became of them remi asked unfortunately i found nothing blaylock then splits his crew between the boum and the shenandoah ii and sets off for the return voyage to zanzibar three hundred miles east of the seychelles they encounter a storm and the shenandoah ii sinksat this sam and remi leaned forward together sinks remi repeated how in the world along with his report to dudley blaylock includes a coded message for constance selma flipped a page on her legal pad and traced her finger down a couple lines having secured the shenandoah we promptly took inventory of her stores and goods to my great surprise in the captains cabin i found a most remarkable item a statuette of a great green jeweled bird consisting of a mineral unfamiliar to me and depicting a species i have never encountered i must admit dear constance i was entrancedsam and remi were silent as they absorbed this finally sam said that explains the line in his journalthe great green jeweled bird and all the bird sketches remi added and maybe what we found in mortons museum in bagamoyo remember all the stuffed birds hanging from the ceiling sam he was obsessed what else did he say in the letter selma im paraphrasing but heres the gist of it hes done his duty for his country not once but twice and he lost his wife in the process he admits he lied to dudley about the shenandoah iis sinking he begs constances forgiveness and tells her he intends to discover where the shenandoah iis crew found the jeweled bird and recover the rest of the treasurewhat treasure sam asked at that point does he have any hint theres more to find if he did he never jotted a word about it at least not in plain text given the nature of his journal it may all be hidden in there somewhere what about the shenandoah iis captains log remi asked if blaylock was assuming the previous crew had found the jeweled bird during their travels the log would be a natural place to starthe never mentions a log but i agree with your assumption sam said my guess he transcribed whatever he found relevant in the captains log to his own journal at any rate selma continued blaylock continued to write constance after the shenandoah iis capture but his letters became more and more irrational you can read them yourself but its clear blaylock was descending into insanityand those are just the plain text portions of the letters pete added weve still got fourteen to decode if were to believe all this sam said then winston blaylock probably spent the remainder of his life sailing the ocean aboard the shenandoah ii scribbling in his journal staring at his jeweled bird and carving glyphs on the inside of the bell while looking for a treasure that may or may not have existed it may be even bigger than that remi said if the orizaga codex is genuine and the outrigger is what we think it is somewhere along the way blaylock may have stumbled onto a secret that was buried with cortes and his conquistadors the true origin of the aztecs chapter goldfish point la jolla california there are a lot of loose ends here sam pointed out he grabbed a nearby legal pad and pen and began writing howwhen did morton obtain blaylocks journal his walking staff and the orizaga codex howwhen did the shenandoahs bell end up buried off the coast of chumbe island how did the clapper come off sam stopped writing what else he asked remi gestured for the pad and he slid it over to her she wrote how much do rivera and his employer know about blaylock how did they get involved what are they after how did rivera know about madagascar she slid the pad back to sam who said i have an idea about one of these what are they after we suspect rivera works for the mexican government correct its a safe bet we also know the current administration president garzas mexica tenochca came into office on a wave of ultranationalismpride in mexicos true precolonial heritage and so forth we also know rivera and his goons all have nahuatlaztec names along with most of mexica tenochcas leaders and cabinet members the aztec groundswell as the press called it won them the electionsam looked around the group and got nods in return what if whoever rivera works for knows the truth about the aztecs what if they knew long before the election remi said we did find what might be nine tourist murders in seven years in zanzibar if our hunch about them is correct the coverup goes back at least that far sam nodded if blaylock truly found what we think he found this could turn mesoamerican history on its head is that enough to kill for wendy asked absolutely remi replied if members of the current government won the election based on a lie and the truth comes to light how long before theyre drummed out of office or even its leaders arrested imagine if after george washington was elected americas first president it was proven he was a traitor its a bit of an applestooranges comparison but you get the ideathen potentially were talking about president garza being directly involved in this pete said sam said he certainly has the kind of horsepower thats been backing rivera from the beginning at this point all weve got to go on is blaylocks journal and letters my gut is telling me the answers are hidden therewhere do you suggest we start selma asked his poem do you have it selma flipped pages on her pad then recited in my loves heart i pen my devotion on engais gyrare i trust my feet from above the earth squared from praying hands my day is quartered the gyrare once twice words of ancients words of father algarismo the first two lines we already figured outhes talking about the bell and fibonacci spirals now we just need to figure out the last four lines they broke into groups selma pete and wendy worked on blaylocks letters to constance ashworth searching for any clues they may have missed while sam and remi retreated to the solarium to pore over blaylocks journal which selma had loaded onto their ipads side by side they reclined on chaise lounges partially shaded by potted palms and billowing ferns the sun streamed through the skylights and cast dappled shadows across the tiled floorafter an hour sam muttered half to himself leonardo the liar pardon that line from blaylocks journal leonardo the liar clearly blaylock was referring to leonardo fibonacci of the sequenceandspiral fame right but why did he add the liar i meant to ask what thats all about the fibonacci sequence wasnt discovered by leonardo he simply helped spread it around europe so he lied about the discovery no he never claimed credit for it and blaylock being a mathematician would have known that im starting to wonder if the line was meant as a reminder to himself go on according to my research the sequence is most often attributed to a twelfthcentury indian mathematician named hemachandra whosurprise surprisealso authored an epic poem entitled lives of sixtythree great menanother line from blaylocks journal which was placed directly across from the leonardo the liar quote certainly sounds intentional remi said but whats it add up to im not sure i need to see that page again back in the workroom sam told wendy i just need to see the area around the sixtythree great men line can do hold on a moment at one of the workstations wendy opened the image in photoshop made some adjustments then said done it should be on your screen now sam studied the image can you isolate and enlarge the area around the sixtythree thirty seconds later the new image appeared sam scrutinized it for a moment too fuzzy im mostly interested in the tiny marks above and below the sixtythreewendy went back to work a few minutes later wendy said try this one the new image resolved on the screen i had to do a little color replacement but im pretty sure the marks are its perfect sam murmured eyes fixed on the screen care to share with the rest of the class remi said weve been assuming blaylock used the fibonacci spiral as some kind of encoding tool on the inside of the bell the problem is at what scale the spirals starting grid size can be anything thats the piece we were missing now we have itexplain said selma blaylocks line about leonardo was meant as a pointer to the sixtythree great men line look above and just to the right of the number three its a quote mark wendy said or the symbol for inches replied pete bingo now look at the dash directly below the sixtythree its a minus sign if you move the inches symbol down and the minus sign up you get this sam grabbed a pad scribbled something and turned it around for everyone to see blaylock is telling us the starting square in his spiral is three inches they quickly realized the mathematics needed to recreate the spiral were beyond their grasp blaylock had devised his bellspiral combination based on his expertise in topology to solve it the fargos needed an expert of their own so sam took a page from remis book and called one of his former professors at caltech as it happened george milhaupt was now retired and living just seventy miles away on mount palomar where hed been playing amateur astronomer at the observatory since leaving the institutesams brief explanation of the problem so intrigued milhaupt that he drove immediately to la jolla arriving two hours after sams call milhaupt a short man in his midseventies with a monks fringe of white hair followed sam into the work space carrying an old leather valise milhaupt looked around said splendid then shook everyones hands where is it he asked where is this mystery not wanting to muddy the waters sam restricted his briefing to the shenandoah the bell and the relevant portions of blaylocks journal when he finished milhaupt was silent for thirty seconds pursing his lips and nodding thoughtfully to himself finally i cant argue with your conclusions sam you were right to call me you were a good math student but topology was never your strong suit if youll bring me the bell your fibonacci calculations and a large sketch pad then leave me alone ill lock horns with mr blaylock and see what i come up withninety minutes later milhaupts scratchy voice came over the houses intercom system hello im done sam and remi and the others returned to the work space sitting on the table amid dividers pencils flexible measuring tapes and a pad covered in scribbles was a sketch as though playing a slowmotion game of musical chairs the group walked around the table eyes fixed on the drawing heads tilting this way and that until finally sam said youve stumped us do you see the tr notation in the upper righthand corner and the numerals near the curve at the bottom leftyes sam said thats my handwriting of course but they were also inscribed on the inside of the bell i suspect it means top right sam and remi looked at him in surprise we missed that remi said dont feel bad they were minuscule without my magnifying glass i would have overlooked them too the tr notations were on the very edge of the bells mouthyou said notations remi replied as in plural there were two i have a second sketch but aside from the order of the symbols each is identical to the other when i saw the two tr notations i assumed they were intended as both orientation points and end points for a pair of spirals as to why there are two spirals i suspect that answer is hidden in the rest of that poem of his as you can see each x mark is accompanied by a designator each represents a different glyph i have a legend with all this written downamazing sam said imagine the patience all this took milhaupt smiled and rubbed his hands together and now id be happy to tackle mr blaylocks poem selma read it aloud well i agree with your assessment of the first two lines milhaupt said as for the other lines i may have some ideas first of all this fellows a very abstract thinkerwhich is especially strange for a mathematicianhe was a character sam agreed we also think he may have been a few sandwiches shy of a picnic ah i see that puts things into perspective well the third linefrom above the earth squaredsuggests to me a pair of spirals that are to be viewed from overhead the notations i found within the bell tend to validate that agreedeveryone nodded the fourth linefrom praying hands my day is quartered the gyrare once twiceis a bit trickier but as were fairly certain about the overhead view issue the praying hands may represent two hands of a clock pointing toward midnight i suspect the words my day is quartered mean mr blaylock has divided his clock into four sectionsmidnight three six and nine and finally following this logic the line the gyrare once twice probably means were to rotate our first spiral to the three oclock position and the second spiral to the six oclock position milhaupt demonstrated rotating his sketches the first on top with the open end of the spiral pointing to the right the second below that the open end of the spiral pointing downward he looked at each member of the group in turn thoughtsno one spoke up me neither he said how about the last line of the poem selma recited it words of ancients words of father algarismo remi said as for the first partwords of ancientswe have a hunch what blaylock meansyoure referring to those aztec glyphs inside the bell milhaupt asked with a cheshire smile i have no idea of their translation of course i assume you do sam nodded theyre from the aztec calendarthirteen months thirteen corresponding symbols clearly mr blaylock was absorbed with the aztecs yes absorbed isnt the word weve been using remi said sam said the second part of the linewords of father algarismohas us stumped i am happy to say i have your answer at last my love of obscure mathematical history has come in handy there is no father algarismo you see its another one of mr blaylocks tricks algarismo is the portuguese derivation of the word algorithm quite simply it means digitremi said then translated the last line reads words of the aztecs combined with numbers sam youre the cryptography guy is any of this ringing any bells sam nodded maybe i seem to remember a page in his journal that was nothing but dots did i imagine that no i remember it wendy said ill find it she disappeared into the archive vault i can see the gears turning in your head said remi whats going on i dont think were meant to combine aztec words with numbers i think were meant to translate them for example take the symbol for flint and replace the letters with corresponding numbersremi was jotting along on her pad a simple substitution code said milhaupt right sam said i think blaylocks spirals are just window dressing look at the two rotated sketches if you straighten out the ends of the spirals you get a horizontal line of glyphs and a vertical line of glyphs essentially a grid said remi wendys voice came over the intercom sam i found that page you mentioned its on the screen selma grabbed the remote and switched on the tv as sam had described the page consisted of nothing more than groupings of seemingly randomly placed dotsrow after row column after columnhow many clusters sam asked remi was already counting one hundred sixtynine thirteen down and thirteen across she smiled same number as your spiral grid idea sam and the same number of months in the aztec calendarmilhaupt said we have a winner now you just need to plug your dots into the grid and figure out what it all means having chased blaylocks riddles for what seemed like months sam now certain he was closing in on his quarry attacked the blaylock dot grid mystery with a gusto that took him through the evening and into the earlymorning hours of the next day translating the aztecnahuatl glyphs first into their anglicized meanings and then into numbers was straightforward but timeconsuming once done he began plugging the dot clusters into their corresponding rows and columns until he had what looked like an lsdinspired sudoku puzzle on steroids next he began experimenting with various cryptographic methods hoping to stumble upon something that clicked shortly before midnight he found just that a binarytype system where the dots positions determined which numbers in the grid were usedafter hearing sams theory remi said youve worked this out tested it i did aside from the empty clusters theyre all latitude and longitude coordinates this is a map chapter goldfish point la jolla california coffee in hand sam and remi walked into the workroom at eight am to find selma pete and wendy standing before a sixfootwide map of the indian ocean tacked to the wall with blue painters tapesix hours earlier at pete and wendys urging sam and remi had gone to bed leaving them to plot the coordinates on a world map of the one hundred sixtynine locations in blaylocks grid eightytwo of them were null pete now explained of the remaining eightyseven fiftythree were located in the middle of the ocean which left us thirtyfour latitude and longitude points that matched up with land thats what you see plotted here the coordinates were marked by red pushpins connected by white string in rough the pins formed a giant inverted v that started near madagascar peaked miles to the northeast at sri lanka and ended off the central coast of sumatra miles to the southeastwhere are the other pins sam asked selma replied we pulled some out most of them well inland we wanted you to see this particular pattern first both remi and sam recognized the gleam in selmas eyes during the night she pete and wendy had discovered something significant go on remi prompted after you got back from madagascar and proposed the easttowest aztec migration theory i started doing a little digging in recent years a number of archaeologists and anthropologists have been finding more and more evidence that the malagasy people of madagascar arrived there in the first or second century having sailed there from indonesiaspecifically the island of sulawesi i came across a map of the route the malagasy were believed to have takenselma picked up the remote and powered up the tv across the room the route depicted as a red line on a map of the indian ocean from the indonesian archipelago to the east coast of africa was nearly identical to the one on the workrooms wall incredible was all sam could say so blaylock beat presentday experts to this theory by a hundred twenty or so years remi said thats impressive but i dont theres more selma said pete and wendy got up on step stools removed the pushpins peeled back the tape and pulled away the map beneath it was a second map this one spanning from the east coast of africa to south america like the first map this one was covered in red pushpins connected by white stringthese are all blaylocks sam asked yes the pushpins began near the coastal city of lumbo in mozambique and proceeded across the waist of africa to the west coast of angola before islandhopping first up the coastline then west across the atlantic to the easternmost bulge of brazil where they turned north and followed the coast of south america past trinidad and tobago and into the caribbean searemi asked are we to believe blaylock visited all these places sam replied he captured the shenandoah in then went treasure hunting for his jeweled bird who knows how long he was at sea it could have been decades for all we knowthis looks familiar remi said pete wendy put the first map up beside this one please they did as she asked remi stared at this configuration for almost a full minute before smiling faintly do you see it she asked see what asked sam in answer remi walked to one of the workstations wendys been teaching me a little photoshop lets see how good a learner i am everybody go sit down this might take me a few minuteswith her upper body blocking the computer monitor no one could see what she was doing at the worktable sam leaned sideways on his stool trying to get a peek forget it fargo remi muttered sorry twenty minutes later remi turned in her seat and addressed the group okay we all remember the orizaga codex everyone nodded remember the symbol spanning the upper half more nods turn on the tv selma ill be damned said sam we were staring at it the whole time it wouldnt win any cartography awards but all the big pieces are there remind me when did the malagasy arrive in madagascarfirst or second century and when did the aztecs first emerge in mexico sixth century the malagasy blaze the first trail from sulawesi then a few centuries later a bigger armadaa hundred ships if the orizaga codex is accuratearrives in madagascar but they dont stop there they keep heading west until they find mexico the journey must have taken years pete said the walk across africa alone would have lasted six months or more if you figure conservatively eight people to an outrigger were talking about as many as eight hundred people sam said it before an exodus remi repliedhow do we know they didnt go around africas southern tip asked wendy two reasons remi said first youll notice that area doesnt appear on their map second they may have tried it but i cant imagine anybody getting around the cape of good hope in outriggersthose are some of the most unforgiving waters on earth sam agreed heres the milliondollar question on your map where exactly does the big question mark fall youve got me indonesias a big place for blaylock it was probably where he thought hed find his treasure for the aztecs it was chicomoztoc when king cuauhtemotzin dictated the codex to orizaga he was trying to show where his forefathers came from but after centuries of having the story handed down through one generation of royalty to the next cuauhtemotzin himself couldnt be more specificpete said what i want to know is why they left in the first place that question was at least partially answered two hours later when remis old professor stan dydell called selma and requested a video conference the group gathered around the tv in the workroom dydells smiling face appeared on the screen in appearance he was the exact opposite of george milhaupt tall thin with a full head of saltandpepper hairgood morning remi nice to see you again and you professor and that man beside you would be sam nice to meet you professor sam introduced pete and wendy dydell nodded in greeting my secretary is helping me with all this you dont mind do you i think technology has outpaced me a bitnot at all said remi i imagine youre anxious to talk about your find so ill get right to it first lets talk about the photos you sent the vessel itself isnt unique canoe shaped two outriggers and a single mast the size is impressive however next im probably not telling you anything you havent already worked out for yourself but the carving on the bowsprit looks remarkably like quetzalcoatl the great plumed serpent god of the aztecs our guess as wellweve talked about quetzalcoatl sam said but whats the significance as in most aztec myth systems quetzalcoatl plays an array of roles that depend on the period and the circumstances in some cases quetzalcoatl was related to the wind the planet venus arts and knowledge he was also the patron god of the aztec priesthood he was also believed to be responsible for the separation of the earth and sky and an essential player in the creation of mankindthats a lot of hats to wear sam remarked and what about the other carving the one on the stern clearly its a bird of some kind but i dont recognize it as for this parchment you have its a copy of the orizaga codex but im guessing you already knew that too yes said remi do you also know you may have the only known copy in existence no we didnt in fact until now it was believed there were no copies just the original heres the short story javier orizaga society of jesus was said to have arrived in mexico as part of cortess landing force he carried with him a whole bevy of monks and suchpresumably to help convert the savages a few months after orizaga penned his codex he was ordered home by the powersthatbe when he got back to spain his codex was confiscated by the church orizaga was jailed and interrogated for two years then released having been denounced by the church and the state he left spain and traveled to what is presentday indonesia where he remained until his death in indonesia again sam murmured professor do we know where exactly in indonesia im not sure i can check for you this codex you have remi where did you find it in africa interesting if its genuine its an incredible find have you had it physically examined not yet youll have to do that eventually for now lets assume its genuine there are a number of things about it that are not just remarkable but potentially groundbreaking sam said you mean that it was dictated to orizaga by the last king of the aztecs that and more i have to admit the upper part has me stumped as for the lower part heres what strikes me the scene in the middle of the parchment clearly depicts a sea voyage of a great number of vessels on the lower left side of the parchment is i think a depiction of the aztecs arrival in the area that would become their capital city of tenochtitlan seeing their stunned expressions dydell chuckled and went on let me refresh your quintessential aztec imagery legend has it that the aztecs knew theyd found their homeland when they came across an eagle perched atop a cactus while eating a snake the image on your codex is depicting essentially the same thing the bird is different and the flora is different and theres no snake but the theme is presentwhy wouldnt it be identical asked sam my guess its a case of what i like to call mdimigrational displacement iconography its a theory ive been toying with for some time essentially its this as ancient peoples migrated they tended to change their myths and imagery to suit their new geography its quite common actually if these old world aztecsfor lack of a better termarrived in mexico nine centuries before the aztec empire rose its perfectly reasonable to think their original iconography would have changed drasticallynot to mention their appearance as they interbred with the localssam and remi looked at each other sam said i can buy that well thats good because that was the easy part dydell said the image in the lower righthand corner the one clearly meant to represent chicomoztoc is where the real wow factor is how closely did you examine the image reminot very she admitted well there are a number of differences between the traditional depiction of chicomoztoc and the one you have first of all theres no high priest at the entrance and the faces you usually find clustered in each of the seven caverns are missing i cant believe i missed that dont be hard on yourself in class we barely touched on chicomoztoc that aside it is whats in the center of the cavern i find so fascinating i took the liberty of enlarging the scan you sent me dydell looked off camera and said gloria would you mind okay good thanks he faced the camera again this image is enlarged four hundred percent gloria says it should be on your screen now do you have it dydell askedwe have it replied sam the first thing youll probably notice is the creature between the two male figures in the middle of the cavern the placement suggests it is a focus of reverence the lower half of the creature appears to be quetzalcoatl the upper half though is hard to make out it could be the tail or something else altogethersam said one of the figures is standing the other kneeling that has to mean something indeed it suggests supplication also did you notice that the figure on the right is holding something its the nahuatl symbol for flint remi said right you are normally i would classify this scene as a sacrificial ceremony of some kind but you have to remember that the aztecs were highly metaphorical in their written language flint can also represent separation and the breaking of old ties now heres the kicker in traditional drawings of chicomoztoc youll find two sets of footprints one set going into the cave and one set going out in your drawing there is only one setand theyre going out sam said when you combine all of thisthe supplicant figure quetzalcoatl the flint the footprintsyou get what i believe is a ceremony of exile the figure on the left along with all of his followers was banished based on the rest of the codex they left chicomoztoc boarded their armada headed west and ended up in mexico to become what history considers the aztec peopleremi asked professor do we know what became of orizagas original codex did the church destroy it or is it tucked away in some archive somewhere neither but im sure theyd intended that it never see the light of day in the church held an auction of old but generally mundane artifactsletters illustrations etcetera apparently someone messed up and the orizaga codex was included in the lot it was purchased by a mexican millionaire i believe a coffee magnatewhat was his name asked sam dydell hesitated thinking garza alfonso or armando i cant remember which they talked with dydell for a few more minutes then disconnected as they often were sam and remi were on the same wavelength almost in unison they said to wendy do you think you can do something to clean up thei know the quetzalcoatl image im on it next sam and remi turned to selma but she was a step ahead of them already seated at her computer typing got it alfonso garza father of cristian garza currently known as quauhtli garza president of mexico and leader of the mexica tenochca partysam and remi shared a smile thats where it all started he said just like blaylock garza got ahold of the codex and caught the bug it consumed him remi nodded and took him somewhere he didnt expect thirty minutes later wendy was done i had to do some creative connectthedots but i think ive got a fair representation of what it wouldve looked liked like originally theres a familiar face sam saidremi nodded blaylocks bird the day ended with a phone call that sam and remi in their exhaustion had forgotten they were expecting selma answered listened for a few moments then hung up and walked to her workstation a minute later the laser printer started whirring she walked back to the table with a sheaf of papersthe lab report on the samples you took from the outrigger do the honors said sam selma scanned the sheets then said the wood is from a durian tree native to borneo indonesia and malaysia score another point for indonesia sam said there seems to be a trend developing the resin you scraped from the hull consisted of the sap from a subspecies of rubber tree also found in indonesia finally the material you scooped from inside the hull they found traces of pandan leaf rattan and gebang palm let me guess remi said all materials used in the construction of natural sail clothselma nodded and all native to indonesia sam added youre batting a thousand replied selma shall i book your flights now or wait until the morning chapter palembang sumatra indonesia the tires crunched on gravel as sam pulled the car off the road and coasted to a stop beneath the boughs of a kapok tree a steady stream of compact cars and scooters whizzed past sams door honking and swerving as though trying to beat a checkered flagokay you win sam said to remi but before i risk my life and step into this traffic to ask for directions let me see the map one more time while like most men sam prided himself on being equipped with a supernatural internal compass that kept him from ever being lost hed also learned to concede those rare times when that compass seemed to be in temporary disrepair now was one of those timestrying to conceal her smile remi handed him the map and sat quietly while sam studied it its gotta be around here somewhere im sure it is as was the case with many of sam and remis revelations since finding the shenandoah s bell buried in the sand off zanzibar winston blaylock had as the saying went been there and done that in this case one of the latitude and longitude points theyd deciphered from his dotgrid system happened to fall where javier orizaga sj had spent the final years of his life it was no coincidence they knew still there were many questions unanswered having spent years hunting for the origin of his great green jeweled bird and discovering along the way the true story of the aztec empire had blaylock heard of orizagas codex and come here looking for a copy or had he found the codex elsewhere and deduced the location the same way sam and remi had similarly what had brought orizaga here a quest for treasure or for the history of a people whose destruction he witnessed an hour after theyd ended their videoconference meeting with professor dydell hed called back with the name of the village orizaga had called home the last two decades of his life palembang sumatra while palembang the venice of the east might have been considered just a hamlet during the sixteenth century today it was not only the oldest city in indonesia dating back to the seventh century but also the biggest in southern sumatra boasting a population of million neither sam nor remi had any grand ideas about what if anything of value theyd find by investigating orizagas adopted homeland however all the hoops theyd jumped through since zanzibar seemed to be leading them in one direction blaylocks quest his journal the maps the codex orizaga himself and now the lab reportall of it pointed toward an unknown location in indonesiait would have made our lives so much easier if orizaga had left an address sam said its a bit inconsiderate really im sure if hed known we were coming he would have remi replied did the woman at the last place say the house was red or green green since arriving in palembang the previous day theyd visited six local museums or historians said to specialize in the predutch colonial period of the citys history so far none of the curators had heard of orizaga and each one had suggested sam and remi go to the citys administrative building and peruse centuries worth of microfiche newspapers for any mention of their friend sam traced his finger along the map occasionally ducking his head so he could see the nearby street signs through the windshield he folded the map and handed it back to remi with a confident smilei know where i went wrong in general or with the directions funny lady sam put the car in gear waited for a gap in traffic then veered out and accelerated twenty minutes of winding down backstreets brought them to an industrial park filled with warehouses behind this they were surprised to find a quiet treelined residential culdesac the houses were small and old but well kept at the end of the circle sam pulled to a stop before what could have passed for a ranchstyle house in anytown usa kelly green with brown shutters and a white picket fence half hidden by redflowering vines they walked up the path mounted the porch steps and knocked on the front door they heard the click of footfalls on wood the door opened to reveal a midfifties white man in crisp khaki pants and a buttondown white shirtyes good afternoon he said with an oxford accent were looking for sukasari house remi said you have found it madam how can i help you were looking for someonea monkwho may or may not have lived in this area in the sixteenth century oh well is that all i thought youd come to try to sell me a vacuum or some pots and pans the man said with a wry smile please come in he stepped back to let them into the foyer my name is robert marcottsam and remi fargo follow me ill make some tea and then tell you everything i know about indonesia in the fifteenth century pardon me for saying this remi said but you dont seem surprised by our question im not here come sit down ill explain he ushered them into a study enclosed by floortoceiling bookcases the floor was covered with a persian rug on top of it were a few rattan furniture pieces around a coffee table sam and remi sat on the sofa ill be just a moment marcott said then disappeared through a side door they heard the clinking of china then a pot whistling he came back in with a tea service filled their cups then sat down across from them who pointed you in my direction marcott askeda woman named ratsami lovely woman knows nothing about sumatran history prior to the twentieth century she was under the impression this was a museum a bit of a language gap im afraid historian versus museum while the official language here is indonesian dialects abound i gave up trying to correct people ten years ago i wrote a book on christianity in indonesia evidently it turned me into a museum marcott got up walked to a nearby shelf retrieved a book and handed it to remigod in java she read it could be worse almost was my publisher wanted to call it jesus in java sam chuckled you chose wisely i would have been inundated with people wanting to know the religious significance of coffee it would have been a nightmare at any rate i came here to research the book fell in love with the place and stayed that was fifteen years ago youre looking for a monk you saidyes a man named javier orizaga a jesuit he would have arrived here in the late s probably ah orizaga fifteen twentyeight marcott said he lived about two miles east of here in fact of course the hut is no longer there i think its a burger restaurant now what can you tell us about him asked remi what do you want to know how much time do you have sam countered unlimited quantities then tell us everything youre going to be disappointed he was an interesting man and he worked hard to help the locals but he was just one of thousands of missionaries that came here over the last half millennium he opened a bible school helped at local hospitals and spent a lot of time in rural villages trying to save soulshave you ever heard of the orizaga codex sam asked marcott narrowed his eyes no but based on the name i somehow think i should have am i about to be terribly embarrassed i dont see why remi said she gave marcott the short version of the codexs history leaving out the specifics about its content or origin marcott smiled fascinating did this codex ingratiate him with the church or was it the opposite the opposite then it was sympathetic to the aztecs i wish i had known all this about him i might have devoted a whole chapter to him there was one interesting story but it didnt really fit into the book so i left it out he died in twentyeight years after arriving hereor at least thats when he was last seeni dont understand remi asked the story goes that in november of that year orizaga announced to his followers and colleagues that he believed hed discovered a sacred place in the junglehe didnt say where exactlyand that he was going to find the what was it marcott paused tapping his index finger on his lower lip oh yes he called it the seven caves or world of the seven caves something along those lines he walked into the jungle and never came back from what i understand orizaga was considered a bit of a nuttheres a lot of that going around sam said so he walked into the jungle and just vanished marcott nodded never seen again i realize it sounds very dramatic but even today disappearances arent uncommon five hundred years ago it was probably a daily event the jungles here are unforgiving even for someone as well traveled as orizaga marcott paused and smiled ruefully talking about the man i find myself really wishing id devoted at least a few pages in the book to his story oh welli dont suppose you still have your primary source material on him do you asked remi no im afraid not but i can do better than that i can take you to my sourceproviding hes still alive that is they followed marcott in his twentyyearold bmw to another residential area in palembangs plaju district here the roads were dirt the houses no larger than six hundred square feet with corrugated tin roofs unpainted plankwood exteriors and mosquitonetting windows beside almost every structure was a tiny vegetable garden and pens containing either chickens or goatsmarcott pulled to a stop before one of the houses sam and remi did the same and got out marcott said he doesnt speak english and hes in his nineties so be prepared who are we meeting apologies dumadi orizaga before he died javier had ten children with a local woman dumadi is a direct descendent of orizaga i thought he was a jesuit said remi he was but at some point he renounced his vowsincluding celibacy obviously maybe because of his ordeal with the church sam offered they followed marcott up the path to a screen door made of twobyfours and threadbare mosquito netting after marcotts fourth fist rap on the jamb an old man in a white tank top shuffled into view he was barely over five feet tall and his face bore mostly indonesian features with touches of spanish thrown in marcott said something to dumadi in indonesian or one of its dialects the old man smiled and nodded and pushed open the door the three of them stepped inside the interior of the home was divided into thirds a twentybytwentyfoot sitting area with four plastic lawn chairs and a cardboardbox coffee table and two side rooms one a bedroombathroom the other a kitchen dumadi gestured for everyone to sittranslating as he went marcott introduced sam and remi then explained that theyd come to palembang to learn more about orizaga dumadi said something he wants to know why youre interested in him marcott replied theyre very guarded about their family here even after five hundred years ancestral veneration is a deeply ingrained tradition for indonesianssam and remi looked at each other never imagining they would find descendants of orizaga they hadnt discussed how to explain their mission lets tell him the truth sam said if the codex belongs to anyone its him remi nodded reached into her carryall and withdrew a manila envelope she flipped through the photos and papers inside then withdrew the scan of the codex she handed it across to dumadisam said to marcott tell him we think this belonged to orizaga and that we believe it has something do with why he came here in the first place marcott translated staring at the scan in his hands dumadi nodded but sam and remi could tell the old man had barely heard marcott the silence dragged out finally marcott said something else to dumadi who laid the scan on the cardboard box climbed to his feet and shuffled off into the bedroom he emerged a moment later carrying a frame he stopped before remi and handed it to her drawn in stylized calligraphy with filigreed edges and intricate swirls and flourishes the original was far removed from the photo but for sam and remi there was no mistaking what they were seeing the pictomap from orizagas codex dumadi pointed at the framed photo then at the scan and said something to marcott who translated he doesnt recognize the bottom portion but the top portions been passed down through his family for centurieswhy asked sam marcott asked listened to dumadis response then said its the orizaga family coat of arms does he know what it means no no one ever talked about what it might mean no marcott replied he says its always been part of the family he assumes it was important to orizaga and thats good enough for him sam flipped through remis manila envelope and withdrew wendys version of the quetzalcoatl bird from the chicomoztoc illustration he handed it to dumadi does that mean anything to him marcott asked listened he smiled and replied which part the ugly snake or the birdthe bird dumadi sat back down with a groan then replied it has no particular meaning to him marcott said its just a bird hes seen them in zoos here remi asked he doesnt remember where exactly he saw one when he was a child his father called it a helmet bird because of the bulge on the back of its head sam opened his mouth to speak hesitated then said what is it whats it called a maleo dumadi says he recalls theyre much prettier than your drawing medium sized black back white breast yellow skin around the eyes and an orangish beak sort of like a colorful chickendumadi said something to marcott who translated he wants to know if this drawing has anything to do with orizaga it does said sam it reminds him of a story about orizaga would you like to hear it yes please remi replied like most of their family stories the details may have changed over time but the gist of it is this near the end of his life orizaga was known by most of the people in palembang and they were fond of him they were also sure he was possessed by a mischievous spiritwhy asked sam marcott listened its similar to what i told you back at my home he wandered the jungles a lot talking about caves and gods and that hed come here to find the home of the gods you get the idea no one was afraid of orizaga they suspected this mischievous spirit was having fun with a poor old man the day orizaga disappeared he announced to everyone that he was again setting out to find his god caves and that he would know the place when he found a hatchery of great birds chapter jakarta indonesia how sure are you about this selma said sam he and remi were sitting on their bed in their suite at the four seasons the day before shortly after leaving dumadis house and parting company with robert marcott theyd boarded a batavia air charter at palembangs sultan mahmud badaruddin ii airport for the twohundredfiftymile hop across the java sea to jakarta the four seasons seemed a decent place for a base of operationsselma said over the speakerphone i confronted him he admitted it that crafty sob i wonder if hes even got grandkids in london going to college or if hes truly dying remi added both are true i checked hes still a con man in my book of the many unanswered questions and curiosities surrounding sam and remis adventure one had been plaguing selma in particular how had rivera and his boss president garza known the fargos would be in madagascar what had prompted the noteandnotify bribe selma believed there were only two possibilities cynthia ashworth keeper of constance ashworths letters or morton proprietor of the blaylock museum and curiosity shop these had been sam and remis greatest sources for research material somewhere along the line had rivera and garza tapped these sources as well cloaked in her best bad cop impression selma started with morton claiming she knew hed sold blaylock material to others and that if morton didnt come clean she was going to take him to court morton broke down within two minutes selma said he didnt know riveras name or how hed come to know about the museum but about five years ago he and a few of his goons showed up asking questions about blaylock and the shenandoah morton says he didnt particularly trust rivera and he suspected theyd get rough with him if he didnt cooperate so that night he moved all the important material out of the museums storeroom and hid it in his home sure enough the next morning he arrived at the museum to find it had been ransacked rivera showed up a few hours later pleasant as can be during the night morton had scrounged up some of blaylocks paperspages from his journal the original manuscript of the biography random drawings and mapsthe moreau madagascar map remi predicted yes hed seen the tiny writing on it and tore away that section and gave the bigger piece to rivera morton says that seemed to satisfy rivera they completed the transaction and rivera left morton being the clever fellow he is figured rivera wasnt quite done so he moved the blaylock material again out of his home to another locationand that night his house was burglarized sam said right morton made it a point to stay out all night with friends the ruse worked he said rivera never returned and then we show up five years later asking the same questions why didnt he pull the same trick on us he said he liked you and he wanted to retire and take care of his grandkids when you offered sixty thousand instead of twenty he decided to throw it all in and hold nothing backthen we dont know what rivera knows do we asked remi no sam replied by dumb luck morton sold him enough to send him down some paths and make some progress but not enough to finish it now with us in the picture rivera and garza can tag along to the end we have to expect theyre going to show upif they havent alreadywhich brings me to my next point said selma we finished decoding the rest of blaylocks letters to constance care to guess the date of his last letter no replied sam even the year selma eighteen eightythree remi replied that means he was out here chasing his treasure for eleven years my god what about the letters in between sam asked there were only a few a year after blaylock captured the shenandoah ii as was his habit the plain text part of the letters was mostly travelogue the rakish man of adventure in the letters he duplicates almost all the tall tales from mortons biography they were window dressing one of his coded messages to constance suggests he was convinced dudley and the others had discovered his lie about the shenandoah ii and were after himwere they not as far as i can tell and if they did know they probably wouldnt have cared the shenandoah ii was gone she was no longer a threat blaylock had done his jobback to his last letter sam prompted right its dated august and was posted from bagamoyo ill quote the relevant part directly have at last discovered the clue for which ive been praying with gods help i will discover the fountainhead of my great green jeweled bird and collect my longdelayed reward sailing tomorrow for sunda strait expect day voyage will write again as possibleyours w you said the sunda strait correct sam asked yes sam paused he closed his eyes for a moment a half smile on his face remi asked what is it blaylock left bagamoyo on august based on his estimated transit time he would have arrived in the sunda within a day or two of august twentyseventhokay the sunda strait was where the krakatoa volcano was august twentyseventh was the day it exploded chapter ashistory buffs sam and remi were well familiar with the eruption of krakatoa the archipelago which covers roughly eight square miles of ocean sits almost dead center in the sunda strait between java and sumatra and consisted of three islands prior to the cataclysm lang verlaten and rakatathe largest island in the group and home to the three volcanic cones collectively known as krakatoa having undergone three major eruptions in the centuries prior to krakatoa was no stranger to turmoil on may twentieth three months prior to the final explosion a great slash appeared in the side of perbuatan the northernmost cone and steam began venting along with plumes of ash that rose twentytwo thousand feet into the atmosphere the residents of the nearby towns and villages having witnessed such activity before paid little attention and by the end of the month their disinterest seemed validated krakatoa settled and remained mostly quiet for the next month on june sixteenth the eruptions began again blanketing great swaths of sea and land with jetblack smoke for nearly a week when the haze cleared massive ash columns could be seen streaming from two of krakatoas cones tides in the straits began running high and ships at anchor had to strengthen their moorings lest they be beached three weeks passed krakatoas two cones were joined by the third and soon ash began accumulating on nearby islands in some places up to two feet thick killing flora and fauna and turning oncelush forests into moonscapes the eruptions continued through the end of june and into midaugust on the twentyfifth of august at one oclock in the afternoon krakatoa went into its paroxysmal phase within an hour a black cloud of ash had risen eighteen miles into the sky and the eruptions were nearly continuous fifteen and twenty miles away ships were bombarded by hot pumice stones the size of softballs by early evening as darkness fell over the strait minor tsunamis were rolling ashore on java and sumatra the next morning just before sunrise krakatoa went into its final death throes a series of three eruptions each one more powerful than the next shook the area so loud were the explosions that they were heard in perth australia two thousand miles to the southeast and in the mauritius islands three thousand miles to the west the resulting tsunamis one for each eruption radiated outward from krakatoa at speeds up to one hundred twentyfive miles per hour bulldozing their way onto the shores of java and sumatra and inundating islands as far away as fifty miles at krakatoa issued its final salvo with an explosion equal to twenty thousand atomic bombs the island of krakatoa tore itself apart the erupting cones having ejected all their magma collapsed in on themselves taking with them fourteen square miles of the island and gouging out a caldera four miles wide and eight hundred feet deep the resulting tsunami wiped out whole villages killing thousands within minutes trees were uprooted and the land stripped of every scrap of vegetation following on the heels of the massive wave came the pyroclastic flows gargantuan avalanches of fire and ash that roared down krakatoas flanks and into the sunda strait traveling at eighty miles per hour and reaching temperatures in excess of twelve hundred degrees fahrenheit the surge boiled the oceans surface below it creating a cushion of steam that carried it thirty miles or more charring or entombing everything in its path manmade and natural alikewithin hours of final explosion what remained of krakatoa fell silent in the space of thirty hours between and people lost their lives chapter sunda strait java sea indonesia the loudspeaker in the corner of the patio cafe came to life attention all ticketed passengers the krakatau explorer will be departing the docks in five minutes please board via the aft gangway the message repeated in indonesian french german then once more in english sam and remi sitting at a corner table beside a trellis covered in blooming bougainvillea finished their coffee and stood up sam dropped a pair of fivethousandrupiah notes on the table and they stepped out from under the awning and onto the dockany sign of them remi asked no you no earlier that morning as the krakatau explorer tour van pulled out of the four seasons turnaround sam thought hed caught a glimpse of itzli rivera but theyd seen nothing more during the ninetyminute ride from jakarta to the carita beach resort docks while riding in a van packed with other tourists wasnt sam and remis preferred style of adventuring they were keenly aware that if rivera and his men were in fact here being caught alone on a lonely road in the javan rain forests could be disastrous moreover this boat tour of what remained of the krakatoa volcano and the newly opened krakatau museum was not only a first step in following blaylocks illfated trailif there was one left to followbut also an efficient way of drawing rivera out and forcing his hand the last thing the mexican needed was to lose his quarry yet again for sam and remi it was akin to swimming with sharks better to have them in sight than wondering when they were going to swim out of the gloom and attack they joined the line of lastminute boarders at the aft gangplank then boarded and chose a spot at the starboard rail the krakatau explorer was a hundredtwentyfoot flatbottomed skiff ferry with an oblong pitchroofed wheelhouse nestled high on the forecastle the afterdeck measuring eighty feet by forty feet was divided into rows by bluevinylcovered bench seatingsam kept one eye on the docks while remi scanned the other passengers she estimated there were sixty aboard still nothing she said here too on the dock a pair of workers detached the gangplank and pulled it away from the ferry a crewman on deck shut the gate the mooring lines were singled up and hauled aboard three more crewmen appeared at the rail and pushed off the dock with poles with a blare from the explorers whistle the engines started and the ferry chugged away from the docks and headed west into the strait three hours later an indonesianaccented voice came over the intercom ladies and gentlemen shortly the captain will be bringing the krakatau explorer around the islands headland for our approach to the museum as promised within minutes the ferry turned to port and headed east along the islands north shoreline passengers crowded the rail to stare up at the sheer twothousandfoothigh cliffall that remained when the majority of the island collapsed into the sea the ferry pulled alongside the museums dock and the mooring lines were secured and the gangplank lowered sam and remi disembarked and headed toward the main building anchored to the seabed at the western edge of the caldera the fivethousandsquarefoot museum was constructed of inchthick tempered glass and whitepainted steel crossbeams according to the brochure sam and remi had picked up at the four seasons the museum contained the single largest collection of krakatoa memorabilia and source material in the world the inside was fully airconditioned the decor minimalist with bamboo floors taupe walls and vaulted ceilings the space was divided into sections by threequarter walls that displayed period photographs artwork and illustrations while freestanding platforms held artifacts that survived the disaster each section also contained a multimedia kiosk complete with an lcd monitor and touchscreen controls sam and remi strolled around on their own until they were approached by one of the guides a young indonesian woman in an aquamarine dress welcome to the krakatau museum may i answer any questions for youwere particularly interested in what ships might have been anchored in the strait at the time of the explosion remi said certainly we have an alcove dedicated to just that this way please they followed the woman through several alcoves before arriving at one labeled the maritime effects two of the walls were devoted to enlarged daguerreotype photos of the straits and surrounding bays and harbors the third wall held copies of pages from ships logs newspaper accounts letters and illustrations on the platforms in the center of the room was a collection of salvaged hardware presumably from vessels caught in the explosionhow many ships were in the area at the time asked remi officially fourteen but on any given day in there were hundreds of small fishing vessels and cargo boats sailing back and forth of course it was easier to account for the ships because of insurance claims also we were able to crossreference captains logs to account for all the vessels presentstanding before a plaque on the far wall sam asked is this a list of the ships and their crews yes i recognize one of these names the berouw the guide nodded im not surprised the berouw is somewhat famous she was a sidewheel steamer that was anchored in lampung bay fifty miles from krakatoa she was picked up by one of the tsunamis and carried several miles up the koeripan river the ship was found almost completely intact but her entire crew was killedthere are only thirteen names remi said pardon me on this list you mentioned fourteen ships but there are only thirteen listed here are you sure the guide stepped up to the plaque and counted the names youre right thats odd well im sure its an administrative error remi smiled thanks for your help i think well wander around a bit certainly if youre so inclined feel free to experiment with the kiosk all of the documents in our collectioneven those not on displayare available for viewing remi walked over to the wall of photographs where sam was standing she said i was half hoping the shenandoahs name would be on the listwould a picture do sam said what he pointed at the uppermost photo on the wall a fourbysixfoot enlargement the plate beside it read looking northeast from the deck of british cargo vessel salisbury anchored eleven miles east of krakatoa august th shown pulau island legundi and mouth of lampung bay do you see it sam asked i see it in the foreground of the photo against the backdrop of pulau legundi was a squarerigged threemasted clipper ship her upper hull painted black it doesnt mean anything remi said im sure there were plenty of ships of that era that looked identical to the shenandoahi agree lets find out shenandoah was two hundred thirty feet twelve hundred tons and rigged for battle i guarantee you that a ship like that sails into the sunda straits any captain or officer of the watch worth a damn is going to make note of it they walked to the kiosk played with the touch screen for a few moments then began searching the museums archives which were organized and crossreferenced by subject date and key word after an hour of trying various word combinations sam found an entry made by the captain of a german merchant ship named minden he brought the translated text up on the screen th august hours passed close astern by sail amp steam clipper ship identity unknown eight cannon ports observed on starboard beam vessel declined to return hail anchored on south side of pulau legundisam scrolled through a few more entries then stopped again th august eruptions worsening nearly swamped by rogue wave have ordered crew to prepare for emergency departure here we go sam murmured he tapped the touch screen and another log entry filled the screen th august proceeding flank speed course hoping to reach leeward side of pulau sebesi unidentified clipper ship still anchored south side of pulau legundi again refused hail sam kept scrolling then stopped thats it the mindens last entry could be her the time frame is right so is the description eight cannon ports the same number as the shenandoah and if it was remi replied the mindens last entry was two hours before krakatoas final eruption whatever ship they saw probably made a run for it and either got clear or was overtaken by the tsunami or the pyroclastic flowtheres one more possibility sam replied which is she suffered the same fate as the berouw she was picked up and carried inland wouldnt she have been found by now maybe maybe not sumatras a big island sam where do you propose we start sam pointed up at the picture again the last place she was anchored hello fargos a voice said behind them sam and remi turned around standing before them was itzli rivera sam said we keep running into each other frankly its something we could do without i can arrange that as long as we help you finish what you havent been able to on your own you read my mind the problem with that plan remi said is that it ends with you killing us it doesnt have to be that way yes it does replied sam you know it and we know it even now we know enough about garzas dirty little secret to topple his government compared to your other victims weve got a mountain of information you murdered a woman in zanzibar just because she found a swordand eight others for much less probably remi added rivera shrugged and spread his hands what can i say how about wheres the tallest building i can jump off of heres a better question why dont you give me all your research and ill tell my boss i killed you remi said after all weve been through together you still think were that gullible youre a slow learner mr rivera youve been lucky so far it wont happen again sam said let me see if im understanding you correctly option one we give you everything weve got and you murder us option two we give you nothing and see how much farther our luck takes us when you put it that way i can see your point rivera replied so lets change the terms you give me what i want and i promise to kill you quickly and painlessly or we continue to play our catandmouse game and i will eventually catch you and torture your wife until you give me what i wantsam took a step forward he stared hard into riveras eyes you need to learn some manners rivera pulled back his jacket a few inches to reveal the butt of a gun and you need to learn some discretion so my wife tells me youre stubborn both of you were going to leave together right now if you fight me or try to attract attention ill shoot your wife then you lets go i have a boat outside well walk outside andno pardon me you heard me im not bluffing mr fargo ill shoot you both i believe youll try dont think ill make it easy nobody will stop me ill be gone before the authorities arrive then what did you really think wed come here carrying all our proof youve really got a problem with underestimating people youve searched our hotel room and found nothing correctyes all weve got with us is a few pictures and theyre nothing you havent already seen if you kill us here everything goes public by the time you get back to mexico city every news channel will be running the storyyou wouldnt be here if you had everything you needed you dont have what blaylock found or what he was after that makes two of us what youre forgetting is ive dedicated myself to keeping this secret for almost a decade youve been involved for a few weeks whatever you find whatever story you tell well spin it the other way you know who i work for and you know how powerful he is even if you manage to survive by the time were done with you youll be a pair of moneyhungry spotlightseeking treasure hunters who created a fantastic lie for their own personal gainwell still have our health remi said sweetly and our sense of humor sam added if youre so confident why dont you go home and let the chips fall where they may i cant do that im a soldier ive got my orders then were at an impasse either shoot us or walk away rivera considered this for a few moments then nodded have it your way remember mr and mrs fargo i gave you a chance to make this easy no matter what else happens im going to make sure you die in indonesia chapter lampung bay sumatra sam eased back on the boats throttles and brought the bow around until they were beam on to the wind the boat slowed to a stop then began rocking from side to side a few hundred yards to port was mutun one of the dozens of tiny forested islands that lined both coasts of the bay to starboard in the distance indah beachokay one more time he said weve been over this sam several times the answers still no if youre staying im staying so lets go home you dont want to go home true but youre starting to make me angry fargo and he knew it when remi started using his surname it was a sign that her patience was wearing thin following their encounter with rivera at the museum theyd caught the next ferry for the sol marbella landing about fifteen miles from the cartita beach docks while they waited for the ferry to get under way sam kept his eye on riveras speedboat until finally losing sight of it when it passed behind the tanjung headland to the southwest once back on the javan mainland they hired a taxi to take them back to the four seasons where they quickly packed headed for the airport and boarded the next batavia air charter across the straits to lampung they touched down shortly before nightfall and found a bayside hotel down the coast a few miles where they called selma the sooner they reached pulau legundi the better sam and remi reasoned though theyd half expected rivera to turn up his sudden appearance at the museum combined with his menacing promise drove home the point that they needed to move quickly to that end selma worked her magic and arranged for a twentyfourfoot motorized pinisia type of narrow flatbottomed ketchand all the necessary supplies to be waiting for them at the docks before sunrise now nearing noon theyd covered a third of the distance to pulau legundiremi said weve never let people like rivera run us off before why should we start now you know why she stepped up to him and laid a gentle hand on his shoulder drive the boat sam lets finish this together sam sighed then smiled youre a remarkable woman i know now drive the boat by late afternoon what had merely been a smudge on the overcast horizon began to resolve into the islands lush green peaks and craggy coastline shaped like a jagged comma the uninhabited pulau legundi was roughly four miles long by two miles wide like all the other islands in and around the sunda strait it had once been blanketed by volcanic ash from krakatoa a hundred thirty years of wind and rain and an everpatient mother nature had transformed the island into an isolated patch of thriving rain forest just over twentyfour hours after leaving jakarta with the sun setting over the legundis peaks sam turned the pinisis bow in to a sheltered cove on the eastern shoreline he gunned the engine and slid the bow onto a tenfootwide strip of whitesand beach and remi jumped out sam tossed down their packs and followed her he secured the bowline to a nearby tree remi unfolded the tourist map theyd purchased at the hotelthe best they could do in a pinchand laid it on the sand they crouched down before leaving the museum sam had studied a few digital maps on the kiosk and mentally marked the ships position from here its less than a mile to the western side he said as best i can tell the shenandoahassuming it was her im praying it was her my best guess puts her here in this shallow bay if were using the berouws fate as a modelyes run that by me again according to accepted history the berouw was the only true ship to be pushed inland anything smaller was either driven to the bottom of the strait or instantly destroyed by the final tsunami my theory is this what made the berouw different is that she was anchored at the mouth of a rivera path of least resistance remi said exactly she was driven inland via a preexisting gouge in the terrain if you draw a line from krakatoa through the ships anchorage and onto the island you see a leaning closely over the map remi finished sams thought a ravine a deep one bracketed on both sides by fivehundredfoot peaks if you look closely the ravine ends below this third peak a few hundred yards shy of the opposite shoreline one mile long and a quarter mile wide whats to say she wasnt crushed into dust or shoved up and over the island and slammed into the seabed remi asked were twentyfive miles from krakatoa the berouw was fifty miles away and she ended up miles inland two reasons one the peaks around our ravine are far steeper than anything around the river and two the shenandoah was at least four times as heavy as the berouw and ironframed with doublethick oak and teak hull plates she was designed to take punishmentyou make a good case lets hope it translates into reality i do however have one more nagging detail shoot how would the shenandoah have survived the pyroclastic flow as it happens i have a theory about that care to hear it hold on to it if you turn out to be right you can tell me if youre wrong it wont matter within five minutes of breaching the tree line they realized madagascars forests didnt hold a candle to those of pulau legundi the trees so densely packed that sam and remi frequently had to turn sideways to squeeze between them were also entwined in skeins of creeper vines that looped from tree trunk to branch to ground by the time theyd covered a hundred yards sams shoulder throbbed from swinging the machete they found a closetsized clearing in the undergrowth and crouched down for a water break insects swirled around them buzzing in their ears and nostrils above the canopy was filled with the squawks of unseen birds remi dug a can of bug repellant from her pack and coated sams exposed skin he did the same for herthis could be a positive for us sam said what do you see how most of the tree trunks are covered in a layer of mold and creepers its like armor whats good for the trees could be good for ship planking he took another sip from the canteen then handed it to remi the going will get easier the higher we go he said define easier more sunlight means fewer creeper vines and higher means steeper remi replied with a game smile lifes a tradeoff sam checked his watch two hours to sunset please tell me you remembered to pack the mosquito hammock i did but i forgot the hibachi the steaks and the cooler of icecold beer this one time ill forgive you they pressed on for another ninety minutes moving slowly but steadily up the western slope of the peak pulling themselves along using exposed roots and drooping vines until finally sam called a halt they strung their doublewide hammock between two trees doublechecked all the mosquito nets seams then crawled inside and shared a meal of warm water beef jerky and dried fruit twenty minutes later they fell into a deep sleep the jungles natural symphony woke them just after sunrise after a quick breakfast they were on the move again as sam had predicted the higher they climbed the more the foliage thinned until they were able to move without the aid of the machete at they broke through the trees and found themselves standing on a tenfootwide granite plateauthats what i call a view remi said shrugging off her pack spread before them were the blue waters of the sunda strait twentyfive miles away they could see the sheer cliffs of krakatoa island and beyond that javas west coast they stepped to the edge of the plateau five hundred feet below them at the bottom of a sixtydegree slope lay the floor of the ravine on either side of it were the peaks that formed its northern and southern walls the ravine itself was more or less straight with a slight curve as it neared the far shoreline a mile awaysam pointed at the patch of water visible beyond the ravines mouth thats almost exactly where she was anchored let me ask you a question why didnt we start over there and just stroll up the ravine a couple reasons one thats the windward side of the strait i might be a tad paranoid but id wanted us to have some cover from prying eyes and the second reason better vantage point remi smiled you were half hoping wed find a mast jutting out from the canopy down there werent you sam smiled back more than half hoping i dont see anything though you no now might be the right time to tell me your theory how would the shenandoah have survived the pyroclastic flow well you probably know the scientific term for it but im thinking of the pompeii effect pompeii italy famous for having fallen victim to another volcano mount vesuvius in ad was also renowned for its mummies stilllife casts of pompeiis inhabitants in the final moments of life like krakatoa vesuvius had unleashed an avalanche of blistering ash and pumice that rolled over the village both charring and entombing virtually everything before it humans and animals unlucky enough to be caught in the open were instantly broiled alive and buried as the bodies decomposed the resulting fluids and gasses hardened the interior of the shelli think thats the term for it actually the principle is a little different here though thats what im counting on assuming the shenandoah was driven here she would have been waterlogged from the tsunami and blanketed in thousands of tons of soaked vegetation and trees when the pyroclastic flow came all the moisture would have flashed into steam and hopefully the blanket of foliage would have been charred instead of the shipremi was nodding then all of it was buried in several feet of ash and pumice thats my theory why hasnt it been found already sam shrugged nobodys been looking for it how many artifacts are eventually found just feet from where everyones been excavating for years too many to count plus the shenandoah was only two hundred thirty feet long and thirtytwo feet wide that ravine issam did the calculation in his headtwentyfive times longer and forty times wideryoure no dummy sam fargo remi looked down the slope before them what do you think she asked straight down sam nodded i think we can manage it the going was slow but not particularly treacherous using the trunks of diagonally growing trees as makeshift steps they picked their way down the slope and back into deeper jungle the sun dimmed through the canopy leaving them in twilight sam called a halt for a water break after a few gulps he wandered off along the hillside with a be right back over his shoulder he returned a minute later with a pair of heavy straight sticks and handed the shorter of the two to remia poker she asked yes if shes here the only way were going to find her is legwork likewise if shes covered in a layer of petrified vegetation and ash there are going to be gaps and voids if we probe enough ground were sure to find somethingassuming dont say it for the next six hours as the afternoon wore toward evening they marched side by side across the ravine floor and up and down hillocks poking with their sticks and doing their best to keep to a northsouthoriented switchback patternsix oclock sam said glancing at his watch well finish this line then call it a night remi laughed wearily and retreat to the lovely confines of our hammock she stumbled forward and landed with an umph sam strode over and knelt beside her are you okay she rolled over pursed her lips and puffed a strand of hair from her cheek im fine getting clumsy with exhaustion sam stood up and helped her to her feet remi looked around wheres my stickat your feet what where sam pointed down jutting two inches from the loam was the tip of remis stick sam said either thats a fantastic magic trick or youve found a void chapter pulau legundi sunda strait stepping carefully they backed up a few feet and scanned the ground nearby anything sam asked no hop onto that tree if we havent fallen through yet we probably wont just humor me remi backed up until her butt bumped into the trunk then turned and climbed onto the lowermost branch sam shrugged off his pack and laid it on the ground next holding his stick parallel to the ground at waist height like a tightrope walker he crept forward until he was standing over the tip of remis stick he knelt down placed his stick in front of his knees then pulled remis free he dug his headlamp from the thigh pocket of his cargo pants and shone the beam into the holeits deep he said cant see the bottom what do you want to do what i want to do is widen it and crawl down there but its almost dark lets set up camp and wait for daylight they slept fitfully passing the hours dozing and talking their minds imagining what might lay only feet away from their hammock having both metaphorically and literally traced the same course winston blaylock followed during his quest sam and remi felt as though theyd been hunting for the shenandoah for years they waited until enough morning sun was filtering through the canopy to partially light their work then ate a quick breakfast and climbed back up the hillock to the hole left by remis stick this time equipped with a thirtyfoot coil of nylon boating rope that had come with the pinisi remi looped one end of the line twice around the nearest tree the opposite end of the line sam formed into a makeshift horse collar that he slipped over his shoulders and tucked under his armpitsluck said remi sam paced over to the hole and knelt down carefully he began jabbing with the stick knocking chunks of loam and congealed ash into the unseen voids below backing away on his knees as the hole widened after five minutes work it was the size of a manholesam stood up and called over his shoulder have you got me remi grabbed the line tighter took in the slack and braced her feet against the trunk ive got you sam coiled his knees and jumped a few inches off the ground he did it again a little higher he paused and looked around see any cracks all clear sam stomped on the ground once then again then six times in quick succession i think were okay remi tied off her end of the line and joined sam at the hole he unraveled the horse collar and knotted it around the strap on his headlamp then clicked the lamp on and started lowering it into the hole counting forearm lengths as he went the line went slack at the bottom of the hole the headlamp lay on its side they leaned forward and peered into the gloomafter a moment remi said is that a no cant be a skeleton foot yes it can be he looked up at her tell you what why dont i go first great idea after retrieving the headlamp they spent a few minutes tying climbing knots in the rope then dropped it back into the hole sam slid his feet into the opening wiggled forward and began lowering himself hand over hand like a geologist examining an exposed cliff face sam felt as though he were descending through history the first layer of material was regular soil but passing two more feet the color changed first to light brown then a muddy grayim into the ash layer he called clumps and veins of what appeared to be petrified wood and vegetation began appearing in the ash his feet touched the bottom of the shaft hed excavated from above he kicked toeholds into the sides of the shaft and slowly transferred his weight to his legs until he was certain he was steady jutting from the side of the shaft was what theyd thought was a skeletal footits a tree root he called thank god next one will probably be the real thing i know stick please remi lowered it down to him using both hands he worked the stick first like a posthole digger then like a pot stirrer knocking and scraping at the shaft until he was satisfied with the width plumes of ash swirled around him he waited for the cloud to settle then squatted on his haunches and repeated the process until hed opened four more feet of shafthow deep so far remi called eight feet give or take sam lifted the stick up and slid it into his belt were going to have to evacuate this debris hold on a moment later remi called bag coming down one of their nylon stuff sacks landed on his head knotted to the drawstring was some paracord sam squatted down filled the bag with the debris and remi hauled it up two more times cleared the shaft sam began lowering himself again under the weight of the layers above the mixture here had become more and more compressed until finally at the tenfoot mark the color morphed again from gray to brown to black sam stopped suddenly he felt his heart lurch he turned his head sideways trying to aim the headlamps beam at what had caught his eye he found it again then braced his feet against the shafts sides to steady himselfive got timber he called there were several seconds of silence then remis faint voice im dumbfounded sam describe it its a horizontal piece about three inches thick i can see eight to ten inches of it three inches thick is too thin to be the spar deck could it be the deckhouse roof the only other raised structures were the stack the engineroom skylight the wardroom skylight and the wheelhouse do you see any traces of glassno im moving on again he reached the bottom of his excavation they evacuated more debris then he kicked out his toeholds and went to work with the stick on his first strike he heard the solid thunk of wood on wood he did it again with the same result he dug out the remainder of the shaft then craned his neck downward illuminating the bottom with his headlampive got decking he shouted he lowered himself until his feet touched the deck the wood creaked and bowed under his weight after shoving debris to one side with his boot he slammed his heel down and got a satisfying crack in reply a dozen more stomps opened a ragged twofoot hole the rest of the detritus plunged through the openingim going through hand over hand he lowered himself through the deck the light from the surface receded and faded leaving him suspended in the glow of his headlamp his feet touched a hard surface he tested his weight on it it was solid cautiously he released the ropeim down he called looks okay im on my way remi replied two minutes later she was beside him she clicked on her headlamp and illuminated the hole above their heads that has to be the deckhouse roof which would make this the berth deck said sam and a tomb they quickly realized panning their beams around the space running down each side of the space at sporadic intervals were twenty or so hammocks hanging from the overhead all of the hammocks were occupied the remains were mostly skeletal save patches of desiccated flesh on whatever body parts werent covered in clothingits like they simply lay down and waited to die said remi thats probably accurate sam replied once the ship was buried they had three choices suffocation starvation or suicide lets move on you choose the only blueprints theyd seen for the ship had come from the original shipbuilder they had no idea what if any changes either the sultan of zanzibar or blaylock might have made to the interior layout this berth deck seemed close to the original but what about the rest of the ship remi chose forward and started walking the deck was almost pristine had they not come in the way they had it wouldve been impossible to tell they were under fourteen feet of earthhas to be the lack of oxygen remi said its been hermetically sealed for a hundred thirty years their beams swept over a wooden column blocking their path the foremast remi asked yes on the other side of this they found a bulkhead and two steps leading up into what had once been the petty officers quarters it had since been turned into a storage compartment for timber and sailclothlets head aft sam said providing blaylock wasnt on deck when they got hit im guessing hed be in either the wardroom or his quarters i agree as much as id love to explore i think this is one of those discretion equals valor moments remi nodded this will take a full archaeological team and years of work they walked aft their footfalls clicking dully on the deck and their murmured voices echoing off the bulkheads they stepped through the berthdeck hatch and found themselves facing another mast this one the main on the other side of this were a bulkhead and a ladder leading up to the main deckdead end remi said unless we want to push through to the main deck and tunnel our way aft to the wardroom lets call that plan b according to the blueprints on the other side of this bulkhead are the coal bunkers the upper level of the engine room then the aft hold the sultan was known to deal in illicit cargo from time to time lets see if he made any covert adjustments to the layout the bulkhead was six feet high and ran the width of the thirtyfoot deck using their headlamps sam and remi scanned the bulkhead from one side to the other directly below the spot where the ladder pierced the deck above remi spotted a quartersized indentation in one of the planks she pressed her thumb into it and was rewarded with a snick a hinged hatch swung downward sam caught it then lowered it the rest of the way on tiptoes he peered into the openinga crawl space he said its heading in the right direction sam boosted remi through the hatch then chinned himself up and followed they headed aft knees and hands bumping along the wood were over the coal bunkers i think sam said ten more feet and remi said bulkhead coming up they stopped the sound of remis fingers tapping and probing the bulkhead filled the crawl space snick eureka she said another hatch she crawled through this opening and disappeared sam heard the clang of her feet hitting grated steel he crawled to the hatch directly ahead was a stanchion he grabbed it and used it to ease himself outthey were standing on a railed catwalk they walked to the edge and shined their headlamps down illuminating shadowed shapes of machinery girders and piping they walked along the catwalk to the aft bulkhead where they found a short ladder leading upward to yet another hatch once through this hatch they found themselves hunched over in the fourfoottall aft holdsam panned his light around trying to orient himself were directly below the wardroom theres got to be another i found it remi called from a few feet away sam turned to see her standing before a dangling ceiling hatch she smiled crafty devil the sultan she said do you think this was for his harem i wouldnt put it past him sam waddled over and formed stirrups with his hands up you go once on the deck above they found themselves standing in a thirtyfootlong corridor at their backs was the shenandoahs third mast the mizzen along the starboard side of the corridor were five doors these would be officers quarterssam checked the first door the head he whispered in turn they checked the remaining doors the second and third rooms were empty but not so with the fourth and fifth lying faceup in each of the tiered bunk beds was a skeletonburied alive remi murmured my god i wonder how long it took however long it took it must have been a nightmare at the end of the corridor they turned right through another doorway and into the portside corridor heading forward one side was lined with more quarters on the other a single door led into the wardroomdo you want to look asked sam not particularly itll be more of the same one more room to check then they turned around a few feet aft was a thick oaken door with heavy wrought iron hinges and a matching latch handle captains quarters sam said my hearts pounding mine too you or me remi asked ladies first sam aimed his headlamp over remis shoulder helping to illuminate her path she stepped up to the door placed her hand on the latch and after a moments hesitation depressed the thumb lever and pushed half expecting the cliched creak of hinges they were surprised when the door swung noiselessly inward from their research they knew the captains quarters aboard the shenandoah measured eighty square feet ten feet long by eight feet wide compared to the officers berths and especially the enlisteds bunk rooms it was luxurioussam and remi saw him at the same time directly ahead of them facing the four mullioned stern windows was a rocking chair jutting above the chairs headrest was a skull bare save a few strands of whitish yellow hair and some bits of scabrous fleshremi stepped across the threshold sam did the same headlamp beams focused on the figure in the chair they paced forward then circled around either side of the chair winston blaylock was dressed as they had imagined him for the past three weeks calfhigh boots khaki pants and a hunting jacket even as a skeleton his stature was impressive wide shoulders long legs barrel chest his hands were lying palms up in his lap cradled there staring up at sam and remi was a footballsized maleo statuette its facets sparkling green in their flashlight beams without a word between them sam gently reached down and lifted the maleo from blaylocks lap they stared at the man for another full minute then searched the cabin they found neither a logbook nor documents save three sheets of parchment blaylocks neat scrawl covered both sides of each sheet remi scanned their contentsthree letters to constance she said dates sam asked august fourteen august twentieth and remi hesitated the last ones dated september sixteenth three weeks after the shenandoah was buried here they retraced their steps forward through the starboard corridor down through the hatch back through the engine room and through the crawl space to the berth deck remi climbed up through their excavated shaft waited for sam to secure the maleo to the end of the rope then hauled it up to the surface she dropped the line back down and sam went uptogether they collected an armload of twigs and small branches then built a latticework over the shaft and covered it with loam it doesnt seem right just leaving them down there remi said well come back sam replied well make sure that hes taken care ofthat theyre all taken care of each lost in his or her private thoughts the climb back up to the plateau passed quickly three hours after leaving the shenandoah they were picking their way down the trail sam had hacked remi was in the lead through the trees sam glimpsed the white sand of the beach their pinisi was goneremi stop sam rasped on instinct he shrugged off his pack unzipped the top pocket grabbed the maleo and tossed it into the brush he donned his pack again and kept walking what is it remi replied turning around she saw the expression on her husbands face she stiffened whats going on she whispered from somewhere to the right hidden in the trees came itzli riveras voice its called an ambush mrs fargo step backward rivera ordered five more feet and youre on the sand mr fargo theres a rifle trained on your wife one more step mrs fargo remi complied drop your pack remi did so now you come forward mr fargo hands up sam walked down the trail and stepped onto the beach to the right rivera stepped from the trees to the left another man armed with an assault rifle did the same rivera lifted a portable radio to his mouth and said something ten seconds later a speedboat glided around the peninsula and into the cove six feet from the beach it stopped on board were two more men also armed with assault riflesdid you find her rivera asked sam saw no point in lying yes was blaylock aboard yes sam and remis eyes locked each one was expecting the same question to come next rivera said did you find anything interesting three letters in spanish rivera barked search them to the man behind sam and remi he came forward snagged each of their packs and dragged them ten feet away he searched each pack and found their iphones and their satellite phone he crushed each one under the butt of his rifle then kicked the pieces into the water finally he frisked sam and reminothing the man reported to rivera just the letters you can have them rivera said in trade im going to take your wife the hell you are sam took a step toward rivera sam dont remi shouted the man behind sam rushed forward and slammed the butt of his rifle into sams lower back just above the kidneys sam stumbled forward dropped to his knees then climbed back to his feetsam took a calming breath rivera you can take you instead no thank you he reached into his pocket pulled out a cell phone and tossed it to sam its prepaid and untraceable with three minutes of talk time left youve got twentyfour hours to determine the location of chicomoztocthats not enough time thats your problem to solve when youve got the location dial star sixnine on that phone ill answer at twentyfour hours and one minute ill kill your wife sam turned around to face remi he said everythings going to be okay remi she forced a smile i know rivera ordered take her at gunpoint remi was marched into the water to the boat the two men aboard lifted her over the gunwale and shoved her down into one of the rear seats sam turned back to rivera who said do i have to tell you not to involve the police or any of that nonsense no your boat is anchored on the other side of the peninsula ill hunt you down whats that if you hurt her ill spend the rest of my life and every penny to hunt you down rivera smiled thinly i believe youd try chapter twentytwo hours later southern sulawesi sams eyes scanned the gauges checking airspeed altitude oil pressure fuel as was everything else aboard the airplane the few dashboard labels that hadnt worn off completely were in serbian the ikarus kurir seaplane painted an ugly shade of grayblue was sixty years old a castoff from the yugoslavian air force the windows leaked the engine knocked the wheeled pontoons were badly dented and the controls were so soft there was a twosecond delay between the time he pushed the pedals and the plane respondedhed never been happier with a plane in his life a thousand miles east of jakarta the ikarus had been the only seaplane available for rent purchase or theftand provided he didnt crash in the next hour it would take him to remi whether they stayed alive over the next few hours or days would depend largely on the credibility of the hail mary pass he and selma had assembled as soon as riveras speedboat had disappeared from view sam had retrieved the maleo statuette grabbed his pack and sorted through their belongings taking only the essentials blaylocks letters went into a ziploc baggie the swim back to the pinisi took just under seven minutes the boat ride to the nearest civilization on the eastern coast of lampung bay an excruciating ninety minutes once ashore and off the beach he jogged a mile down a dirt road to a collection of quonset huts on the outskirts of an industrial farm he talked his way into the plant office and to a phone and called selma who listened then said its not enough time i know that its all we haveshould we call rube no theres nothing he can do in time have pete and wendy get me back to jakarta on it now tell me where things stand what do we know virtually nothing five hours after he left pulau legundi sam touched down in jakarta he checked into the closest hotel with a wifi connection and a laptop to rent then resumed his call with selmai dont care if were right about the location sam said i just need to be able to sell it to rivera and convince him we have to meet i could create evidence wendy could photoshop something as a last resort sam checked his watch were going to take six hours and work every angle we have if we dont get anywhere well go with your plan lets run through it orizaga wandered off presumably looking for chicomoztoc did he stay on sumatrawe dont know both he and blaylock were focused on the maleo orizaga said hed know chicomoztoc when he found a hatchery of great birds he had to have meant the maleo agreed it seems likely where are they found theyre on the endangered species list theyre limited to sulawesi and buton islands how about five hundred years ago i dont know have pete and wendy put together a list of maleo experts we dont even know if there is such a thing there are experts for everything ask about hatcheries concentrations migration okay back to sulawesi its where the malagasy lived prior to migrating to madagascar and we found blaylocks outrigger on madagascar thats two votes for sulawesi what do we know about sulawesi prior to the sixth century sam heard the rustling of paper selma said human settlements as far back as thirty thousand years bc believed to have been part of a land bridge between australia and new guineamore recent sam said as deep as ive been able to dig in the past few days ive found very little until the sixteenth century when the portuguese arrived what about the language or the art any similarities to either the aztecs or blaylocks protoaztecs wendys working on a search but were up against the same problem except for a few cities sulawesi is thousands of square miles of rain forest dead volcanoes and not much else there are places on that island that have never been explored theres very little internet and even fewer online art collections if we had a few weekswe dont just do your best if you find something that looks or sounds even remotely aztec flag it sam you have to take a breath when ive got remi back lets go back to the outrigger you have the lab report remind me what do we know about the materials used the wood used was durian we know where it exists today im working on where it might have grown before the sixth century same with the rest of itthe rubber tree the pandan leaf the gebang palm let me guess there arent many experts on those either not that ive been able to find how about blaylocks letters weve decoded them all unless theres a code behind the code theres nothing else there that applies to his journal too how about the constance letters you found on the shenandoah theyre not coded the first two letters discuss the voyage to the sunda strait the last was probably written shortly before he died you can read it when we get home he tells constance he wished hed come home to marry herso sad how about the maleo statuette you found it could be emerald or jade or any number of other gems im not familiar with ill do a search for minerals endemic to sulawesi but i dont think itll solve our problem im going to need access to our server so i can look at everything from heresure give me ten minutes good thanks what are we missing selma i dont know sam were missing something three hours passed sam and selma talked every twenty minutes discussing progress dissecting what they knew and rehashing what they suspected at hour four selma called again weve made a little progress we found a book by a norwegian botanist that discusses both the pandan leaf and gebang palm i talked to him on the phone he thinks that around the fourth and fifth century both of them were heavily concentrated in the northern third of sulawesibut not restricted to there no i just realized what were forgetting what the codex remember the bush the maleo is sitting on yes damn how did i forget that doesnt matter have wendy do her thing enlarge the image clean it up and show it to the norwegian sam hung up and returned to his laptop as he had been on and off for the last three hours he was scrolling through the gallery of images and scans theyd collected there were dozens of constance letters hundreds of journal pages the orizaga codex the fibonacci spirals they all began to blur togetherhe switched to google earth and continued his scan of sulawesi looking for anything that might ring the faintest of bells in his head minutes turned into an hour he zoomed in on a secluded bay on sulawesis northeastern coast as it seemed with every spot around sulawesi islets and atolls were scattered like confetti sam stopped suddenly and tracked his finger backward moving the map he zoomed in again paused then zoomed some more he squinted his eyes then smiled a hollowedout flower he muttered he was reaching for the phone when it rang it was selma you were right sam there are experts for everything i heard back from a zoologist in makassar she claims up until the early seventeen hundreds maleos were more migratory every year they would congregate in the northeast part of the island for a few monthson his laptop sam was switching between google earth and the photo gallery go on also i emailed a photo of the codex bush to a curator at the cibodas botanical gardens in jakarta he thinks it could be a dwarf durian tree i pressed him a little and he thought it was probable the durian had migrated from east to west which would have put it in sulawesi about sixteen hundred years agofantastic sam said absently can you get to google earth hold on okay im ready sam gave her a set of latitude and longitude points zoom in until that island fills most of your screen done does that shape remind you of anything imagine those erosion ridges deeper i dont see what oh selma was silent for a few beats sam that looks like the chicomoztoc illustration writ large i know its just a coincidence it has to be maybe but its in the northeast part of the islandthe same place all your experts mentioned even if its not chicomoztoc i think i can convince rivera to buy into it and then what ill figure that out when im in front of him selma i need you to get me to sulawesi and then i need you to get me a seaplane chapter southern sulawesi sam eased the ikarus into a gentle bank and started bleeding off altitude in preparation for landing below and to the right the airstrip emerged out of the haze sam lined the nose up with it then dropped through a layer of clouds made a few final adjustments and touched down he taxied toward the trio of quonset huts at the edge of the tarmac and followed the hand signals of a groundcrew member to the fuel pumping station sam powered down the ikarus and climbed out as selma had already done the legwork sam had but to sign a form he did this then walked around the edge of the hut he dialed star sixnineyoure cutting it close said rivera ive only got sixty seconds or so left on this phone are you at the spot yet were ten minutes away let me talk to my wife tell me the location of chicomoztoc and ill do that not until im standing in front of her youre pushing your luck rivera said and youve already tipped your hand you said it yourself youre not going to let us live you want chicomoztoc then these are my terms put her on remis voice came on the line sam are you okay im fine where are you close hang in there rivera came back on well be waiting the line went dead ten minutes later he was back in the air and heading southeast toward selayar island another twenty minutes and he was again dropping through the clouds below the sea was a flat blue he leveled off at two thousand feet and followed the coastline until the southern tip of the island came into view he put the ikarus down a few hundred yards offshore and taxied toward the beach sitting on the side of a dirt road was a pair of isuzu suvs as the ikaruss skids scraped the sand the doors to the suvs opened and out stepped rivera remi and the three men from pulau legundisam shut down the engine climbed out onto the pontoon and plodded ashore check him rivera ordered one of the men frisked sam then stepped back and shook his head search the plane too sam said id like to hug my wife go ahead sam let remi come forward hoping rivera would let her out of earshot it wasnt to be thats far enough he called sam and remi embraced he whispered take the number three seat grab the sleeping bag and be ready despite the cryptic nature of the message remi simply replied okay they separated sam gave her a reassuring smile then she stepped back to riveras side the man rivera had sent to search the plane waded ashore theres nothing aboard no weapons just some sleeping bags blankets and camping gear sam said in case we have to stay overnightthats a relic of a plane said rivera are you sure it will get us where were going not even remotely sam replied but its what you get for a twentyfourhour deadline we can cancel the trip if youd like no were going i can only carry three of you fine whats our destination a bay on the eastern coast as far as i can tell it doesnt even have a name itll take us two and a half hours if anyone is waiting for us ill shoot you both and die in the resulting crash sam replied i have to admit that has a certain appeal i can fly a plane as well as you can fly a helicopter lets get moving sam should have compensated for the ikaruss edge it was closer to three hours before the coastline appeared through the windshield sam put the plane through an abbreviated checklist and began his descent he banked gently to the north and pointed the nose at the mouth of the crescentshaped bay in the rear seat beside remiwho as instructed had taken the seat behind samsrivera leaned forward for a better viewits a small bay he remarked a quartermile wide at the mouth and threequarters of a mile at its widest six islands and youre sure chicomoztoc is one of them i never said i was sure its my best guess based on everything we know you seem to be forgetting that we managed to do in a few weeks what you couldnt accomplish in almost a decade belated congratulations said rivera how did you find it long story but in a minute youll see what put the frosting on the cake the question is will you recognize itas sam dropped the ikarus through a thousand feet they passed between the headlands and into the bay where is it rivera asked patience a minute later sam turned the nose slightly off center to let the thickly forested island pass beneath the starboard wing out the side window he said rivera leaned sideways and looked down this is it he asked incredulously its tiny three hundred yards across and two hundred feet off the water its not big enough to be an island an islet then either way its what youve been looking for why is the center concave its called a caldera youre looking at an extinct volcano replied sam you still dont see it do you see what remi with a nod of approval from rivera remi leaned over his shoulder and looked out the window sam said squint think big hollowedout flower a beaming smile spread across remis face sam you found it well soon find out do you see it yet rivera no youre familiar with the traditional illustration depicting chicomoztoc imagine that illustration viewed from above now imagine the points of the island rounded and more pronouncedafter a few moments rivera murmured i see it amazing amazing take us down are you sure yes damn it take us down whatever you say passing through two hundred feet sam banked the ikarus one last time following the bays western shoreline until the planes nose was again pointed north thirty seconds later the pontoons kissed the surface the ikaruss fuselage shivered and the windows rattled sam kept a slightly noseup attitude bumping over the surface as his speed bled offhe watched the needle drop to sixty knots then fifty when it slid past forty knots he said remi how many sleeping bags do we have she leaned forward in her seat picked up the pile of bags and placed them in her lap ive got three and ive got one sam replied pointing to the bag stuffed between his seat and the passenger seat rivera how many do you have what the hell are you talking about sams eyes flicked to the dashboard the needle hit thirtyfive knots he turned toward the man in the passenger seat how about you the man opened his mouth to reply but the words never came out in one fluid motion sam dropped his right hand diagonally down punched the mans seatbelt release then grabbed the sleeping bag brought it to his chest and shoved the stick forwardthe ikarus nosed over and slammed into the water chapter having never intentionally crashlanded before sam had a plan that was a combination of gut instinct and a fair grasp of physics traveling at thirty knotsroughly thirtyfour miles per hourthe ikarus had enough kinetic energy to throw everyone inside violently forward against their seat belts but not enough to throw the seaplane into a noseovertail tumblethe impact was also enough to rip the passenger seat and the seat behind it free of the mounts that sam had preloosened before leaving the airstrip riveras man in the passenger seat already unbelted was driven headfirst into the windshield snapping his neck and killing him rivera still belted in flew forward and slammed into the back of the passenger seat while sam clutching the sleeping bag in front of his face and chest smashed into the dashboard in the backseat remis impact was cushioned by two sleeping bags she was the first to regain consciousness after the impact she released her belt and heaved herself forward between the seats she grabbed sam by the shoulders and eased him backward water was gushing into the cabin through the hole left in the windshield by riveras man already nose down in the water the ikarus began tipping forward under the weight of its engine lifting the tail from the watersam remi shouted sam his eyes snapped open he blinked a few times looked around did it work he asked were both alive id call that a success what about rivera remi looked at rivera who lay slumped forward bent at the waist unconscious or dead i dont know and i dont care we need to think about leaving sam how about right now great sam braced his feet against the dashboard fighting gravity then punched the button to release his seat belt he tried his door it didnt budge he tried again my doors jammed try riveras door hes blocking it sam pressed with his legs and arched his back sliding his upper body into the backseat get his belt remi hit the release rivera slid forward into sams outstretched hands he let gravity do the rest and rivera tumbled headfirst onto the remains of the passenger seat and his dead friendremi crawled across the seat and grabbed the door handle are you ready whenever you are deep breath she muscled the door open a column of water surged into the cabin they let the cabin fill up then remi shoved off and swam out sam was halfway out the door when he stopped and turned back he kicked into the front seat and started probing the floorboard with his hands under the dead mans left boot sam found what he was looking for the semiautomatic pistol the man had been holding he tucked it into his belthe made his way back out and kicked for the surface he broke into the air beside remi ten feet to their right the planes tail was jutting straight out of the water its not going down remi said probably a pocket of air in the tail im going back down to see what i can salvage my plan didnt include that part ill meet you on the beach sam took in a lungful of air flipped over and dove his outstretched hand found the leading edge of the wing and he pulled himself across the fuselage then down into the doorwayhe stopped rivera was gone sam looked into the tail section saw nothing and checked the front seat again he saw movement out of the corner of his right eye and turned his head a shadow rushed toward his face he felt something hard strike his forehead pain flashed behind his eyes and everything went darksam he heard distantly the voice faded then returned sam he felt hands on his face he knew that touch remi he forced his eyes open she was leaning over him her auburn hair dripping onto his face she smiled how many fingers am i holding up very funny none im okay help me sit upjust stay there youve got a nasty gash on your forehead rivera where is im here mr fargo sam tilted his head backward an upsidedown rivera was sitting ten feet up the blacksand beach damn sam muttered ill give you this much rivera youre one tough bastard sam forced himself up onto his elbows then sat upright with remis help he turned around rivera was in tough shape his nose was broken one of his eyes swollen shut and his lower lip was split the gun in his right hand was held in a rocksteady grip howeverrivera said and youre too clever for your own good as soon as youre feeling better im going to kill you and your wife i may have tried to kill you but i didnt lie about this place i could still be wrong but i dont think so fine ill kill you both then find the entrance myself the island isnt that big it doesnt look big now but once you get into that jungle itll suddenly get a lot bigger it would take you months to find it and how long for you sam checked his watch eight hours from the time we get into the caldera why that number just a guess are you stalling for time thats part of it also we want to find chicomoztoc as much as you do maybe more weve just got a different motive than you do ill give you four hours rivera stood up remi helped sam to his feet he leaned on her as though dizzy headache he said loudly then whispered in remis ear i had a gun she smiled you did i have it now waistband yes if you get a chance shoot him gladly ill try to distract him having toughened themselves over the past few weeks first on madagascar then on pulau legundi sam and remi found the hike up the islands forested slope relatively easy rivera however was struggling his broken nose forced him to breathe through his mouth and he was now limping still his years as a soldier were shining through he kept pace with them keeping ten feet between them and his gun at last they reached the top below them the calderas slopes dropped a hundred feet to the valley floor the bowl shape having acted as a rain funnel for centuries had caused the trees and vegetation to grow faster than their cousins on the exteriorwhat now asked rivera sam turned around in a circle orienting himself my compass was in the plane so i have to estimate this sam walked to the right picking his way through the trees for another fifty feet then stopped it should be right about herehere below us explain right after which you shoot us no thank you riveras mouth tightened in a thin line his eyes never leaving sams rivera shifted his gun slightly right and pulled the trigger the bullet punched through remis left leg she screamed and collapsed rivera shifted the gun back onto sam stopping him in midsteplet me help her sam said rivera glanced at remi his eyes narrowed he limped over to where she was lying crouched down and picked up the pistol that had fallen from remis waistband rivera stepped back you can help her now sam rushed to her side she gripped his hand hard her eyes squeezed shut against the pain sam patted his pockets came up with a bandanna and pressed it against the woundrivera said do i have your full attention now yes damn it the bullet hit her in the quadriceps muscle she wont bleed to death and providing she doesnt stay out here more than a couple days theres not much chance of infection between these two guns ive got thirty more rounds start cooperating or ill keep shooting chapter they made their way down to the valley floor sam in the lead with remi cradled in his arms and rivera trailing behind they found a small clearing in the approximate center of the bowl and sam laid remi down rivera sat down on a fallen log at the edge of the clearing his gun never wavering from sams chest rivera lifted his shirt up on the left side of his abdomen was a black softballsized bruisethat looks painful sam said its just a bruise sam knelt beside remi he lifted the bandanna on her thigh the bleeding had slowing to a trickle he whispered riveras bleeding internally through clenched teeth remi asked how bad im not sure stall until he keels over dead ill try stop your whispering rivera barked move away from her sam complied tell me your theory about the entrance sam hesitated rivera pointed the gun at remi its based on the illustrations sam said chicomoztoc is always a cavern with seven smaller caves around it like a flower the cavern is beneath a mountain the drawings vary but the big details are the sameincluding the location of the entranceat the bottom rivera said right but if im right and this is the place it means the exterior shape of the island was as important to them as the interior how could they have gotten an overhead view of it they didnt they sailed around it and mapped it as small as this island is it would have been easy to do it accurately go on if youre looking at the illustration face on as a twodimensional image the entrance to chicomoztoc is down if you look at it from overheadand they oriented themselves on the four cardinal directions like most cultures dothen the entrance lies to the southrivera considered this then nodded slowly good now go find it youve got four hours if you dont find it by then ill kill you both rivera made the ground rules clear sam would search for the entrance while he rivera guarded remi rivera would call sams name at random intervals if sam didnt answer within ten seconds rivera would shoot remi again as he and remi had done on pulau legundi sam made do with what was at hand a sturdy sixfootlong stick and patience facing what he thought was due south he started up the calderas slope prodding ahead of him with the stick the first pass to the top took him twenty minutes on the rim he sidestepped to the right and started back down the slope he felt ridiculous though his method was sound and still used in certain cases the gravity of where he was what he searching for and the clock that was ticking on remis life blended together giving him a nagging sense of helplessnessthe afternoon wore on in twentyminute intervals he hiked up the slope then down the slope up down repeating until hed made six passes then eight then ten shortly before five oclock with the sun dropping toward the western horizon he was picking his way through a particularly dense cluster of trees when he stopped to catch his breathinitially the sound was just a faint hiss sam held his breath and strained to pin down the location it seemed to be all around him fargo rivera hollered here sam called back you have thirty more minutes sam picked his way ten feet farther down the slope he paused the hissing had faded slightly he stepped ten feet to the left listened again louder now he repeated his test boxstepping up and down the hillside until he found himself standing before a bulge in the slope he poked the bulge with his stick the tip disappearedhis heart thumped in his chest he dropped to his knees and shoved his head into the opening the hissing doubled in volume waves he whispered he pulled back dug into his pocket found his penlight he clicked it but nothing happened come on he unscrewed the bottom and dumped the batteries on the ground and used his shirt to dry each one in turn he reassembled the flashlight and clicked the button he was rewarded with a bright beam he stuck his head back into the opening and shined the light around a threefootwide smoothwalled shaft descended diagonally into the slope at the edge of sams flashlight beam the tunnel curved right into darknessfargo sam pulled his head out here twentyfive minutes left he had a decision to make with no idea where this tunnel led and without proper gear he could easily find himself beyond earshot of rivera or worse still he would hear riveras checkin call but be unable to answer it within the allotted ten seconds he had no doubt that either of these circumstances would lead to remi being shot againhes going to kill us anyway sam said to himself roll the dice feet first sam wriggled into the opening and started downward he hadnt gotten ten feet when rivera shouted fargo sam scrambled back up the chute and stuck his head into the light here he checked his watch nineteen minutes he backed into the chute and let himself slide braking with his toes and palms until he reached the bend where he had to curl his body to navigate the angle the chute steepened continued for ten feet then suddenly widened out sam felt his legs dangling free he clawed at the walls trying to arrest his slide but gravity took over he slipped from the chute and started fallingchapter his plunge lasted less than a second he landed feetfirst in a pile of something soft rolled backward in a reverse somersault and came to rest on his knees his flashlight lay a few feet away he crawled over grabbed it and cast the beam about the pile into which hed fallen was almost pure white his first thought was sand but then he smelled it the distinctive tang of salt the rush of the waves echoed around him bouncing off the walls fading and multiplying as though he were caught inside a funhouse auditoriumsam checked his watch sixteen minutes he looked up the chute from which hed fallen was ten feet above his head he turned around panned his flashlight the wall nearest to him sparkled as though encrusted in tiny mirrors he stepped up to it salt he murmured beneath the faceted white veneer he could make out a darker streak it was greentranslucent green the stripe rose up the wall widened into a footthick band then turned again forking into dozens more veins the branching continued until it was a giant latticework beneath the white salt veneer the cavern itself was roughly oval and no wider than forty feet in diameter eyes fixed on the ceiling he started across the cavern he felt a jet of air blow up his leg he stopped and crouched down the fourfootwide hole in the floor was perfectly disguised by a crust of salt punctuated by pencil holes through which the air was being forced sam stood up looked around now knowing what to look for he could see dozens of holes within the beam of his flashlight he reached the center of the cavern spaced at regular intervals around him were what looked like saltencrusted stalagmites each one approximately five feet high there were seven of them these were ceremonial cairns he realized each cairn a metaphor perhapsthe place of the seven caves sam murmured chicomoztoc careful of his footing he strode over to the nearest cairn knelt down and pressed the head of his flashlight against the surface beneath the crystallized salt he saw a dull green glow he used the butt of the flashlight to lightly hammer the surface on the third blow a scab of salt fell away followed by a pingpongballsized rock he picked it up it was a translucent green the same as the maleo statuette the stone absorbed the beam of his flashlight swirling the light until the interior seemed to glow and sparkle of its own accord sam pocketed the stone argo riveras faint voice called damn sam muttered he whirled around casting his light wildly about he needed a plan he needed something his beam fell on the salt pile the kernel of an idea formed it was sketchy at best but it was all he had dodging holes he sprinted back to the salt pile he grabbed a handful of it and stuffed it into his pocket he scanned the flashlight along the wall beside him it curved to the right he followed it the floor sloped down then up then left the hiss of waves faded behind him to the right he glimpsed a faint light source he ran toward it the walls closed in and the ceiling descended until he was running hunched overhe stumbled through a wall of foliage and fell forward argo sam rolled onto his back caught his breath here eleven minutes sam lay still for thirty seconds picking at his plan until satisfied it could work but then again could was a far cry from would he had no choice no other options and virtually no more timehe picked his way to the bottom of the bowl then made his way back to the clearing i found something are you lying to me rivera replied no rivera stood up lets go give me a minute sam walked over to remi and sat down beside her she opened her eyes and smiled at him hi hi does it hurt no its dull throbbing ive been counting my heartbeats to pass the time sam chuckled never bored are you never i found something im taking rivera there now is it i think so i think we found it he leaned over and kissed her on the cheek im going to take him in there he whispered with any luck ill be coming out alone then ill see you when you get back sam stood up and turned to rivera ready lead the way sam took rivera to the exit then handed him the flashlight and stood to one side as rivera ducked his head into the entrance rivera tossed the flashlight back to sam whats in there i didnt go far rivera paused sam knew he was debating whether the fargos had suddenly become extra baggage but as far as i went i got lost three times in one of the side tunnels theres a dropoff beyond that i saw something on the wall a symbol of some kind this did the trick rivera gestured for sam to enter the tunnel he stepped inside and hunchwalked until the walls and ceiling widened out rivera was a few steps behind which way sam feigned confusion for a few seconds then headed right and followed the sloped floors dips and rises and turns until finally they emerged into the salt cavern are those waves rivera asked looking around i think so theres probably a maze of sea caves down there and the walls crystallized salt sea salt blown up from the caves do you see the dark streaks sam pointed the flashlight at the nearest wall take a look his gun fixed on sams chest rivera sidestepped to the wall sam said its some kind of mineral deposit emerald or jade nodding absently rivera followed the veins with his eyes as they spiraled up the wall and across the ceiling wheres this side tunnel careful to keep the beam off the floor sam shined the flashlight across the cavern he held his breath half expecting rivera to notice the cairns and their arrangement but he didntgo on sam started across the floor heart thudding in his chest he tried to keep his pace steady watching the placement of his feet as he stepped over holes or along their edges as he crossed the caverns center point there came a crackling sound like pond ice giving way rivera cursedsam turned around dont shine that in my eyes damn it rivera had stepped into one of the smaller holes and fallen through up to his crotch he struggled to extricate himself straining to get his free leg under his body he tried twice more then stoppedyoure going to come over here and help me up if you i know sam replied youll shoot me flashlight in his left hand sam strode forward he flicked the beam into riveras eyes then down again at the same time he stuffed his right hand into his pocket grabbed a fistful of salt and pulled it out againdamn it rivera growled keep the light sorry thats close enough just give me your wrist dont grab ahold of me sam extended his wrist rivera grabbed it and used sams counterweight to pull himself free sam felt riveras weight shift forward he twirled the flashlight in his fingers shining the beam directly into riveras eyessorry sam said again even as he said the words he was moving sidestepping left using riveras momentary blindness to get the gun barrel off him sam swung his right hand forward as though throwing a baseball the salt hit rivera squarely in the eyes knowing what was coming sam dropped to his belly rivera screamed and started pulling the trigger bullets thudded into the walls and ceiling salt crystals rained down sparkling in the glow of sams flashlight rivera spun wildly trying to regain his balance as he staggered across the floor the gun bucking in his hand sam pushed himself to his knees coiled his legs like a runner in the starting blocks then pushed off and charged rivera heard the crunch of sams footfalls and spun toward the sound firing still running sam dropped back to his belly and skidded across the floor the salt crystals ripping at his chest and chin he went still held his breath rivera whirled again trying to pinpoint the sound he lost his balance again lurched sideways and stepped squarely into another hole with a zipperlike crackling sound riveras legs plunged through he spread his arms to arrest his fall the gun dropped from his hand and skittered across the salted floor coming to a stop beside sams facehe grabbed the gun and climbed to his feet fargo rivera screamed sam walked over to the hole rivera arms were fully extended only the palms of his hands were touching solid ground already his arms were trembling the tendons in his neck strained beneath the skin still blinded by the salt rivera rotated his head wildly from side to sidesam crouched down beside him fargo im right here youre in a bit of a pickle get me out of this thing no sam shined his flashlight into the hole saltencrusted rock outcroppings jutted from the walls like barbs leaving only a twofootwide gap in the center far below sam could hear the roar of waves crashing against rock he grabbed a nearby softballsized stone dropped it into the opening and listened to it ricochet off the rocks until the sound faded what was that rivera askedthats karma calling sam replied about a hundred feet of it based on newtons second law what the hell does that mean get me out you shouldnt have shot my wife rivera growled in frustration he tried to press himself upward but managed only a few inches he slumped back down his head dipped below the level of the floor beneath riveras shirt his muscles quivered with the strain i just realized something sam said the more your palms sweat the more the salt dissolves beneath them i think thats what financial experts call diminishing returns its not a perfect metaphor but i think you get my pointi should have killed you hang on to that thought soon its all youre going to have left riveras left hand slipped off the edge for a split second he clawed at the ground with his right hand his nails shredding before he tipped sideways and started to fall he landed back first on one of the outcroppings shattering his spine he screamed in pain then slid off and kept tumbling his head slamming on rock after rock before disappearing from view epilogue two weeks later goldfish point la jolla california remi limped into the solarium and eased herself down on the chaise lounge next to sams without looking up from his ipad sam said youre supposed to be using your cane for at least another weeki dont like my cane sam looked over at her and you call me stubborn hows the leg feel better the doctor says ill be fit for full duty in a few weeks given the nasty alternative i couldnt be happier by nastier i assume you mean starving to death inside the crater of a dead volcano thats exactly what i mean though remi hadnt been in danger of bleeding to death on what theyd since dubbed chicomoztoc island the risk of infection and sepsis were all too real sam had known he had only two choices stay put and wait for selma to send help which she was sure to do but how quickly would her request for assistance take to make its way through the right channels in the indonesian government his second choice was to leave remi alone and strike out on his own in search of help in the end remi knowing her husband as she did encouraged him to leave her the gun and go that left sam the question of which direction the next morning he said goodbye to remi and climbed to the lip of the caldera where he stood for a time scanning the horizon hed all but decided to head south when he saw a faint trickle of smoke rising from the forest a few miles to the north at a jog he zigzagged his way down the slope waded into the water and swam the half mile to the shore where he headed north until he reached a river this he followed inland his eyes never leaving the smoke column until he reached a small clearing in the center of which stood a man in a safari vest and a blue baseball cap bearing the bbc logoupon seeing the disheveled sam stumbling into view the director of the documentary yelled cut and began demanding to know whod just ruined his shot two hours later sam was back in the caldera with remi and an hour after that the bbc helicopter touched down on the beach the next day they were back in jakarta remi tucked safely in bedwe have to start making some decisions sam now said i know they were keeping some gargantuan secrets given the momentous nature of what theyd discovered in the weeks following their improvised excavation of the shenandoah s bell it had come as a shock to realize that other than themselves selma pete wendy professors milhaupt and dydell and the kid no one was aware of what theyd found the outrigger in madagascar was still perched atop its altar in the lions head cave the shenandoah was still sitting in the ravine on pulau legundi buried under fifteen feet of krakatoan ash the maleo statuette theyd recovered from the shenandoah was tucked away in their workroom safe and the ceremonial cavern beneath the caldera remained hidden and unspoiled while they fully intended to hand over these discoveries to the worlds archaeological and anthropological communities they also recognized the wisdom of taking a few weeks to consider the implications of what theyd discovered and prepare themselves for the media storm that was sure to follow the press releases sam and remi now also understood why garza had never let the mexica tenochcas symbol the jade statuette of quetzalcoatl be physically examined if garzas quetzalcoatl ever faced testing sam and remi were confident of a match between those results and the ones they obtained on their maleo the jeweled bird was in fact not made of emerald or jade but rather a rare type of garnet known as magmatic demantoid except for the meticulous sculpting the maleo underwent its characteristics were identical to those of the stone sam had taken from the cavern wherever and however blaylock had found the maleo its surprisingly pristine condition and the shenandoahs unique fate had combined to leave behind even more compelling evidence microscopic traces of indonesianspecific pigments that suggested the statuette had once been paintedperhaps to better represent the maleo bird itself in the days following their return home a number of minor secrets that had been nagging sam remi and the others slowly sorted themselves out blaylocks journal whose eccentricities continued to reveal themselves in dribs and drabs had solved the bell mystery when pete found two pages stuck together in blaylocks own words he dramatically described being attacked by pirates while the shenandoah was at anchor off chumbe island two days before she departed for the sunda strait lest the bell ophelias heart fall into the wrong hands blaylock jettisoned it overboard after removing a memento the clapper intending to reunite the two upon his return to bagamoyo in the same attack blaylock lost his artillery sword a short gladiusstyle weapon the same one sylvie radford found while snorkeling a hundred twentyseven years later blaylocks beloved journal and walking staff both of which were rarely beyond his arms reach hed left behind with one of his concubines the day before the shenandoah departed for indonesia they eventually found their way to morton and the blaylock museum and curiosity shop sam and remi couldnt help but wonder whether the enigmatic winston blaylock had somehow known he wouldnt be coming home in the end president quauhtli garzas paranoia sealed his fate good soldier that he was rivera had left no trail that could incriminate his boss so sam and remi devised a disinformation plot that capitalized on the fact that riveras body remained missing they were surprised when their scheme bore such spectacular fruit armed with their suspicions about the tourists rivera murdered in zanzibar and the evidence supporting their theory about the true origin of the aztecs they used rube haywoods connections to start a leak that quickly became a torrent itzli rivera was alive and rather than face extradition to tanzania he was talking to the authorities who had details about not only the murders but also garzas attempt to hide the truth about his quetzalcoatl statuette and the mexica tenochcas powergrabbing ruse within hours of the story hitting american cable news channels mexican networks were running it nonstop within days mexican opposition parties and legislators were demanding an investigation and hundreds of thousands of protesters had taken to the streets in mexico city surrounding government buildings and grinding the city to a near halt having spent nearly a decade safeguarding a secret that had the power to both glorify and destroy him quauhtli garza now realized all was lost in the space of weeks all of it was gone torn asunder by a pair of treasure hunters no less americansimperialists just like cortes and his hordes it was unjust history repeating itself how had the fargos managed it and so quicklycurse them and curse rivera for that matter the traitorous bastard garza thought he would not suffer the same fate as his forefathers he was alone but his destiny was still in his hands on the fifth day after the story broke garza now trapped in his office by mobs chanting show yourself and garza must go dismissed his security detail and staff and stared out the window at what had been just hours before his adoring publicnow treacherous conquistadors returned to tear down what hed built at sunset a sunkeneyed garza left his office marched to the roof of his building overlooking templo mayor took a final look at his city and what could have been and unceremoniously leapt into the airsurrounded by thousands of stunned onlookers his shattered corpse lay atop the jagged steps of the pyramid the last remnant of the lost aztec empire selmas strident voice came over the loudspeaker above remis chaise im ready whenever you are remi replied on our way they found selma in the workroom standing at the end of the table i just finished plugging in the last of the data a similar scenario run by the us geological survey a few years ago selma announced shed collected information from dozens of other geological organizations and universities from around the world in addition to the usgshave you seen it sam asked and ruin your fun not a chance one of the more troublesome questions that remained unansweredor at least not answered to their satisfactionwas why after traveling twelve thousand miles across the globe had the protoaztecs chosen lake texcoco as their ultimate home legend claimed they had been guided there by an eagle perched atop a cactus with a snake in its mouth but professor dydells mdimigrational displacement iconographytheory suggested that image had begun as a maleo perched atop a durian treego ahead selma selma pointed the remote at the lcd and a moment later a google earthlike overhead image of chicomoztoc island appeared the camera zoomed out to encompass the nearby isles and the bay itselfselma pressed another button slowly at first then gaining more speed the image began to morph as a time line at the margin counted backward in tenyear increments sea levels rose and fell coastlines retreated and expanded jungles thinned and thickened a column of smoke drifted across the bay followed by a secondhold sam called and selma paused the animation volcanoes remi nodded looks like it selma hit play again water levels rapidly rose and retreated and then land began moving there it goes remi murmured can you slow it down selma asked sam selma touched a button on the remote the screens time line read ad the animation slowed to oneyearpersecond increments sam and remi watched transfixed as the horns of the bay gradually began rising from the sea and crawling toward each other as all the islands in the bay except chicomoztoc disappeared beneath the surface by the time the time line reached the year ad the bay had become landlocked all that remained was a lone island shaped like the flowershaped cave in the chicomoztoc illustration in the middle of what had morphed into a lakeno wonder that otherwise marshy piece of land in the middle of lake texcoco looked so appealing to them remi said they were coming home sam and remi thanked selma and returned to the solarium which one do you want to do first sam asked which what which excavation the outrigger on madagascar chicomoztoc island or the shenandoah once we make the announcement i suspect it wont take long for expeditions to begin forming id like to think well have our first pickremi thought about it a moment then shrugged you sam smiled each one has its appeal he dug into his pocket and came up with a quarter he made a fist and placed the coin on top of his thumbnail two tosses we go with the winnerremi nodded sam fargo flipped the coin and it twirled skyward
