jilly cooper polo a legend of fair women and brave men to felix with all love authors note to avoid confusion i should point out that although polo brings back many of the characters from my earlier books riders and rivals it is not in the strictly chronological sense a sequel the story begins in the very early s a year after riders ended and rupert campbellblack split up from his wife helen it finishes in the late s two years after the end of rivals a word of explanation is in order about the handicapping system in polo which is at least as complicated as a level maths a full game of polo consists of six chukkas of approximately seven minutes each there are four players in each team a forward at no two midfield players at nos and and a back at no every player has a rating known as a handicap which is reassessed by the polo authorities twice a year these handicaps reflect individual ability and range from minus two for an absolute beginner up to a maximum of ten for the very best players no englishman has been rated at ten since the second world war the term highgoal polo in england means that the aggregate handicap of a team entered for a particular tournament must be between and a goal team for example could be composed of a forward with a handicap of two two midfield players each on eight and a back on four in palm beach where the standard is higher the ceiling for a highgoal side is and in argentina as high as the ultimate with each of the members of the team on ten no player can take part in highgoal polo unless he has at least a handicap of one in mediumgoal matches the aggregate handicap of the team is normally between and and in low goal between and most tournaments are based on handicap thus the team with the higher aggregate concedes goals at the start of a match to the other side acknowledgements one of the joys of writing this book has been the friends i made during my research i have seldom encountered more charming or helpful people than among the polo community travelling alone to strange places can be very daunting i am therefore eternally grateful to ronald ferguson and pilar boxford for opening so many doors for me and above all to geoffrey and jorie kent in palm beach and jeanjacques and zou zou de wolff and their family in argentina for offering me endless hospitality the run of their yards introductions to topclass players grooms and ponies alike and transforming what might have been a terrifying ordeal into a great adventure many other people helped me like those referred to above they are all skilled in their own fields but as i was writing fiction i only heeded their advice in so far as it fitted my story the accuracy of the book in no way reflects their expertise or their views they include anthony and mary abrahams sally armstrong paula atkins susan barrantes garth and diana bearman steve and sandi berg garth and pat booth michael brown nene martinez castro peter cadbury johnnie cahendanvers alina

willey and paul withers nor as a writer does one automatically expect generosity from ones own profession but few could have been kinder or more unstinting with encouragement time and advice than william and lilo loyd john and lavinia watson john and cilla lloyd hugh and maria ines dawnay and michael hobday although i enjoyed hospitality in polo clubs internationally i am especially privileged to live near one of the loveliest polo clubs in the world cirencester park i would therefore like to thank the earl and countess bathurst the hon mark and rosie vestey and particularly douglas and sally brown ronnie and diana scott alison roeves eika clark claire millington sarah ridley ted allen and all the other staff and members of the club for all their tolerance friendliness and cooperation i must also stress that polo is a work of fiction and none of the characters is based on anyone except when they are so famous or so central to the polo world as ronald ferguson or terry hanlon are that they appear as themselves any resemblance to any living persons or organizations is purely coincidental and wholly unintentional the polo world however is full of legends and wonderful anecdotes and if an incident or a line of dialogue is attributed to a character in the book this character is on no way intended to portray the original subject of the anecdote or the speaker of the line of dialogue polo took a long time to write i am therefore deeply grateful to my publishers at transworld paul scherer mark bartyking patrick jansonsmith and all their staff for their kindness and encouragement i also had marvellous editorial help from diane pearson broo doherty and tom hartman in addition i am immeasurably lucky to have desmond elliott not only as my literary agent but as my best friend polo is a very big book and consequently i owe a vast debt of gratitude to annette xuerebbrennan annalise dobson and anna gibbskennet who bravely deciphered my ghastly handwriting and typed great chunks of the manuscript and also to beryl hill diane peter jane brooks chris ingersent verity tilling and catherine parkin who all typed individual chapters thanks should also go to tony hoskins and diane stevens for driving me to numerous polo matches nor could the book ever have been written without the stoical backup of ann mills whose obstacle race over the piles of books and papers to clean my study resembled participation in the grand national rather than a polo match or jane watts my pa who spent hours collating manuscripts transcribing corrections and generally providing cheer and comfort when i despaired the book would ever be finished it is not easy living with a writer who is totally absorbed when a book is going well and suicidal when it is going badly therefore the lions share of my gratitude must go to my family including my mongrel barbara and her agent gypsy who met a very nice class of dog at polo matches for their endless understanding and good cheer finally i would like to pay tribute to all the gallant ponies who take part in the game and to the grooms who spend such long hours looking after them characters bart alderton an american

attention to her english exam while her classmates scribbled away perdita macleod was drawing a polo pony outside the scent of honeysuckle drifted in through the french windows the cuckoo called from an acidgreen poplar copse at the end of the lawn perdita gazing out thought longingly of the big tournament at rutshire polo club where the semifinals of the rutshire cup were being played all her heroes were taking part ricky francelynch drew benedict seb and dommie carlisle the mighty argentines miguel and juan obrien and to crown it the prince of wales fretfully perdita glanced at her exam paper which began with a poem by newbolt and its not for the sake of a ribboned coat she read or the selfish hope of a seasons fame but his captains hand on his shoulder smote play up play up and play the game are newbolts views of team spirit outdated asked the first question perdita took a fresh sheet of paper and wrote yes in her disdainful blue scrawl the schoolboy in the poem must be an utter jerk and a poofter to boot to prefer his captains hand on his shoulder to a seasons fame and a ribboned coat she put down her pen and thought how much shed like a ribboned coat one of those powderblue blazers braided with jadegreen silk hamish her ghastly stepfather never gave her nearly a large enough allowance then she thought of fame perdita wanted to be a famous polo player more than anything else in the world being at a boarding school she could not play in the termtime and had so far only achieved the first team of a suburban pony club of hopelessly low standard when her family moved to their splendid new house in rutshire in the autumn however shed be able to have a pony and join a good club like rutshire or cirencester just over the border god she was bored with this exam she lit a cigarette hoping it would encourage her formmistress who was adjudicating to expel her but despite the furious wavings of paper by the swot on her right her formmistress didnt react she was far too engrossed in perditas jackie collins which shed confiscated the day before and round which shed now wrapped the dust jacket of hilary spurlings biography of ivy comptonburnett perdita took another drag and glanced at the next question do you find the poems of thomas hardy unduly preoccupied with death it wasnt an afternoon for death perdita slid through the french windows across the sunlit lawn once out into rutminster high street she tugged out the tails and undid the top buttons of her shirt hitched up her navyblue skirt a few inches and wrinkled her navyblue socks conscious that men fancied schoolgirls she left on her black and pink striped tie but loosened her hair from its tortoiseshell clasp so it cascaded whiteblond down her back eliciting wolfwhistles from two workmen mending the road perdita stuck her nose in the air her sights were set higher than roadmenders she was a big girl for fourteen tall and broad in the shoulder with pale luminous skin and a full sulky mouth a long greek nose and large very wideapart eyes as dark as elderberries gave her the look of a creature of fable a unicorn that might vanish at any moment the main gates of rutshire polo club were swarming with police because of the princes visit taking a short cut perdita clambered over a wall to the right fighting her way through the undergrowth scratching her legs on brambles and stinging nettles until she reached the outskirts of the club a vast emeraldgreen ground stretched ahead of her on the right were the pony lines where incredibly polished ponies tied to iron rails in the shade of a row of horse chestnuts were stamping nudging flattening ears at each other and aiming kicks at any fly eating their bellies god they were beautiful thought perdita longingly and curiously naked and vulnerable with their hogged manes and boundup tails beyond the pony lines stood the little clubhouse with its british american and argentine flags beyond that reared the stands and the pinkandwhite tent for the sponsors lunch before sundays final cars for todays semifinal already lined both sides of the field polo fever had reached an alltime high this season due to the princes impending wedding to lady diana spencer ringing ground one and ground two behind the clubhouse were massive ancient trees their wonderful variety of green occasionally interrupted by the rhubarbpink of a copper beech with their lower branches nibbled level by itinerant cows they looked like an army of dowagers in mididresses to the north through this splendidly impressive backdrop could be glimpsed the rosepink roof of rutminster hall a charming queen anne manor house home of sir david waterlane a polo fanatic who owned the surrounding nine hundred acres perdita scratched her nettle stings the moment she was famous she decided darkly as an orange and black striped helicopter landed on the greensward behind the clubhouse she would go everywhere by air envy turned to excitement as the helicopter doors burst open and two young players both in evening shirts and dinner jacket trousers jumped out instantly perdita recognized seb and dommie carlisle otherwise known as the heavenly twins vastly brave blond and stocky like two golden bear cubs it was said that any girl in the twins lives and there were legions had to play second fiddle to polo and the other twin next moment a small fat bald man with the tiny mean eyes and wide jaw of a bilious hippo who was wearing an orangeandblack polo shirt and straining white breeches charged up bellowing for christs sake hurry up the umpires are waiting to go on we should have started five minutes ago why are you so late we started late said seb carlisle putting his arm round the fat mans shoulders dommie had this terrific redhead no seb had this terrific brunette came the muffled tones of dommie carlisle having whipped his shirt over his head to reveal a bronzed and incredibly muscular back he nearly collided with the little fence round the clubhouse as he desperately tried to undo his cufflinks from the outside well if i can be on time i cant see why you bloody cant shouted the fat man whom perdita now identified as victor kaputnik originally hungarian victor was a pharmaceutical billionaire and famous polo patron who employed the twins as professionals and whose helicopter and fuel had just transported them from london polo players are rated by handicap which ranges from minus two goals which means an absolute beginner to ten goals for the very topclass player this has nothing to do with the number of goals they may score but is an indication of their ability although only twenty the twins already had fourgoal handicaps much of their energy was spent ripping off victor kaputnik longingly perdita watched them sprint into the clubhouse outside people carrying glasses of pimms or beer were drifting towards the stands perdita was dying for a coke and a sandwich but she hadnt brought any money she lit another fag to take the edge off her appetite looking at the scoreboard she saw that todays first semifinal was a needle match between victors team the kaputnik tigers who were wearing orangeandblack shirts and the alderton flyers in duckegg blue who were all four sitting near a lamborghini parked under a chestnut tree zipping up their boots there was the hon basil baddingham a notorious roué with patentleather hair and a laughing swarthy face who gave perdita a terrific eyemeet and drew benedict a clashing blond captain in the welsh guards with very regular features and eyes to match his blue shirt and there perdita caught her breath was her utter utter god ricky francelynch grimly fastening on his kneepads and refusing to exchange banter with the others ricky who had the beautiful lean powerful body the coarse black curls and the sensitive yet virile features of a russian ballet dancer was the bestlooking player in england and had a ninegoal handicap the most talented and dedicated player he was also the most tricky not for nothing had the argentine players nicknamed him el orgulloso the proud one standing slightly apart from the other three swinging a polo stick furiously round and round and champing to get into the fray was their patron bart alderton an american airplane billionaire and the owner of television stations and newspapers bart was a still strikingly handsome man in his late forties with thick grey hair tinged with red like a wolfs pelt and a belligerent suntanned face one of the most renowned and feared predators in the world markets where he snapped up companies before they could even blink bart had houses and strings of polo ponies in five countries known as the artful tax dodger he seldom paid tax in any of them today bart was determined to wipe the floor with his old rival victor kaputnik whom bart had taken a girl off many years ago and who in revenge last year had appealed to the monopolies commission and blocked barts taking over a leading british airplane manufacturer victor had brought down a new bimbo who he was keen to impress and was equally anxious to win bart had drew benedict basil baddingham and ricky francelynch on his team for the english season bart liked drew and bas who were amateurs suitably deferential and prepared to socialize with him for the sake of having all their bills picked up ricky who earned a long salary playing for bart as a professional was an entirely different proposition bart resented rickys arrogance and detachment he was incommunicative before matches and disappeared home like smoke afterwards today hed even refused to have a team meeting arguing that there was no point when bart never did anything he was told it further irritated bart as the teams walked down to the stretch of green behind the back line where the grooms were warming up their ponies for the first chukka that all the girls gazed at ricky not at him the alderton flyers were shortly joined on the field by the kaputnik tigers who consisted of victor kaputnik whod just taken out his teeth and had a slug of brandy to steady his nerves the carlisle twins who erupted on to the field as joyous as otters and a ninegoal chilean player called jesus who lived in victors house and coached him every day and with whom victor had just had a blazing row because the chilean had run up a telephone bill ringing his girlfriend in chile talk about chile con carphone said seb carlisle collapsing with laughter as the two sides formed up on the halfway line a second later the umpire in his striped shirt had thrown the white ball in sticks slashed and cracked stirrups chinked and expletives flew as the players struggled to get it out followed by a hailstorm of hooves on the dry ground as everyone hurtled towards goal blocking a cutshot from jesus ricky took the ball back upfield changing direction three times to fox the opposition as he hurtled towards goal in a cloud of dust the obvious pass was to drew on his right looking towards drew ricky flicked a lovely undertheneck shot round to bas who slammed the ball between the posts bloody marvellous screamed perdita jumping up and down the rest of the crowd clapped languidly as the tigers edged ahead however it was plain to perdita who was watching every stroke that bart was a much better player than victor who despite the chileans coaching just cantered about getting in everyones way ricky she realized was much the best player but his teammate the blueeyed drew benedict normally the most dependable of players must have been celebrating too heavily last night missing pass after pass he was having the greatest difficulty in controlling the chileans dazzling aggression sitting in the stands with the sun behind them sat the wives and girlfriends of the players but all wearing dark glasses so no one could see if they were bored bart aldertons wife grace a puritan mother in her forties had breeding and old money and did a huge amount for charity marrying her after ditching his loyal and loving first wife had given bart the connections and the extra cash to turn him into a billionaire described by basil baddingham as the only social grace bart had acquired on the way up grace was wearing a cartier watch a string of pearls and a purple silk dress printed with pansies her dark hair was drawn back in a bun and a straw hat with a purple silk band shaded her austere but beautiful face grace considered suntans both vulgar and ageing in her soft white hands lay a red notebook in which she kept the score and recorded every botched shot and missed penalty during the game and the name of the alderton flyer responsible next to grace sat sukey elliott whod got engaged to drew benedict the day before hence drews hangover she seemed to remember every match played and goal scored by drew in the last two seasons a keen horsewoman herself sukey was the sort of girl who could get up and do the ponies if drew had a hangover sukey had a neat rather than an exciting figure and a horsey not unattractive face her light brown hair was taken off her forehead by a velvet bow she was wearing a bluespotted shirtwaister dress for the party lady waterlane always gave in her beautiful house across the park on the thursday evening of rutshire cup week sukey would make the perfect army wife always showing a charming deference to the wives of superiors in this case grace alderton but even more valuable in drews eyes sukey possessed a hefty private income which after marriage would enable him to resign his commission and play polo full time were thinking of having our wedding list at either the general trading company or peter jones or harrods which would you suggest sukey asked grace on sukeys left in the row below sat victors bimbo a redheaded nightclub hostess called sharon whose heavy eye makeup was running and whose uplifted breasts were already burning blimey its ot she said to sukey why do the orses keep bumpin into each uvver grace would have ignored sharon regarding her as both common and part of the opposition sukey was kinder and enjoyed imparting information its called a rideoff she explained when a ball is hit it creates its own right of way and the player who hit it is entitled to hit it again but if another player puts his horses shoulder in front of that first players horses shoulder and a good horse will feel the pressure and push the other horse off the line then the second player takes up the right of way if you cross too closely in front of another rider like someone shooting out in front of you on the motorway its a foul ow i see said sharon who plainly didnt and why does the scoreboard say victors teams winning when there seem to have been more goals down the uvver end thats because they change ends after each goal said sukey kindly so noone gets the benefit of the wind i could do with the benefit of some wind said sharon fanning herself with her programme its bleedin ot it is agreed sukey would you like to borrow my hat grace alderton thought sukey was a lovely young woman who would make a splendid wife for drew she did not feel at all the same about chessie francelynch who rolled up halfway through the fourth chukka in a coloured vest no bra frayed denim bermudas and torn pink espadrilles clutching a large glass of pimms and a copy of barchester towers chessie who had bruised scabiousblue eyes and looked like a botticelli angel whod had too much nectar at lunchtime made no secret of the fact that she found polo irredeemably boring being stuck at home with a threeyearold son william polishing silver cups and taking burnt meat out of the oven because ricky hadnt got back from a match or was coping with some crisis in the yard was not chessies idea of marriage youve missed an exciting match francesca said grace pointedly id have been on time grumbled chessie if that goon in the bar didnt take half an hour to make a pimms better go and help out said commander harris the clubs secretary known as fatty waddling off to the bar to help himself to another drink the disgusting old soak said chessie congratulations she went on sitting down next to sukey when are you getting married in september so that drew can finish the polo season when did he propose on sunday it was so sweet he asked me to look after his signet ring before the match then put it on my weddingring finger and said would i and now hes bought me this heavenly ring nice said chessie admiring the large but conventional diamond and sapphires drew must have had to flog at least one of barts ponies to pay for that graces red lips tightened and even more so when the players who always seemed to be playing on some distant part of the field for once surged over to the fourinchhigh wooden boards as the sidelines are known in polo near the stands ignoring rickys yells to leave the ball bart barged in missed an easy shot and enabled seb carlisle to whip the ball away to dommie his twin who took it down the field and scored when i say fucking leave it bart for fucks sake leave it rickys bellow of exasperation rang round the field eliciting a furious entry in graces red book and an extremely beady glance from miss lodsworth a local bossy boots and one of the whiskery old trouts always present at polo matches it was my ball shouted bart i paid for this fucking team and im going to hit the goddam ball to lighten the atmosphere as the players cantered back to change ponies after the fourth chukka sukey warmly informed chessie that ricky had already scored two splendid goals good said chessie lightly we might not have black gloom all the way home for a change he still wont talk mind you even if he wins hes too hyped up to say anything sukeys total recap of the match was mercifully cut short by the arrival of one of bas baddinghams gorgeous mistresses a longhaired blonde called ritz maclaren she and chessie proceeded to gossip noisily about their friends until grace hushed them reprovingly and asked chessie what she intended to wear for lady waterlanes party that evening what ive got on said chessie until rickys father relents and gives us some cash or ricky gets his polo act together i cant see myself ever affording a new dress its the ponies that get new shoes in our house she waved a torn espadrille hanging on the end of a dusty foot at grace not me its not very respectful to lady waterlane not to change reproved grace to which chessie replied that clemency waterlane would be so busy wrapped round juan obrien her husbands argentine pro that she would hardly notice i cant think why david waterlane doesnt boot clemency out said ritz maclaren who was calmly removing her tights terrified juan would go as well said chessie david told ricky there was no problem getting another wife but hed never find another hired assassin as good as juan oh good shot ricky cried sukey do watch chessie your husbands playing so well as the bell went to end the fifth chukka perdita raced down to the pony lines to catch a glimpse of matilda ricky francelynchs legendary blue roan whom he always saved for the last chukka ponies that had played in the fifth chukka which except for victors had had every ounce of strength pushed out of them were coming off the field drenched in sweat nostrils bloodred as poppies veins standing up like a network of snakes barts horse having been yanked around was pouring blood from a cut mouth sending scarlet froth flying everywhere grooms instantly went into a frenzy of activity untacking each pony sponging it down throwing water over its head taking down its tail other grooms were loading already driedoff ponies from earlier chukkas into lorries for the journey home while still others were leading them round or just holding them as they waited to go on quivering with pitchfright while their riders towelled off the sweat and discussed tactics for the last chukka that ricky francelynchs got a wonderful eye said the security man who was looking after the princes jack russell hes got wonderful eyes thought perdita wistfully deepset watchful dark green as bay leaves and now as they lighted on matilda his favourite pony amazingly softened before a game matilda got so excited that her groom could hardly hold her snorting neighing shrilly kicking up the dust with stamping feet watching the action with pricked ears her dark eyes searched everywhere for ricky as he walked over she gave a great deep whicker of joy they had hardly been separated a day since she was a foal she was the fastest pony hed ever ridden turned at the gallop and once when shed bucked him off in a fit of high spirits had raced after the rider who had the ball and blocked the shot there wasnt a player in the world who didnt covet matilda and now ricky was going to need all her skills the alderton flyers were three down the last chukka was decidedly stormy ricky scored two goals then drew and bas one each putting the flyers ahead then bart frantic he was the only member of the team without a goal missed an easy shot and took his whip to his little brown pony it was your bloody fault not the ponys howled ricky to the edification of the entire stand and for christs sake get back evading drews clutches yet again jesus the chilean thundered towards goal in a mood of altruism and probably seeing a chance to be forgiven for the telephone bill he put the ball just in front of victor his patron who connecting for the first time in the match tipped it between the posts and levelled the score to cheers and whoops from all round the ground victor immediately waved his stick exuberantly at his redheaded nightclub hostess who was just thinking how much better looking every man in the field was than victor whys victors orse wearing so many straps it looks like a bondage victim she asked sukey the saddle has to hold if youre going to lean out of it explained sukey patiently ride hard hit hard and keep your temper said brigadier hughie the club chairman and bore whod just arrived contrary to this advice bart incensed that victor had scored proceeded to ride the fat little hungarian off the ball at such a dangerous angle that bart was promptly fouled and the tigers awarded a fortyyard penalty bart then swore so hard at the umpire that the penalty was upped to thirty yards which jesus had no difficulty driving between the posts putting the tigers ahead again in the closing desperately fought seconds of the game jesus got the ball and set off for goal his bay mares hooves rattling like a firing squad on the dry ground ricky on matilda belted after him and had caught up when the bay mare stumbled as the bell went matilda cannoned into her and ponies and riders crashed to the ground in front of the stands to the horrified gasps of the crowd as the dust cleared ricky and jesus could be seen to have got to their feet the chileans bay mare got up more slowly and after an irritated shake set off at a gallop for the pony lines matilda however made several abortive attempts and when she finally lurched up her off fore was hanging horribly oblivious of the whiskery old trout miss lodsworth complaining noisily about the disgusting cruelty of the game perdita watched helplessly tears streaming down her face on came the vets van the crowd fell silent as screens were put round the pony fatty harris the club secretary somewhat unsteadily joined the little group victorious but grimfaced with dommie carlisle unashamedly wiping his eyes the kaputnik tigers rode back to the pony lines where the grooms of the great argentines juan and miguel obrien and their patron sir david waterlane were warming up ponies for the next match in which they were playing with the prince of wales behind the screen however an argument was raging youre not putting mattie down hissed ricky if its a cannon bone we can slap her into plaster i want her xrayed shell be no use for polo protested the vet maybe not but im bloody well going to breed from her its all right lovie rickys voice softened as he stroked the trembling mare give her a shot of buscopan advised fatty harris dont be fucking stupid snapped ricky if you kill the pain shell tread on it and make it worse got to get her off the field ricky said fatty fussily his breath stale from too many lunchtime whiskies princes match is due to start in ten minutes cant hold it up utterly indifferent to the fact that in the end he held up the princes match for half an hour and that most of the spectators and some of the players regarded him as appallingly callous for not putting matilda out of her agony ricky helped by drew and bas gently coaxed the desperately hobbling mare into a drivenup horse box ricky would stay inside with her while one of his grooms drove them the eight miles home to where the vet would bring his xray equipment green beneath his suntan shaking violently and pouring with sweat ricky spoke briefly to his wife chessie when she came over and hugged him chessie had often been jealous of matilda in the past now she could only pity rickys anguish im desperately sorry darling whenll you be back probably not at all ill ring you but what about lady waterlanes reception asked an outraged bart who had just joined them you cant miss that ricky looked at bart uncomprehendingly bbbugger lady waterlane he said coldly ricky had just climbed in beside the mare when a ripple of excitement ran through the crowd as a dark man in a cherryred polo shirt pulled up his pony beside the lorry his hazel eyes were on a level with rickys as he called out desperately sorry ricky ghastly thing to happen always liked matilda great character hope you manage to save her touched by the expression of genuine sympathy on the princes face ricky forgot to bow thank you sir bart and grace whod also joined him on the field shot forward expectantly avid to be presented but it was too late shouting back to ricky to let him know the result of the xray the prince had moved off hitting a ball ahead of him cantering across the pitch and out of barts life why the hell didnt you introduce us it seemed irrelevant as they raised the ramp of the horse box and shot the bolts bas and drew shook their heads they knew how devastated ricky was but he was pushing his luck aubergine with rage bart turned to chessie what the fuck does your husband think hes playing at polo said chessie bitterly absolutely nothing else barts resentment against ricky was in no way abated when the prince regretfully decided he wouldnt have time to look in at lady waterlanes party because his match had been delayed lady waterlane who didnt find latins at all lousy lovers was so preoccupied with juan obrien her husbands argentine professional that she hardly noticed the princes absence a rather too relaxed hostess besides feeding and watering her guests and giving them free access to the bedrooms where the fourposters hadnt been made for weeks lady waterlane expected people to get on with it totally confident in the business world bart felt an outsider among the raffish and sometimes aristocratic members of the polo community who knew each other so well he had expected ricky to introduce him to everyone chessie furious at having forked out for a babysitter and determined to stay for the party could easily have fulfilled this function but bart had been so rude to her about rickys arrogance and the fact that she was dressed like a tramp that she had stalked off to comfort jesus the chilean who was mortified his pony had caused matildas fall bart however was not left alone for long june and july when the midseasons handicaps were announced were the months when dissatisfied patrons started looking round and wondering which players they would hire to make up their teams for next year apart from the occasional amateur like bas and drew there are two kinds of players in polo the patrons who have the money and the professionals who earn money playing for them professional players are only as good as their last three games contracts rarely extend beyond a season there is therefore collossal pressure to perform well but with ones future at stake diplomacy is almost more important than performance patrons not only like to win but also to be taken to parties and treated as one of the boys during the season everyone had noticed the froideur between ricky and bart miguel obrien known as the godfather because he controlled the other argentine players like the mafia was also grimly aware that with his handsome brother juan constantly wrapped round clemency waterlane david waterlane might not be overkeen to employ them to play for rutminster hall next year david was tricky and also very mean looking round the beautiful drawing room miguels conniving dark little eyes noticed the damp patches on the faded yellow wallpaper and the tattered silk chaircovers and saw that davids ancestors on the walls could hardly see out through the layers of grime he knew too that david owed thousands to ladbrokes and the taxman thinking how agreeable it would be next year to be sponsored by barts millions miguel started chatting him up you ride very well for the leetle time you ave learn purred miguel wiz zee right coaching you could be miles bettair but success in polo is eighty per cent zee good orses he hoped bart and his beautiful wife would come and stay at his estancia in argentina and try out some of the familys superb ponies bart was flattered imagine the kudos of having the great obrien brothers playing on his team both in england and palm beach the napier brothers ben and charles known as the unheavenly twins because of their cadaverous appearance whod been beaten by the obriens david waterlane and the prince in the second match were also at the party cruel to their horses and even crueller to their patron a petfood billionaire who theyd ripped off so unmercifully that he was threatening to quit polo the napiers also tried to make their number with bart during the evening but they were preempted by seb and dommie carlisle who having got drunk and appropriated perdita after the match came rushing up to bart oh mr alderton could you please take us into a corner and chat us up like mad so victor will get appallingly jealous and offer us three times as much next year bart was amused the twins he decided would be far more fun to play with than ricky or the napiers drew benedict couldnt stay long at the party as he had to dine with sukeys parents his future inlaws but ever diplomatic he found time to talk to bart his patron telling him how well he had played and how the team would never have reached the semifinals without him its disappointing we didnt make the finals but a good thing from my point of view added drew philosophically im supposed to be guarding some nuclear weapons this weekend and id have had difficulty getting leave on sunday having mugged up on the wall street journal and the financial times every day drew was also able to comment on the progress of barts latest takeover admiring drews wellworn but beautifully cut suit his striped shirt and blue silk tie and his dependable handsome face with the turneddown blue eyes and juttingly determined jaw bart thought that he was quite the best kind of englishman a sort of butch leslie howard briefly he touched drews pinstriped arm with the back of his hand the nearest he ever got to intimacy with men the armys lossll be sukeys gain he said roughly shes a very lucky young woman drew grinned londons fortunehunters are out to lynch me having taught himself spanish because he realized what an advantage it would be understanding what the argentines were gabbling to each other on and off the field drew had also overheard miguel talking to juan before he left he took chessie on to the terrace the setting sun was turning the house a warm peach and gilded the lake around which cows were lying down catmint brushed against chessies legs as drew adjusted the shoulderstrap of her coloured vest which had flopped down her arm as your husbands best friend you want me to stop flirting with jesus that too said drew look ive just overheard that oily sod miguel telling juan that barts fed up with ricky and things look rosy for next year ricky should be here guarding his patch well hes not snapped chessie when did a party ever come before a pony hes just rung up to say theyve xrayed matildas leg and its a cannon bone so theyre going to slap it in plaster and then sling her up thank christ so hell be here soon some hope said chessie bitterly he prefers to stay with mattie hes already collected will from the babysitter hes so bloody arrogant hell never dance to barts tune he who pays for the piper heidsieck calls the tune said drew deheading a rose drewhoo drewhoo sukey was calling from the french windows shades of the prisonhouse begin to close mocked chessie dont be subversive said drew kissing her on the cheek youd better chat up bart instead of jesus or your husbands on a collision course the party roared on coronation chicken was served although seb carlisle was heard to remark that it was debatable whose coronation it was celebrating a few bread rolls were thrown dommie carlisle added to the rising damp by filling a condom with water and spraying it round the drawing room all the players dogs which followed them everywhere lay around panting finishing up the food and being tripped over in a dark corner juan obrien a beautiful animal with big brown eyes long black curls and a vast slightly bruised lower lip was gazing limpidly at clemency waterlane you haf the most wonderful eyes in the world my best mare in argentina ees due to foal soon eef its a filly i shall call her clarissa after you actually my names clemency said lady waterlane but its awfully sweet of you juan victor kaputnik the pharmaceutical billionaire bald pate gleaming in the candlelight black chesthair spilling out of his unbuttoned shirt was boasting in his thick hungarian accent about his prowess as a businessman i have discovered a cure for the common cold he was telling fatty harris the club secretary i wish hed find a cure for the common little man muttered seb carlisle hes an absolute pill no he makes pills giggled dommie shooting a jet of water into the round red face of fatty harris who was too drunk to realize where it had come from barts mood was not improving once a heavy drinker he had cut out booze almost entirely to improve his polo but now really longed for a huge scotch desperately dehydrated after the game he had already drunk two bottles of perrier he was livid theyd lost the match livid that victor had scored that goal which he was boasting to everyone about livid that victor had got into the final with the prince and might well appear photographed with the prince and lady diana on the front of mondays times and livid that victor was now dancing with his redheaded nightclub hostess his six oclock shadow grating the sunburnt cleavage of her splendid breasts and there was clemency waterlane wrapped round juan and that ravishing schoolgirl bopping away with dommie and seb bart knew that grace was a wonderful wife but he had never forgiven her for being from a better class than him and was fed up with her criticizing his polo pointing out that if he hadnt bumped victor so hard today jesus would never have been awarded that penalty now she was being charming to that old bore brigadier hughie and his wife ive broken mright leg twice mleft leg once my right shoulder three times cracked three ribs and dislocated mthumb and melbow droned on hughie polo players are very brave people said mrs hughie who looked like an eager warthog brave enough to face the inland revenue every year drawled chessie on her way to the bar ignoring chessie grace listened politely thinking how dirty clemency waterlanes house was and how much better she grace could have arranged the flowers then noticing bart pouring himself a huge scotch she left mrs hughie in midflow as she strode across the room baby we werent going to drink look im exhausted shall we go bart said he wasnt tired and still had some business to discuss with miguel why didnt the pilot fly grace home and come back for him in an hour chessie francelynch rather drunk sat in the depths of a sofa letting conversations drift over her from a bench on the terrace she heard an outraged squawk as victors pudgy hand found the soft flesh between sharons stockings and her suspender belt hey dyou fink im common or somefink victor tits first please in front of the fireplace still full of ash from a fire last march four young bloods were discussing next weeks tournament in cheshire seb and dommie are definitely coming and theyre mounted whos going to mount drew simon cant because hes mounting henry bas is mounting himself well bas will have to mount drew too then nor did the young men deflect in the slightest from their conversation when david waterlane having found juan mounting his beautiful wife in an upstairs fourposter was forced to expel the frantically protesting argentine from the house clemency was sniffing in an armchair and receiving a pep talk from brigadier hughie who felt that as chairman of the club he should provide moral guidance dyou really feel clemency mdear that its worth leaving a tolerant husband three lovely children and nine hundred acres for the sake of six inches of angry gristle clemency sniffed and said yes she did that david could be very intolerant and juans gristle wasnt angry and was considerably more than six inches chessie found herself giggling so much that she had to leave the room and went slap into bart alderton who was clutching another large scotch chessie updated him on the juanclemency saga shes crazy went on chessie david puts up with murder even if he is stingy and he is loaded unlike your spouse said bart pointedly ghastly word said chessie and i hear youre not espousing his cause next year bart took her arm and frogmarched her outside on to the long grass beyond the lawn away from a scuffling victor and sharon who told you that he said sharply miguel was overheard boasting to juan i wish you the luck of them miguel will fleece you and juan will no doubt offer grace a good deal more than six inches at least rickys honest and hasnt jumped on grace whys he so broke snarled bart hes paid enough chessie put a hand on a stone lion though the sun was long set it was still warm the scent from a clump of philadelphus was almost overwhelming stymied by a massive overdraft she said hes spent so much on the yard and ponies and a stickandball field and hes no good at selling ponies on at a wicked profit like some people he gets too fond of them and always justifies not selling them by claiming theyll go for three times as much next year when hes put more work into them his father used to help him but they fell out cant say i blame his daddy said bart heavily el orgulloso indeed actually rickys very shy and introverted protested chessie hes aquarius you know aloof glamour but has difficulty expressing himself what sign dyou think i was born under asked bart chessie laughed a pound sign i should think i want another drink shrieks were coming from the swimmingpool as people fully dressed jumped into the icy water which david waterlane had been too mean to turn up until that morning inside bart poured a glass of wine for chessie and more whisky for himself im not sponsoring ricky next season he said brutally im crazy about my polo but not with him its costing me a million dollars a year none of it disposable victor scores a goal today and all i get is abuse he droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven said chessie seeing her face was quite expressionless bart said he neglects you too he prefers polo to sex said chessie flatly but what player doesnt i dont said bart roughly stroking her slender brown arm with the back of his hand i wouldnt neglect anything as precious as you put me in a packing chest with the rest of your renoirs would you taunted chessie the waterlanes ancient gramophone was now playing anything goes bart took chessie off to dance wheres grace murmured chessie deciding that bart was rather excitingly built gone home she was pooped leaving you on the loose thats unwise unwise of ricky and grace said bart drawing her close for the first time he looked her straight in the eye and kept on looking her skin was translucent her hair tousled her wanton sleepy eyes as violet as the shadows beneath them you could strip a mans aftershave off with a look like that said bart wish i could strip off victors chesthair at least he has the manners to dance with his hostess said chessie drily as sharon and victor quickstepped past gathered round a billiard table in the next room jesus whod just spent half an hour on david waterlanes telephone ringing chile seb dommie and perdita who still hadnt returned to her boarding school were demonstrating polo plays with sugar lumps at the hitin you should have tapped the ball to seb and hed have hit it to me said dommie moving a sugar lump i was here no you was ere said jesus moving it to the right and you should have been here said perdita moving it back to the left you seem to know more about it than us said dommie squeezing her waist i ought to go said perdita ruefully they lock the fire escape at midnight weve got biology first thing tomorrow and i havent revised at all if youre weak on the subject of human reproduction said seb starting to plait her long blond mane dommie and i could give you a quick crash course there are plenty of beds upstairs how old are you fourteen said perdita gaol bait as far as were concerned sighed dommie come back in two years time what are you going to do when you grow up play polo youd do better as a stockbroker or a soccer player said seb theres no money in polo i know said perdita but at least id rub up against all the richest most powerful men in the world like mrs francelynch said dommie watching chessie rotating her flat denimed belly against barts crotch that looks like trouble to me bloody ell said jesus ruefully if he hadnt spent so long on the telephone he might have scored there he toyed with the idea of cutting in then decided he might want to play for bart one day aware that they were being watched bart and chessie retreated to david waterlanes study tearing himself away from the photographs of ponies and matches on the wall bart discovered chessie looking down her vest examining her breasts whaddyer doing they say everything you touch turns to gold i wondered if i had let me try again bart slid his hands inside her vest christ youre sexy they were interrupted by mrs hughie who like the brigadier rather ineffectually tried to act as a custodian of morals at polo parties and was now trying to foist strong black coffee on unwilling guests hello chessie she said averting her eyes as chessie reinserted her left breast jolly bad luck about matilda rickys been playing so superbly too i was trying to remember whats his handicap his personality said bart bleakly oh i wouldnt say that mrs hughie gave a nervous laugh as she handed chessie a cup dyou take sugar chessie looked straight at bart only in daddies she said softly i actually came to find you said mrs hughie hastily as the whoops increased next door im awfully fond of seb and dommie but they have had a bit too much to drink and theyre with a dear little soul called perdita macleod whos boarding at queen augustas could you possibly drop her off on your way home chessie thereby killing two birds who might otherwise get stoned said chessie bart was absolutely furious but as she and perdita left the floodlit house for the moonlit night chessie reflected that bart would be more likely to renew rickys contract if she held out storming up rickys drive twenty minutes later twitching with desire and frustration she was alarmed to find the house in darkness even worse the front door was open and noone was at home panic turned to rage however when she discovered ricky still in his breeches and blue polo shirt fast asleep in the stable next to matildas will also asleep lay in his arms they were surrounded by two labradors a whippet the stable cat assorted plastic guns and dinky toys and a copy of thomas the tank engine the labradors blinked sleepily and thumped their tails matilda hanging from her sling looked up watchfully in chessie she recognized a rival but ricky and will didnt stir chessie woke at noon feeling hungover and guilty she shouldnt have got tight or off so publicly with bart gossip spread round the polo community like napalm if ricky didnt know by now his grooms certainly would her fears were confirmed when will wandered in later from playgroup bearing paintings to be admired stories to be read and his hands crammed full of yellow roses pulled off by the head for her stocky as a welsh cob will had a round pink face and dark brown slanting eyes with long curly lashes tipping the blond fringe of his puddingbasin hair no child could be more edible even allowing for a mothers bias how could she have dallied with bart and jeopardized this thought chessie hugging him fiercely did you bring me a present demanded will i didnt go anywhere i could get you one said chessie who brought you home from playgroup fuckies said will who couldnt pronounce frances the head grooms name fuckies say mummy got pissed up last night mummy did not mattie got sore leggie went on will as if i didnt know snapped chessie want some crisps ask daddy chessie snuggled down in bed daddy gone to london dont be ridiculous daddy loathes london ricky avoided london at all costs only his passion for chessie after theyd first met had dragged him up to her flat in the cadogans and then hed always got lost as will pottered off crispwards chessie thought about bart he reminded her of all those rich ruthless cynical invariably married men whom shed met and had affairs with when she used to cook directors lunches in the city one of them had been about to set her up in her own restaurant in the fulham road called francescas when she had met ricky it had been at her rich grandparents golden wedding with an eye to inheriting loot rather than a sense of duty chessie had reluctantly driven down from london expecting to be bored rigid instead she found that her plain horsey cousin harriet who at twentyfive had never had a boyfriend had turned up looking almost pretty and bursting out of her brown velvet dress with pride because she had ricky in tow despite having absolutely no small talk and the trapped ferocity of a tiger whipped into doing tricks at the circus he was the most attractive man chessie had ever seen it took her exactly fifteen minutes to take him off her poor cousin harriet gazing sleepily at him across the gold candles throughout dinner then dancing all night with him the chuntering of outraged relations was so loud noone could hear the cracking of poor harriets heart offhand with people to cover up his feelings unused to giving or receiving affection ricky had not had an easy life the francelynches had farmed land in rutshire for generations horsemad their passion for hunting had been exceeded at the turn of the century by a passion for polo herbert rickys father the greatest polo player of his day and a confirmed bachelor had suddenly at fiftyfive fallen madly in love with a twentyyearold beauty sadly she died giving birth to ricky leaving her arrogant crotchety heartbroken husband to bring up the boy in the huge draughty georgian house which was called robinsgrove because the robins in the woods around were supposed to sing more sweetly there than anywhere else on earth ricky needed that comfort determined that his son should follow in his footsteps herbert was appalled to discover that the boy was lefthanded this is not allowed in polo consequently herbert spent the next years forcing ricky to do everything righthanded to the extent of tying his left arm to his side for hours on end as a result ricky developed a bad stammer for which he was terribly teased at school although herbert adored the boy he couldnt show it only by playing better polo could ricky win his fathers approval herbert went to every match yelling at ricky in the pony lines the cheers were louder off the field than on when ricky started yelling back herberts vigilance was rewarded at just twentythree when he met chessie rickys handicap was six and he had already played for england to chessie he was unlike anyone she had ever met in the middle seventies when men were getting in touch with their feelings and letting everything hang out ricky gave nothing away a tense uncompromising loner lack of love in his childhood had made him so unaware of his charms that he couldnt imagine anyone minding being deprived of them chessie had had to make all the running smitten by her ricky was terrified to feel so out of control and went into retreat he was always away playing in matches or searching for new horses he never rang because he was shy about his stammer and he knew it would wreck his polo career to marry when he needed all his concentration to make the break gradually persistently chessie broke down his resistance herbert had been violently opposed to the marriage but when the tetchy old eccentric met chessie he was as bowled over as his son even to the extent of moving out of robinsgrove which had grooms flats stabling for twenty horses and four hundred acres of field and woodland and moving into the dower house two miles away to make way for her and ricky at first the marriage was happy herbert went to matches with chessie and enjoyed her cooking at least once a week and when chessie produced an heir two years later the old man was happier than hed ever been but although herbert had initially settled on ricky chessie used to having her bills picked up and being showered with presents by besotted businessmen soon went through it the land which included a large garden a tennis court and a swimmingpool needed maintaining and the house with its vast rooms needed a gas pipe direct from the north sea to keep it warm also rickys dedication aloofness and incredible courage on the field which had attracted chessie madly in the beginning were not qualities she needed in a husband ricky adored chessie but he was far too locked into polo and after the first two years too broke to provide her with the constant approval attention and material possessions she craved resentful that ricky wouldnt pay for a nanny chessie was always palming will off on his grooms most topclass players employ one groom to three ponies rickys grooms had to look after five even six but they never minded they all adored ricky who beneath his brusqueness was fair kind and worked harder than anyone else and they were proud to work for such a spellbinding player chessie a constant stranger to the truth had also failed to tell bart at the waterlanes party that she had caused rickys rift with his father gradually herbert had recognized chessie for what she was selfish manipulative lotuseating narcissistic unreliable and hopelessly spoilt one rule in the francelynch family was that animals were fed before humans horrified one day when ricky was away that the dogs had had no dinner by ten at night and the rabbits hutch hadnt been cleaned out for days herbert had bawled chessie out totally unable to take criticism chessie complained to ricky when he came home wildly exaggerating herberts accusations triggering off such a row between father and son that herbert not only stopped the halfmillion he was about to settle on ricky to avoid death duties but cut ricky out of his will although both men longed to make it up they were too proud ricky whose family had always been the patrons was forced to turn professional incapable of the tact needed to massage the egos of businessmen desperately missing herberts counsel appallingly strapped for cash barts for a season went nowhere when you were dealing with horses ricky threw himself more into polo and devoted less time to chessie in chessies defence with a less complex man she might have been happy she loved ricky but she burned with resentment hating having to leave parties early because ricky was playing the next day why too when there were ten other bedrooms in robinsgrove with ravishing views over wooded valleys and the green ride down to the bustling frogsmore stream did ricky insist on sleeping in the one room overlooking the stables here the window was always left open so if ricky heard any commotion he could be outside in a flash as she staggered downstairs to make some coffee on every wall chessie was assaulted by paintings of polo matches and photographs of ricky herbert and his brothers leaning out of their saddles like cossacks or lined up their arrogant patrician faces unsmiling as their polo sticks rested on their collar bones going through the dark panelled hall she glanced into the library and was reproached by a whole wall of polo cups grown yellow from lack of polish oh god thought chessie hysterically polo polo polo already on the wall was the draw of the british open known as the gold cup the biggest tournament of the year starting next thursday and running over three weeks it would make ricky more uptight than ever at least marriage had taught him domesticity in the kitchen his white breeches were soaking in banish to remove brown bootpolish and the grass stains from yesterdays fall from the egg yolk on the plates in the sink he had obviously cooked breakfast for will and himself but chessie only brooded that she was the only wife in polo without a washingup machine on the table was a note darling ricky had written with one of wills crayons gone to london back late afternoon didnt want to wake you matties bearing up love ricky other wives thought chessie scrumpling up the note furiously went to paris for the collections ricky was so terrified of letting her loose in the shops he wouldnt even take her to london at least it was a hot day she might as well get a suntan going upstairs to fetch her bikini she heard the telephone and took it in the drawing room it was grace probably just back from a shopping binge at ralph lauren sounding distinctly chilly learning ricky was in london she asked to speak with frances speak to not with you silly cow muttered chessie doesnt trust me to pass on messages she was about to go in search of frances when she noticed a lighter square in the rose silk wallpaper above the fireplace it was a few seconds before she realized that the munnings had gone valued at it had been given to them as a wedding present and was a painting of rickys aunt vera on a horse ricky must be flogging it in london in order to buy another pony i dont believe it screamed chessie storming into the hall where she found will applying strongarm tactics to the frantically struggling stable cat as he tried to spray its armpits with right guard stop it howled chessie completely forgetting about grace at the other end ricky returned around six he had managed to get for the munnings he knew it was pathetically little but at least it had enabled him to buy from juan a dark brown mare called kinta whod previously been a race horse whom hed always fancied and with whom juan had never clicked he felt absolutely shattered now yesterdays adrenalin had receded he could feel all the aches and pains he was in agony where jesus had swung his ponys head into his kidneys and where a ball had hit his ribs his stick hand was swollen where victor had swiped at him and there was a bruise black as midnight in the small of his back where jesuss bay mare had lashed out at him scrabbling to regain her feet after that last fall chessie waited for him in the drawing room fury fuelled by his checking mattie and the other ponies before coming into the house hi darling he said ignoring the gap above the fireplace ive got another pony how dare you flog aunt vera thundered chessie half of that money belongs to me how much did you get ten grand you were robbed at that moment will erupted into the room daddy bring me a present yes i did said ricky handing him a halfsize polo stick for children will gave a shout of delight and brandishing it narrowly missed a lalique bowl on the piano just like daddy now chessie clutched her head oh please no she screamed chessies froideur with ricky didnt melt but he was kept so busy getting acquainted with kinta now known as the widowmaker tuning her and the other ponies up for the first gold cup match next thursday playing in mediumgoal matches and worrying about mattie who didnt seem to be responding to treatment that he hardly noticed until he fell into bed then when he was confronted by the berlin wall of chessies back he tended after his hand had been shuddered off to drop into an uneasy sleep leaving chessie twitching with resentful frustration all night grace made it plain that she was livid with chessie for leaving her hanging on the telephone bart had made absolutely no attempt to get in touch with chessie perhaps he was still sulking because she had thwarted his plans by giving perdita a lift home surprised how anxious she was to see him again chessie went along to the thursday match and deliberately dressed down in a collarless shirt and frayed bermudas held up with rickys red braces to irritate grace alas the grooms were all tied up with the ponies and her babysitter had gone to margate so she was forced to take will and his new short polo stick with her will was a menace at matches having grabbed a ball he proceeded to drive it into fatty harriss ankles brigadier hughies ancient springer david waterlanes bentley and finally a lot of little girls playing with a dolls pram who all burst into noisy sobs this was drowned by wills even noisier sobs when he saw his father umpiring the first match between the kaputnik tigers and rutminster hall wriggling out of chessies grasp he rushed on to the field and was nearly run down by jesus the chilean juan and miguel were on epic form and after a frenzied last chukka of bumps and nearly fatal falls rutminster hall ran out the winners by victor kaputnik whose gloating when he won was only equalled by his rage when he lost could be heard yelling furiously at the twins and jesus as they came off the field chessie was about to wander down to the pony lines in search of bart when he emerged out of a duckegg blue helicopter followed by grace extremely chic in brown boots a brown trilby and a furlined trench coat her glossy dark hair drawn back in a french pleat after last weeks heatwave a bitter north wind was flattening the yellowing corn fields turning the huge trees inside out driving icy rain into the eyes of the players and horses and putting the easiest penalty in jeopardy despite this there was a good crowd to watch the second match between the alderton flyers and the doggie dins devils who included the notorious napier brothers an underhandicapped australian and kevin coley their appalling petfood billionaire patron not being able to face an hour with grace chessie was thankful when the carlisle twins bounded up teeth brilliantly white in their mudspattered faces and insisted she watch from their car will who adored the twins immediately stopped crying arent you flying home with victor asked chessie no hes pissed off with us because we were late ill go and get us a drink said seb as the alderton flyers rode on to the field all wearing polonecked jerseys under their shirts chessie was glad of the warmth of the twins lotus listening to the whistling kettle sound of victors blackandorange helicopter soaring out of the trees she turned to dommie i dont know why youre looking so smug about losing oh well catch up said dommie there are four more matches in the draw dont tell victor he thinks we were late because of the traffic actually we were selling a pony for about three thousand pounds more than its worth seb had just lied that its grandsire was nijinsky when i walked in and said it was mill reef but we got over that hurdle who bought it asked chessie idly phil wedgwood bloody hell said chessie he rang ricky yesterday said hed just sent the mare ricky sold him in may to the knackers because she had back trouble and could he buy another ricky loved that mare so much he hung up on him now phils bought one from you jesus i dont think your husbands got his act together commercially said dommie hes got to learn to care less about ponies and more about patrons victor is so thick we sold one of his own ponies to him the other day quick duck here comes the head girl through the driving rain both suitably clad for the weather came sukey and grace going towards barts limo which had been driven independently to the match for them to sit in grace nodded coolly sukey who was carrying a camera tapped on the window i was hoping to video the match so drew could isolate his mistakes afterwards but the visibilitys so awful bad luck on losing seb im dommie oh sorry i can never tell you two apart ive got the bigger cock said dommie chessie giggled sukey firmly changed the subject weve had the daily express at home all morning doing a feature on drew youd never dream how many rolls of film they used they wanted to do ricky and me said chessie furiously but ricky was far too uptight to let them in on the morning of a match oh drews managed to conquer his nerves said sukey then looking at chessie arent you frozen not with me around said dommie running his hands up and down her bare legs before sukey had time to look oldfashioned seb had arrived holding three bloody marys and a coke in his hands and a packet of crisps between his teeth for will christ this weathers awful dyou want a drink sukey no thanks ive just had a cup of tea theres the throwin i must go and watch with grace such a wonderful lady silly bitch muttered chessie putting the bloody marys on the dashboard as seb got in beside her next minute bart thundered past them eyes screwed up against the rain swiping at the ball and missing completely he was so bad reflected chessie it was a turnoff to watch him but not as bad as the petfood billionaire kevin coley who was simultaneously hitting his poor pony round the legs with his stick tugging on its mouth and plunging huge spurs into its sides dreadful rider winced seb hes just given me a book on dog breeds said dommie getting it out of his barbour seb and i are thinking of getting a pit bull jesuss game is distinctly off today said seb baby jesus is a little bugger said will his mouth full of crisps the conditions were worsening the pitch was a black sea of mud beyond the clubhouse the pinkandwhite sponsors tent strained at its moorings by the third chukka the alderton flyers were leading by not because of superior play but because juan who was umpiring was so anxious to curry favour with bart that he hadnt blown a single foul on him god said seb as bart crashed into charles napier at ninety degrees that should have been a goal to the other side shall we get a white or a brindle one asked dommie hows your ravishing schoolgirl asked chessie expelled poor darling we tried to take her out on sunday we were going to windsor and thought shed like a jaunt but they wouldnt even give us a forwarding address oh shell turn up said chessie those sort of girls always do ready for another drink asked seb as the halftime bell went i quite like basenjis said dommie but they dont bark he ran his hand down chessies bare leg again honestly mrs fl if you werent married to ricky id make such a play feel free said chessie then jumped at a tap on the window divotstomping time francesca ordered grace alderton looking disapprovingly at the row of glasses on the dashboard dommie lowered the window a centimetre its too cold mrs fl isnt dressed for treading in and weve just got warm for the first time today grace didnt actually flounce but her body stiffened as she stalked off on to the pitch good period baby she shouted to bart as he cantered back muddy but elated having scored a goal can we get our diaries together when we get back to the car sukey asked grace as they trod back the divots i dont want to have our wedding on a day when you wont be in england will took a great slug of dommies second bloody mary and started on a bag of maltesers seb had brought him dont let him eat them all said chessie hell be sick will ate four then put the rest in the breast pocket of his shirt allbody will think ive grown a tit the twins roared with laughter rickys breeches were black with mud as he came out for the fifth chukka his spare sticks were in front of dommies car leaning against the little fence that ran along the edge of the pitch some players used the same length stick for every pony but ricky preferred longer sticks for taller ponies and kinta the new dark brown thoroughbred was nearly sixteen hands if he broke a stick he expected chessie to run out and hand him a new one those are the fiftyones on the left and the fiftytwos on the right he shouted to her as he cantered back for the throwin are you going to deauville chessie asked the twins shut up said seb i want to see how ricky goes on juans pony and you can get your nose out of that book dom ricky was used to riding with his reins completely loose the slightest pressure on his horses necks turning them to the left or right kinta however coming from the race track where horses are only expected to go one way and used to being yanked around by juan pulled like an express train and was almost impossible to stop christ ricky wont have any arms left said dommie as kinta easily outstripped charles napiers fastest pony but shes going bloody well for him juan must be as sick as a baby with its first cigar both sides were now squelching around the doggie dins goal bart should have dropped back and marked ben napier but instead rushed into the mêlée and losing control of his pony mishit get back you stupid fucker howled ricky interesting your husband never stammers when hes shouting abuse said seb as will took another slug of bloody mary ricky and ben napier both bounded forward trying to prise the ball out of the mud there was a crack as rickys stick broke swinging round he galloped towards the boards he wants another stick said seb reluctantly chessie climbed out into the stabbing rain only the fence and the row of cars stopped kinta fiftytwo yelled ricky are you trying to tell me your age drawled chessie give me my fucking fiftytwo say please chessee come on said seb disapprovingly sthop sthouting daddy said will for christs sake howled ricky dont be infantile said a furious grace running forward and handing the stick to ricky seizing it he hurtled back into the game but it was too late despite kintas phenomenal speed doggie dins had taken advantage of rickys absence to score a goal sthop sthouting said will filling up his waterpistol from sebs bloody mary as the bell went for the end of the fifth chukka chessie caught sight of graces face and was about to belt back into the smoky warmth of the twins car may i speak with you francesca shall we have a word after the match im watching ricky not noticeably weewee clamoured will ive got to take will to the loo said chessie why dont you let him pee in fatty harriss rain gauge said dommie then fatty will be so horrified by the amount of rainfall hell cancel sundays match and well have a day off said seb i quite like rottweilers said dommie weewee said will dropping his maltesers in the mud as he scrambled out of the car if grace hadnt been present chessie would have picked the maltesers up as she dragged will away he burst into tears ill take him to the lav said sukey then you and grace can chat he wont go with you protested chessie come along will said sukey briskly to chessies amazement will trotted off with her you only have to use the right tone of voice said grace do look said seb nudging dommie grace is about to urge mrs fl to exercise a little decorum decorums a nice name for a dog said dommie then i could exercise it inside barts limo the new leather smelt like a tack shop grace had been a good wife to bart twentyone years ago she had taken this roaring roughneck and turned him into a tycoon she had provided him with the contacts the friendships the staff the right silver and china at her dinner parties where important people met the important people they wanted to meet grace was acutely aware of the social advantages of polo she longed to invite the prince to dine at one of her five houses as much as she wanted her two children to make brilliant marriages graces every action whether she was fundraising at a calorieconscious teetotal buffet lunch or reading biographies of famous people as she pedalled away on her exercise bicycle was geared towards improvement she couldnt understand chessies lack of motivation and had spent a lot of time this summer discussing both chessies and rickys shortcomings with bart but in the last week she had noticed bart was slagging off chessie less and less he was even talking about bringing her and ricky over to palm beach for the polo season in january having herself dreamt about ricky last night rather a disturbing dream grace had now decided that he was terribly misunderstood and took a positive pleasure in giving his wife a pep talk are you supporting doggie dins francesca of course not snapped chessie one could be fooled into thinking so a married couple is two people half a polo team and youre intelligent enough to know that you only win at polo and in life if you play as a team and support each other your behaviour towards ricky is flip destructive and totally unsupportive chessie yawned youve no idea how tricky he is women are always on rickys side because hes so goodlooking i am not women said grace icily how many times have you failed to pass on messages turned up late at matches and showed no interest in the game look at you today egging on the twins dressed like a tramp and now not giving ricky his fiftytwo if the flyers lose this match itll be entirely your fault youre twentyseven not seventeen francesca when ricky signed his contract with you said chessie furiously there was absolutely no clause about my turning up in a ball dress at every match youve no idea what its like living with a man whos totally obsessed with polo if your husbands going to succeed grace looked at chessies mutinous profile you have to put up with loneliness when bart was building up the business he often didnt come home till two oclock in the morning not surprised said chessie if you bent his ear like this dont be impertinent i dont want to hear any more you can buy ricky but not me scrambling out of the limo chessie went slap into sukey and will who was still clutching his waterpistol all better said sukey such a jolly little chap i waited outside and didnt miss a minute oh well played drew darling oh go on go on stick em up said will his eyes squinting through his blond fringe dont point guns at people dear said grace next minute will had emptied a pistol full of bloody mary into her cream silk shirt grace gave a scream chessie made the mistake of laughing if youd take your nose out of that book for one second said seb to dommie youd see ricky finally losing his patron as chessie dragged will off in search of ricky she could hear sukey comforting grace im sure mrs beeton will know how to get tomato juice out suddenly chessie stopped laughing and started to cry that was naughty she screamed at will you may have been defending my honour but your methods were very extreme hi honey said a voice youre getting soaked it was bart coming off the field delighted to have scored two goals and trounced doggie dins he was in exultant form then he realized that the rain pouring down chessies face was tears hey whats the matter your ghastly wifes been giving me a dressingdown for not dressing up telling me what an awful wife i am the icy wind was sweeping the drenched striped shirt against her breasts i tell you the only reason frankenstein was a monster was because he was frank she added furiously just for a second they were hidden from the pitch by a homegoing horse box bart put a warm sweating hand on chessies neck and she felt her stomach disappear ive tried to put you out of my mind he said roughly but i didnt manage it grace and i are going back to the states tomorrow for a wedding one of the biddies even in the pursuit of love bart had to namedrop ill be back on wednesday how about lunch on thursday all right meet me at rubens retreat at one oclock said bart and rode on grace came forward as he reached the pony lines well played baby then consulting her red book but you were loose in the fifth chukka how dare you chew out chessie francelynch snarled bart i run this team ok and dont you forget it graces peptalk only intensified chessies desire to take her husband off her the weather continued windy and very cold and chessie spent the next week sourly watching her suntan fade and thinking up alibis for thursday lunchtime fortunately ricky was being paid to play in a charity match at the guards club that day on the understanding that he stayed behind for drinks and allowed himself to be gawped at by all the sponsors rich clients this meant he wouldnt be home much before eight ricky was loath to go he was desperately worried about mattie whod stopped eating and kept biting listlessly at her plaster her eyes were dull always the first sign of pain in a horse he was sure the plaster was beginning to smell a sinister indication that infection or even worse gangrene was setting in pooh said will coming into chessies bedroom with his new polo stick and breathing in the collective reek of duo tan immac and nail polish dont touch screamed chessie as he trotted purposefully towards the makeup bottles on her dressing table she loathed being distracted when she was getting ready it was all rickys fault for not being able to afford a nanny nor could she start washing her hair until hed gone then she found the water hadnt been turned on she also dried her hair upside down too long so it stood up like a porcupine she didnt know if she was more nervous of seeing bart or ricky finding out it was so cold she put on a pale pink cashmere dress which was near enough flesh tones in colour to make her look as though she was wearing nothing at all sticking her tongue out at herberts portrait she ran down the stairs out in the yard she was relieved to find that louisa rickys youngest and most amenable groom had been left in charge plump pinkfaced always smiling louisa had been described by chessie in a bitchier moment as looking like a piglet whod just won the pools she was a complete contrast to rickys head groom frances who scrawny angry and equally obsessed with ricky and the horses was always finding fault with the other grooms work chessie had nicknamed frances and louisa picky and perky perky was now trying to coax mattie to eat a carrot can you look after will for a couple of hours chessie asked her im just popping out to lunch with a girlfriend pooh said will matties leg smells awful then realizing chessie was getting into the car without him started to cry mummy wont be long ill bring you a present called chessie as she drove off girlfriend indeed muttered louisa catching a whiff of diorissimo mummys gone ahunting ten miles from robinsgrove the wind dropped the sun came out and the temperature rocketed shrivelling the wild roses hanging from the hedgerows chessie could see her face reddening in the driving mirror and feel the sweat trickling down her ribs it was all rickys fault for not being able to afford a car with airconditioning there were no shops on the way for her to buy something cooler her mouth tasted acid with nerves rubens retreat once a large country house now an hotel was set in lush parkland reputed to have the best food and the softest double beds in england it was a favourite haunt of the rich and libidinous inside it was wonderfully cool chessie nipped into the ladies to remove her stockings tone down her flushed face and clean her teeth ive just had gastric flu and keep getting this terrible taste in my mouth she explained to the attendant whod seen it all before she found bart in an alcove screened by huge plants on the telephone he only paused to kiss her and wave her to the chair beside him he was very brown and wearing a cream silk shirt a pinstriped suit and an emeraldgreen tie which matched the greensward on which naked ladies were sporting with cherubs on the mural round the walls i dont care if the price is rising keep buying but spread it around we should have control by tomorrow lunchtime ordered bart waving to the waiter to pour chessie a glass of champagne while half his mind wrestled with the complicated finances of one of the fiercest takeovers wall street had ever known his eyes ran over chessie she was as flushed as a peony that pink dress emphasized every curve like a second skin as the waiter laid a dark green napkin across her crotch it was as though he was putting on a fig leaf bart wanted to take her upstairs and screw her at once sorry about that he said as he came off the telephone arent you drinking asked chessie noticing his glass of perrier im driving perrier dont make you merrier said chessie idly just looking at you makes me drunk said bart where does ricky think you are at home i was terrified the match might be cancelled it isnt i checked it out said bart how is he preoccupied matties deteriorating kinta wont stop sure he hasnt got a bit on the side asked bart as they studied the menu chessie laughed sourly the only bits rickys interested in go in horses mouths how was he when you got home after lady waterlanes reception asleep in the hay beside mattie that figures he thinks hes jesus christ anyway the telephone rang choose what you want to eat said bart picking up the receiver id like poached salmon zucchini and no potatoes he told the waiter why are you so keen to take over this company asked chessie as he came off the telephone five minutes later chief executive ashley roberts blackballed me at the racquet club ten years ago you are into revenge said chessie taking a slug of champagne never forget a putdown that all right he brandished his fork in the direction of chessies fish pâté fraction too much fennel said chessie ok ok that wasnt a putdown i used to cook for a living before i got married ill cook for you one day bart massaged her arm i sure hope so im sorry about grace did the bloody mary come out of her shirt no she called ralph hes making her another one i suppose thats what shirty means how was the wedding is grace still biddling while rome burns bart tapped her nose with his finger you must not take the piss how did you two meet asked chessie as the waiter took away her hardly touched pâté i was a test pilot at nasa great life none of us thought wed live beyond thirty you cant imagine the joy of testing an airplane learning its personality talking to it poking and probing finding new things i was a little boy from nowhere but when i flew i felt like a god he blushed ashamed of betraying emotion grace came to visit the plant and that was that she grounded me but she backed me chessie was fascinated how come you got so rich bart shrugged i build the best airplanes and helicopters in the world and i bought land when it was worth an acre now its going for all markets go in cycles the skill is knowing when to get in and when to get out chessie breathed in the sweet scent of white freesias and stocks in the centre of the dark green tablecloth how were your children when you went back ok quite unselfconsciously bart got photographs out of his wallet thats luke hes twentytwo nice face said chessie comes from my first marriage doesnt live with us hes been working his way up as a groom in a polo yard very proud wont accept a cent from me sounds like ricky more sympatico than ricky said bart flatly this is red chessie whistled wow thats an even nicer face he really is beautiful then sensing shed said the wrong thing nearly as goodlooking as his father bart looked mollified all the girls are crazy for red hes kinda wild he got looped at the wedding and threw his cookies all over his grannys porch plays polo like an angel if hed quit partying hed go to ten and heres my baby bibi barts voice softened now she is like you said chessie what a clever intelligent face no one could call her pretty with that crinkly hair and heavy jaw bibi is superbright harvard business school only one interested in coming into the business shes daddys girl doesnt get on with grace she might relate to a younger woman he added pointedly he is definitely putting out signals thought chessie as their second course arrived dyou often have affairs with men who arent your husband said bart forking up poached salmon not since i was married and you occasionally they werent important chessie examined the oily sheen on a red leaf of radicchio is this i guess so thats why i didnt call you before elated chessie regaled him with scurrilous polo gossip knowing it would delight him to know how other players ripped off their patrons aware she was dropping the twins in it and not caring she told him about them selling one of victors own horses back to him are you going to deauville asked bart as he came off the telephone for the third time not unless ricky forks out for a temporary nanny the grooms get so bolshy about babysitting and deauvilles no fun unless you can go out in the evening we havent had a holiday since we were married said chessie bitterly and untruthfully bart traced the violet circles under her eyes you need one dont you ever get any sleep not since i met you said chessie who had drunk almost an entire bottle of champagne it excited her wildly that this man at the same time as dealing in billions of dollars could give her his undivided attention all her grievances came pouring out having been dragged up by a succession of nannies himself ricky thinks will ought to be brought up by his mother wills a nice kid said bart hes only whiny overadrenalized and superaggressive because hes picking up tensions from your marriage youre both too screwed up to give him enough attention thats not true chessie dropped her fork with a furious clatter if youre going to talk to me like that im going bart caught her wrist pulling her back stop overreacting he said sharply you havent done anything wrong wills playing up because youre miserable does your son red throw up in porches and no doubt in porsches because you and grace arent happy spat chessie grace no longer excites me lets go upstairs said bart calmly and he opened a door hidden in the romping nymphs behind him which led straight into a lift the beauty of this place is you dont have to go through reception to get to the bedrooms it was a most unsatisfactory coupling bart was too anxious to get at her chessie was too angry and uptight to get aroused despite her moans and writhings bart knew she hadnt come sick with disappointment and frustration she got dressed here was just one more failure because she was not able to tell people what she liked that she never came from straight screwing and never with ricky poor little ricks girl said bart kissing her forehead its all over thought chessie miserably as they went outside barts telephone rang again he talked so long that chessie was about to wander off without even saying goodbye when he hung up in jubilation ive got fortynine per cent by tomorrow lunchtime ill have nailed him whats your next takeover target asked chessie sulkily you are said bart he glanced at his watch theyll just be throwingin were going for a ride like all polo players he drove too fast overtaking with splitsecond timing one hand on the wheel the other resting on chessies thigh as the limo swung round the hangar the helicopter standing on the apron was as blue as the flyers polo shirts and as the sky above on its side in dark blue letters was written alderton your friend in high places chessie sat in the passenger seat with the full flight harness biting into her pink dress having gone round turning on switches and tightening screws as a preflight check bart had taken off his jacket and his green silk tie and was secured by just a seat belt round his waist satisfied everything was in order he started up the engine there was a thrilling roar as the jets took a grip on the rotors which quickly accelerated to their operating speed with a last look round to see everything was clear bart alerted the control tower who asked for his destination and initial reading were going to do local flying towards the southeast not above a thousand feet said bart as they flew over yellowing fields and raindrenched woods and villages chessie gave a scream of joy isnt it heaven just like a childs farm if you picked up the houses theyd be hollow underneath she longed to run her hand up and down barts pinstriped thigh hard as iron like rickys theres david waterlanes place said bart you can see them stick and balling down below chessie could see the dark silken flash of the lake flecked with duck and the dark brown oval of the exercise ring if you look closely she said you may see clemency sunbathing in the nude or juan getting his back brown on top of her talk about one flew over the cuckolds nest bart laughed the sun was beating down on the glass bubble oh hell im getting too hot again thought chessie five minutes later bart pointed out a beautiful white house with a green roof set in a clearing thickly ringed with woodland he flew so low that chessie could see the cars glittering outside the front door and white figures leaping on the tennis court the swimmingpool glittered in the sunshine like an aquamarine gorgeous place breathed chessie belongs to ashley roberts barts voice thickened with excitement when i take him over tomorrow and fire him later this year hell be forced to put it on the market howd you like to live there chessie went very still we rattle enough in our present house she said lightly ahead loomed a huge apparently substantial whiteandmushroombrown cloud which had formed into turrets icebergs and snow drifts lets go through that archway said bart not even touching the snowwhite edges now he was flying alongside a massive pinky cliff just clipping it laughing as chessie flinched away i used to play around for hours like this when i was a boy now im going right into this cloud this is the most scary feeling in the world he added as they were enveloped in dense fog even after years of flying it still scares the shit out of me you cant figure if youre upside down you have a total disregard of what the brain is telling you its completely disorientating then as he came out into brilliant sunshine he smiled at her powerful as he was handsome pretty much like meeting you he does like me thought chessie in ecstasy and im mad about him hes tied up in a megatakeover and hes fooling around in the air with me the sun was beating down on the bubble again the shimmering fields and woods seemed to stretch for ever sheep huddled under the trees like lice im baking gasped chessie wishing she could find some shade like them take your dress off said bart idly just undo the harness and take it off kerist he said a moment later as chessie threw the dress behind her seat oh christ she was only wearing a pair of rosepatterned white pants the slenderness of her waist emphasized the fullness of her thighs and her breasts soft and whitegold in the sunshine with the nipples pink and spread her cheeks were very flushed her eyelids drooped over eyes leaden with lust shed put victors bimbo in the shade thought bart she was more beautiful than any of the girls his son red attracted two joysticks murmured chessie putting her hand on his cock i know which one id like best bart wanted her now but even on automatic pilot making love in a helicopter is not in the flight manual were over victors land he said in amusement theres a clearing in the wood where we can land no one will find us ill just tell them im going down on me i hope whispered chessie having cleared with flight control bart eased the power and headed for the trees chessie saw the clearing a little sagegreen disc cut in half by a winding stream flanked by willows there were no houses near by switching off bart allowed the blades to stop before opening the door and jumping on to the lush green grass next moment hed walked round to the other door and his arms were deliciously full of chessie jesus youre lovely he murmured carrying her to the shade of a large oak tree this time he was going to take it very slowly why did you pretend you came before he asked as he laid her gently down in the groin of two huge roots chessie opened her eyes in terror i didnt she stammered i came beautifully liar peeling down her pants he slid his fingers into the oily cavern thats better i should put you across my knee for distracting me at nine hundred feet instantly her breath quickened her eyes went dull her legs widened ecstatically so thats it bart thought in triumph she wants to be treated like a naughty little girl his hand slid to her bottom exploring gently but persuasively is that what you like he whispered your butt paddled repelled but wildly excited chessie squirmed against him rickys too straight huh chessie nodded helplessly i cant talk to him slipping his hand under her buttocks between her legs he fingered the bud of her clitoris and felt the flood of wetness as she gasped and came the sun had dropped behind the trees as he pulled out of her for the last time the skill said chessie mocking to hide how moved she felt is knowing when to get in and when to get out they didnt talk on the way home mist was rising from the river bart dropped her off where her car was at rubens retreat youre going to be very late what movie have you been to see gone with the wind said chessie twice round i guess this takeovers going to take up so much of my time i wont go to deauville said bart then getting a jewel box out of his briefcase ive got you a present chessie wasnt really into costume jewellery but for paste the diamonds were certainly beautifully set and looked pretty round her neck in the driving mirror she supposed the rich didnt dare wear real jewels any more thank you she said trying to simulate enthusiasm are you going to be able to hide them from ricky asked bart cupping her groin with his hand chessie glanced down id better shove them up there she said bitterly thats one place ricky wont look as ricky rode off the field at the end of the match at the guards club there was a message to ring louisa matties worse she said trying to hold back the tears her leg smells awful and her eyes are dead phil bagleys out on his rounds but i got him on his bleeper hes coming as soon as possible mercifully major ferguson the deputy chairman and polo manager understood course you must go at once ill explain to the sponsors im sssorry mumbled ricky sssuppose i shouldnt have tried to save her done just the same myself said major ferguson matties a legend give anything for one of her foals ill ring you in the morning love to chessie if only rickyd had barts helicopter limited in the horse box to forty miles an hour going slap into rushhour traffic and trapped between returning tractors and hay lorries he didnt get home until nearly eight please god save her he prayed over and over again phil bagley was already in matties box the stink of putrefaction was unmistakable mattie hung leaden in her sling for the first time since she was a tiny foal she didnt whicker with delight to see ricky phil bagley looked up shaking his head the legs completely cold below the plaster he said brusquely to hide his feelings he loved mattie having treated her since she was a foal and had rejoiced in her dazzling career ive been sticking needles in and she doesnt feel anything and her temperatures right up which indicates secondary infection as well as gangrene ricky crouched down beside phil bagley feeling matties skin which had gone hard and crisp like parchment is she in pain yup considerable im afraid theres no way we can take off the plaster and clean it up we can have a look ricky held matties head although her breath quickened she made no attempt to fight as phil got to work he only had to saw a few inches the stink was appalling im sorry ricky its completely putrid if she were a dog or a human we could amputate the fiercely impassive frances who was looking over the stabledoor gave a sob of course ricky deliberately kept his voice steady you must do it at once then without turning frances can you ask louisa to see that wills well out of the way as phil went off for the humane killer ricky put his arms round matties neck running his hand up the stubble of her mane sorry i put you through it sweetheart he muttered i only wanted to save you his voice broke as she gently nudged him as if in forgiveness shutting his eyes he scratched her gently behind the ears putting his lips to the white star between her eyes where the humane killer would go until he felt phils hand on his shoulder the sun had set but there was still a fiery glow in the west as chessie stormed up the drive dog daisies lit up the verges and the air was heavy with the sweet scent of the lime tree flowers she had hidden barts necklace in the lining of her bag and buying a rutshire echo had memorized the synopsis of the robert de niro film she was supposed to have seen sober now her earlier bravado evaporated she was twitching with nerves as she drew closer she heard a muffled explosion and slammed her foot on the accelerator the house was in darkness perhaps will had got hold of one of rickys guns then she saw the lorry parked crooked across the yard and panicked ricky was home already outside matties box he was holding frances in his arms oh charming said chessie acidly i thought you were wowing sponsors at guards ricky looked round his face ashen his eyes huge black holes then chessie saw that francess normally accusing disapproving face was a blubbered disintegrating mass of tears what on earths the matter ive just put mattie down said phil bagley in a tight voice as he emerged from matties box im terribly sorry oh god said chessie not knowing what to say but feeling passionate relief that noone would bother where shed been for a terrible moment i thought it was will shooting her a look of pure hatred ricky walked past her into the night in the kitchen she found will patting the plump shoulder of a frantically sobbing louisa mummy he turned in delight louisa crying did you bring me a present delicious sweeties said chessie producing a handful of rubens retreats petits fours out of her bag ugh said will spitting a marzipan banana out all over the floor ricky didnt come back all night chessie thought he must have gone to his fathers until the telephone woke her at eight oclock next morning herbert here barked a voice trust the old bugger not to apologize for ringing so early or after so long can i speak to ricky hes not here well tell him ive just heard about mattie bloody shame im very sorry it must have cost herbert a lot to ring but chessie decided not to pass on the message she didnt want him back in their lives hanging around restricting her freedom looking out of the window she saw ricky was back and with a couple of men from the village was digging a grave in the orchard where generations of dogs and stable cats had been buried the two labradors tails wagging were trying to join in frantically scrabbling the earth with their paws wayne rickys second favourite pony a custardyellow gelding with lop ears whod been devoted to mattie stood by the paddock gate neighing hysterically keen to escape such a house of mourning longing to be alone to think about bart chessie drove into rutminster on the pretext of doing the weekend shopping out of curiosity on the way home she stopped off at a jeweller to get barts necklace valued the bumpy veined arthritic hands trembled slightly as they examined the stones very very nice said the jeweller in reverent tones id be surprised if youd get much change out of might be even higher pretty stones for a pretty lady he added with a smile at chessies gasp of amazement chessie was so stunned she went straight out and committed the cardinal indiscretion of ringing bart at home from a call box pretend im a wrong number look im sorry i was so horribly ungrateful id no idea those diamonds were real like my love for you said bart softly i cant talk now and hung up did you bring me a present said will when she got home joyfully chessie gathered him up and swung him round till he screamed with laughter ive got a hunch she murmured i may have got you a new daddy bart rang her later can you talk i could talk when i was eighteen months said chessie but im precocious out of the window she could see louisa wiping her eyes with the back of her hand as she planted primroses round matties grave mattie had to be put down she told bart im sorry she was a helluva horse hows ricky taking it bottling it up as usual any repercussions last night ricky was too shellshocked even to realize id been away i forgot to ask yesterday are you still going to drop him i guess im going to drop ricky and grace said bart the polo community were flabbergasted when bart didnt come to deauville and allowed the team that he was forking out so much for to play without him his place was taken by an underhandicapped australian who interchanged so dazzlingly with ricky that the alderton flyers clinched the french championships after a very close fight against david waterlane and the obrien brothers kinta suddenly clicking with ricky won the best playing pony award to juans fury so much were the flyers on form they were hotly tipped to win the french gold cup next sunday although ricky desperately missed mattie he felt his luck was changing during the endless barbecues and parties the racing and gambling which characterize deauville players and patrons who arent rushing home every evening get a chance to talk ricky spent a lot of time with david waterlane and his son mike a raw silent spotty youth back from harrow for the holidays hopelessly inhibited by his father mike showed considerable promise feeling the boys relationship with david was very like his own with herbert ricky immediately struck up a rapport with mike they exercised their horses at dawn every day in the surf and stick and balled together mikes game improved dramatically and as a result david signed ricky up as his senior pro for the next year he and ricky had been to the same school and understood each other david was sick of the doubledealing and histrionics of the obriens ricky had to confess that to the abscessdraining bliss of barts absence was added the relief of not having chessie with him he could concentrate on his game and not worry the whole time whether she was bored or spending too much money or sulking because she wasnt spending money he was well aware that his marriage was going badly but being used to cold war over the years with herbert he didnt feel it was the end of the world after drinking at least a bottle and a half of champagne after the french championships ricky tried to ring home but the telephone was dead probably been cut off suddenly missing chessie like hell he decided to accept victor kaputniks offer of a lift back to the tigers yard at newbury sukey and drew who were coming too had parked their car there and could give him a lift back to rutshire buoyed up by champagne ecstatic with victory he bought a dark green cashmere jersey for chessie a cowboy suit for will and stopped off at the supermarket and loaded up with garlic sausage salami toblerone huge tomatoes and the cheese which smelt like joggers socks which chessie adored so much victors helicopter seated eight so drinking continued on the flight and sukey who didnt drink drove drew and ricky back to rutshire so they were able to carry on boozing reliving every chukka next sundays gold cup seemed well within their grasp now ricky sat in the back addressing occasional fond and drunken remarks to the huge silver cup which he would have to hand over to bart tomorrow were going to spend the second half of our honeymoon in argentina and find drew some really good ponies said sukey as she turned off the m it must be nice having a wife who acted as chauffeur and remembered every shot youd ever scored thought ricky but he didnt think he could bring himself to sleep with sukey he was overwhelmed again with longing for chessie he should have forked out for a temporary nanny they needed to spend more time together my luck has turned he told himself again as sukey drove up the lime avenue im going to be a better husband from now on robinsgrove was in darkness perhaps chessied gone to stay with her mother as he stood reeling uncertainly in the yard he suddenly felt a swordthrust of misery that mattie wasnt there to welcome him then a white ghost shot out of the grooms flat millicent the whippet frisking round his legs was overjoyed he was home she was shortly followed by the two labradors and louisa who was spilling out of a yellow sundress sounds of revelry were going on behind her whatever are you doing back she asked in horror just for the night said ricky clanking bottles as he searched in the carrier bag we won ohmigod how wonderful said louisa flinging her arms round his swaying body he was absolutely plastered bless him and kinta won best playing pony any problems no everythings fine theyre all turned out except wallaby and his hocks much better come and have a drink to celebrate the whoops and howls were increasing who the fucks that shouted a voice no thanks said ricky handing louisa a garlic sausage and a bottle of cointreau for you wheres chessie louisa looked guilty ricky thought it was because hed caught her having a party gosh thanks shes left a note on the kitchen table millicent hasnt been eating she called after ricky as he tottered towards the house but she will now youre home ricky realized how drunk he was when he tripped up the back doorstep and nearly dropped the cup god that cheese stank there was no moon so he spent ages finding his keys the kitchen was incredibly tidy usually by sunday night it was a tip he dumped the carrier bags on the table poured himself a large whisky and was just about to open a tin of chappie for millicent when he saw chessies letter how odd shed put it in an envelope dear ricky he read im leaving you i cant put up with a miserable totally meaningless marriage any more im taking will my lawyers will be in touch dont try and find me yours chessie very carefully he spooned the contents of the chappie tin into millicents bowl and putting it down sprinkled biscuits over it then as he walked towards the telephone and realized hed scattered biscuits all over the floor he started to shake his thighs suddenly seemed to have a life of their own leaping and trembling his heart was crashing against his ribcage the telephone was dead so he went over to louisas flat where he found a young man in pink boxer shorts brandishing the garlic sausage like a large cock at a frantically giggling louisa her giggles died when she saw ricky can i use your telephone louisa nodded use the one in the bedroom chessies left me ricky told drew over the telephone christ i am sorry did you know anything id heard rumours why the fuck didnt you warn me i hoped it would blow over whos the man youre not going to like this drew paused bart alderton bart said ricky incredulously but hes old enough to be her sugar daddy thats what attracted her look ill come over no im going round to kill him for christs sake youre in no condition but rickyd hung up louisa was standing in the doorway her eyes filled with tears im so sorry she stammered you oughtnt to drive wait till morning but ricky pushed straight past her millicent having wolfed her dinner and hoovered up the biscuits on the floor was determined not to be left behind and jumped belching into the now mended bmw it was a warm night the clouds had rolled back leaving brilliant stars and a rising moon as ricky couldnt find the top of the whisky bottle he wedged it in the side pocket taking repeated slugs as he drove he covered the twenty miles in as many minutes overtaking two cars at once on the narrow roads shooting crossroads a cold rage had settled in it wasnt chessies fault bart alderton could corrupt anyone the electric gates had not yet been installed so ricky was able to open the iron ones deer and sheep blinked in the headlights as he drove up an avenue of chestnut trees as he rattled over the second sheep grid where the drive opened up into a big sweep of gravel the beautiful seventeenthcentury manor house with its ruff of lavender and white roses clambering to the roof was suddenly floodlit little millicent quivered in the back as four rottweilers came roaring round the side of the house fangs bared growling horribly scrabbling at the cars paintwork with thick black claws taking another slug of whisky ricky got out of the car and because he was totally unafraid only stopping to pat a sleek snarling head or mutter a casual good dog was able to walk unscathed through the pack and ring the door bell a security guard answered his shoulders seemed to fill the door mrs francelynch said ricky youve got the wrong house buddy im coming in to wait for her whos that called chessies voice for a second the security man was caught on the hop shoving him aside ricky walked into the house chessie looked floodlit too she was wearing a red silk dress longsleeved highnecked and slinky black shoes with fourinch heels and huge rubies at her ears neck and wrists her hair had been newly streaked cut shorter and swept off her flawless face ricky caught his breath she looked staggering the tramp had become a lady how dare you barge in here radiant with spite chessie moved towards him get out bartll be back in a minute then were going out to rubens retreat it was as though she was outlining the evenings whereabouts for a babysitter how longs this been going on my being miserable since i met you i guess youre coming home to that dump im bloody not she caught a waft of whisky ricky was wearing a crumpled dark blue shirt and jeans unshaven very brown his black hair falling over his forehead he looked savage and dangerous ricky dropped his eyes first and aware of the hovering guard turned left into the drawing room which had been exquisitely furnished in soft corals and yellows by grace all the cushions looked as if they had been blown up with bicycle pumps lllook i know things have been difficult but i love you do you now ive been spending so much time on the ponies so we could get straight thingsll get better bullshit screamed chessie hysterically polos a drug only curable by poverty or death and youre hooked we won today so fucking what sneered chessie barts still going to drop you ricky bit his lip davids going to sponsor me next year and ive almost certainly got a patron for palm beach that still wont be enough to live on ill tap my father your fathers a disgusting crabby old man taunted chessie and youre getting more like him every day im not having you damaging will like herbert damaged you making you incapable of showing affection for anything but a horse im surprised you noticed wed gone under the chandelier in the centre of the room he could see she was uncharacteristically wearing a lot of makeup making her look much harder barts influence was already working and you think barts the answer said ricky slowly i was fooled at the beginning hell crucify you hes only interested in conquest he beats up his horses soon hell do the same to you he already has thought chessie stretching voluptuously she could hardly sit down after bart had spanked her that afternoon barts the most considerate man ive ever met then as ricky raised his eyebrows and the best lover he could give you a bit of coaching im fed up with being married to a failure in and out of bed ricky clenched his fists for a second chessie thought he was going to hit her mocking him with her enhanced beauty she sauntered over to the drinks trolley and with a totally steady hand poured herself a vodka and tonic her dress was so lowcut at the back that ricky could see a violet bruise above the cleft of her buttocks ill make a bargain with you she said swinging round ill come back to you the day you go to ten and win the gold cup she ticked the conditions off with long scarlet nails and the day england win back the westchester it was virtually an impossibility no english player had gone to ten since before the war and the westchester cup the holy grail of angloamerican polo had remained uncontested in american hands since you bitch whispered ricky i agree its highly unlikely said chessie her laugh sounded horrible almost mad daddy daddy woken by the din frightened by the shouting will in pale blue pyjamas trailing a huge white fluffy monkey obviously the result of a trip to harrods ran into the room and threw himself into rickys arms he was so excited he couldnt speak ricky clung on to his warm chunky body which smelt of talcum powder and shampoo seeking sanity and comfort this couldnt be happening he couldnt let chessie take will away did you bring me a present the cowboy suit was at home putting his hand in his jeans pocket ricky pulled out a little silver pony with a detachable saddle and bridle that hed been given as an extra prize for captaining the winning team here you are horsie said will enraptured horsie like mattie then turning to chessie daddy stay the night daddys going said chessie icily reaching for the bell let me keep him for tonight no said chessie alarmed youll kidnap him what are you planning to do with him take him back to america of course but well be back and forth to england all the time bart does so much business im sure the lawyers will grant you visitation rights visitation rights said ricky enraged youre even talking like a fucking american now hes my child and im not having that bastard bringing him up were going home he said pushing wills blond fringe out of his eyes then when will looked doubtful millicents in the car and you can see louisa aware of the security man hovering in the hall ricky made a dive for the french windows no screamed chessie mummy bellowed will suddenly scared stop him yelled chessie but ricky was already sprinting across the lawn with will bawling his head off and next minute the bmw was careering down the drive scattering rottweilers they met bart coming the other way and had to mount the verge to pass him ricky was in luck bart because he was coming to pick up chessie had left the gates open poor millicent was bouncing around in the back as stone walls and dusty august trees flashed by ricky knew he ought to fasten wills seat belt but all that seemed important for the moment was putting as much distance as possible between himself and bart there was a crossroads in half a mile where he could lose him in mounting the verge he had spilt the whisky and the car reeked of drink want mummy howled will want mummy its all right darling youre safe daddy loves you youll see mummy soon ive got a present for you at home wills sobs subsided a little ahead the river fleet gleamed in the moonlight as they hurtled towards the bridge ricky put a hand on wills leg to steady and reassure him next moment the moon slid behind a big black cloud too late he saw in the pale glow of the headlights a fox cub racing down the middle of the bridge towards him its eyes yellow and panicstricken instinctively ricky swung to the left and hit the side of the bridge head on over the almighty crunch he heard will scream felt an agonizing pain in his elbow and then blackness the two speed cops reached him before bart millicent was whimpering in the back will was killed outright his neck broken by the impact of the dashboard ricky was unconscious the gash down the side of his face pouring blood his right arm in a curiously vulnerable position you could smell whisky all over the car plastered said one of the traffic cops shaking his head and neither of them wearing seat belts then as the moon came out he noticed the polo stickers on the windscreen and the little silver pony clutched in wills hand christ its ricky francelynch he said as his companion rang for an ambulance he tried to coax millicent out of the back seeing rickys licence on the floor he flipped through it thought as much he muttered two drunkdriving charges already theyll clobber him for manslaughter poor sod he thought the world of that kid poor little bugger nearly four months after william francelynch was killed in a car crash and his father arrested on charges of manslaughter and drunken driving perdita macleod broke up for the christmas holidays having been expelled from queen augustas for carousing with the carlisle twins and walking out of her english exam she had been dispatched to an even stricter and more expensive boarding school only the threat that she wouldnt be given a polo pony for christmas had prevented her running away to the bliss of breaking up was the added thrill that her mother and stepfather had at last moved into brock house a rambling medieval rectory on the rutshiregloucestershire border six miles from rutshire polo club it was even more excitingly only two miles from eldercombe the village in which ricky francelynch lived although the poor darling perdita reflected bitterly was still cooling his heels in rutminster gaol awaiting trial terrified lest her mother would be eccentrically dressed or even worse blub in oh little town of bethlehem perdita had failed to send home the invitation to the endofterm carol service merely telling her to pick her up afterwards perdita was normally too idle to lift anything heavier than a cigarette but today in the hope of a lightning getaway she had lugged her trunk her record player carrier bags full of posters dirty washing polo magazines holiday work some hope vivaldi the hampster and a yucca called kevin down three flights of stairs and piled them up outside her school house alas just as everyone was spilling out of chapel identikit mothers in ontheknee suits identikit fathers in fawn coats with brown velvet collars perditas mother daisy rolled up in an absolutely filthy fallingapart mini and immediately started tooting and waving like a rainbow windmill abandoning the car and blocking everyones way she ran across the tarmac to fling her arms round her daughter finally perdita crimson in the face was able to wriggle free and start hurling carrier bags into the car as the heldup traffic tooted and everyone particularly the fawncoated fathers stared in amazement why thought perdita savagely does my mother have to be so wacky and so demonstrative and even worse look half the age of any of the other mothers daisy in fact looked adorable in her early thirties she had the round grave dark brown eyes the rosy cheeks the long straight shiny brown hair parted in the middle and gaudy taste in clothes of a matrioska doll but when she stopped worrying and smiled her eyes had the joyous sparkle and her mouth the dark pink bewitching softness of hogarths shrimp girl today she was less gaudy than usual trying to catch a landscape in a certain light before she left she had forgotten to take off her painting smock or wash the alizarin crimson off her hands and looked as if shed been killing a pig on her left cheek was a large splodge of burnt sienna which shed used to capture the faded ginger of the oak woods beneath the new house oh look theres blue teddy cried daisy in her slightly breathless voice which squeaked when she got excited she propped perditas ancient teddy bear up between kevin the yucca and the record player now he can see out of the window its such a ravishing drive home oh theres miss osbourne went on daisy scrabbling in the back as she saw perditas house mistress bearing down on them i bought her a bottle of bristol cream no mum shes an old bitch hissed perdita for christs sake get in were holding up the traffic hi perdita have a good christmas a group of classmates to whom perdita with her beauty outward insouciance and murderous wit was a source of constant fascination peered in through the window are you perditas friends asked daisy whod never been allowed to meet any of them how lovely weve just moved to rutshire perhaps youd like to come and stay in the holidays the tooting was getting deafening mum for gods sake shrieked perdita byee shouted daisy windmilling to miss osbourne and the group of girls as she set off in a succession of jerks down the drive narrowly avoiding ramming the car in front as she stopped to admire the trailing yellow twigs of a willow tree against an angry navyblue sky cant think whats wrong with the car said daisy as it ground to a halt and died just inside the school gates the tooting became even more acrimonious as she frantically tried the ignition need any help the father of lucinda montague perditas sworn enemy reeking of brandy from his office party popped his head inside the car it wont budge said daisy helplessly fraid youve run out of petrol daisy who always found the wrong things funny went off into peals of laughter perdita put her head in her hands it was not until four fathers all roaring with laughter whod also obviously been to office parties lifted the mini out of the way and miss osbourne had provided a can of petrol and theyd reached the slow lane of the motorway and daisyd apologized a hundred times that perdita thawed enough to light a cigarette and ask what the house was like oh gorgeous said daisy thrilled to be forgiven you cannot believe the views this morning the whole valley was palest cobalt green with frost and the shadows of the bare trees were do eddie and violet like it interrupted perdita who was bored rigid by nature adore it theres so much space after london i bet theyve bagged the best rooms every room is best were going to be so happy youve already been asked to a pony club barn dance i wouldnt be seen dead said perdita scornfully noone whod bopped the night away with jesus and the carlisle twins would lower herself to a pony club hop when can we get my pony well i rang the twins as you suggested theyre in argentina but their groom put me on to a man outside rutminster whos got a bay mare if you like her subject to a vets certificate you should be able to have her right away although daddy may think you should wait till christmas day thats stupid christmas isnt for ten days i could be schooling or even hunting her by then how much are you prepared to pay i cant see daddy going much above you wont get a threelegged donkey for that snapped perdita stubbing out her cigarette and lighting another one the moves been dreadfully expensive began daisy hopefully perhaps if your reports good dont be fatuous daddy doesnt give a shit about my reports now if it were violet or eddie thats not true protested daisy knowing it was whens granny macleod arriving twentythird said daisy gloomily thats all we need now shes a widow shell be more ghastly and selfobsessed than ever daisy knew she ought to reprove perdita but she had never got on with her motherinlaw herself and was dreading having her for christmas bridget macleod in her turn had never forgiven her daughterinlaw for having what she referred to as a past nearly sixteen years ago when she was only seventeen daisy had become pregnant while she was at art college her parents were so appalled when they learned the circumstances in which the baby was conceived that they threw daisy out eventually daisy gave birth to a daughter and called her perdita the lost one because she knew she couldnt afford to keep her in utter despair while going through the legal process of adoption daisy had met a trainee barrister hamish macleod hamish was one of those stolid young men who grew a beard and had a flickering of social conscience during the sixties which was firmly doused by the economic gloom of the seventies moved by daisys plight rendered sleepless by her beauty hamish asked her to marry him so that she could keep the baby daisy had accepted with passionate gratitude hamish was goodlooking and seemed kind she was sure she could grow to love him anything to keep perdita hamishs family particularly his mother bridget were appalled scottish lowermiddle class rigidly respectable they branded daisy a whore who had blighted their only sons dazzling career at the bar they had threatened to black the wedding unless daisy put on a wedding ring and pretended that she was a young widow whose husband had been killed in a car crash daisy after fifteen years of marriage still looked absurdly young kind sympathetic dreamy hopelessly disorganized she had become increasingly insecure because hamish who had now left the bar and become a successful television producer never stopped putting her down and complaining about her ineptitude as a mother her lack of domesticity and her lousy dress sense subconsciously hed never forgiven her for having perdita illegitimately and hit the roof if she looked at other men at parties he also ruthlessly discouraged her considerable gifts as a painter because they reminded him of her rackety artstudent past and because he considered there was no money in it nor could he ever forgive perdita for her strange beauty her bolshiness and her dazzling athletic ability throughout the marriage he had pointedly lavished affection on the two children violet and eddie now aged thirteen and eight whom he and daisy had had subsequently less glamorous than perdita they were sweetertempered and betteradjusted daisys fatal weakness was a reluctance to hurt anyone she had tried and tried to screw up the courage to tell perdita the truth about her birth but terrified of the tantrums this would trigger off she had funked it feeding her the official line that her father had been killed in a car crash we were so in love darling but he never knew i was pregnant daisy dreaded the day when perdita might want to know the name of her real father at least her blinkered obsession with polo and ponies had some advantages aware however that hamish didnt love her perdita tried to trigger off a response by behaving atrociously matters werent helped by bridget macleods ability to beam simultaneously at hamish violet and eddie and freeze out daisy and perdita this reduced daisy to gibbering sycophancy and perdita to utter outrageousness dark thoughts about her motherinlaws impending visit occupied daisy until darkness fell by which time they had reached the village of appleford where several cottages in the high street already sported holly rings and the village shop window was bright with crackers and christmas puddings brock house lay a quarter of a mile on its gates flanked by pillars topped by stone badgers bumping down the pitted drive daisy reached a fork to the left past vast unkept rose bushes and a dovecote lay farm buildings which had been converted into garages stables and a tackroom with paddocks behind to the right flowerbeds edged with box and a paved terrace led down stone steps to the back of brock house shaggy with creepers long and low with its little litup windows the house had a secretive air on the far side beyond a large lawn edged with herbaceous borders the land dropped sharply into the appleford valley thickly wooded with oaks and larches and famous for its badger sets inside was chaos daisy had made heroic attempts to get straight after moving but now the children had come home bringing their own brand of mess violet and eddie were in the kitchen and greeted their elder sister guardedly whats for supper asked eddie who was circling advertisements in exchange and mart chicken casserole and chocolate mousse to celebrate perditas first night home said daisy there was said violet you left the larder door open and gainsborough got at the chicken then he was sick i cleared it up and i got some sausages from the village shop thank god for violet thought daisy violet macleod had inherited daisys sweet nature and round face and hamishs solid figure freckles and curly darkred hair which clashed with her high colour when she blushed she also had beautifully turneddown amethyst eyes which she pointed out ruefully matched her plump purple legs less bright than perdita she did much better at school because she was hardworking and methodical and because she knew you needed straight as to become a vet violet spent much of her time sticking up for her father and grandmother and protecting her mother from perditas tantrums she was now combing the recently sick longhaired ginger tomcat gainsborough who was mewing horribly stop it said violet firmly you know fur balls make you sick eddie at eight looked not unlike a bouncer in a nightclub slightly dyslexic hugely entertaining he was interested in making a fast buck and enjoying himself he had already found another prep schoolboy across the valley with whom to spend his time his current ambition was to have a gun for christmas daisy was dragging her feet because she felt eddie might easily murder his elder sister give us a fag perdita said eddie as perdita got out a packet of silk cut eddie said violet shocked you are much too young want us to show you round asked eddie unloading the car listening to the thundering feet and yells of excitement as the children raced along the passages daisy prayed that in this house they would at last be a really happy family the stables are fantastic said perdita with rare enthusiasm when she returned twenty minutes later with the others when the telephone rang daisy answered from the way their mother stiffened and her voice became nervous and conciliatory the children knew it was their father now she was apologizing for forgetting to get his suit back from the cleaners ill pick it up first thing in the morning perditas home would you like a word for a second perditas normally deadpan face was vulnerable and hopeful well youll see her later oh i see you must be frantic see you tomorrow night then hes not coming home explained daisy putting down the receiver because he knows im back said perdita flatly nonsense blustered daisy he sent tons of love all three children knew she was lying hes only got love for eddie sneered perdita and notsoshrinking violet can i have a vodka and tonic i am fifteen now oh all right said daisy anything to keep the peace dark dark dark wailed daisy a week later the hoovers gone phut the washing machines broken down hamish says the place is a tip and the kitchen brush has alopecia im off perdita dressed for hunting in boots skintight breeches and a dark blue coat went straight to the housekeeping jar what are you doing asked daisy i need money for the cap you took a tenner yesterday ill pay you back out of my christmas present money said perdita rushing off towards the stables wheres my dark green sweater bellowed hamish from upstairs there are two buttons missing off my blazer and why the hell isnt there any loo paper daisy sighed hamish had come back exhausted after a weeks filming last night to watch one of his programmes a documentary on road haulage daisy hadnt helped matters by falling asleep because it was so boring the moment the final credits went up hamishs mother was on the telephone telling him how wonderful it had been when noone else rang hamish who was pathological about his beauty sleep retired to bed the telephone then started up again but instead of being congratulations from jeremy isaacs and alasdair milne it was friends of the children catching up on gossip and wondering what life in the country was like until hamish was screaming with irritation now he was downstairs bellyaching because perdita had whipped the last of the housekeeping money i told you to always keep a float i dont know them well enough in the village shop to ask them to cash a cheque what times peter pan oh christ said daisy hysterically id forgotten all about peter pan i cant go ive got to get everything ready for your mother tomorrow and do all the cooking and shopping and buy the stocking presents and i havent wrapped any of the other presents and ive got to stay in for the washingmachine man we havent got any clean sheets hamish looked at her pityingly i cant understand why you cant treat christmas like any other weekend i suppose youve got your period coming ive got your bloody mother coming muttered daisy into the sink wendy can do the shopping said hamish loftily and the stocking presents give me the list but she must be frantic protested daisy wendy was hamishs pa who seemed to work for him twentyfour hours a day its always the busiest people who find the time said hamish sanctimoniously wendy can take the children to peter pan ill bring them and the shopping home afterwards i hope he added ominously youre going to get things shipshape for mother shes had a very stressful year and needs a rest in the past on hearing hamishs car draw up outside daisy had been known to take mugs out of the dish washer and frantically start washing them up in the sink so much did hamish hate to see her inactive he was a successful film producer because he was good at keeping costs down finicky about detail and had brilliant empathy with his leading ladies who found him attractive because to use one of his favourite phrases he targeted on them hamish in fact looked rather like an old testament prophet who regretted shaving off his beard for a bet copperbeech red hair rippling to his collar a wide noble forehead smouldering hazel eyes beneath jutting black brows and a fine hooked nose with flaring nostrils lapsed into a petulant mouth and a receding chin hamish also loved the sound of his own voice which reminded him of brown burns tumbling over mossy rocks in the highlands having muscular hips and good legs he also wore a kilt on every possible occasion he was now however soberly dressed in grey flannels and applying a clothes brush to the small of his blazered back as he grumbled about cat hair the moment hed borne eddie violet and the shopping list off to work daisy felt guilty about making such a scene with the pressure off she started reading the daily mail i believe it is possible a young american girl was quoted as saying to have a caring supportive husband cherishing children and a high octane career i have none of these things thought daisy i only want to paint later that evening she and violet decorated the house violet organized a bucket of earth and red crêpe paper for the tree and daisy was comforted by the rituals of hanging up the same plastic angel with both legs firmly stuck together and the tinsel with split ends and the coloured balls which had lost their hooks and had to be tucked into the branches until they fell prey to gainsborough in the alcove by the front door they set up the crib which had been in the macleod family for generations there had nearly been a divorce the year daisy painted the plain wooden figures putting mary in powder blue and joseph in a rather ritzy orange did you enjoy peter pan asked daisy as she arranged straw from the stables in baby jesuss manger it was fun said violet id forgotten captain hook went to eton daddy loved it too daddy came with you said daisy in amazement wendy got an extra ticket explained violet standing on a chair to tie mistletoe to the hall light he gets on awfully well with wendy theyre always laughing thats nice thought daisy wistfully hamish seldom laughed at home the lost boys reminded me of perdita said violet life would be so peaceful thought daisy if it were just her and violet now they were alone she could tell violet how wonderful her report was daisy also felt guilty that perditas new pony had cost a beautiful bay mare called fresco she had arrived with a saddle and a pound note tucked into her bridle for luck which perdita had nailed to the tackroom wall but that was only the beginning frescos trousseau of rugs so new they practically stood up by themselves and headcollars and body brushes and curry combs not to mention feed had cost a fortune at least perdita was blissful having established an instant rapport with the pony she was totally organized and reliable about looking after her it was such a relief having her in a good mood and out of the house hunting and exploring the countryside particularly near ricky francelynchs land but daisy still felt she ought to buy better presents for the other two children hamish had violently discouraged daisy against taking any interest in money on the grounds that she was too stupid to understand it but she had felt mildly alarmed when he told her they were only going to rent brock house because he had invested almost the entire proceeds from the london house in a coproduction with the americans the resulting movie he assured her would be such a surefire hit hed recoup his original stake five times over and be able to buy brock house or something far grander in a year or two the spare cash left over gave daisy the illusion that for once they were flush she must find something more exciting for violet than that laura ashley dress suddenly she had a brainwave at least bridget coming made her tidy up thought daisy the following day as she plumped the cushions in the drawing room and used eight firelighters and all yesterdays mail and telegraph to light the logs hamish had grudgingly chopped that morning and at least they werent going to bridgets for christmas with a shiver daisy remembered the year when baby eddie and violet and particularly perdita had trodden lindt kittens into bridgets carpet and sacked her ultratidy house more effectively than any hun or visigoth going into the garden to pick some pinched pink roses and winter jasmine for bridgets bedroom daisy breathed in the sweet just freezing air the acrid smell of bonfires and leaves moulding into the cocoabrown earth the red had gone out of the woods now they were uniformly dun and donkey brown with the travellers joy glittering silken over the tops of the trees in the setting sun in a fringe of beeches across the valley rooks grumbled like waves scraping on shingle it was so beautiful if only she could paint but hamish would be driving biddy as his mother was nicknamed down from the airport now i must try to be efficient and nice to her and forget about painting until she leaves daisy told herself firmly i must be grateful for the millionth time to hamish for saving me from solitary evenings in peeling bedsitters with one bar on the fire and a fortywatt bulb and no money and look at perdita whom hamish had enabled to live in this glorious house and hunt this wonderful pony every macleod had a silver lining as always she felt even guiltier when hamish came through the door with his mother such a frail little person with tears in her eyes who smelt of tweed cologne and brought homemade fudge and shortbread and a bottle of whisky for hamish how could i have turned her into such a monster thought daisy as she put on the kettle there was a clatter of hooves outside and perdita appeared at the back door i suppose theres no hope the glasgow shuttle crashed with no survivors she asked hush shes arrived said daisy you must try and be nice to granny and for gods sake tidy your room when youve sorted out fresco daddys bound to show her round the house did you have a good day brilliant we got three foxes i got a brush perditas face was muddy but her pale cheeks were for once flushed with colour and her dark eyes sparkled like jet rupert campbellblack was out christ hes goodlooking he gave me several swigs of brandy and billy lloydfoxe too hes really nice and gave me two fags and they both said it wouldnt hurt fresco to hunt her and play polo hunting was the best way to get used to a young horse and rupert told me he was going to have one more crack at the world championships next year and then give up showjumping and drew benedict was there and the twins theyre off to palm beach just after christmas but were going to get together in the spring holidays and fresco jumped a bullfinch at least six foot high and that journalist beattie johnson came to the meet she said she was getting material for an indepth interview with ricky rupert pissed her up and said he was only interested in indepth intercourse of course she was only digging up dirt evidently rickys taken wills death terribly hard and that bitch chessie buggered off with all the francelynch jewellery and when you think how rich bart is its all right im coming sweetheart she turned back to fresco i cant tell you how much i like living in rutshire rupert and billy gave us a lift home in their lorry we really must get a trailer not at the moment said daisy coming out to give fresco a piece of carrot wheres the newlywid now asked perdita shes upstairs daisy giggled you mustnt be naughty it must be awful being widowed bet shes knocked out she cant have loved grandpa the way she bossed him around the poor old sod must be having the best christmas ever first time hes rested in peace for forty years by the time biddy macleod had expressed joy and amazement at the increased growth and splendour of violet and eddie and at hamishs taste in putting up pictures none of them daisys and arranging the furniture although aunt madges chest of drawers in the spare room could do with a guid polish and come downstairs having unpacked im not happy till i get straight and how it was late for tea at five although flying made one work up a thirst and what a nice young fellow had insisted on carrying her hand luggage at the airport daisy had decided biddy was an absolute monster again and she didnt look remotely frail any more just a bossy old bag with mean little eyes like burnt currants a tight white perm and a disapproving mouth like a puckeredup dogs bum she doesnt mind being widowed at all thought daisy it leaves her free to indulge her real passion hamish the first black daisy put up was to forget biddy had lemon in her tea trust hamish to remember said biddy smiling mistily chuntering daisy belted back to the kitchen but got distracted through the clematis and winter jasmine which framed the hall window she could see the red afterglow of the sunset blackly striped by a poplar copse i must remember it just like that she thought it wouldnt be a cliché with the picture frame of creeper mummy called violet you were getting granny some lemon mummy was looking out of the window she explained to her grandmother and hamish she finds things so beautiful sometimes she forgets what shes doing hamishs and biddys eyes met i must get that creeper cut back its ruining the brickwork said hamish i got seventyfive christmas cards biddy was boasting as daisy came back having scraped the mould off a wizened slice of lemon id prefer it black biddy said pointedly cant you remember anything snapped hamish glaring at daisy as long as its wet and warm said biddy with a martyred sigh i was saying i got seventyfive christmas cards so many people wrote saying such nice things about your father hamish i brought them with me we didnt get many this year said hamish petulantly daisy was so late in sending out the change of address cards as daisy was clearing away the tea things and biddy had been poured a wee glass of sherry hamish suddenly went to the gramophone and put on a record that had just reached number one in the charts i must just play you this lovely record mother it was some choirboy singing a poignant solo beginning if onlee your christmas could be my christmas and going on to expound on the loneliness of being separated from loved ones during the festive season but you dont like pop music daddy said violet in amazement i know but i heard it on the car radio and fell in love with it its great isnt it mother very moving said biddy i love the sound of choirboys voices at that moment perdita walked in still flushed from hunting still in her white shirt tie breeches and boots she looked utterly ravishing surely biddy will concede that thought daisy hello granny said perdita guardedly making no attempt to kiss her grandmother youve shot up said biddy accusingly i hear your fathers bought you a pony i hope you realize what a lucky girl you are shes lovely agreed perdita whats for supper mum im starving going to the drinks tray she poured herself a large vodka and tonic what the hell are you doing thundered hamish mum always lets me biddys dogsbum mouth puckered up even more disapprovingly hows your new school horrific and have you decided what youre going to do when you grow up perdita smiled im going to get divorced i beg your pardon im going to marry a megarich businessman catch him cheating on me and take him to the cleaners mum i truly am going to need a trailer the meets after christmas are too far away to hack to biddys and hamishs simultaneous explosions were diverted by the doorbell thankful to escape from the fray daisy fled to answer it oh the little duck they could hear her saying from the hall violet darling im sorry you had to have her before christmas but heres your present the next moment an english setter puppy had padded happily and confidently into the drawing room she had a black patch over one eye like nelson black ears a lean speckled body like a baby seal and a tail which hadnt unfurled its feathers but which shook her whole body every time she wagged it oh mummy gasped violet as the puppy joyfully licked her bright pink face shes the loveliest thing in the world i cant believe it is she really mine oh i love her and who is going to look after her when violet goes back to school said hamish furiously i am said daisy then i wont be lonely when youre away so much ive had a lot of dropped telephone calls this week which im sure must be burglars checking up a large dogs a terrific deterrent it was hard to tell who looked more disapproving when having rushed round in excitement and tried to snatch biddys knitting the puppy peed on the rug in front of the fire that rug was a wedding present from the mcgaragles thundered hamish ill get a cloth said violet oh thank you mum shes the best present ive ever had by the time ethel as the puppy was now called had rampaged round the house chased gainsborough up the tree with subsequent loss of glass balls peed again twice had a bowl of scrambled egg and fallen asleep on a cushion by the aga daisy had managed to get supper ready it was the first time they had eaten in the dark green dining room with the big window looking over the valley and the red berries of the holly tucked behind every picture gleaming in the candlelight daisy had taken a lot of trouble to make coq au vin and a meringue and icecream pudding with raspberry purée hamish wasnt going to have a public row with daisy about the puppy instead he pointedly ignored her making no comment about the food and telling his mother at great length about the new film he was making on robert burns ive got no airpetite since your father passed away but i must keep my strength up said biddy piling a matterhorn of mashed potato on to her plate she had always been the most demonstrative leaver always taking too much so she could leave a lot worst of all she ate terribly slowly violet who longed to play with the puppy and perdita and eddie who wanted to watch television were nearly going crazy and only waited because they wanted some pudding perdita lit a cigarette put it out thundered hamish perdita pretended to snore eddie got the giggles violet went bright crimson trying not to giggle daisy had to rush out of the room to get the pudding its absolutely yummy said violet accepting a second helping can we have it instead of christmas pudding asked eddie biddy macleod said nothing she wanted to leave it but she was too greedy you must be tired mother said hamish early bed with a hotty i think biddy who loved it when her son was masterful admitted she was a little weary but before i turn in id love to see your road haulage film again but international velvets on protested perdita you can watch it in your bedrooms said hamish heavily but we cant tape it wailed eddie and my television shows snow storms on all four channels mines broken said perdita if your mother occasionally saw fit to get anything mended said hamish nastily you wouldnt be in this predicament for once you are not going to do everything you want biddy smiled at violet would you kindly make me a cup of horlicks i brought my own jar its on the hall table i didnt think youd have any here although hamish used to love a drink of horlicks ignoring perdita who was looking at her with horror a cold blank stare coming straight off the north pole biddy added and if youre coming up eddie theres no wastepaper basket in the guest room nor toilet paper in the guest bathroom where is ethel going to sleep said daisy as she wearily finished clearing up in my room said violet who was gently teasing the diving biting ethel with an old slipper she is not thundered hamish who had just dispatched biddy to bed i am not having this house reduced to a urinal how could you introduce a puppy at christmas he added to daisy all the dog charities say its the worst time she will sleep in the stables because he doted on violet he relented enough to allow ethel to sleep in the kitchen with a ticking clock wrapped in a towel to simulate her mothers heartbeat we must start as we mean to go on said hamish getting into bed with his pyjamas buttoned up to the neck and pointedly turning out the light on his side of the bed a great howl rent the air christ said hamish oh i love the sound of puppies voices said perdita from the television room as an even more piteous howl rent the air silent night silent night giggled eddie from his bedroom oh poor ethel said violet from the landing trying not to cry typical exploded hamish my mother has come here for a rest i am totally exhausted and have to be on location at six tomorrow and you introduce that incontinent beast i think you do these things deliberately i truly dont said daisy humbly i just thought violet deserved something special because youve bankrupted me buying that pony for perdita ethels howls were growing in volume let violet get her just for tonight pleaded daisy no said hamish will noone listen to the voice of common sense i hope youre satisfied youre ruining mine and my mothers christmas theres no way ill get to sleep now as daisy lay twitching in the darkness waiting for the next explosion hamish started snoring unheard by her father violet had tiptoed downstairs and carried a delighted wriggling ethel upstairs to bed with her in the television room unconcerned by any of the rumpus she had caused earlier perdita lit a cigarette and put in a tape of last years polo international freezing it every time ricky hit the ball one day shed have a swing as good as his christmas eve started badly hamish buzzed off humming if onlee leaving daisy with a mass of food to buy all the presents to wrap up and dispatch and biddy macleod to entertain a hard overnight frost symbolized biddys mood and put paid to any hunting so perdita was hanging around winding everyone up the evertactful violet took biddy on an extended tour of the house as some sort of deathwish afterwards daisy couldnt resist showing biddy the stables surely the old bag could find something nice to say about the immaculate tack room and the gleaming contented fresco fetlock deep in clean straw but biddy merely remarked it was a pity perdita didnt keep her bedroom like that and how all that equipment must have cost puir hamish a fortune daisy bit her lip but frescos been a huge success perditas been so much easier since shes got a real interest and the children are fighting so much less she protested mummy mummy yelled violet from her bedroom window quickly perditas killing eddie whatever for said daisy racing over the gravel hes recorded the wizard of oz over her international tape christmas eve deteriorated after lunch biddy solemnly rootled out hamishs mending and sourly sewed to the festival of nine lessons and carols everplacating daisy kept rushing in putting more logs on the fire and offering cups of tea hamish should have been back after lunch but didnt return until seven singing if onlee and sucking extra strong mints at least have a rest tomorrow and boxing day biddy implored him ill have to go in on boxing day and look at the rushes you work too hard out of despair and to get her through the nightmare of packing presents daisy got stuck into the vodka and orange much too early she made heroic attempts to have dinner bang on eight leaving a beef casserole in the slow oven of the aga then she discovered to her horror at ten to eight that perdita had replaced the beef with some barley she was boiling overnight for fresco you did it on purpose yelled hamish i did not screamed perdita i didnt know it was for tonight daisy burst into tears biddy whod set like a jelly all day suggested she rustle something up instead hamish with an air of martyrdom swept biddy violet and eddie out to supper at the local pub saying theyd go on to midnight mass afterwards he refused to take perdita seeing perditas white set face daisy said she had all the stockings to do and shed skip supper and walk down to midnight mass later upstairs in her bedroom with a bottle of benedictine she started frantically cocooning presents with sellotape biddy would be shocked she believed in recycled paper and string it was past eleventhirty by the time daisy had finished the stockings its the only time fat lumpy legs are acceptable she thought laying them on the bed she ought to get ready for church but she couldnt find her boots anywhere looking for them downstairs she found ethel crunching something up in the hall she was so adorable with her thumping tail and speckled head then as ethel coughed up a piece of wood which was definitely orange daisy let out a moan whats up said perdita who was eating philadelphia cheese with a spoon in the kitchen ethels eaten st joseph wailed daisy grannyll have a heart attack hooray said perdita ive bought her the jane fonda work out book for christmas hopefully itll finish her off its nearly midnight lets go out and see if frescos kneeling down to honour the birth of christ the grey lurex lawn crunched beneath their feet jupiter orion capella and the dog star blazed overhead there were never such stars in london thought daisy fresco gave a low deep whinny of welcome but didnt bother to get up as perdita sat down beside her that means theyre happy and relaxed said perdita proudly if they lie down isnt she beautiful shes the best friend ive ever had thank you so much mum ill be a great polo player one day and then i can support you unbelievably touched tight from tiredness and benedictine daisy wandered away from the stable door then behind her from the black church spire she heard the mad romping din of the bells echoing down the white frozen valley celebrating the birth of christ the hopes and fears of all the years thought daisy overwhelmed with a wave of loneliness and despair how wonderful to love and be in love at christmas then wiping away the tears she chided herself how ridiculous to think there was more to life than a husband children and a lovely house i do love you she mumbled much later when hamish came to bed is that because youve drunk half a bottle of benedictine dyou want some sex daisy daisy didnt she was absolutely knackered but she thought it might cheer hamish up sex with him was always the same hand straight down to the clitoris rubbing it until she was wet enough for him to go in then ten brisk thrusts before he came daisys hangover did not enhance christmas morning for her nor did eddie playing a computer game hed got in his stocking which squawked every time the monkey grabbed the banana on the palm tree nor did biddy yakking on and on and letting her croissant get cold biddy had made a little stocking for hamish filled with socks underpants shaving soap disposable razors and initialled handkerchiefs and finally a fawn jersey which he was now wearing all the things i know you need biddy had added pointedly daisy who longed to get everyone out of the kitchen so she could stuff the turkey clutched her head as the telephone rang swearing and falling over the puppy hamish grabbed the receiver it was his leading lady in the robert burns film whod found a tax bill among her christmas cards hamish turned on the charm but darling youll get repeat fees and i ought to get reheat fees thought daisy as she shoved biddys cooling croissant back in the oven for the third time that was melanie said hamish coming off the telephone switching on the kettle and dropping another herbal teabag into his cup even on christmas day they pester you sighed biddy and you ought to eat a proper breakfast youve lost so much weight seven pounds said hamish smugly patting his concave stomach then snatching up the telephone as it rang again hamish macleod oh hello hello turning towards the window hamish hunched his broad shoulders over the telephone jumping as biddy leapt up to tuck in the marks and spencer tag sticking up from his jersey collar how are you he went on no not yet we open ours at teatime lovely its awfully sweet of you ill try happy christmas trying not to smirk he put down the receiver isnt that sweet that was wendy ringing to wish us all happy christmas she sent special love to you and violet he added to eddie and hoped you enjoyed peter pan shes my pa he added to biddy absolutely first rate i hope you get a chance to meet before you go back they were late opening their presents because daisy was still stuffing the turkey and edging it into the aga which was harder than parking the mini in cheltenham on christmas eve make a list said hamish bossily as the children fell on their presents or well never remember who gave who what and get a bin for all the paper we can use again and get that dog out of here he added as ethel pitched in joyously biddy macleod gave eddie a camera violet a walkman and hamish some gold cufflinks to replace the ones daisy had lost in the laundry she gave daisy a set of cake forks and perdita two padded satin coathangers judging by your room i thought you needed something to hang your clothes on she told perdita daisy shopping at the last moment had overspent appallingly eddie was overwhelmed with the airgun violet was too sweet not to pretend to be enchanted with the laura ashley dress but hamish wasnt remotely pleased with his barbour and green gumboots nor his silk shirts after all it was his money daisy was squandering and when biddy opened the box with the beautiful pale grey silk nightie she merely said thank you very quietly and put it to one side she made no comment about the jane fonda work out book but went into raptures over eddie and violets massive box of chocolates im going to have one now and then there was all the palaver of identifying a coffee creme from the chart oh come on said perdita biddy went into orbit when hamish handed her an envelope which told her that the tapes of all his programmes including road haulage and a video machine would be waiting for her in glasgow when she got home one more present said daisy handing biddy an unwieldy red parcel cocooned in sellotape it says biddy love from ethel in the end hamish had to help biddy rip it open she gave a gasp as she extracted a pair of dusty ancient downatheel boots one with a piece of chewing gum sticking to the toe what is the meaning of this theyre mummys boots said violet shes been looking for them all day i must have packed them by mistake said daisy in a small voice everyone dressed for dinner daisy only had time to wriggle into an old purpleandred caftan and tone down her scarlet cheeks perdita in a black skirt and shirt that daisy had given her came into the kitchen as daisy was draining the sprouts her clean whiteblond hair hung in a long plait with that lovely smooth white forehead and long long dark eyes and the greek nose and the tiny upper lip curving over the wonderful passionate mouth she was pure picasso thought daisy you look gorgeous she said i wish daddy and granny thought so that was inspired giving boots to an old boot hush hissed daisy it was totally unintentional violet loyally wearing her new laura ashley which was quite the wrong colour and embarrassingly emphasized her emergent bust was doing valiant work with biddy macleod in the sitting room biddy whod been down since half past seven pointedly refused a second glass of sherry therell be wine at dinner violet admired biddys shoes black glacé kid with high heels to show off biddys tiny feet i thought i disairved a treat at that moment hamish walked in expecting praise he was wearing a frilly shirt a blackvelvet coat with silver buttons a sporran a heavy closely pleated kilt neat buckled shoes and a silver dirk in his socks oh hamish you look glorious said biddy thou mindst me of departed joys departed never to return she applied a handkerchief to her burnt currant eyes you look the image of your father i didnt mean to upset you mother no it makes me happy to see you carrying on the tradition you look lovely in your scarlet too i didnt want to spoil the feast said biddy what feast said hamish looking at his watch its nearly nine oclock are we ever going to eat he demanded marching into the kitchen just as daisy was carrying a swimmingpool of turkey fat to the sink her hair was dank with sweat her cheeks carmine only the dead white rings under her eyes showed how tired she was well be about quarter of an hour but everyones starving look at dirk bogarde said perdita who was lounging against the aga you should have put man tan on your knees hamishs lips tightened you ought to be helping your mother so ought you i thought modern husbands were supposed to share the cooking few husbands work the hours i do ouch screeched hamish as ethel goosed him liberally youll never guess what ethels done granny said perdita dreamily as they sat down to dinner shes chewed up st joseph but that cribs been in the family for generations spluttered biddy is this true marys a single parent now said perdita very topical although i suppose god the fathers floating about overseeing things so shes not quite alone i wonder how god impregnated her aid or just miracles perdita snarled hamish handing a large plate of breast to biddy i wouldnt mind god as a father went on perdita just think of the things he could do magic me up a trailer flatten the top paddock into a stickandball field exterminate certain people she smiled sweetly at granny macleod be quiet thundered hamish putting down the carving knife with a clatter i am going to beat that dog oh no daddy violet turned pale she chewed it up yesterday shell have no idea what shes being beaten for it is christmas not a word of praise passed biddy macleods lips throughout christmas dinner although a great deal of food did now they were pulling crackers and hamish was checking the angle of his blue paper admirals hat in the big mirror over the fireplace he had hardly eaten a thing perdita pulled a cracker with eddie and disappeared under the table to get the rolledup hat and the motto she emerged a minute later elderberry dark eyes glittering looking dangerously elated oh help thought daisy ive seen that look before violet noticed it too and exchanged uneasy glances with eddie who was on his fourth satsuma hamish poured glasses of brandy for himself and biddy and a very small one for daisy we dont want a repeat of last night to absent friends said hamish raising his glass indeed said biddy to my dear dear lochlan perdita refilled her glass with red wine to ricky francelynch she said and drained it biddys mouth vanished and never came back i hope he gets ten years for merdering that poor wee bairn he did not murder him said perdita ominously perdita murmured daisy why she wondered was she frightened of everything and perdita of nothing not bullfinches out hunting nor biddy macleod drunk driving to my mind is murder went on biddy noone has any right to drive when theyre off their head with drink hed been celebrating snapped perdita hed just won one of the biggest tournaments in the world all polo players are the same to my mind replied biddy spoilt jet set indulging airvery gratification rubbish said perdita furiously i bet if grandpa macleod had run off with some tart taking hamish with him when he was two and youd been to some hogmanay pissup youd have jumped into your austin seven and tried to get him back and not given a stuff about drunk driving mouthing furiously biddy was too outraged to speak go to your room thundered hamish then turning to daisy will you control your child she doesnt have to said perdita picking up her cigarettes im going im not having anyone slagging off ricky thats all you shouldnt judge people you dont know pushing back her chair she picked up the new black shoe which biddy had kicked off because it was murdering her corns from under the table and threw it among the cracker remnants the toe had been completely chewed off by ethel biddy burst into tears and ethel was shut howling in the utility room daisy went out to the stable where she found perdita mutinously cuddling fresco darling how could you how could i not the bloody bitch poor ricky she is daddys mother shes your husbands mother do you know what she said to violet in the sitting room isnt it a funny thing none of my grandchildren have fair hair like i did and violet said but perdita does and bloody macleod said smugly i mean my real grandchildren how horrible said daisy totally unnerved by talk veering towards perditas origins shes never liked me and secretly i think shes jealous because youre so much prettier than all her other grandchildren perdita waited until much later in the evening when daisy and the children were watching the magnificent seven mummy says grannys jealous because im so much better looking than you or eddie oh shut up said violet who was redeyed from ethels banishment mummy wouldnt say a thing like that would you mummy well stammered daisy oh god youre a bitch sometimes perdita on boxing day hamish reeking of paco rabanne went off to the office another frost ruled out hunting instead perdita practising her swing on a tea chest on the lawn hit a ball straight through the stainedglass window halfway up the stairs daisy forgot shed put a chicken in the aga for lunch so it emerged as a charred wren and they had cold turkey and salad instead swelling with turkey leftovers and righteous indignation biddy darned hamishs socks if her beloved son was in financial straits it was entirely due to daisys mismanagement and extravagance the sky outside was turning yellow the forecast said snow wouldnt it be lovely said violet if we got snowed up and you couldnt go home granny daisy turned pale like an addict needing a fix she thought shed go mad if she didnt paint while biddy had her sleep after lunch she surreptitiously got out the sketch book violet had given her for christmas and drew ethel and gainsborough on their backs in front of the fire nor could she resist a quick sketch of biddy macleod mouth open and snoring chin doubled two tweed spare tyres legs apart showing three inches of doughy white thigh between lisle stockings and wool knickers christ thats good said perdita creeping up best thing youve done in years you shouldnt have flattered her so much hush daisy giggled and as biddy was stirring hid the drawing in the desk and went off to put the kettle on away from the fire she started shivering she hoped she wasnt getting flu she was just bringing in the tea things when she heard perdita saying do look at this really good drawing mums done of you its not you squeaked daisy nearly dropping the tray its supposed to be an old girl who lives in the village but biddy macleod had put on her spectacles i see she said quietly now i know what you really feel about a defenceless old woman daisy but i shall behave with dignity im going to pack my suitcase oh please gabbled daisy utterly distraught it wasnt meant to be a likeness look at picasso look at francis bacon theres no need to explain yourself daisy at least have a cup of tea i dont want anything slowly biddy went out of the room that was stirring it daisy shouted at perdita i dont care with any luck weve got shot of her when biddy came downstairs with her suitcases she insisted on waiting in the hall for hamish as the wind whistled through the broken stainedglass window she had a long wait hamish desperately late sucking extra strong mints took in the situation at once led his mother into the study and left the door ajar i feel so unwelcome sobbed biddy its not you or violet or little eddie but daisy and that wicked wicked girl hamish persuaded her to stay on now you see what i have to put up with mother daisy heard him saying please dont go i need you hostilities had to be suspended the following night because they had been asked to a party in eldercombe by a bearded psychiatrist called lionel mannering and philippa his rapacious wife daisy dreaded parties in the past hamish had got so insanely jealous if she spoke to other men that shed completely lost the art of chatting anyone up she also had a raging sore throat and was so cold and shivery that she put on a crimson and white striped dress which shed never worn because it was too lowcut and put a crimson mohair polo neck over the top as a suckup gesture because biddy had once knitted it for her unable to wash her hair because biddy and hamish had hogged the hot water she decided to put it up you look great mother said hamish helping biddy out of the icy wind into the front seat of the car sepia clouds raced across a disdainful white moon sitting in the back daisy who was beginning to feel really ill felt sweat cascading down her sides and soaking her fringe it was a large noisy party with all the women in taffetas satins and beautiful silk shirts there were also loads of goodlooking men for daisy to avoid the moment hamish entered the room he was off delighted to be with his peers as he called them telling everyone he was in television dumping biddy on the hostesss mother and chatting up all the rutshire wives who were delighted to have some new talent and even more delighted when hamishs busty wife with the red shiny face in the awful clothes was pointed out to them the lean rapacious hostess whisked everyone round introducing them as if she were doing a grand chain in an eightsome reel daisy talked to a sweet girl who was giggling with nervous relief because shed just got rid of her motherinlaw im going to get seriously drunk i cant mines over there said daisy regretfully theres basil baddingham look at the colour of him he mustve been skiing or playing polo abroad said the girl hell know the latest on ricky then as all the rutshire wives converged shrieking on bas hes so wicked he must have had every woman in the room not me said daisy almost regretfully the girl laughed its only a matter of time daisy was comforted to see peoples eyes glazing over at biddys monologue my sons in television held them for five minutes until they discovered hamish wasnt producing rumpole and then drifted off this is my first christmas as a widow at least held the women for another five daisy was so hot she thought she was going to faint as hamish was the other end of the room she took off her crimson polo neck which wiped off all her makeup and pulled the pins out of her hair so it cascaded around her shoulders and splendid cleavage bas a connoisseur both of horse and female flesh crossed the room hastily daisy slung the crimson polo neck round her shoulders hiding her cleavage with the sleeves shame to cover it up said bas whose height gave him a good view youre living in brock house arent you ive seen you in the village and ive met perdita hunting christ shes pretty rupert and the twins and i are all drawing lots to take her out on her sixteenth birthday thats nice said daisy youll have to wait till next november i like things on slow burn said bas idly i can see where perdita gets her looks do you live near here said daisy hastily he was so attractive but it was difficult concentrating when little black spots seemed to be taking away half of his wickedly smiling face in cotchester ive got a wine bar you must come and dine there one evening er when your husbands away it was definitely a comeon hows ricky francelynch said daisy to change the subject bas shook his head fucking brave i thought hed top himself cooped up like that and hes already had three operations on his elbow daisy winced will he be able to play again bas shrugged wont get much chance to find out if hes convicted the trial starts next month i say are you all right he put a suntanned hand on daisys forehead then ran his fingers lingeringly down her cheek youre absolutely baking you ought to be in bed preferably with me as daisy swayed he pushed her gently down on the sofa philippa he yelled to his hostess have you got a thermometer turning round a couple of minutes later to check whether biddy was all right hamish saw daisy sitting on a sofa with a thermometer in her mouth exposing her entire bosom to a tall dark and very handsome man who was stroking her pulse hamish was across the room in a flash whats going on he said furiously youre a lousy husband accused bas no dont try to talk he chided daisy you havent had it under your tongue for a minute through feverish redveined eyes daisy looked beseechingly up at hamish why are you making a fuss daisy asked hamish coldly its no fuss said bas whipping out the thermometer see for yourself its nearly you must take her home at once insisted philippa poor darling i expect youre exhausted by christmas and just moving in then adding as biddy bustled up what a good thing youve got mummy staying you must keep her tucked up warm mummy and not let her do a thing daisy didnt dare look at biddy see you when youre better darling said bas do come back when youve dropped her and mummy daisy heard philippa say to hamish four days later on new years eve daisy staggered up only slightly comforted that she had lost seven pounds clutching on to the bedroom window she could see perdita stick and balling on the lawn in the fading light she had used two of eddies cricket stumps as goal posts now she was galloping flat out then stopping pirouetting fresco round on her hocks and shooting off in another direction both their pony tails flying on the last gallop fresco didnt manage to stop and flatfooted all over the herbaceous border hamish would do his nut jumping off perdita stuffed the pony with carrots hugging her and covering her face with kisses shes never loved a human like that thought daisy sadly if only hamish ever showed a flicker of interest in her clinging on to the banisters daisy staggered downstairs to an unrecognizable kitchen every surface was stripped and gleaming even the azalea daisys mother had sent her from the alcoholics home looked quite sprightly dryingup cloths boiled briskly on top of the aga grey scum trembling on top humming if onlee biddy was ironing a new emeraldgreen shirt which had somehow found its way into hamishs wardrobe on the memo pad by the telephone biddy had jotted down ajax domestos blue loo shake and vac freshaire x i cant thank you enough for taking over said daisy as she collapsed into a chair someone had to said biddy tersely goodness you iron well biddy had finished the green shirt and had started on hamishs yfronts there was something obscene in the loving way she slid the hot iron with a hiss of steam into the crotch daisy could feel the sweat drenching her forehead im afraid i dont bother to iron pants and socks she mumbled apologetically wheres ethel in her kennel outside where she should be said biddy thatll be hamish her face really lit up as she heard wheels on the gravel hamish looking pale but elated reeked of extra strong mints again you are a miracle he said kissing biddy on the cheek only you could get a polish like that on the frontdoor handle weve sent your black shoes back to the manufacturers and asked them to find an identical pair feeling better he added turning to daisy but not looking at her you look much better how was your day asked biddy were you pleased with the rushes green grow the rushes oh i love the lassies oh said daisy dreamily better than i thought said hamish ignoring daisy the bad news is that melanies got flu so we probably wont be able to start shooting on monday the good news is that wendys asked us to supper oh no thought daisy im simply not up to it but wendys been working all day she protested she wont want to be bothered course she will said hamish briskly ive accepted anyway good for you to get out and mother certainly needs a break there was a minitantrum before they left because gainsborough had shed ginger fur over the new green shirt which biddy had ironed specially biddy also huffed and puffed because her stackheeled brown shoes were less dressy with the red dress than the glacé kid daisy knew she should have washed her hair but she felt too exhausted if wendy had been working all day reflected daisy it had been on the dinner party the flat was gleaming full of freesias more tinselled and redribboned than santas grotto in a department store and the food exquisite and consisting of all hamishs favourite things hamish whod brought lots of bottles kept leaping up and filling glasses and clearing away as he never did at home wendy whom daisy vaguely remembered as a raver in black leather and chain belts was dressed in a grey wool mididress with a white collar her long dark hair so shiny biddy might have been polishing it all day was held back by a black velvet ribbon all evening she targeted on biddy flattering her preposterously laughing at her frightful jokes and displaying an encyclopaedic knowledge of hamishs work burns is going to be a seminal work of course but i think haulage is my favourite she was now saying as biddy greedily scraped up the remains of a second helping of passion fruit mousse hamish is a cut above other producers because hes so caring not just for actors and directors but the crew as well and for you too thought daisy watching hamishs enraptured face hamish had been given to crushes throughout their marriage but daisy had never seen him so besotted nor did wendy make the mistake of ignoring daisy she kept suggesting other food when daisy couldnt manage to eat anything bringing her into the conversation as a coarse fisherman occasionally pulls on a spare rod what a lovely meal said biddy folding her napkin as its hogmanay i should have served you haggis said wendy but i couldnt get one great chieftain of the pudding race she added skittishly to hamish i see you know your burns said biddy approvingly the hag is astride this night for a ride muttered daisy i really like that young person yelled biddy when wendy refusing any help went next door to make coffee what a poppet yelled wendy as biddy went off to the loo daisy only started getting jumpy when wendy having asked biddy if shed like some background music put on if onlee i really love this tune wendy said dancing a few steps her eyes shining she couldnt have been prettier if onlee sighed daisy i was at home in bed but i suppose well have to see in the new year hamish however was most solicitous about getting her home early and sending her straight to bed next morning biddy left hardly saying goodbye to daisy or perdita but kissing violet and eddie very fondly i feel so much happier about things now daisy heard her saying to hamish daisy felt jumpy but for the next few days screaming matches over thankyou letters and getting three trunks packed left her little time to think neither violet nor eddie wanted to go back to school and loathed being parted from ethel and the airgun respectively but perdita was worst of all clinging round frescos neck sobbing and sobbing i cant leave her mum please let me go to the local comprehensive i promise ill work and pass my o levels once they were back it was reversedcharge calls three times a day to see if fresco and ethel and the airgun were ok driving hamish demented the sunday after term began the sky turned the colour of marzipan and it started to snow by teatime it was drifting appleford was completely cut off and hamish couldnt get home for ten days it was very cold but daisy lived on tins ethel tourneyed with the drifts and fat gainsborough tiptoed along the white fences using his ginger tail as a rudder daisy also painted maniacally and joyfully brought up in london she was unused to snow like this the thaw brought a telephone call from hamish saying snow had held up filming but hed be back at the weekend more sinister the postman got through again staggering under a pile of brown envelopes daisy left them for hamish as usual then a letter arrived to both of them complaining that none of last terms school fees had been paid and requesting settlement for the spring and winter terms at once pickfords were also agitating to be paid for the move even more alarming all the cheques daisy had written for fresco and ethel and hamishs silk shirts came winging back daisy rang up the bank manager im afraid theres nothing to honour the cheques mrs macleod and now youve sold the london house no security ill talk to my husband this evening whimpered daisy in panic detesting herself daisy went to hamishs desk and went through his bank statement in the red how on earth had the pennypinching hamish managed that with frantically trembling hands hating herself even more daisy went through hamishs american express forms and nearly fainted the restaurant and hotel bills were astronomical and he must have spent more at interflora in a year than shed spent on perditas pony she supposed leading ladies had to be kept sweet and suppressed the ignoble thought that hamish had paid for all those freesias banked in wendys flat there was also a bill from janet reger for december of which daisy had never seen the fruits her heart cracking her ribs she looked at the minicab bills hamish terrified of losing his licence never drove if hed been drinking daisy went cold the december account was for nearly every journey was to or from wendys flat hamish was always saying he had a bed in the office maybe he regarded wendys flat as his office she mustnt overreact but if shed known how desperately they were in debt shed never have spent so much money at christmas she jumped guiltily as the telephone rang it was an old friend fiona whod always bossed daisy about at school can i come and spend the weekend of course daisy quailed at how irritated hamish would be did you have a good christmas course not you dont if your lovers married wendy seemed to manage thought daisy fiona have you heard anything about hamish well ones heard hes keen on some pa but lets face it hamish has always liked ladies and no doubt in the end hell get as bored sexually with her as he did with you sit tight dont rock the boat ill see what i can suss out before the weekend daisy sat down and cried and ethel whod been disembowelling one of biddys stuffed coathangers leant against her and licked her face daisy wasnt raging with jealousy hamish had stood by her as the papers called it for fifteen years she couldnt expect him to always lie on top of her as well then hamish rang to tell her he didnt want any supper and not to wait up next morning daisy sat hunched over a cup of coffee trying not to think about wendy listening to hamishs bath running out gainsborough was chattering at the window crossly watching robins tits and sparrows feeding on the bird table then a predatory magpie swooped down and they all scattered one for sorrow said daisy crossing herself with a shiver good morning mr magpie how are your wife and children and your mistress she added as an afterthought turning to the front page of the daily mail she saw that ricky francelynch had been sent down for manslaughter orgulloso gets two years said the headline bastard thought daisy looking at the sensual yet implacable face of the judge sir anthony wedgwood qc defending read daisy said that his client had had extreme provocation a wife he worshipped was taken off him by his patron and he has been punished a million times by the death of a son he adored and terrible injuries which have almost certainly put an end to his polo career if that hasnt thought daisy furiously two years in jug certainly will the judge sounded just like biddy macleod the defendant he had told the jury is a member of the jet set the jeunesse dorée who raised a thousand pounds a match playing for his patron he may just have been left by his wife but he was used to living in the fast lane and already had convictions of speeding and drunken driving i feel went on the judge there should be some redress for his young wife who has sustained the terrible loss of a child nor do i believe there should be one law for the rich there were pictures of ricky looking stonyfaced and much much thinner arriving at court and on the inside pages of a bewitchingly glamorous chessie and the adorable little boy and also of rickys friends basil baddingham rupert campbellblack david waterlane and the twins all looking bootfaced after the verdict daisys eyes filled with tears poor ricky he was far far worse off than she was outside the sky was leaden grey and a bitter north wind ruffled the hair of the wood but at least the hazel catkins hung sulphuryellow like a tiffany lamp ricky cant see any of that thought daisy incarcerated in rutminster prison ricky francelynch got two years she told hamish as she handed him a cup of herbal tea hamish glanced at the paper hes already done six months remand if he behaves himself hell be up before the parole board in a few months hell probably only do a year in the end you are clever to know things like that wifes bloody goodlooking i dont blame bart alderton said hamish helping himself to muesli daisy was so busy reading all the details of the trial and that rupert and bas were going to appeal and wondering whether to send ricky a food parcel that it was a few minutes before she noticed two suitcases in the hall oh god hamish must be off to recce some new film and shed been so preoccupied with penury and painting she didnt know what it was he was bound to have told her and hed be livid because she hadnt listened she must be a better wife putting his muesli bowl in the sink hamish removed some bottles of whisky and gin given him by hopeful theatrical agents for christmas from the larder and asked daisy if shed got a carrier bag heres one from libertys rather suitable if youre wanting your freedom daisy giggled nervously going anywhere exciting very said hamish calmly im leaving you im moving in with wendy for once the colour really drained from daisys rosy cheeks for gggood she whispered for my good said hamish im afraid ive come to the end of the road like harry lauder thought daisy wildly hamish should be wearing his kilt i cant cope with your hopeless inefficiency any more he went on the house is a tip you never diary anything or pick up my cleaning the children particularly perdita are quite out of control their rooms are like cesspits i owe it to my career i can never invite backers or programme controllers or anyone that matters to the house you cant even cope with mother for a few days it isnt as though you even worked to justify leaving her hamish was deliberately pouring petrol on resentment that must have been smouldering for years im sorry mumbled daisy i will try and be more efficient i keep thinking about painting one wouldnt mind said hamish with chilling dismissiveness if you were any good i married you fifteen years ago because i felt sorry for you i feel i deserve some happiness hes enjoying this thought daisy numbly she could see biddy macleod crouched on top of the fridge like an old buddha applauding him picking up her coffee cup she found the washingup machine already full and clean and started unloading it until i met wendy i didnt know what happiness was said hamish sententiously she makes me feel so alive alive alive ohho mumbled daisy cockups and muscles alive alive oh im going mad she thought i cant take this in wendys so interested in everything i do easy to be interested when youre in love thought daisy sadly trying to take ten mugs out of the machine one finger through each handle her hands were shaking so much she dropped one on the stone floor see what i mean youre so hopeless said hamish smugly sweeping up the pieces daisy cut herself and wound a dryingup cloth round her hand and frankly glancing in the kitchen mirror hamish extracted a piece of muesli from his teeth i cant put up with perdita any more i have forked out for that little tramp till im bankrupt perdita said daisy losing her temper would have been ok if youd ever been nice to her mother thinks shes seriously disturbed there must be some bad blood somewhere that was definitely below the belt daisy started throwing forks into the silver drawer that is family silver said hamish not my family any more screamed daisy and picking up the drawer she emptied it into the libertys carrier bag beside the whisky and the gin take the bloody stuff away so youre leaving me because im lousy at housework and dont help your career and you cant stand perdita and wendy makes you feel so alive why cant you tell the truth and just say you enjoy screwing wendy i knew youd resort to cheap abuse nothing cheap about those bills minicabs must have found their way blindfold to wendys and you must have kept interflora in business it ought to be renamed interwendy you certainly were youve been snooping sighed hamish i was trying to conduct this with dignity i had hoped to avoid animosity for eddies and violets sake daisys eyes darted in terror youre not going to take them away only if you really cant cope said hamish loftily well have them at weekends and for a good chunk of the holidays you can certainly have custody of perdita and that appalling dog shes not appalling said daisy throwing ethel a bonio from the red box on top of the fridge what about the house weve only just moved in and until we pay pickfords i dont think theyll move us again youll have to rent somewhere cheaper watching ethel slotting the bonio between her paws and eating it like an icecream daisy wished violet could see her what about the children wendy and i told eddie and violet last night we drove over to see them how did they take it whispered daisy the blood was beginning to seep through the dryingup cloth very calmly as i expected once they realized theyd still see a great deal of me they stopped worrying he peered into the machine and picked out the potato peeler wendys doesnt work so ill take this one he dropped it into the carrier bag and how many times have i told you not to put bonehandled knives in oh what does it matter fluttering on the bottom window pane daisy suddenly saw a peacock butterfly which had survived the winter trying not to bruise it with her shaking hands she let it out of the window it was hamishs calmness that paralysed her he might have been explaining to his leading lady that he was dropping her midfilm wendy would be so much better in the part but i dont know anything about money she said in terror you better learn its time you grew up and were dreadfully overdrawn whose fault is that said hamish gathering up his suitcases in the hall you didnt exactly pull in your horns over christmas i cant afford you daisy you can contact me through my lawyers daisy started to shake why didnt you tell me you wanted a divorce before we went through all this hassle of moving i doubt if youd have listened you were so anxious to get here so perdita could have her pony and you could paint you couldnt think about anything else and he was gone the dryingup cloth round her hand was soaked with blood now looking out of the window she gave a scream as gainsborough pounced on the peacock butterfly and gobbled it up it was no more good at coping with the outside world than she was fifteen years of marriage to hamish had made daisy feel a total failure as a wife but they had equipped her even less for a divorce hamish had never let her pay a bill renew a car licence or an insurance policy or look at a tax document the first crushing blow on visiting her solicitors was to discover that the hollywood coproducers had decided to ground hamishs movie project and his entire investment had gone up in smoke a visit to the bank manager confirmed that there was not only no money but massive debts hamish was ok the coproducer of the movie feeling guilty about hamishs losses offered him work in la for at least a year and had also taken on wendy as a pa this took hamish outside the jurisdiction of the courts so it would cost daisy a fortune in lawyers fees to get a penny out of him cruellest of all now that hamish had dumped daisy biddy macleod was quite prepared to subsidize him for a start she was going to pay violets and eddies school fees and give them a fat allowance but she refused to fork out anything for perdita which meant perdita would have to leave her current boarding school who were kindly allowing her to stay on until the end of term in late march as the creditors moved in daisys jewellery the silver and pictures and the better pieces of furniture all had to be sold the owner of brock house who lived abroad said daisy could stay until april but he must have his rent investigating the possibility of a council house daisy was told she was at the bottom of the list locals tended to ignore her not knowing what to say a few london friends rang for grisly details and gave her more grisly details of the women usually themselves that hamish had tried to get into bed then they shrugged their shoulders daisy was always losing things why not her husband as well do ring us if you need us they said but daisy didnt ring however miserable she was inside she projected an image of cheerfulness like her namesake already dotting the lawn outside however much you mowed her down she would pop up the next day just before halfterm frescos owner tim jeddings came to repossess her because she hadnt been paid for either daisy couldnt watch as the pony was loaded into the trailer merryeyed muddy a little fat from no exercise she had brought so much happiness daisys plan had been to tell perdita on the drive home when no eye contact would make it easier then perdita got a lift home with a schoolfriend and instead of running into the house headed straight for the stable extracting a granny smith from her school skirt and joyfully screaming for fresco it was a glorious day the sun was lighting up the crimson buds on the beech trees snowdrops spread like the milky way across the lawn fresco fresco perditas cries rang round the valley bouncing off stone walls and trees by now greedy and loving fresco should have been belting up the field a minute later perdita had burst into the kitchen her breath coming in great gasps shuddering and shaking from head to foot fresco must have jumped out of her field we must get her a friend ring the police at once darling im afraid shes gone what dyou mean gone tim jeddings took her back the cheque bounced we havent got enough money to pay for her for a second perdita stared at her her face changing from alabaster to putty i dont believe you there must be money from selling this house its only rented you could have taken me away from school id have got the money from somewhere what about your jewels daisy held out her ringless hands theyve all gone then perdita screamed and screamed shes gone to a wonderful home up north babbled daisy i didnt want to tell you while you were at school but i never said goodbye screamed perdita i dont believe tims sold her yet rushing into the hall she found the telephone book she was shaking so badly she misdialled three times mr jeddings mummys lying you havent sold fresco on yet there was a long pause perdita slumped against the wall you rotten bastard she screeched and crashed down the receiver hearing the din ethel came rushing in with a muddy nose and a dugup dahlia root in her mouth and threw herself delightedly on perdita go away yelled perdita shoving ethel violently away why havent you sold her as well because shes darling violets dog i suppose why the fuck cant you go out to work and earn some money like everyone elses mother instead of producing crappy awful paintings noone wants for half an hour she was so hysterical that daisy was about to ring the doctor then she went silent and wouldnt talk to daisy or the other children when they came home nor would she eat after shed taken all three children back to school on tuesday night daisy went into perditas room every cutting of ricky francelynch every photograph of fresco was ripped into tiny pieces all over the floor oh god what have i done moaned daisy bursting into tears she was interrupted half an hour later by the door bell imagining it was some creditor she was just sidling downstairs intending to bolt the door when it opened and basil baddingham walked in he looked so opulent with his patent leather hair and his even suntan and his wide wolfish smile showing his perfect teeth that he seemed to have come from another planet please go away said daisy clapping her hands over her blubbered swollen face its not a good time always a good time for a drink said bas brandishing a bottle of dom perignon he set off purposefully towards the kitchen where lunch still lay on the table and gainsborough was thoughtfully licking up perditas untouched shepherds pie im really not up to it mumbled daisy get some glasses said bas removing the gold paper from the bottle i am your knight in shining armour i had one of those said daisy but he walked out because i didnt keep it shining enough i know youve had a rotten time but youre well shot of him id have been round sooner but ive been in palm beach have you found somewhere to live theres a flat on the bledisloe estate wont do far too rough said bas you and perditad be sitting ducks for all the yobbos at the pop of the champagne cork gainsborough shot out of the room sending the remains of the shepherds pie crashing to the floor lets go and sit somewhere slightly more comfortable said bas filling up their glasses there was still a sofa in the drawing room but it was bitterly cold bailiffs do this asked bas then as daisy nodded you poor old thing under his gentle questioning daisy told him about the selling of fresco and hamishs departure i know it seems like the end of the world said bas but youre an extremely pretty lady and scores of men are going to come running after you once youve got your confidence back including me daisy giggled feeling slightly happier ive got a much better idea bas went on you cant move into the bledisloe estate one of rickys tenants finally kicked the bucket during the big freeze he lived in a lovely little house snow cottage on the edge of rickys land been there for thirty years only paid ten pounds a week ricky was too soft to put up the rent now he wants me to sell the house to some rich weekenders its a bit tumbledown but there are three bedrooms and an orchard and the same stream that runs through ruperts land so youll have condoms flowing past your door the only problem is youll also have philippa and lionel mannering i met you at their party gazing down at you from their awful house but come the summer they wont be able to see through the trees anyway shell be far too interested in ricky when he comes out of prison to waste much time on you wont ricky mind us living there asked daisy hardly daring to hope hes not minding anything much at the moment poor bastard except will dying and chessie buggering off im sure hell let you stay for a year while you sort yourself out i see no reason to alter the rent but i thought he was desperately short of cash oughtnt you to sell it for him certainly not said bas filling up her glass its insane to sell anything at the moment since the prince of wales moved into the area propertys going to quadruple in rutshire over the next few years ill take you to see it tomorrow its a heavenly cottage said daisy brightly as she drove a stonyfaced perdita home at the beginning of the school holidays i know were all going to be terribly happy there you said the same thing about brock house snapped perdita she looked pinched and miserable her hair had lost all its sheen her eyes their jetty sparkle how many bedrooms are there three so someone will have to share perhaps you and violet we will not well theres a room off the sitting room we can use said daisy placatingly wistfully bidding goodbye to a possible studio and its surrounded by fields so perhaps one day well be able to afford a pony again perdita shot her mother a black stare of hatred shut up about that she hissed the holidays were a nightmare daisy was so broke that they were living virtually on bread and jam and perditas hatred corroded everything although she had grumbled in the past about her boarding schools she bitterly resented being sent to a comprehensive and was absolutely mortified that biddy was forking out for violet and eddie daisy felt awful and wished she could raise two fingers to biddy and send all the children to the local comprehensive but to make ends meet she was due to start a job as a filing clerk at a nearby christmas pudding factory at the beginning of may and she thought eddie and violet were too young to come home to an empty house every evening besides the womens magazines all advised one to leave children at their schools at the time of divorce school is often the only continuity the day before violet went back she and perdita had a terrible row perdita had just endured a week at her new school where her strange set face and uppity manners had done nothing to endear her to her classmates one boy had called her turdita and when she screamed at him the others had taken up the refrain getting home perdita took it out on violet whod just had a letter from hamish announcing that wendy was pregnant disgusting letch screamed perdita wendys a whore and now shes got a bun in the microwave hamishll favour the new brat and lose interest in you rubbish said violet furiously at least we know who our father was what dyou mean snarled perdita nothing said violet realizing shed gone too far my father was killed in a car crash of course he was mumbled violet i must go and finish packing half an hour after her mother had gone to bed that night perdita began searching it had grown much colder the wind had risen and creepers rattling long fingers against the windows kept making her jump her heart was beating so hard she felt it must wake her mother the blood was pounding in her ears her whole body was throbbing as she crept downstairs into the study at least we know who our father is what had violet meant what poison had she been fed by hamish bugger the overhead bulb had gone and theyd been too poor to replace it perdita crept round the room groping like a blind man tripping over a small stool at last finding the side light by the desk which was too eaten by woodworm for the bailiffs to take only yesterday shed come in and found her mother crying over a letter which daisy had quickly stuffed into one of the drawers everything was in a frightful mess but perdita could only find bills and business correspondence her hands moved around pressing drawers and shelves frantic to find the pulse point that opened the secret drawer at last her fingers rubbed against a little switch on the inside right of the top shelf and the centre of the desk swung round in a small drawer at the back was a bundle of papers tied up with a green ribbon icy with sweat perdita collapsed on to the wooden wing chair to read them on top was a photograph of daisy in her teens even allowing for changes in fashion she was unbelievably pretty with her dark hair longer than her mini skirt there were also some photographs of herself as a baby and then a snapshot of a man surrounded by a group of students on the back daisy had written jackie being admired her father had been called jackie was that him perdita examined the mans face again it was handsome slightly weak her hands were trembling so much she nearly tore the cutting from the guardian it was a review of jackie cosgraves exhibition the reviewer thought well of his work bold brave and starkly original the review contained another photograph of jackie he was handsome was that her name perdita cosgrave next she found a marriage certificate between daisy james and hamish macleod on december at ayrshire register office that was only fifteen years and four months ago theyd certainly lied about the length of their marriage a picture of daisy and hamish on their wedding day showed hamish with a beard in an awful kilt looking surprisingly happy and proud daisy looked awful very peaky and thin in a ghastly pale coat and skirt her hair tucked into an unbecoming hat and here was a birth certificate perdita james born november her heart seemed to be pounding in her throat now mother daisy james father unknown perdita gave a croak of misery at the bottom of the pile was a yellowing torn tearstained letter dated december which was from hamish darling little daisy so he was capable of tenderness tomorrow we will be married please dont worry my family will come round when they realize how adorable you are and how happy youre going to make me dont torture yourself over perditas parentage the letter was shaking so much now she could hardly read it doesnt matter shes the bonniest wee bairn in the world ill be her father and love her far more than whoever he is would ever have done i will take care of you always hamish the next minute the outside drawer which had been on her knee crashed to the ground scattering papers everywhere there was a muffled bark from daisys bedroom overhead jumping up with the letter in her hand perdita thought she was going to black out dont torture yourself over perditas parentage had her mother lied to hamish about jackie cosgrave had she been a prostitute or a nympho whod bedded so many men she didnt know who the father was the next moment perdita jumped out of her shuddering skin as a reluctant ethel shoved by a terrified daisy burst into the room weve got nothing for you to burgle began daisy brandishing eddies airgun darling what are you doing what were you doing hissed perdita sixteen years ago you told me jackie had been killed in a car crash he was stammered daisy looking far more scared than by any burglar dont lie to me or were you lying to hamish to get him to marry you poor sod who was my father her voice rose to a shriek daisy had gone deathly pale her teeth were chattering shall we have a drink no for once were going to talk i tried to tell you sobbed daisy hamish thought it better not when you were younger and then it was too late youd better tell me now perditas black brows were pulled right down over her furious hating eyes were you on the game or raped by a gang of louts no no daisy shook her head she was wearing a peach woollen nightdress shed got for p in a jumble sale her hair was dragged back with an elastic band her eyes popping out huge like a rabbit with myxomatosis ethel gazing at them both soulfully started to scratch i was just seventeen when i went to art college mumbled daisy jackie was my art master i fell madly in love with him he was so frightfully attractive all the class irrespective of sex had crushes on him but for some reason he chose me he was a very good painter i saw the cutting he was also divorced heavily into drugs and the king of the swingers he didnt love me but he was flattered by my heroworship one evening he took me to a party in chelsea id never seen such people only about a dozen of them but so beautiful sophisticated and jet set they were all rock stars actors and polo players i was desperately shy id hardly touched drink before and never never drugs but i took both to please jackie to show i was up to it and got absolutely stoned her voice faltered so low now perdita could hardly hear it over the moan of the wind im sorry to shock you but i was very young about a year and a half older than me said perdita spitefully the ppparty degenerated into what people talk about as a typical sixties orgy stammered daisy at least it was the only one i ever went to everyone was er making love to everyone dont you mean fucking sneered perdita yes whispered daisy i know its awful but i was so stoned i dont remember anything about it inconvenient said perdita lighting one cigarette from another the wind was screaming down the chimney thorns from the climbing rose outside were scraping the windowpane like fingernails i woke up next morning with a terrible hangover lying on the hosts hearth rug utterly appalled by what i remembered doing then horror turned to panic when i discovered i was pregnant i went to jackie he refused to accept any responsibility cant say i blame him said perdita tonelessly any of the guys at the party could have been my father im sorry daisy hung her head what happened then i was devastated i loved jackie so much i hoped hed come round i put off telling granny and granddaddy james because i was so frightened same old story blazed perdita youre too worried to let down jackie at the orgy too wet to tell me about fresco or my father too wet to tell your parents till its too fucking late daisys voice broke granny and granddaddy were sweet at first they just couldnt cope with me not knowing who your father was they said i must have you somewhere else so i went to this unmarried mothers home in scotland huge tears were pouring down daisys face now you were so beautiful i wanted to keep you so badly then one bitterly cold day there was this big pond frozen over beside the unmarried mothers home i looked out as i was feeding you all the children were skating with their parents one little girl was just sliding along shrieking with joy while her father held her hands i felt it was so selfish to deprive you of two parents and i must let you be adopted there was this wonderful couple who wanted you they were so longing to have a child i knew i was going to lose you thats why i called you perdita the lost one said perdita tonelessly hamishs firm was overseeing the adoption he sought me out at the unmarried mothers home and offered to marry me he was different in those days he had ideals he was so kind and so goodlooking i was sure i could grow to love him anyway id have married the devil i was so desperate to keep you no wonder biddy looked so sour at the wedding said perdita savagely did you tell her i was a little orgy bastard no wonder she loathes me what chance did i ever have hamish took me on because he had the temporary hots for you once he got bored he got fed up with me its all my fault and im sorry sobbed daisy i love you more than anything in the world please forgive me getting up stumbling over a pile of art magazines she fell towards perdita holding out her arms frantic to comfort and be comforted but perdita whod always detested physical contact shoved her away dont touch me you disgusting slag all those men in one night i bet you loved it and whats more violet knows she doesnt said daisy aghast i swear it bloody does biddy or probably hamish tipped her off oh my god whispered daisy oh darling im so sorry why the fuck didnt you let that wonderful couple adopt me hissed perdita theyd have given me a much better life than you or hamish have for such a solitary and reserved introvert as ricky francelynch prison was slightly less crucifying than it might have been because it made him feel in some infinitesimal way that he was atoning for the terrific wrongs he had done chessie not only had he killed her child but he was convinced shed never intended to stay with bart and could now only be miserable living with such a monster even while recovering from horrific operations on his right elbow in the prison hospital he wrote her endless letters with his left hand begging in a rare dropping of his guard for her forgiveness and her return chessie answered none the one glimmer of cheer was that herbert his father felt so sorry for ricky that he changed his will yet again leaving everything to ricky instead of the local hunt who were absolutely furious which at least meant the bank came sweet and ricky could turn his ponies out instead of selling them after the relative freedom of being on remand where he could wear his own clothes have visitors and go for walks outside his worst time inside was the month after his conviction when for twentytwo hours a day with lights out at six he was banged up in a tiny cell in rutminster prison with a burglar a murderer and a gbh case he was next moved to greenwood an open prison on the rutshirewiltshire border the drive with the sun warming the bare trees and snowy fields sparkling against a delphiniumblue sky was tantalizingly beautiful near the prison was a large elizabethan manor house with ramparts of yew overlooking a great frozen lake which belonged to some cousins herbert had fought with what would they think wondered ricky if he climbed over the wall and dropped in on them for tea the prison governor was a raging snob weve got six millionaires four old etonians three radleans two solicitors an archdeacon and a rock star the lead singer of apocalypse in at the moment he told ricky so youre pretty small fry the rock star gets so much fan mail he ought to be sewing his own mail bags sorry about your arm bad business well find you something not too taxing to do the library or the art department or a bit of gardening im a racing man myself but evidently the scrubs has got a table completely set aside for polo players never knew there were so many bad hats in the game queueing up for lunch ricky felt sick he dreaded having to adjust to a new set of people hed grown fond of his three previous cellmates whod been very tolerant when impossibly run down he had kept them awake with his incessant coughing or his screaming nightmares nor had he ever been intimidated at rutminster just behind him in the queue on his first day however was a fat little man with strands of dyed black hair oiled across his bald patch and a puffy complexion like marshmallow flanked by four huge minions he was making a lot of noise irritated that ricky was ignoring him he poked him in the ribs howdy a get that he pointed at rickys elbow is that sling olding up a limp wrist or did we urt it raising our glass once too often to our mouth drunk driving wasnt it i ear we plays polo wiv prince charles ricky said nothing and deciding against dishclothgrey mutton and flooded yellow cabbage helped himself to mashed potato off our nosh are we went on the fat little man drawing so close that ricky could smell breath like too sweet cider ay suppose were used to creamed potatoes at buck house wont be playin polo for a bit will we will we his voice rose threateningly for a second ricky considered ramming the plate of mashed potato in his face instead he said why dont you piss off piss orf mimicked his tormentor turning to his four huge minions who shook with sycophantic laughter oh we are an ooray enry arent we did we pick up that posh accent from prince charles we better learn some manners and mindful of his beefy entourage he punched ricky in the kidneys not for nothing did ricky have the fastest reflexes in polo he was also instinctively lefthanded next minute a left hook had sunk into the fat mans marshmallow jaw and sent him flying across the canteen crashing to the ground strolling across the room ricky hauled him to his feet and smashed him against the wall dont ever speak to me like that again he said softly or ill really hurt you and dropped him back on the floor there was a stunned silence not a screw nor a minder moved more of an ooray enry cooper drawled a camp cockney voice everyone cracked up and bellowed with approval as the fat little man struggled to his feet and shuffled out threatening vengeance dancer maitland the owner of the camp cockney voice held out a long pale hand to ricky welcome to greenwood ricky knew nothing of the music business but the tousled mane of streaked shoulderlength hair darkening at the roots and scraped back into a pony tail and the heavily kohled hypnotically decadent frostgrey eyes hidden behind dark glasses told him at once that this must be the rock star of whom the governor had boasted thin to the point of emaciation in jeans and a black jersey dancer had a long mournful clowns face a pointed chin and a big pale mouth like a lifebelt intensely theatrical giving off a suggestion of tragicomic heights he moved with feet turned out and pelvis thrust forward with the fluid grace of a ballet dancer gathering up rickys plate of cooling mashed potato he bore it off to a far table and sitting down patted the seat beside him unwilling to be charmed ricky sat opposite ooray enry ip ip ooray the ole prison will put up a plaque to you for flooring that fat queen who is he you didnt know marmaduke kempton thats not his real name bent property developer terrorized the east end in ere hes a tobacco baron known as the duke carrying on his reign of terror most powerful guy in the nick or he was till you floored him now eat up your spuds went on dancer reprovingly although your strength doesnt seem to need keeping up the foods atrocious in ere but ive got a pet screw who smuggles fings in for me gazing at the nightblack glasses ricky said nothing weve got judge bondagesmith in common drawled dancer ricky looked blank he sent me down too month before you made the same crack about living in the fast lane who are apocalypse indeed dancer peered over his glasses imitating the judge fucking ell youd have thought everyone ad eard of us i hadnt confessed ricky straightening a prong of his fork dancer grinned his mouth with its exquisitely capped teeth seemed to light up his sad clowns face like a semicircle of moon youre better looking than bondagesmith so ill forgive you were in the same dormitory by the way very enid blyton i didnt bag you a bed by the window the draughtd have given you earache then seeing the wary expression on rickys face i know youre dyin to know what i was brought in for but it aint that sex offenders and longterm murderers are all tucked away in another dorm stockbrokers and accountants in the next encouraged by the slight lift at the corner of rickys mouth dancer went on i was busted smuggling cocaine and heroin into england shame really id gone cold turkey six months before gone through all the screaming heebyjeebies of coming off i was just bringing in the stuff for a friend whats it like in here ricky removed a long dark hair from his potato and put down his fork triffic contacts said dancer my shares have rocketed an the screwsll do anything for a bit of dosh you wont have any assle with the inmates now youve taken out the duke the padres a bugger literally loves converting straight blokes so keep your ass superglued to the wall when hes around you dont seem to eat much either said ricky looking at dancers congealing mutton im so anorexic i have midnight fasts said dancer have you er had lots of hits in the top twenty five number ones the last one for twelve weeks and fourteen weeks in the states sighed dancer shaking his head who are apocalypse indeed my solicitors comin in ere for a stretch next week no wonder i didnt get off dancer saved rickys sanity he made him laugh and later he made him talk about polo and slowly about chessie but never about will in return dancer was incredibly frank about his own sexuality and the problems of a deprived childhood followed by fame and colossal riches too early i was an east end kid suddenly we had a break i was going everywhere staying at the best hotels meeting the best people birds throwing themselves at me smart parties i got so i had to be high to go on stage then i was getting so high on coke i started taking heroin to calm me down and ended up addicted to that as well youve gotta talk rick bottle it up and it comes out in uvver directions the night my auntie died my uncle went straight up the pub two months later he went off his ead and died of an eart attack thanks said ricky anyone claimed evelyn waugh who has been to an english public school feels comparatively at home in prison for ricky it was better hed been bullied at school here he was very popular the inmates liked him because he didnt show off or drop names or grumble and because beneath his aloof impassive manner his grief was almost palpable once he started giving racing tips that worked even the duke forgave him and started asking him what prince charles was really like and if hed ever clapped eyes on princess diana there were terrible moments he was plagued by feelings of utter worthlessness he slept appallingly still wracked by insomnia followed by nightmares he was consumed with desire for chessie he was crucified by the knowledge that wills last terrifying memory must have been chessie and he screaming at each other and being gathered into a car and hurtled to his death he was also worried stiff about his arm he still couldnt move his fingers or pick up anything heavy but there were small victories captaining the prisoners bowls team to a win against the screws watching the wallflowers and forgetmenots hed planted come out in the bed by the visitors checkin gate all his free time was spent with dancer mostly they talked about polo insatiable for knowledge dancer would demand again and again to hear how mattie had died and how wayne matties halfbrother had let himself out of his box and flooded the yard and how kinta thundering unstoppable down the field at deauville enabled ricky to score the winning goal night after night with four white chess pieces for one team and four black for the other ricky taught dancer the rudiments of the game one late april evening when they could hear the robins singing outside reminding ricky unbearably of home they got out the board and the eight blackandwhite pieces show me some sneaky moves said dancer well if black hits the ball upfield began ricky and the opposing white back and the black number one are in pursuit of the ball riding each other off ricky moved the blackandwhite bishops forward so they clashed into each other if black number one judges himself beaten he should move to the left and draw white off the line black number two watching the play charges up the line dancer are you listening to me i was finking how nice itd be if you said apocalypse instead of black you thinking of taking up polo ive got a lot of money i want to get rid of if you teach me to make money said ricky ill teach you to play polo apocalypse is a great name for a polo team said dancer that night ricky told dancer about chessies parting jibe she says shell only come back to me if i go to ten and win the gold cup and england win back the westchester piece a cake said dancer airily you said the teams with the longest purses win i was goin to retire but ill write anuvver song itll go to number one because everyones missed me while ive been inside then ill take up polo and wiv me as your patron well take everyone out good as his word dancer abandoned his autobiography which hed been scribbling in a red notebook and wrote a song called gaol bird about a robin trapped in a cage the tune was haunting in the right mood dancer would sing it suddenly in bed at night few prisoners threw shoes at him the words spoke for all of them in april they were all distracted by the falklands war a man in the dormitory had a son in the paras ricky was worried about drew benedict who had resigned his commission and was due out of the army in august but who was now steaming out with the task force drew had the kind of crazy courage and lack of nerves to get himself killed ricky dropped a line to sukey who was no doubt now diligently schooling drews new argentine ponies and watching every bulletin in early may ricky got a letter from his solicitor requesting a visit the night before he was lounging on his bed watching the trees thickening with young leaves against a pale pink sunset dancer peering in the mirror was grumbling about his roots i wish youd first seen me on stage wiv my hair all wild and my makeup on rick how can anyone operate wiv no eyeliner cant even get your eyelashes dyed in this dump when you were at boarding school did you try anyfink with blokes once or twice you enjoy it not much said ricky who was now concentrating on polo magazine better than nothing i suppose staved off the loneliness might be better than nuffink here dancer put a hand on rickys shoulder want to try it sometime there was a long pause the prison building was turning a pale rose madder in the sun which was sinking like a blazing ruby into the far blue horizon chessie was wearing rubies the night will died not really said ricky im still married dont mind my asking dancers drawl had a slight tremor not at all i just want chessie back but youve been fucking good to me dancer i wouldnt have survived the last months without you the sunset was no longer responsible for the red glow which suffused dancers long sad face now that is enid blyton he said sardonically ians coming to see me tomorrow thats why im uptight then when ricky raised his eyebrows ians the bloke i smuggled the coke in for there was no sun the next day thick mustardyellow fog hung round the prison the visitors room with its potted plants and its bright mural of a farmyard and no smoking beyond this point sign was a bit like an airport lounge children played underfoot wives and girlfriends with dyed hair short skirts no stockings and very high heels held hands with inmates but said little the screws delivered coffee and tea at p a cup martin rickys solicitor in his dark grey suit clinging to his oxblood briefcase for extremely dear life looked out of place no sugar for me he said dropping saccharin in his cup i envy you your waistline he added heartily privately thinking how thin and drawn ricky looked hoping he hadnt caught something nasty in prison across the room ricky was aware of dancer coiled into a relaxed theatrical pose hand exaggeratedly cupping his pointed chin to hide the tension as he chatted to a thickset blond young man with a sulky face this must be ian he was quite unlike the birds of paradise with their rainbow hair and tight leather trousers who usually visited dancer the news is not exactly good martin was saying as he opened his briefcase im afraid chessies filed for divorce in fact ive got the papers and a letter for you here ricky went very still but felt his heart was leading some crazed life of its own trying to fight its way out of his ribs the letter was written from barts new york flat the palm beach season would be over chessies small almost illegible writing only covered a quarter of the page dear ricky please sign these papers and give me a divorce i think you owe it to me i need to forget and everything about you reminds me of will im sorry yours chessie yours chessie thought ricky dully what a ridiculous way to end a letter when shes not mine any more borrowing martins gold cartier pen he signed the papers im afraid the other bad news which frances told me to tell you is that millicents dead she was run over it seemed a kinder way than to tell ricky the little whippet had simply stopped eating christ thought ricky another death dancer was always saying they went in threes matilda then will now millicent it was very quick no ones fault ricky put his head in his hands hed missed millicent more than the ponies the way shed curled her silken body almost inside him snaking her head into his hand shivering with nerves and adoration she was the thing hed most looked forward to coming out to after that the fog seemed to invade his brain so he took in nothing particularly that bas in some ludicrous robin hood gesture had let snow cottage to someone called daisy macleod ridiculous when your plan was to redecorate and sell it as soon as the existing tenant died said martin thinking of his huge unpaid bill whats up said dancer afterwards nothing how did it go i wouldnt give him any more dosh so he got nasty and said hed got someone else a plague on both your arses i said fanks to you ricky i dont feel nuffink for him any more what did your bloke say you look as though your ouse burnt down ricky shrugged he brought divorce papers i signed them he couldnt tell even dancer about millicent he was terrified of breaking down divorce is nuffink said dancer furiously just a piece of paper how can you fight when youre stuck in here but i promise you ricky when we get out of ere well buy the best ponies in the world and outmount everyone in late august the hon basil baddingham dropped in on his old friend rupert campbellblack curious to see how rupert was coping with one of his first surgeries as the new mp for chalford and bisley even before entering the constituency office bas was assaulted by wafts of scent being an expert on such matters he identified femme fracas joy and diorella before they all merged into one totally eclipsing the tobaccosweet smell of the large buddleia outside the door although the dozens of peacock and tortoiseshell butterflies cruising over the long amethyst flowers reflected bas were not unlike the gaudy constituents who thronged the waiting room patting their hair and powdering their noses bas had expected the people haunting mps surgeries to be largely pensioners seeking smaller electricity bills and quicker hip replacements this lot looked as though they needed a husband replacement and as rupert had just divorced his wife helen they must have high hopes some were very pretty perhaps i ought to go into politics thought bas im afraid if you havent an appointment theres no way mr campbellblack can see you said the thoroughly flustered agent its like the first day of the sales here i only dropped in socially said bas just tell him im here finding himself a corner on the dark green leather seat bas picked up a july horse and hound which had a large photograph of himself kevin coley of doggie dins and the disgusting napier brothers jubilantly hoisting the gold cup above their heads basil baddingham playing well above his handicap said the copy found the flags twice in the crucial fifth chukka bas smirked and glancing up saw several of the occupants of the waiting room eyeing him with great interest he smiled back at the prettiest one who dropped her eyes then looked again when she thought he wasnt looking just back from deauville bas was very brown women got awfully restless in august he thought it was an awareness of summer running out and lovers being away with their wives and seemingly unending school holidays the pretty one who was wearing a pink cotton jersey cardigan and jeans had just been summoned to see rupert she had a glorious bottom bas was an hon because his official father had been ennobled for his work as a munitions manufacturer during the war after twentythree years of utter fidelity to lord pop pop as he was known bass mother had had a mad fling with an argentine polo player the result was bas who had inherited both his fathers amorous and equestrian skills a very early marriage had ended in divorce and no children having no intention of getting caught again at thirtyfour bas dabbled in property ran a very successful wine bar hunted all winter played polo and was known after rupert campbellblack as the worst rake in the west of england having spent many happy autumns buying ponies and playing polo in the argentine bass loyalties had been torn apart by the falklands war he had loathed seeing his second fatherland so humiliated but bas was a commercial animal and he was even more irritated that he was banned from buying argentine ponies any more he had also recently bought a large tract of land round rutshire polo club on which he intended to build upmarket polo yards with glamorous houses attached and flog them at a vast profit to poloholics like victor kaputnik and bart alderton unfortunately rutshire polo club was not the draw it should have been the bar was useless the argentine players who had added such glamour had been forced to turn back in midflight and with drew benedict away in the falklands and ricky in prison the attendance had dwindled drastically the scented ladies were getting restless the girl in the pink cardigan had been in with rupert for ages when she came out bass expert eye noticed the flushed face and the buttons done up on the wrong holes mr baddingham said the agent i was next thundered a big woman in dungarees im afraid mr campbellblack cant see anyone else today said the agent desperately trying to stem the storm of protest he had to return to london for a crucial meeting with the pm grinning bas slid into ruperts office bloody good winning the gold cup said rupert bloody marvellous winning the world championships said bas the ideal moment to retire not sure i should have done said rupert looking ruefully at the pile of papers showjumpings much easier than this facts at your fingertips indeed my fingertips are more used to pleasuring other things ruperts suntan from the world championships didnt altogether hide the dark circles under his eyes too much sex recent divorce or withdrawal symptoms at announcing his retirement wondered bas ive only got ten minutes said rupert im going back to london on a friday night she must be special who is she beattie johnson rupert was unable to resist boasting bas whistled is that wise sensational in bed said rupert and utterly unscrupulous in print said bas disapprovingly its all right shes abandoned the scorpion for six months to ghost my memoirs a house ghost said bas look rickys coming out of prison next month rupert raised his eyes to heaven christ having jacked in showjumping i know exactly how he must feel not being able to play polo we ought to join hooked on horses anonymous wasnt so bad in prison said bas he had a routine and people all round him he liked the people well he was brought up on a large estate said rupert he should know how to get on with the working classes hows he going to cope when he gets out asked bas that bloody great house no chessie no will look i want to show you an amazing girl ive got one rupert looked at his watch in london its on your way said bas down at rutshire polo club the huge trees in their mididresses were turning yellow a scattering of mothers lined ground two this is the pony club said rupert outraged im off one chukka said bas soothingly watch number three in the black shirt on the dark brown mare with the white blaze only the narrowness of the waist the curl of the thigh and the slight fullness in the tshirt indicated that the player was a girl next moment perdita had tapped the ball out of a jumble of sticks and stamping ponies legs ridden off the opposing number three dummied past the white number four and scored two minutes later she scored again with an incredible back shot from twenty yards not only does she get to the ball in time to examine it for bugs said bas but she plays with five times more aggression than any of the boys not bad said rupert grudgingly in fact shes almost as good as i was when i started but the competitions pathetic she wouldnt stand up even in low goal would if she were properly taught shes fantasticlooking close up just think what a draw shed be here in a few years time a really stunning good girl player just because you want to push up the price of the land round the club you can buy in too said bas thundering down the field perdita caught one of the opposition on the hop get off my fucking line you creaming little poofter she screamed and whipping the ball past him flicked it between the posts fine command of the english language said rupert and thats an exceptionally nice mare its rickys said bas since hes been in prison his ponies have been turned out and perditas been borrowing them all summer without asking that happens to be kinta best playing pony at deauville last year rupert took another look at perdita as she lined up for the throwin didnt she come out with the east cotchester last year thats the one father walked out lost all their money girl like that ought to be sponsored shes bankable and bonkable has the ministry for sport got any spare cash none said rupert getting into his car polos too elitist everythings going to the olympic fund well at least lets give her to ricky he cant play for ages because of his elbow he cant drive or go abroad for a year if hes not going to drink himself insensible weve got to find him an interest to avoid the press ricky was let out of prison by a side door two hours early his tweed jacket hung off him the faded brown cords were held up by an old school tie the cuffs of his check shirt slipped over his knuckles like mittens once through the door he took a great shuddering breath a thrush was singing in the sycamores the sun had just risen in a tidal wave of rose and turquoise but dense inky blue storm clouds gathered menacingly in the west ricky was expecting joel his farm manager with the landrover instead spotlit against this thunderous backdrop lounging around a vast open bentley like characters out of scott fitzgerald were rupert bas drew and a tousled but undeniably desirable blonde who was wearing ruperts dinner jacket over her roseprinted silk dress bas being halflatin and the most demonstrative came straight up put his long muscular arms round ricky and kissed him on both cheeks welcome back dear boy he murmured in his husky caressing almost exaggeratedly english accent drew very brown from the troopship but more reserved relieved ricky of his suitcase rupert his blue eyes bloodshot and slightly off centre lipstick all over his evening shirt put an arm round rickys shoulder leading him to the car you made it you poor sod christ im glad youre out then drawing forward the tousled blonde this is beattie johnson ricky stiffened his eyes wary and hostile beattie johnson had written some vicious lies about him and chessie during the trial its ok said rupert quickly shes off duty although rupert had kissed off all her makeup and reddened her face with his stubble she was even sexier close up curling her arms round rickys neck she kissed him on the edge of his mouth you poor old thing the nightmares over i have to tell you youre much more glamorous in the flesh beatties flesh in its clinging softness reminded ricky agonizingly of chessie beneath the sharp tang of her scent he caught the unmistakable fishlike reek of sex and nearly blacked out leave him alone beattie snapped bas you sit in the front ricky isnt this a truly terrific motor car we decided it wasnt worth going to bed said rupert as he headed towards the motorway we thought wed all have breakfast at sheepfield chase bas got them to lay on a private room so you wont get gorped at and the uncondemned man is going to eat a hearty breakfast said beattie putting her hands on rickys shoulders ricky tried not to freeze away having taken a large swig out of a bottle of krug bas handed it forward to him ricky shook his head go on chided beattie youre about three bottles behind the rest of us no thanks said ricky looking down he saw beatties rather dirty toenailed foot edging down the gear lever to rub against ruperts black thigh putting down a hand rupert caressed her instep bugger off now he said to her or ill be done for drunk driving and for christs sake get that black tie off bas ricky wished he could go straight home he needed to touch base but it had been so kind of them to turn up he must make an effort he turned to drew glad you got back safely bloody nuisance missing a whole season said drew it must have been wonderful all those cheering crowds welcoming you back gushed beattie wed no idea of the strength of feeling back home said drew it was a complete surprise we were overwhelmed how did you feel when the truce was finally signed in port stanley went on beattie did you have a fantastic pissup no said drew we were simply glad to be alive hes changed thought ricky the golden boys grown up and been jolted out of his habitual sangfroid drews being recommended for an mc said bas sukey must be thrilled said ricky theyve all done so well he thought wistfully world champions gold cups mcs the conversation inevitably got on to polo and what a bore it was not being able to buy ponies from argentina any more im getting some from australia said bas and the prince of wales then realizing beattie was listening he started gabbling away in spanish to drew speak english said beattie furiously hearing the words charles and diana its bloody rude when she could get no change out of either drew or bas she turned back to ricky did they give you a hard time inside because you were a gent no how was dancer maitland great did he make a pass at you oh shut up beattie said bas well he is a screaming pouf id have made a pass at ricky if id been in prison dancers fffine said ricky wanting to strangle beattie hes a lovely man everyone adored him out of the corner of his eye he could see beattie writing lovely man on her wrist with eye pencil the inky black cloud had spread over the whole sky they only just managed to reach the hotel and get the roof up when the heavens opened i guess mp stands for moderately pissed said rupert as ravishing waitresses handpicked by bas brought more bottles of krug into the private room ricky put his hand over his glass go on said bas you must celebrate today honestly ive given it up thats ridiculous said rupert you used to drink for rutshire i dont want a drink said ricky through gritted teeth then lowering his voice im sorry i just feel i owe it to will ah said rupert also dropping his voice i understand sorry but dont punish yourself too hard christ look at the tits on that waitress attack came next from rickys left you mustnt be sad said beattie pouring him a cup of coffee spare men are at such a premium these days youll be snapped up in a trice ive got some stunning girlfriends you must make up a four with rupert and me her hot brown eyes ran over him telling him what fun they could have together shes not sure of rupert and is trying to make him jealous thought ricky god knows hed be impossible to hold is it true asked beattie that chessie said shed only come back to you if you went to ten and won the westchester for fucks sake shut up snarled rupert then turning back to bas no it was definitely halfbrother to nijinsky breakfast arrived eggs bacon sausages kidneys cold ham and a mountain of kedgeree ill help you said beattie piling up rickys plate you definitely need feeding up then they all watched in horror as ricky tried to cut up a piece of ham his right arm simply wasnt up to it ill do it for you said drew taking rickys knife and fork the prettiest waitress was already sitting on bass knee feeding him fried bread spread with marmalade theyre all booked for the morning murmured rupert who had his hand halfway up beatties skirt id go for that redhead over there ive found an amazing girl for you to teach polo to bas called across the table smile please said beattie who had suddenly produced a camera ricky got to his feet fried egg churning in his stomach he only just reached the lavatory in time then it was mostly bile he threw up drew was waiting as he came out the blue eyes matteroffact but not insensitive im sorry we thought you needed cheering up we went about it the wrong way ill run you home on the motorway the windscreen wipers fought a losing battle with the downpour and drew talked idly about the falklands once we reached the actual island i had the somewhat unenviable task because i speak spanish of debriefing the argie pows one of their pilots shot down in the sea was actually a polo player arrogant sod although i must say british methods of obtaining information are somewhat reprehensible so are beattie johnsons said ricky christ shes awful awful agreed drew ever since rupert packed in showjumping hes been drinking and screwing his brains out i had a look at your ponies by the way they look very well a season offs probably done them good i dont know if im going to be able to rickys voice trailed off course you will youve got to get to ten frances the head groom and joel rickys farm manager were furious to be caught on the hop not expecting ricky for hours and by then absolutely plastered they hadnt swept the yard there was hay and straw everywhere floating in huge puddles louisa was just furious that shed failed to keep up the crash diet shed started every morning for the last month in anticipation of rickys return but ricky didnt seem to notice anything having patted the labradors he said he wanted to be on his own for a bit and hed see them later inside the house the emptiness hit him like a boxing glove no silken whippet coiled herself round him jumping for joy his one craving was to look at wills photographs again the one in his wallet had cracked and almost disintegrated but on the piano in the drawing room he found only empty silver frames shaking he opened the photograph album and found every picture of will had been removed and where there had been photographs of ricky and chessie together chessie had cut out herself as he looked round the room he noticed pieces of furniture missing pictures taken from the walls huge gaps in the bookshelves churning inside feeling bile rising in his mouth again he raced upstairs someone had tactfully removed the child gate from across the top stair but the rockinghorse with most of its paint chipped away by wills polo stick still stood on the landing wills bedroom had obviously been tidied up opening a drawer he found the policemans helmet will had been wearing when he squirted grace with bloody mary there were all the dinky cars will so adored snoopy lay spreadeagled on the bed with his vast inflated belly oh god groaned ricky finding wills piggy bank empty on the window sill chessied even broken into that stumbling into his dressing room he found the photographs of his ponies still up but the pictures of chessie and will once again removed next door in the bedroom he nearly fell over millicents basket lined with his old dressing gown but found all chessies clothes and her jewellery gone and there mocking him was the huge fourposter with its blue chintz curtains covered in pink peonies and roses he remembered how shed accused him in that terrible last row of being such a failure in bed hopelessly overexcited by her he supposed he had often come too quickly the glowstars chessie had stuck on the ceiling had long since lost their luminosity howling like a dog ricky threw himself down burying his face in the pillow for some faint trace of the diorissimo she always wore but there was nothing later in the day ricky pulled himself together and had a bath outside the rain had stopped and everything dripped and sparkled in the hopelessly overgrown garden tortoiseshell butterflies rose indignantly as he picked michaelmas daisies honeysuckle and roses to put on wills grave in the little churchyard at eldercombe where generations of francelynches had been buried william richard francelynch said the newest headstone the vicar toddling past to choir practice was about to stop and speak to ricky but seeing his face moved quickly away towards sunset missing dancers prattle and overcome by restlessness ricky told frances to saddle up donaghue his old hunter now was as good a time as any to see if hed lost his nerve once mounted the ground seemed miles away the saddle impossibly slippery so he tried to concentrate on his surroundings joel had got very slack the fences were in a terrible state bypassing the orchard and a field of stubble he set out to look at his ponies which were turned out in the watermeadows at the bottom of the valley after the rain the ground steamed like a grand national winner the sinking yellow sun was turning the steam amber gold flocks of gulls were returning to the bristol channel after a days looting in the newly ploughed fields with only one arm working ricky had difficulty opening the gate leading to the valley but donaghue stood like a statue checking the sheep grid alongside the gate ricky was pleased to see that at least the wooden ramp which enabled field mice or hedgehogs to clamber out was still in position the view down the valley as always took his breath away on each steep side dense ashwoods plunged to fringes of reddening bracken then into a green ride which was divided by a stream which hurtled down through caverns of wild rose hawthorn and the elders the valley was named after then raced on to meet the frogsmore stream where it flowed under snow cottage at least this is all still mine thought ricky kicking donaghue into a canter thank god there wasnt anyone around to see him clinging to the horses mane relief on reaching the more level watermeadows turned to joy and a great lump rose in his throat as he saw kinta whod kept carting him last summer and wayne matties hideous custardyellow admirer and the yard escapologist standing together idly chewing and scratching each others necks their tails and their punk growingout manes were full of burrs then ricky froze for on a stretch of grass eaten flat by sheep some strange female was riding pilgrim his finest mare from argentina she was cantering bareback with just a headcollar and with a polo stick was tapping a ball in and out of a row of stones presumably pinched from one of his walls for a second he was transfixed with pleasure by how well she rode then as he drew nearer and the ponies stopped grazing and looked up he realized she was only a schoolgirl with her skirt tucked into dark blue wool knickers and her platinumblond pony tail tied back with her school tie for a further few seconds he watched her execute a perfect figure of eight changing legs in and out of a couple of stones then he flipped what the fuck do you think youre doing the roar was loud enough to send the ponies scuttling away almost to start an avalanche of ash trees turning the girl gave a gasp of horror then swinging pilgrim round set off at a gallop up the valley ricky gave chase all thought of his damaged arm forgotten donaghue was bigger and had a longer stride than pilgrim but the girl was lighter and god she made the pony shift oblivious of stones and rabbit holes jumping over fallen logs she reached the top of the hill and thundered towards the sheep grid come back howled ricky dont be a bloody idiot perdita ignored him digging her heels into pilgrims heaving sides she put her straight at the sheep grid for a second the pony hesitated then the iron bars flew beneath her and she had landed safely on the other side by the time ricky had gone through the side gate he found pilgrim running around the barley stubble and the girl vanished into the beech woods like a gypsys lurcher pilgrim was gratifyingly delighted to see her master digging him in the ribs and searching his pockets for polos whickering with joy until donaghue was squealing and snapping with jealousy by some miracle pilgrim seemed all right but as ricky ran his hands down her delicate dark brown legs he shuddered at the thought of them snapped by those murderous iron bars grimly he rode back to the stables to tell joel what had happened sounds like perdita macleod said joel who the hells she daisy macleods daughter theyve rented snow cottage they what i know nothing about it you do said joel you signed the lease the day martin came to see you i guess you had a lot on your mind well theyre not living there much longer snapped ricky id no idea she was riding the ponies said joel i havent been down that end of the valley for a few days well you should have been half the fences and walls are down shes a stuckup bitch that perdita joel hastily changed the subject they cant stand her at the village shop then because he wanted an excuse to go and see daisy added ill pop down and have a word with her mother im going to talk to her mother said ricky grimly ill drive you said joel no ill walk down through the woods daisy macleod had had a gruelling day she absolutely loathed her new job her boss mr bradley the christmas pudding manufacturer was a revolting thickvoiced potbellied letch who was constantly chiding her because her typing and filing particularly in her current state of postdivorce shock were not up to scratch almost worse he insisted she wore high heels and dresses to the office adding that as a caring chauvinist he was only making her dress as femininely as possible for her own good so that she might one day attract a new husband he made daisys flesh creep but she put up with it because she desperately needed the money and the factory on the far side of eldercombe village was in walking distance so she could rush home and take ethel out during her lunch hour now eddie and violet had gone back for the autumn term daisy had hoped perdita would be less disruptive she had got straight us in her o levels but any remonstrance from daisy triggered off a storm of abuse then on the first friday of term she was suspended for a week for punching a girl in the playground at least i wasnt being laid by the art master she screamed at daisy when she got home i dont take after you that much daisy knew that when perdita was frightened she became more abusive but it didnt make things easier now a fortnight later perdita should have been back at school but to the intense irritation of the caring chauvinist the switchboard at the christmas pudding factory had been besieged by calls all day from mothers complaining that perdita had terrorized their children from the village shop grumbling that perdita had walked out twice without paying and asking daisy to settle a horrifying drinkandcigarette bill and worst of all from perditas form mistress saying perdita hadnt been near the school since tuesday and was supposed to be retaking her o levels which didnt bode well walking wearily home along the cart track which ran alongside rickys woods and at rightangles to the eldercombe valley daisy kicked off her shoes although sharp pebbles cut her bare feet anything was better than those punishing high heels even the undeniable prettiness of snow cottage didnt cheer her up because she was so aware of crumbling mossy walls that should be pointed and harts tongue ferns growing out of the roof and the hayfield of a lawn and a door bell that didnt work and red apples littering the orchard floor reproachfully waiting to be turned into pies there was no sign of perdita but at least daisy got a wonderful welcome from ethel who whimpered and moved from foot to foot with joy then bounded straight into the stream splashing about then shaking herself all over daisy daisys love for ethel had deepened almost into idolatry over the last months despite her frightful naughtiness and her great destructive paws ethel never seemed to mind how much daisy sobbed into her shaggy shoulder and this morning to cheer daisy up she had even chewed up hamishs copy of robert burns turning on the washingup machine and looking out into the red twilight daisy decided that too many evenings since she moved in had been spent drinking too much vodka when the budget ran to it and trying to change television channels on the cordless telephone nor had she painted since she moved in her inspiration seeming to have dried up tonight she would do something practical perdita was always grumbling she had nowhere to put her clothes a cupboard on the landing was full of the childrens old toys if daisy put them in plastic bags they could be stored in the attic and perdita would have a new cupboard daisy had a bet with herself a large vodka and orange if she could empty the cupboard in half an hour but then the memories came flooding back of a time when hamish and she had seemed happy as she found corn dollies never made up kites never built jigsaws of windsor castle never even opened she was so busy trying on mickey mouse masks and plugging in clacking false teeth and turning soapy liquid into a stream of bubbles she didnt notice ethel beating a retreat downstairs with a large stuffed panda and there was one of eddies alltime best presents the plastic bloodstained knife which hooked round the back but looked as though it was going through the head putting it on catching sight of herself in the landing mirror daisy burst into tears wiping her eyes and rushing downstairs to answer the telephone she found perditas headmistress on the line her first fears were that perdita had been expelled instead the headmistress gave her a peptalk we dont feel mrs macleod that perdita is getting quite the right home backup its very hard being a latchkey child and the victim of a broken home we do realize you have to earn your living but i gather that perdita never sees her father they really dont get on said daisy apologetically are you sure youre not letting your animosity towards your exhusband poison your judgement perditas not a stupid child just very disturbed perhaps if you could spend more time talking to her instead of slumped in front of the telly with a bottle of vodka thought daisy in despair at the prospect of finding perdita another school she noticed the washingup machine had stopped it was so ancient the door kept opening seeing gainsborough sitting on the kitchen table with his back paw in the air like a leg of mutton daisy grabbed her sketching pad keeping the door of the washingup machine shut with her bottom she started drawing frantically next moment ethel gave a bark of delight and daisy steeled herself for another frightful row with perdita instead through the kitchen door hardly knocking came the most ravishinglooking man gosh she thought my luck has changed then as he turned towards her she noticed the long livid scar running down the side of his face and realized to her horror that he must be ricky francelynch her landlord oh dear said daisy i thought you were perdita its her ive come to talk about said ricky bleakly join the queue said daisy helplessly as the washingup machine changing direction gave a great dragons roar whats she done now stammering ricky told her about riding pilgrim and jumping the sheep trap she could have killed herself and worth of pony i didnt know shed been riding them said daisy appalled im terribly sorry shes also been taking them to the pony club all summer oh my god gasped daisy shes not here at the moment but i promise it wont happen again ill tttake her to court if she doesnt stop i dont blame you said daisy look do sit down as she moved forward the washingup machine stopped you have to lean against it she explained then her eyes falling on the breakfast and last nights supper washingup in the sink im afraid its an awful tip look do have a drink ive got some vodka and i know perditas got the remains of a bottle of malibu she certainly owes it you ricky shook his head just for a second he looked slightly less grim dyou always go around with knives through your head i expect perdita wishes i did crimson with embarrassment daisy tore the knife off i was sorting out the childrens toy cupboard oh hell poor panda she pointed helplessly at blackandwhite fur and blue foam rubber littering the hall weve got so little space she went on and you know how hopeless children are at allowing anything to be thrown away yes said ricky oh heavens said daisy mortified as she remembered about will im so sorry its all right mind if i look round quailing daisy nodded the only thing shed done to the house was to put roseprinted paper up in violets room and the damp had come straight through we love it so much here her voice trailed off as she thought of the dreadful mess hed find in the childrens bedrooms mindlessly she drew in some whiskers on gainsboroughs face and thickened his tail it was no good shed have to have a drink as she was tugging the ice tray out of the hopelessly frozen ice box ricky came downstairs looking grimmer than ever this place is an absolute disgrace it is agreed daisy humbly anarchy somehow broke out after my husband walked out no the state of it said ricky theres damp in every room that sinks coming away from the wall you need bookshelves and cupboards fitted in all the rooms ive got builders starting in the yard tomorrow ill send a couple down here to sort things out they can probably mend the washingup machine oh thank you daisy had great difficulty not bursting into tears again are you sure you dont want a drink ricky shook his head i dont not since will oh how stupid of me said daisy appalled how could i be so crass and how awful too she thought for ricky to be reminded of wills death by that scar every time he looked in the mirror she was amazed when he sat down at the kitchen table and started stroking ethels lovely speckled head whys perdita so screwed up and he listened without interrupting while she told him about the failed o levels and having to sell fresco the first thing perdita had really loved and about hamish never loving her and spoiling the other two he wasnt perditas father daisy blurted out who was asked ricky some other man said daisy going scarlet but because aunts and grandmothers and teachers and family friends all prefer violet and eddie i sort of overcompensate to make it up to her you give in because its easier than facing one of her tantrums getting up she put two pieces of melting ice into her glass of vodka then going to a yellow tin on the shelf took out a tea bag and put it on top of the ice then unseeingly gazing out into the darkening garden she switched on the kettle taking the glass from her ricky removed the tea bag switched off the kettle and looking in the fridge and not finding any tonic added orange juice to the vodka before handing it back heres someone in an even worse state than i am he thought to his amazement he found himself saying bas has already spoken to me about perdita he thinks shes got fantastic potential if she promises not to bunk out of school any more and tries to get her o levels ill give her a weekend job working in the yard if she takes that seriously and passes her o levels ill teach her to play polo for a second daisys face quivered then she blew her nose noisily on a piece of kitchen roll are you sure it wont be a bore ricky shook his head the probation officers keeping tabs on me i cant drive or leave the country for a year give me something to do that is the nicest thing thats ever happened said daisy slowly like a golden retriever searching for a sock to give a returning master she looked frantically round the room then ripping the drawing of gainsborough from her sketching pad she thrust it into his hand perdita came in ten minutes after ricky had left she looked pale truculent and dangerous something wonderfuls happened said daisy youve found a lover spat perdita so what else is new daisy winced ricky francelynch came round so for a second perdita looked terrified then resumed her normal expression furious dark eyes in a white cold stony face youre to go and see him at eleven on saturday whatever for hes going to offer you a parttime job and if you work hard and get your o levels hell take you on full time after the way he swore at me this afternoon im not sure i want it said perdita coldly daisy resisted a desire to shake her instead she asked what she wanted for supper im not hungry snapped perdita stepping over the toys daisy had turned out she flounced into her bedroom and slammed the door waltzing deliriously round the room she pulled out the only photograph of ricky she hadnt ripped up and whispering at last at last started covering it with kisses at a quarter to eleven next morning perdita sauntered downstairs reeking of the remnants of daisys last bottle of je reviens her deliberately dishevelled newly washed hair fell halfway down her back her normally alabaster skin was smothered in bronze base to hide two spots which had sprung up overnight on her nose and chin out of nerves an excess of royalblue eyeliner and mascara ringed her angry eyes she wore no bra her breasts as rounded as scoops of icecream were emphasized by the tightest royalblue tshirt no pants line marred the impossibly stretched navyblue jodhpurs flicking her whip against gleaming brown boots she posed in front of daisy dressed to kill she said sarcastically certain to kill any passion in ricky thought daisy perdita was much too beautiful to smother herself in that muck and the twelve pounds missing from the housekeeping must have paid for that tshirt if i look like a whore said perdita reading her mothers thoughts im only taking after you ive no idea when ill be back if ever outside it was still hot the sun had dried the dew but the fields were still strewn with cobwebs forgetmenots and jadegreen watercress choked the stream at the top of the ride rickys house skulked like a grey battleship in its ocean of turning beech trees this should be fun said frances to louisa as perdita strolled into the yard cigarette still hanging from her lips is she applying for a job as a hooker the ponies peering out over their bottlegreen halfdoors however made no secret of their delight at seeing perdita who had been stuffing them with carrots nicked from philippa mannerings garden all summer itll be interesting to see how fit youve got them said frances nastily and id put that out she added pointing to a no smoking sign over the tack room door chucking her lighted cigarette in a dark green tub of white geraniums ignoring francess look of disapproval perdita went up to each pony hugging them and pulling their ears even kinta known to bite everyone rested her face against perditas leaving a blob of green slime on her right nipple just as ricky came out of the tack room yesterday his face had been animated with rage today it had resumed its normal impassivity close up perdita noticed the puttygrey pallor the black hair flecked with grey the livid scar running from right eyebrow to jawbone his mouth had vanished in a grim line neither the thick curly eyelashes nor the black rings underneath them tempered the bleak animosity of the slanting dark eyes above the hard slav cheekbones perdita felt a strange mixture of passion and compassion ill make him better she thought hes going to be my lover and the father i never had im going to be the love of his life and the child he lost ricky looked at perdita even the crude makeup and the obscenely tight clothes could not really detract from her beauty yet in her wanton blatant sexuality she was terrifyingly close to both beattie johnson and chessie a waft of je reviens reached him sickly sweet amid the stable smells of horse sweat leather straw and droppings he was overcome with revulsion tack up sinatra he said to louisa louisa and frances exchanged awed but gleeful glances sinatra was the most difficult ride in the yard he had to be gagged up to the eyeballs for anyone to control him bred in kentucky his coat had the mushroomfawn silkiness of a weimaraner brilliant on his day he bucked under the saddle and pulled like the intercity to london leave off the running reins and he doesnt need a double bridle or that martingale ordered perdita following frances into sinatras box were the best judge of that snapped frances he throws his head when he stops ive been riding him in a headcollar all summer on your swollen head be it my god is ricky ever going to knock you into shape talking of shapes drawled perdita staring contemptuously at the scrawny hipless bustless frances yours leaves a great deal to be desired ricky made no comment about the lack of martingale but handed her a hat as soon as she was mounted aware it would flatten her hair perdita grumbled that she didnt want to look like mrs thatcher going down a mine put it on said ricky sharply ricky stood in the middle of a sandy oblong corral which was enclosed by postandrail fencing except for a gate at one end and a stretch of wall at the other for a start he made her circle on different legs leading to small circles then into figures of eight each time sinatra changed legs perfectly blimey said louisa keep your weight on the inside leg said ricky now circle the ring at a gallop then turn at the top sharply changing legs knowing this was the most important move in polo perdita cantered round sweetly calmly then leaning right forward she sent sinatra thundering down the side of the ring only just preventing him crashing into the wall going into a lightning turn which nearly brought the pony down before ricky could stop her she careered back to the other end executing a turn so sharp that sinatras fawn nearside should have been full of splinters stop showing off howled ricky just proving hes better in a snaffle he only stopped to avoid ccconcussing himself crap said perdita rudely and swinging round galloped back pulling sinatra up five yards in front of the wall turning so fast that for a second both pony and rider vanished in a cloud of brown dust emerging she thundered up to ricky slithering to a halt three feet away from him running her hand up and down sinatras bristly poll to show him her appreciation well she taunted ricky your weights too far forward it cant be bloody can if you hadnt anticipated those stops youd have been right over his neck after a quarter of an hour on sinatra by which time his silken coat was dark brown with sweat ricky changed her on to kinta the widowmaker who required the brute strength of a juan obrien to halt her wilful stampede this should be even more fun hissed frances to louisa she rides jolly well conceded louisa rickyll never put up with this kind of lip perditas method of stopping kinta was simple she rode her flat out at the brick wall at the end which must have been five foot high sitting still in the saddle she made no attempt to pull her up unable to stop kinta had no option but to hoist herself over the wall just catching it with a cannon bone and pecking on landing i think well walk back you stupid bitch perdita chided the hobbling pony as she opened the gate and returned to the ring what the fuck dyou think youre playing at white with rage ricky bent down to examine kintas leg teaching her a lesson look how shes learnt it swinging kinta round she hurtled her towards the wall stop yelled ricky too late as if she were doing a dressage test kinta swivelled round changing legs perfectly hurtled down to the far corner and turned again blimey cubed said louisa in amazement you keep forgetting to stop in a straight line said ricky determined not to praise her and you never look round to check whos behind you anyone coming down the line would take you clean out nobody here shrugged perdita its got to be instinctive for when there is someone said ricky look look and keep looking into the distance never at your hands at that moment a yellowandcrimson hotair balloon came over the hill letting out a great recharging snort kinta nervy at the best of times jerked up her head hitting perdita smartly on the nose totally unsympathetic ricky ordered her to go on circling the ring doing small turns for perdita frantically wiping away blood as it splattered her and kinta the session deteriorated sharply ten minutes more on kinta were followed by twenty minutes on wayne rickys favourite pony still circling turning then swinging round and putting her left hand on waynes custardyellow right quarter at the trot until her face and neck were streaming with sweat and blood and her mascara and eyeliner were smeared and making her eyes sting wayne flattened his big donkey ears and rolled his bruised dark eyes in martyrdom like an instinctive footballer who doesnt need to train he was appalled to be subjected to such boring manoeuvres the sun grew hotter i will not give in i will not give in said perdita through clenched teeth her tits were agony bouncing around but just as she was about to crack ricky signalled to frances to bring in a bucket of polo balls wayne perked up as ricky smoothed out the pitted sand in the centre with his boot and put down a ball well start off with the nearside forehand so you want him on the nearside leg desperate to show what she could do perdita completely mishit three balls in a row youre not watching the ball wayne getting crafty skedaddled so near the ball that she couldnt hit it without bashing his legs she missed again fucking hell she screamed now shell go to pieces said frances happily come here said ricky dripping with sweat and blood makeup streaking her face like a clown caught in a deluge perdita rode sulkily up to him calm down he said gently youre going too fast and getting uptight and he knows it and keep at him with your left leg or hell move in back she went chattering with rage and panic please god or hell never take me on slowly ricky took her through it dont cut the corner up out of the saddle bend over look at the ball begin your swing keep watching the ball head over the ball crack stick and ball connected in an exquisitely timed shot bingo perdita threw her stick into the air ten feet high and caught it that was perfect you hit it too late and dont throw your stick in the air its dangerous better a stick in the air than a stickinthemud the galloping fox weathervane was motionless in the swooning heat beneath it the stable clock said two fifteen she had been riding for two hours nearly twice the length of a normal match well try one more thing said ricky louisa led out two ponies willis a huge bay invaluable because he had the best brakes in rutshire and hermia a little chestnut mare ricky had bought in argentina in who was very green and terrified of everything ricky mounted willis perdita clambered wearily on to hermia her ribs and shoulders were agony her back ached her thighs were raw where the sweating jodhpurs had rubbed them her hands could hardly hold hermias reins as she followed ricky a hundred yards down a wooded lane past an empty leafstrewn swimmingpool here in two and a half acres of lush green grass framed by midgefilled trees lay rickys stickandball field next years tiny catkins were already forming on the hazels ricky noticed the reddening haws and remembered how little millicent used to shut her eyes to avoid the prickles as she delicately picked the berries off the thorn trees overwhelmed with bitterness at the hand fate had dealt him he saw no reason why he should show others any mercy now do everything i tell you he yelled to perdita as he kicked willis into a gallop the big bays stride was longer than hermias and perdita had to really motor to keep up halfway up the field ricky shouted turn hes crazy raged frances in anguish if he has a fall his arms buggered for good four times ricky raced up and down the field executing sharper and sharper turns now he was hurtling towards two orangeandwhite traffic bollards which served as goal posts up the other end ride me off he bellowed perdita spurred hermia on but she was just too far behind rickys knee and the shoulder of his horse hit hermia so hard that she seemed to fly four feet through the air perdita was still reeling when ricky turned and was riding back ride me off again the fourth time perdita was knocked clean out of the saddle and only stayed mounted by clinging to the mares neck bastard she screamed as she righted herself but by now ricky had reached the opposite end of the field now ride towards me towards me towards me dont duck out keep going the mighty willis was thundering at them like a volvo on the motorway perdita could feel hermia quailing and about to bolt it was all she could do to keep her on course she could see williss red nostrils as big as traffic lights his whiteedged eyes the flashing silver of his bit they must crash they must stop yelled ricky swinging willis to the left obedient to their masters willis and hermia skidded to a halt so close that hermias head brushed williss quarters and perdita was deposited on the grass all the breath knocked out of her aching body you bloody fool she croaked i told you not to sit so far forward get up youre not hurt i know im bloody not but you might have been you risked a headon collision and wrecking your arm for ever just for the sake of putting me down youre crazy just for a second ricky smiled at least youve given me back my nerve go and have a shower and well have lunch doesnt look so sexy now does she said frances spitefully as a dusty bloodstained perdita hobbled into the yard wincing as she led hermia oh i dont know said joel shes jolly brave said louisa kindhearted and admiring she followed perdita into hermias box you ok fine perdita leant against the wall fighting back the tears ill see to hermia said louisa and show you where the shower is after shed found perdita a towel and some soap she handed her a pair of pants and a long white tshirt with bananas and oranges embroidered on the front i thought you might want to change thanks said perdita slowly sorry i was bloody beforehand i was absolutely shitscared neednt have been said louisa joel and i thought you did brilliant the hot waters erratic but theres plenty of cold twenty minutes later perdita joined ricky in the kitchen he was drinking coke eating a slice of ham between two pieces of white sliced bread and reading the times sports page he rose six inches from his chair as she came in at least he recognizes im female thought perdita encouraged louisas tshirt several sizes too big for her fell to a couple of inches above her knees her hair wet from the shower was slicked back the alabaster skin was without a scrap of makeup her nose was swollen her big curved mouth looked as though bees had stung it and her wary dark eyes were still bloodshot from the dust thats better you look like a human said ricky if you ever turn up tarted up like that again you go straight back to your playpen what dyou want to drink vodka and tonic said perdita chancing her arm not if youre going to play polo most top players hardly drink or smoke he added removing her packet of cigarettes and throwing it in the bin there were four in there said perdita outraged anyway the twins smoke theyre not top players yet armed with a glass of perrier and a ham sandwich perdita wandered round the kitchen stopping before a photograph of herbert on a pony whos that my father any good he was a nine said ricky won the interregimental cup seven times in a row and played in the westchester oh sighed perdita why dyou want to learn polo i want to go to ten said perdita simply looking down at the remains of his ham sandwich ricky found he was suddenly not hungry and threw it in the bin i dont think its possible he said with timing and skill a girl could hit the ball as far as a man you could train your ponies even better but its the ridingoff and the violence thats the problem im nearly five foot seven protested perdita thats bigger than lots of the mexicans or argentines the telephone rang one of the grooms must have picked it up because next moment a bootfaced frances had put her head through the window its philippa mannering she snapped at ricky would you like to go to kitchen supper tonight no thanks tomorrow the next day sorry i cant frances shrugged her shoulders and disappeared ghastly old bag that philippa said perdita then when ricky didnt react her house overlooks ours shes always peering through the trees with her binoculars she wouldnt suit you shes a nympho wear you out in a week thank you for the advice said ricky tartly i fancy him so much thought perdita ill never be able to eat again as if reading her mind ricky said get one thing straight im not interested in you sexually if you work here its as a groom are you after my mother hissed perdita hardly shes not in a fit state to have anyone after her at the moment you need a dog round here said perdita fretfully as she also threw her uneaten ham sandwich in the bin its a crime to waste scraps like that she gazed at herberts unsmiling face again youve got to beat your father and go to ten too ricky thought of his damaged elbow which was now hurting like hell and didnt seem to be getting any better yes he said bleakly because he wants chessie back thought perdita but ill get him long before that alone in his large draughty house mourning will desperate for chessie panicking about his arm rickys hatred for bart obsessive primeval poisoning living deep within him grew like a beast and so he took it out on perdita she didnt mind him making her clean all the tack or skip out the horses or scour the fields for lost balls or even put all the bandages and saddle blankets through the ancient washing machine that kept breaking down but sometimes he seemed to invent tasks deliberately scrubbing the inside and outside of buckets and even cleaning the bowl of the outside lavatory worst of all he wouldnt let her near a polo stick perdita raged inside and took it out on daisy at home but at the yard she behaved herself knowing it was her only chance once a week too the sullen protective scrawny frances drove ricky to rutminster to see his probation officer which gave perdita the chance to stick and ball on the sly while louisa kept cave louisa and perdita had become inseparable in the spring perdita retook and passed seven o levels as a reward ricky allowed her to help louisa get the ponies fit for the coming season riding them up and down the steep rutshire hills trotting them along the winding country lanes one april afternoon they were exercising ponies along the chocolatebrown earth track which ran round the huge field of young barley which perdita had escaped into after jumping the sheep grid the year before it was a still muggy day wild garlic swept through the woods like an emeraldgreen tidal wave the sweet scent of primroses and violets hung on the air no ones ever loved anyone as much as i love ricky said perdita restlessly hes thirty and youre sixteen protested louisa i dont care im still going to marry him when he grows up christ look at that perdita took hold of little hermia who was still very nervous and even wayne rolled his blackringed eyes and raised his donkey ears a centimetre as a vast black helicopter chugged up the valley almost grazing the tips of the ash woods it flew round the paddocks over the stick and ball field and circled the battlements of robinsgrove like a malevolent crow coming out of the forage room holding a bucket of stud nuts ricky in a blinding flash of hope thought it might be a returning chessie then he saw the four horsemen of the apocalypse on the side of the helicopter as it dropped into a paddock beyond the corral scattering ponies as the rotors stilled the door flew open and out stepped a lean menacing figure entirely clad in zips and black leather heavily suntanned his eyes were hidden behind dark glasses and his blondstreaked mane far more teased and dishevelled than perditas blimey squeaked louisa its dancer maitland why didnt i stick to that diet dancer was followed by two heavies in tweed suits with bulging muscles and pockets who had great difficulty squeezing out of the door as he reached ricky dancer removed his dark glasses his heavily kohled brilliant grey eyes glittered with excitement from you ave i been absent in the spring he drawled gaol bird was number one on the us charts this morning so i fort it was igh time i took up polo ricky just gazed at him knew youd get a shock when you saw me done up said dancer raking a heavily metalled hand through his blond curls then he put his arms round ricky and hugged him grite to see you beauty its wwwonderful to see you stammered ricky ave you missed me ricky nodded to tell the truth i bloody have this is paulie and this is twinkle said dancer waving airily at the two heavies who were gazing hungrily at perdita thems my minders very amenable if i feed them fresh rottweilers every morning this place is somefink else the ouse and all the trees and that ravine he gazed down the valley we ad a cruise round he went on who owns the big house on the edge of the village eldercombe manor asked ricky some awful old fossil called bentley how much land about two hundred acres including the village cricket pitch perfect said dancer now i want to see all the ponies thats wayne wiv the floppy ears an kinta wiv the badtempered face and liel hermia shes the shy one you see i remember everyfink you told me but when ricky took him into a nearby paddock where a dozen ponies came racing up and at the sight of rickys bucket of stud nuts started flattening their ears barging and kicking out at each other dancer edged nervously closer to ricky can we get a taxi back to the yard they wont hurt you although they might hurt each other said ricky stop it he snapped punching willis on the nose as the big bay lashed out at little pilgrim once he was safely on the other side of the post and rails dancer said that now he was here it was time for his first lesson four or five minutes later he emerged from the house with his hair tied back in a pony tail wearing a black shirt breeches and boots look at the length of those legs sighed louisa im going to convert him im surprised ricky hasnt ordered him to take off his makeup snapped perdita who felt wildly jealous of dancer potential patron explained louisa ricky wouldnt mind if he wore blusher and a miniskirt these boots ave never been on an orse before and neither ave i boasted dancer as ricky took him through a games room crammed with golf clubs ski boots tennis rackets and polo sticks to a room with netting walls and floors sloping down to a flat oblong on which stood a wooden replica of a horse every time the ball was hit it rolled back so it could be hit again before he jiggered his arm ricky would spend half an hour a day in here practising his swing dancer on the wooden horse was a revelation long legs gripping the slatted barrel new boots in the stirrups shifting effortlessly in the saddle he had a marvellous eye and sense of timing he met the ball right every time cowdray an ten goal ere i come he screamed getting more and more excited i can fucking do it we can start getting some ponies right away now lets try a real orse you may not find it quite so easy said ricky gently tack up geoffrey he added to perdita geoffrey was known as the hangover horse because he was the kindest easiest ride in the yard and from the days when ricky used to drink heavily had always seemed to know when his master was somewhat the worse for wear you could trust a dead baby on geoffrey all right gimme a stick said dancer when perdita had lengthened his stirrup leathers try without one to begin with advised ricky dont be daft ive cracked it said dancer riding into the corral even on the gentle geoffrey however he fell off seven times with escalating screams of rage and elation i cant control this fucking machine he yelled at ricky its got no steering no brakes and i cant get my foot off the accelerator give me another one just walk to start with shouted ricky and as geoffrey jerked his black head to avoid being hit in the eye he added stop brandishing that stick like ian botham youve got to take it slowly he grabbed the relieved ponys bridle and removed dancers stick theres no problem teaching you to play polo but youve got to spend the next six months learning to ride the aim is to keep the patron out of traction now get your ass down in the saddle get your heels down and your knees in by the end of an hour dancer had fallen off twice more was bruised as black as midnight and utterly hooked what dyou fink he asked perdita as he rode into the yard am i going to make it gaol bird was blaring out of the tack room wireless you couldnt be a worse polo player than you are a singer snapped perdita back in his black leather trousers wearing two of rickys jerseys dancer prowled round the drawing room clutching a huge bacardi and coke and looking at the cups and the photographs what an eritage christ i ache all over you fucker when can we go and buy some ponies we cant yet ricky put another log on the fire weve got enough ponies here if youre serious we can spend the summer teaching you to ride and if it works out see about buying ponies in the autumn youre stalling said dancer shivering and edging towards the fire arm still playing up ricky shrugged ive still got no feeling and no strength in my last three fingers ive got just the bloke for you ive seen three specialists said ricky wearily they all say rest it you could fucking rest it for ever said dancer weve got to get you to ten an get the westchester back an youre not getting any younger my friend seth newcombe practises in new york best bone man in the world i cant leave the country mountain better come to mahomet said dancer sethll fly over if i ask him nicely hes been after me for years im not being carved up by some old queen said ricky outraged think he might deflower you under the anaesthetic said dancer dont be so pigeaded seth arrived in england by private jet the following saturday dancers helicopter transported him and his xray equipment to robinsgrove a charming wasp with the gentlest hands and the whitest cuffs ricky had ever seen he examined rickys arm for ten minutes then said hed like to operate immediately i think theres a trapped nerve you must be in a lot of pain can you guarantee a one hundred per cent success rate asked ricky belligerently no but you wont get the strength or feeling back into your hand if you just leave it and youll certainly never get to ten or nine or eight or even seven i know a bit about polo i used to play at the myopia club in boston for years christ i hope he wears spectacles when he carves me up said ricky a week later ricky went into a clinic in harley street the operation took several hours dancer and perdita waited in a private room so dancer wouldnt get mobbed and as the day wore on perditas animosity evaporated and she and dancer clung to each other for reassurance perdita despite rickys admonition smoked one cigarette after another dancer stuck into bacardi and coke was in an even worse state what happens if hes really fucked up seth said he wont said perdita hes such a sod i dont know why we love him so much i ache for him in bed every night sighed perdita i ache every night from falling off his bloody orses pity seth cant give him a heart transplant at the same time to get him over chessie said perdita im sorry i didnt like you to begin with i guess i was jealous i like you said dancer youre going to play on my team when ricky gets better blacks a great colour wiv your eyes both jumped as seth came into the room still in his green gown he looked elated but desperately tired his eyes were bloodshot beneath the green cap well we untrapped the nerve that prison hospital made the most godawful cockup and reset the elbow touching wood he leant down to touch the table and realizing it was veneer shuddered and touched a picture frame he should get back all the strength of his fingers and make a one hundred per cent recovery dancer burst into tears can we see him asked perdita as she and seth mopped him up no point hell be out like a light for the next few hours when can he play again well hell have to be patient a little low goal next year high goal perhaps in while ricky was in hospital dancer had not been idle rolling up at his bedside a few days later he looked very smug well ive got my yard he said putting a large jar of caviar and a bunch of yellow roses down on the bed where is it snapped ricky eldercombe manor jesus how did you fiddle that i went to see lady bentley nice lady said she was fed up wiv providing tea for all the villagers and their visiting teams every sunday i told her thats the trouble wiv noblesse oblige it flamin nobbles you anyway your mate basil baddingham has been very cooperative hes andled the deal and says ill get planning permission for everyfing ricky groaned youre crazy no were not all we need is a stack of brown envelopes filled wiv dosh bas says the councils completely bent thats why theyre called councillors because they counts the money they get in bribes every day dancer roared with laughter how much did they sting you asked ricky disapprovingly nearly a million but bas reckons itll be worf four million by the end of the eighties theres rooms we can knock froo for a recording studio and uvver rooms we can knock froo for parties an a nice piece of flat land where we can build a polo field the village have been playing cricket on that for generations well theyll have to watch polo now and miss lodsworth the village bossyboots will be next door marshalling the parish council like a tiger shes not going to like her girl guides being corrupted by all your musicians dancer grinned sounds kind of fun bas didnt mention any incentives in the handout about underage schoolgirls and talking of schoolgirls i just love that perdita i watched her stick and balling this morning never missed the goal posts once she is not supposed to be playing you cant hold her back protested dancer why are you so foul to her got to bash the stems of roses to get the water in said ricky flatly she told me about losing er pony said dancer fort i might buy her another one you will not snapped ricky suddenly looking pale and tired i can only just control her as it is i got complaints about her from miss lodsworth only last week taking seven ponies up eldercombe high street to save making two journeys so she could get back and stick and ball and she gives them too much road work so they wont get dirty and she wont have to waste time scraping off the mud every time my backs turned she picks up a stick probably want to sleep wiv her said dancer slyly thats why youre so orrible the only thing im interested in is getting chessie back snapped ricky he was bitterly ashamed that having been assured by seth that his arm would recover he was still overwhelmed with black gloom the day before ricky was due home the ancient washing machine finally croaked because perdita had overloaded it with saddle blankets and frances had made such a scene that dancer whipped perdita off to rutminster to buy ricky a new one as a welcomehome present we dont want him any crosser wiv you than he already is said dancer as they stormed back to eldercombe along the motorway perdita adored dancers car a gold ferrari fitted with all the latest gadgets including a synthesizer a cd player whose speakers were blaring out gaol bird and two telephones lets try ringing each other up she suggested then she gave a scream look theres a little dog running along the verge it must have been dumped stop for christs sake cant stop ere protested dancer you bloody can get in the lefthand lane then for a second the traffic slowed down to allow cars to turn off at exit fifteen and perdita was out of the ferrari narrowly avoiding being run down by a lotus and on to the grass track in the centre of the motorway tears streaming down her face she belted back the way they had come looking desperately for the little dog cars were hurtling past her in both directions how could the little thing possibly survive her heart was crashing in her ribs as she stumbled over the uneven divots just when she felt she couldnt run another step she saw the little dog again he had huge terrified eyes with bags under them like a basset and one ear that stuck up and the other down and a long dirty grey body and stumpy legs he wore no collar and was poised absolutely terrified on the far side of the righthand traffic lane perdita didnt call to him but seeing her he suddenly dived into the traffic narrowly missing a milk lorry and a bmw and only avoiding a bentley because it swerved to the left causing great hooting and screaming of brakes now the dog was racing down the green track ahead of her two hundred yards away loomed a little chef restaurant oh please god let him make it sobbed perdita stumbling on ignoring the wolf whistles and yells of approval from passing drivers she watched in anguish as the dog decided to make a dive and plunged into the traffic again trying to avoid a volvo going at mph he was hit by the front of an oil lorry which knocked it on to the hard shoulder perdita gave a scream of horror which turned into joy as the dog stumbled on to three legs and dragged himself into the safety of the restaurant oblivious of cars forgetting dancer perdita somehow crossed the road and sprinted the last hundred yards the dog was nowhere to be seen but following a trail of blood perdita found him underneath a parked lorry his eyes were terrified his lip curling his little back leg a bloody pulp its all right darling gradually she edged towards him but when she put out her hand he snapped and cringed away perdita tried another tack crawling out she explained what had happened to the driver of the lorry and asked if she could have a bit of his lunch grinning he gave her half a pork pie at first the dog looked dubious then slowly edged forwards and gobbled it up plainly starving more yelled perdita by the time the dog had finished the pork pie and eaten three beef sandwiches several drivers were gathered round admiring perditas legs youve got to help me catch him she said peering out her cheeks streaked with oil hell bleed to death if we dont get him to a vet the dog was finally coaxed out with a bowl of water so frantic was his thirst the first lorry driver gave perdita an old blanket to wrap him in the second offered to drive her to the nearest vet and went off to borrow the yellow pages from the restaurant the third was suggesting the rspca might be better when dancer screamed up in his ferrari fuckin ell perdita fort youd been totalled all the drivers had to have dancers autograph for their wives and tell him what a bleedin shame hed been put inside before he and perdita finally set off for the vets perdita had to hold on to the little dog very tightly as he shuddered in her arms despite the blanket he bled all over dancers pale gold upholstery mercifully the vet was at the surgery putting the dog out he operated at once the leg needed sixty stitches once again dancer and perdita waited he wont have to lose the leg said the vet as he washed his hands afterwards but hell have very sore toes for a bit you can pick him up tomorrow what are you going to do with him dancer asked perdita give him to ricky hes got to learn to love something new getting home to find little chef as he was now known in situ ricky was absolutely furious i do not want another dog and if i did it would be a whippet that must be the ugliest dog ive ever seen hes sweet protested perdita hes had a bad time like you have she nearly added a dog is a tie not a very old school one in little chefs case admitted perdita but mongrels are much brighter than breed dogs and you need something to guard the yard frances is getting very long in the tooth little chef hobbled towards ricky the whites of his supplicating pleading eyes were like pieces of boiled egg his tail instead of hanging between his legs was beginning to curl i dont want a dog said ricky sulkily it broke millicents heart every time i went away im not into the business of heartbreaking could have fooled me drawled dancer ive gotta go ive got a concert so have i dancers got me a ticket said perdita scuttling out after him see you tomorrow just give him a chance left alone with ricky little chef limped to the door and whined for a bit when it was time to go to bed ricky got millicents basket down from the attic and put it in front of the aga stay he said firmly little chef stayed upstairs he had difficulty getting out of his clothes across the yard he could see a light on in francess flat shed be across in a flash if he asked her since the operation hed had terrible trouble sleeping to get comfortable he had to lie on his back with his left hand hanging out of the bed his body ached with longing for chessie for a second he thought of perdita then slammed his mind shut like a dungeon door that could only lead to disaster francess scrawny body was always on offer but on the one night when despair had driven him to avail himself of it he hadnt even been able to get it up that was why she was so bitter he turned out the light breathing in the sweet soapy smell of hawthorn blossom through the open window the new moon was rising like a silver horn out of the jaws of the galloping fox weathervane before he had time to wish he jumped out of his skin as a rough tongue licked his hand in the dim light he saw little chef gazing up at him beseechingly go away snapped ricky then as the dog slunk miserably away oh all right just this once but when he patted the bed little chef couldnt make it so ricky reached down and helped him up immediately he snuggled against rickys body giving a sigh of happiness for the first time in years both of them slept in until lunchtime within a week little chef was running the yard bringing in the ponies from the fields doing tricks for pony nuts retrieving lost balls from the undergrowth then running on to the field and dropping them when there was a pause in play he also learnt not to scrabble dancers leather trousers and who was welcome in the yard biting the ankles of visiting vat men growling at philippa mannering when ever hopeful she dropped in on ricky and lifting his leg on the probation officers bicycle he adored perdita but ricky was his great love and gradually as the ugly little dog limped after him barking encouragement during practice chukkas and even hitching a lift on the back of a pony in order not to be separated ricky succumbed totally to his charms and when the vet came to take out little chefs stitches it was ricky who held the wildly trembling dog in his arms any visiting player who was foolish enough to make eyes at perdita or disparaging cracks about little chefs appearance got very short shrift by the beginning of august rickys arm was so much better that he was able gently to stick and ball by the end of august so excessive had been the overtime paid the builders and excavators that dancer and his gaudy retinue were able to move into eldercombe manor miss lodsworth had a busy summer when she wasnt inveighing against cruelty to ponies and disgusting language at rutshire polo club and furiously ringing up ricky to complain about perdita thundering ponies five abreast down eldercombe high street she was writing to dancer to grumble about cheeky builders truculent security guards and alsatians chasing her cat smudge nor was she amused by helicopters with flashing lights landing like fireflies at all hours nor the deafening boom of allnight recording sessions worst of all some sadist of a landscape designer had slapped down dancers stickandball field right next to her house so she not only had fairies at the bottom of her garden but also a microcosm of rutshire polo club as commissioner for rutshire how could she hold dignified gettogethers with her guides when expletives and polo balls kept flying over her hawthorn hedge nor did any of the rest of the parish council come to her aid the vicar who was a closet gay and the local solicitor who reckoned that such development would triple the price of his house both thought dancer was splendid dancer however was warned well in advance that miss lodsworth would be holding an allrutshire jamboree in her garden on the first saturday in september and had promised there would be no stick and balling that afternoon a perfect day dawned rising early miss lodsworth prayed that it would continue fine and her guides would find enjoyment as well as fulfilment in their jamboree believing in economy miss lodsworth had already baked rock and fairy cakes and spread hundreds of sandwiches with crusts still on with marmite and plum jam which was cheaper than strawberry nor was coca cola or sevenup allowed her guides would have lemon squash because it was better for them and less expensive creaking up from her knees miss lodsworth snorted with indignation even on a saturday dancers bulldozers were still knocking down trees and flattening hillocks to extend one of the loveliest cricket grounds in england into a polo field just after lunch as she was wriggling into her guide uniform which had grown somewhat tight miss lodsworth looked out of the window and saw a girl not wearing a hard hat clattering five ponies down the high street it was that fiendish perdita macleod now she had pulled up outside the village shop and was yelling to them to bring her out an icecream the vicars wife who had parked on a yellow line while her gay husband went into the shop to get a treacle tart got such a shock when wayne stuck his big hairy white face in through the window that she jumped out and ran away a traffic warden finding an empty car gave the vicar a parking ticket clattering on trying to hold five ponies and eat an icecream perdita was not amused to hear whoops and noisy hooting behind her it was seb and dommie carlisle packed into their lotus with two sumptuous brunettes and a bull terrier spilling out of the luggage compartment aware that she was hot and sweaty and her hair was escaping from its towelling band perdita greeted them sulkily were going to see over dancers palazzo yelled seb and swim in his pool which is even bigger than loch lomond why dont you come over i havent got a bikini thats the last thing youll need see you later when she got back to the yard however ricky had other ideas what the fuck were you doing taking out five ponies at once ive just had miss lodsworth and the vicars wife on the telephone if you step out of line once more youre fired and dont think youre going to turn them out and slope off i want each pony washed down and all the sweat scraped off im going out to look at a pony and dont forget to doublelock waynes door the jamboree was in full swing guides were marching powwowing flagwaving and singing stirring songs as dancer showed the twins over a totally transformed eldercombe manor as they progressed through the great hall which was now a recording studio and practice rooms and six master bedrooms with bathrooms and jacuzzis en suite and an intercom service so dancers retinue could chatter to each other all night the twins whoops of laughter and excitement grew in volume i want a mistress bedroom said seb bouncing on one of the huge double beds outside they admired a pink brick yard for twenty ponies which looked like three sides of a battenburg cake and an indoor school completely walled with bulletproof mirrors bas said it looked like a tarts bedroom said dancer cheerfully hes seen enough of them said dommie how the hell did you get planning permission bas and i gave a little drinks party for all the local planning committee an greased their palms so liberally their glasses kept sliding out of their ands and there were german shepherds abiding in the fields said seb keeping a close hold on decorum his bull terrier as twinkie the security guard prowled past with an alsatian but this is designated an area of outstanding natural beauty it will be when my ponies arrive next week said dancer cosily soon the twins and their brunettes and various glamorous hangerson were all stripped off round the pool miss lodsworth exhorting her guides to greater endeavour in this modern world was having great difficulty making herself heard over the din of dancers group who were warming up in the recording studio seb standing on the top board with binoculars was peering into miss lodsworths garden in excitement that blonde one looks very prepared to me lend a hand darling he shouted isnt that what girl guides are supposed to do i wish someone would lend me a farm hand said dancers interior designer sulkily wilhelm wont speak to me since i chucked his filofax in the jacuzzi hes nice he added as one of dancers workmen went past wielding his jcb like ben hur now theyre doing semaphore said seb get me a goal flag dancer then i can signal do you screw to that blonde shell tie a clove hitch in your willy if youre not careful said dommie then itll be a guided missile collapsing off the diving board with laughter at his own joke seb just managed to keep the binoculars above the water level meanwhile over in snow cottage daisy macleod trying to fill up her painting jar found there was no water in the tap in the house above her philippa mannering who wanted to wash her hair before the dinner party to which ricky had refused to come yet again found not only no water in the tap but that the washingup machine had stopped in midcycle over at robinsgrove finding no water to hose down the ponies perdita put them in their boxes and having given them their hay nets and filled up the water buckets from the water trough raced off to dancers for a swim wayne rickys favourite pony had such a low threshold of boredom that he had a special manger hooked over the halfdoor so he could eat and miss nothing in the yard at the same time the yard escapologist he had been known to turn on taps and flood the yard and even worse let other ponies out of their boxes when he got bored at matches he had to be watched like a hawk in case he wriggled out of his headcollar and set off for the tea tent where his doleful yellow face and blackringed eyes could coax sandwiches and cake out of the most stonyhearted waitress left to his own vices deserted even by his friend little chef whod gone with ricky wayne started to fiddle with the bolt at the jamboree it was time for tea the marmite and plum jam sandwiches were already curling on the trestle table under the walnut tree the guides were hot and thirsty but as miss lodsworth went to the kitchen tap for water to fill up the jugs of concentrated lemon squash only a trickle came out of the tap please miss lodsworth said a pinkfaced pack leader the upstairs toilet isnt flushing nors the downstairs said her friend looking out across dancers emerging polo fields miss lodsworth first thought how beautiful as a huge fountain of water gushed a hundred feet into the air throwing up rainbow lights in the sunshine against the yellowing trees picking up the telephone she was on to dancer in a trice dyou realize she spluttered that your bulldozers have gone slap through the chief water main the whole village will be cut off and my guides have nothing to drink she couldnt mention the question of lavatories to dancer round the pool they were all having hysterics as dancer tried to calm her down ill get on to the emergency services immediately of course they work on a saturday an if it gets too bad your little girls can come and drink out of the swimmingpool and weve got plenty of bourbon if youre pushed he had to hold the telephone away from his ear an hour later perdita sidled into the yard with wet hair to be confronted by frances quivering with ecstatic disapproval why the hell didnt you bother to dry off the ponies i just nipped over to dancers for a swim cant keep away from the boys can you did you turn wayne out no yes i must have done perdita always blinked when she was lying oh christ he must be in one of the paddocks or the garden he isnt ive looked sneered frances thank god rickyll come to his senses and sack you now oh please dont tell him pleaded perdita she hadnt realized quite how much frances detested her you stay here frances handed her hermias lead rope ill take my car and go and look for him ill go sobbed perdita and leaping on to hermias back she clattered off down the drive perdita couldnt get any sense out of the gaudy retinue round dancers pool they were all drunk or stoned waynes gone missing she screamed please someone come and help me look for him probably gone to the jamboree said dommie looking up from his brunette miss lodsworthll be teaching him how to untie clove hitches dont be so fucking flip pulling on a pair of garfield boxer shorts grumbling dommie tiptoed barefoot across the gravel out to his lotus you go west ill go north have you seen a yellow pony with a white face have you seen a yellow pony with a white face getting more and more desperate perdita stopped at every house and scoured every field ricky would go apeshit if anything happened to wayne then as she entered eldercombe village she saw a pile of droppings in the middle of the road looking for a pony said an old man he went into that garden perdita went as green as the guides unconsumed lemon squash for there in the gateway framed in an arch of clematis as purple as her face stood miss lodsworth shed had to buy all her guides coca cola from guiding funds and send them home early in a hired bus in case they electrocuted themselves storming the gates of eldercombe manor in search of dancer she would be eating marmite sandwiches and rock buns for months dancer maitland has wrecked my jamboree roared miss lodsworth your pony has wrecked my garden hes trampled on my alstroemerias and my dahlias kicked out my cucumber frame and broken down the fence into the orchard im terribly sorry ill pay begged perdita please dont ring ricky im going to ring my solicitor wayne was enchanted to see hermia and perdita and gave the appearance of having been searching for them all day as she only had one lead rope perdita had to walk both ponies the mile and a half back to robinsgrove at the bottom of the drive wayne started to totter and his yellow belly gave such a thunderous rumble he started looking round at it in surprise and reproach oh god colic thought perdita perhaps hes eaten something he shouldnt i must get him home halfway up the drive wayne started pawing his belly and rolling the whites of his eyes soon he was cannoning off lime trees and as they passed the second gates crashed into the lefthand gatepost by the time he had staggered into the yard he could hardly stand up hitting the ancient mossy mounting block and tripping over one of the green tubs filled with white geraniums as little chef came bounding out to lick him on the nose perdita had never known ricky so angry taking one look at the swaying wayne he yelled at frances to ring phil bagley the vet tell him it may be a heart attack or colic or twisted gut he could even have been hit by a car tell him to fucking hurry then turning on perdita you stupid bbbitch i told you to doublebolt those doors i know i forgot well youve forgotten once too often get out youre fired please let me see what phil says whispered perdita whose face was now as white as waynes get out hissed ricky who needed all his strength to guide the staggering crashing wayne into his box just fuck off phil bagley arrived in a quarter of an hour i was delivering one of mark phillips calves he said indignantly the things i do for you ricky now wheres this pony as he went into his box wayne was still pawing his belly then slumping against the wall he crashed to the ground ill give him a massive jab of vitamin b said phil when hed examined him and some buscopan its obviously hurting him then wed better get some fluids inside him i guess its twisted gut wheres he been escaped to eldercombe got into miss lllodsworths garden jesus youd think hed been programmed as phil loaded his syringe and ricky tried to calm the terrified pony whose eyes were quite glazed now they heard frantic barking outside next minute miss lodsworths head appeared over the halfdoor looking even more like a horse than wayne ive come to make a complaint not now said phil who was holding the needle up to remove the air bubbles piss off muttered ricky under his breath i must speak to someone can you wait somewhere else snapped phil im sorry but weve got a critically sick horse here sick my eye thundered miss lodsworth that horse isnt sick its dead drunk its just eaten all my cider apples there was a long pause crouching down phil sniffed waynes breath i do believe youre right how many apples dyou reckon he ate close on a hundred ricky never thought hed want to hug miss lodsworth are you sure he said getting to his feet as he plunged the needle into waynes shoulder phil started to laugh a second later dommie carlisle shivering slightly in just boxer shorts appeared beside miss lodsworth youve found him thank christ ive been looking everywhere whats the matter with him pissed as a newt said ricky im surprised you treat the matter so lightly bristled miss lodsworth what about my apples he ought to have some painkillers said phil and we ought to get some fluids into him dont want him to wreck his liver but wayne was sleeping peacefully better lay on some fernet branca for the morning said dommie i think i deserve a drink ricky you all deserve a drink said ricky turning to miss lodsworth im frightfully sssorry ill refund you for the apples and any other damage i havent got any cider but i can offer you plenty of whisky miss lodsworth had had a long day oh all right i havent been inside this house since i used to come here to dances when your father was a boy not that he ever danced with me after rickyd settled them in the drawing room with drinks he went in search of perdita she wasnt on the wooden horse or in the yard or in the tack room little chef tracked her down in the pink dusk at the bottom of the garden with her arms round an apple tree sobbing her heart out please god make wayne better she was saying over and over again then started as little chef stood up on his stumpy back legs to lick her hand im so sorry she wailed please give me another chance i love it here so much i promise not to cheek frances and cut corners i just love the ponies and cheffie and you so much she couldnt stop herself adding in a year of working for him she had never cried or apologized she looked so forlorn so utterly defeated her head drooping like a snowdrop her wonderfully lithe body clinging almost orgiastically to the tree trunk ricky had to steel himself not to take her in his arms but he would have been putting a match to a petrolsoaked bonfire and he didnt want to hate himself any more than he did already its ok he said gently hes not ill just drunk hed helped himself to miss lodsworths cider apples oh my god will he be ok fine except for a thumping hangover but you cant afford to make mistakes like that he might have got on to the motorway like little chef shuddered perdita starting to cry again thats what makes it so awful i overreacted said ricky dropping a hand on her hair you can start full time next week if you like oh you are lovely seizing his hand perdita covered it with kisses i could make you better i really do love you ricky felt dizzy it was so long since hed wanted someone like this no you dont he said firmly you ought to be meeting more boys your own age not lechers like bas and the twins if youre coming to work here full time youre bloody well going to join the pony club polo is largely a matter of pony power having left the army drew benedict had spent a great deal of sukeys money buying really good ponies with these he turned his game around and was gratified when his handicap was raised to eight in the autumn listings a year later the following year after an excellent may and june playing for david waterlane drew felt he ought to put something back into the game he therefore agreed to coach the rutshire pony club for the polo championships the finals of which were held at cowdray at the end of july drew also quite liked an excuse to get away from sukey on summer evenings used to commanding platoons he was determined to knock the rutshire teams into shape one of his crosses was perdita macleod who had now been working full time for ricky for nine months and felt she knew everything perdita on the other hand even though she was playing with seventeen to twentyone year olds regarded playing for the pony club as deeply infra dig she loathed being parted from ricky for a second and felicia the ponies ricky and drew had lent her were still very green consequently she never stopped bellyaching to daisy about how all the other pony club members had at least three ponies and how humiliating it was having to hack to meetings when everyone else rolled up either in the latest horse boxes with grooms or driving porsches with telephones nor she told daisy did that bloody old geriatric drew benedict ever stop picking on her and all the other boys in the team were such wimps one of them started crying yesterday when i hit him with my stick it was only because he was using his elbows all the time i tried to explain to drew but he just sent me off arent any of the boys attractive enquired daisy hopefully not compared with ricky snapped perdita and they all think drews absolutely marvellous because hes an eight and a falklands hero and all hes such a bastard youre always saying that about ricky said daisy reasonably but im madly in love with ricky so i put up with it it was nearly two and a half years since hamish had walked out on daisy and she could no longer claim to be madly in love with him but she missed the presence of a man in her life and her selfconfidence was in tatters by some miracle she had hung on to her job with the caring chauvinist but she found it exhausting coping with that and running the house and looking after perdita and more and more after violet and eddie now wendy had a daughter called bridget after biddy macleod hamish seemed less interested in his older children snow cottage simply wasnt big enough for all of them particularly when perdita who still hadnt forgiven her mother was always banging doors and making scenes daisy ever hopeful and optimistic however still made heroic efforts to win perdita round she couldnt afford a car yet but on the day of the final trials for the pony club championships which were held at rutshire polo ground she and ethel took two buses and walked a mile in pouring rain to lend perdita support perdita however was deeply embarrassed to see her mother arriving in unsuitably colourful clothes and dripping wet hair like a superannuated hippie why the hell couldnt she turn up in a barbour a headscarf and a volvo like everyone elses mother nervous because she was due to play in two chukkas time perdita refused even to acknowledge daisys presence momentarily the rain had stopped it was a hot very muggy evening the sun making a guest appearance between frowning petrolblue clouds floodlit the dog daisies and hogweed in the long grass and turned the pitch a stinging viridian a sweet waft of lime blossom mingled with the rank sexy smell of drying nettles and elder flowers daisy had brought her sketch pad but found it difficult to capture the action and hold on to a straining ethel perhaps she could let ethel off there seemed to be an awful lot of dogs around for her to play with liberated ethel frisked with a jack russell in a red spotted scarf and wolfed up a halfeaten beefburger bun then as the players came thundering down the boards she joined the stampede trying to steal the ball and nearly bringing down the pony of a fat child with pigtails whose mother promptly started yelling at daisy fortunately her torrent of abuse was diluted by a downpour of even more torrential rain all the mothers raced for their volvos as the players struggled over to another part of the field sheltering her sketch pad under her shirt daisy looked helplessly around she had no mackintosh shed just managed to catch a joyously soaked ethel when a blond man with a flat cap pulled over his straight nose asked her if shed like to sit in his landrover its all right i dont mind the dog ethel clambered into the back and slobbered down his neck you are kind said daisy gratefully being a pisces i normally love rain but this shirts a bit seethrough when its wet she was wearing a fringed dark purple midiskirt and a pink muslin shirt from the early seventies which had tiny mirrors sewn into it and which was clinging unashamedly to her breasts her dark hair fell damp and straight just grazing her nipples you look like midi ha ha said the blond man smiling slightly but when daisy unearthed a bottle of madeup vodka and orange from the chaos of her bag he shook his head helping herself daisy noticed he never took his eyes off the play and was now turning on the windscreen wipers to watch a darkhaired boy coax a fat roan pony down the field that childs definitely team potential but the ponys an absolute bitch i must have a word with his parents and christ that ponys improved since last year then consulting a list on the dashboard no it hasnt its another pony do you want my coat im fine daisy took another swig out of her bottle midi ha ha laughing vodka at least i cant be done for being drunk in charge of a setter nice dog said the blond man putting back a hand and rubbing ethel behind the ears isnt she agreed daisy who was beginning to perk up she noticed that the man was very handsome in a stolid heavylidded way she would have to mix manganese blue with a little paynes grey to get the colour of his eyes he had a lovely mouth and lovely muscular thighs daisy suddenly wanted to check her face and when he went off at the end of the chukka to talk to the next group playing which included perdita she toned down her rosy cheeks and drenched her neck with je reviens but failed to put the top back on properly so it stank out the landrover je reviens said the blond man sniffing as he got back inside and i did youre too young to have a child playing asked daisy fishing yes checking the list of players again he opened the car door yelling for christs sake mark youre not on your man ought to be called unmark said daisy taking another swig im dying to find out which is drew benedict really ghastly old fossil went on daisy happily hes giving perdita such a hard time i would have thought having worked for ricky for nearly two years she might be allowed to evolve her own style she offered the diminishing bottle to him again again he shook his head howd you get on with ricky he asked never see him i just pay his farm manager our rent he rides past occasionally he still looks pretty miserable but dancer seems to have cheered him up and the specialist says hell definitely be playing again next year then well all have to look to our laurels said the blond man but hes not a good teacher too impatient and introverted too obsessed with his own game hes got a sexy voice thought daisy soft and very quiet she wished she knew if he were married there are lots of boys playing she said in surprise perdita seems to be the only girl boys tend to avoid the pony club because theyre always being told to keep their toes up and clean tack give them a stick and ball and its a different story some of them are pretty bloody impossible when they arrive no idea how to play as a team or to think of other people most of them get far too much pocket money not perditas problem said daisy nor enough discipline parents marriages are so often breaking up hum perditas problem sighed daisy whose tongue had been totally loosened by drink on no lunch everyone keeps telling me she needs a father but its tricky if youre a single parent isnt that a ghastly expression if you go out at night looking for a father for your children everyone brands you a whore people like philippa mannering and miss lodsworth dyou know them only too well and if youre too miserable because youve been deserted people think youre a drag and dont ask you to parties and if youre too jolly wives think youre after their husbands i feel like taking a pinger to parties to stop myself talking to anyones husband longer than two minutes even girlfriends i know really well get insanely jealous mind you the husbands think youre after them as well if you dont have a man even the plainest ones think youre dying for it and are you asked the blond man who was watching perdita jump the boards and execute a particularly dazzling back shot good girl she kept her head down not really but on lovely days youre suddenly overwhelmed with longing to be in love again he turned and looked at her did she detect compassion or was it slight wistfulness in those incredibly direct blue eyes she was just thinking how easy hed be to fall in love with and that she really mustnt start cradlesnatching when he said perditas seriously good shes already been picked for the jack gannon thats the eighteen to twentyone group but she ought to apply for a pony club polo scholarship whatd that entail six months in new zealand or australia the bpa pay for her ticket out there and put her in a yard shed get pocket money in return shed look after the ponies school them and play polo oh how wonderful sighed daisy thinking longingly of the peace at home then added hastily for perdita of course they have to be heavily vetted beforehand so they dont let the side down some winners in the past have been temperamental and failed to get up in the morning but on the whole they go out as boys and come back as men i hope perdita doesnt grow hairs on her chest giggled daisy sorry im being silly its a wonderful idea but im sure drew benedict wont allow it why not he thinks shes useless the blond man looked faintly amused theres the bell then as a woman strode past in plus fours with an eton crop added and theres the dc id better go and have a word with her looks more ac to me said daisy draining the last of the vodka and orange the sinking sun had appeared again gilding the wheat fields and splodging inky shadows in the rainsoaked trees daisy got unsteadily out of the landrover next moment ethel nearly pulled her over as perdita galloped up hello mum youve got tomato skin on your front tooth what on earth were you talking to drew about for so long drew said daisy faintly but you said he was old so he is at least twentynine but i really like him now hes picked me for the jack gannon and im four months under age and he says hermias really improved daisy was almost too embarrassed to accept a lift home from drew i had no idea she mumbled ill have to be a bit nicer to perdita in future he said drily perdita was in such a good mood that she and daisy actually had supper together for the first time in months er is drew benedict married asked daisy as she mashed the potato to a terrific sloane called sukey said perdita not looking up from horse and hound shes just had a baby it popped out during the semifinals of the queens cup if it had been a girl drew wanted to call her chukka bas said it ought to be called chuckup because its always being sick daisy added too much milk to the potatoes is she pretty sukey nooo said perdita scornfully drew married her for her money i thought he was gorg i mean quite attractive said daisy too straight for me said perdita i wonder if i ought to take up weightlifting daisy nearly said perdita could start off by weight lifting some of her belongings upstairs but desisted because it was such heaven to be on speaking terms again encouraged by drew daisy applied for a pony club scholarship for perdita and they were duly summoned to kirtlington to meet the committee in early july as their appointment wasnt until the afternoon sukey benedict asked them to lunch beforehand to the caring chauvinists extreme irritation daisy took the day off and hired a car very out of practice at driving she had several nearmisses on the motorway and her nerves werent helped by perdita spending most of the journey with her hands over her eyes as daisy ground recalcitrant gears and proceeded in a succession of jerks down the high streets of oxfordshire villages having thought about drew benedict rather too much in the last fortnight daisy was fascinated to see what sukey was like but as she came down the steps of the beautiful russet georgian house first impressions were very depressing only five weeks after having a baby sukeys figure was back to an enviable slimness the perfect pinkandwhite skin had no need of makeup her collarlength mousey hair was drawn off her forehead she wore a blue denim skirt on the knee and a striped shirt with the collar turned up noting the lack of creases the air of calm efficiency the brisk highpitched voice daisy thought gloomily that sukey couldnt be more different from her if this was drews type she didnt stand a chance then she felt desperately guilty who was she whod been crucified by hamishs departure to hanker after someone elses husband escaping into the downstairs loo which had photographs of drew in various polo teams all over the walls daisy repaired her pink shiny face it was so hot outside that she had settled for an orange cheesecloth caftan which shed jacked in with a belt of linked gold hippos the gathers over the bosom made her look as though she was the one breastfeeding she wore brown sandals and tried to arrange the crossgartering over two scabs where shed cut herself shaving the telephone had rung just as shed finished washing her hair so it had dried all wild and was now held back with an orangeandshockingpink striped scarf off which ethel had chewed one of the corners goldhooped earrings completed the picture i look awful thought daisy particularly as perdita whod be expected to ride looked absolutely ravishing in a dark blue shirt and white breeches coming out of the loo she found drew looking equally ravishing in a blue striped shirt rolled up to show very brown arms he had that highcoloured english complexion which looks so much better with a suntan he took her into the sitting room which daisy was comforted to see was absolute hell far too much eaudenil and yellow and ghastly paintings of polo matches interspersed with some excellent watercolours over the fireplace was a very glamorized portrait of sukey in a pale blue ball dress and some very good sapphires over the desk was a portrait of drew probably painted in his late teens he was wearing an opennecked shirt and his blond hair flopped over his eyes which were smiling with a lazy insolence johnny macklow said daisy impressed drew nodded good girl only had one sitting spent the whole time fending the old bugger off refused to go back for any more my mother was furious vodka and orange wasnt it not too large chided sukey shes got to talk sense to the committee later need a stiff one to cope with that lot said drew having handed the glass to daisy he turned to perdita like to come and see the yard lunch at one fifteen on the dot dont be too long ordered sukey after theyd gone sukey paced up and down sipping evian water out of the window daisy admired the incredibly tidy garden not a weed dared to show its face beyond a heat haze shimmered above the fields which sloped upwards to a wood which seemed about to explode in midgy darkness on the piano was a picture of a baby in a silver frame hes sweet said daisy just beginning to smile said sukey her voice softening and youve got your figure back so amazingly exercise and not drinking helps it must said daisy guiltily taking a huge gulp of her vodka and orange sukey had reached the window in her pacing and was about to start on the return journey look i hope you dont mind my saying so but i know drews fritefly keen for perdita to get this scholarship hes been so kind mumbled daisy but the committee are really rather stuffy sukey was like a comely steamroller i honestly think you ought to wear something more conventional that orange dress would be lovely at a party but it makes you look a bit arty and hippy and you should wear tights they all had holes said daisy flushing lets just pop upstairs and see if we can find something more suitable but youre miles thinner than me before she knew it daisy was upstairs in the tidiest bedroom she had ever seen even the few pots of makeup on the blueflowered dressing table seemed to be standing to attention the double bed was huge too lucky thing to be made love to by drew on it daisy was appalled to find herself thinking when i was having jamie i had this lovely dress which i hardly got out of said sukey raking coat hangers along a brass bar ah here it is triumphantly she extracted a navyblue cotton dress with a big white sailor collar presumably to distract from the bulge oh i couldnt protested daisy but as if mesmerized she found herself getting out of her orange caftan and darting almost minnowlike into the navyblue dress so ashamed was she of the greyness of her pants which had practically detached themselves from the elastic it really isnt me she protested it is you need the whole look insisted sukey bossily heres a pair of tights theyve even got a darn the committeell like that and these shoes will be perfect i love flatties dont you but a little heels better for this dress they do fit well and the earrings dont really go or the scarf just let me brush your hair back and put on this alice band there dont you look charming neat but not gaudy daisy gazed at herself in the mirror her forehead was unnaturally white where her fringe had been drawn back she suppressed a terrible desire to fold her arms and break into a hornpipe its truly not me itll certainly be the committee said sukey firmly you want perdita to get this scholarship dont you there was a knock and a filipino maid put a shiny dark head round the door its ready is it conchita well be down in a sec can you tell mr benedict drew didnt recognize daisy when she crept in wheres daisy got to he said breaking off a grape christ said perdita youve been sloaned mum doesnt she look nice said sukey she looks gross sukeys lips tightened drew looked at daisy incredulously torn between rage and a desire to laugh but thats your maternity dress he added to sukey and as my disgusting stepfather walked out two and a half years ago pointed out perdita the committee are going to think it pretty odd that mums got a bun in the oven she doesnt look at all pregnant said sukey she looks like jolly jack tar snapped perdita shiver your timbers mum shut up perdita fighting a fearful urge to burst into tears daisy giggled instead daisy looked lovely before said sukey plunging a knife into the yellow red and green surface of the quiche but you know how stuffy brigadier canford and major ashton are charlie canfords such a dom hed have much preferred daisy as she was said drew coldly noone could have told from his face that he was absolutely livid with sukey but he didnt want a row which would upset daisy and gee perdita up before the interview patting the chair beside him he told daisy if perdita gets the scholarship sukey and i may well be going out to new zealand at the same time to buy some ponies so we can keep an eye on her not if youre going to dress me in sailor suits said perdita giving a bit of pastry to drews slavering yellow labrador i dont think perdita ought to have wine if shes going to ride said sukey would you like salad with or after daisy ignoring her drew filled up perditas glass then seeing daisys eyes had suddenly filled with tears asked her if shed like another vodka and orange another thing to remember at the interview said sukey pointedly is to let perdita do the talking some mothers answer all the time for the children which makes the committee think the child lacks initiative what have you done to my mum suke sang perdita shut up perdita said drew and daisy simultaneously and do try and appear really keen perdita advised sukey the committee loves enthusiasm the interview lasted half an hour very kindly they asked daisy about her financial circumstances she stuck out her darned leg hoping to give an impression of genteel poverty smiled so much her face ached and despite sukeys warnings found herself talking too much to compensate for perditas bored indifference brigadier canford who was indeed a lover of pretty girls looked at perditas impassive deadpan face and had a strange feeling hed seen her before somewhere and what dyou want to get out of polo i want to go to ten bit ambitious nearest a womans ever got is five out of the window perdita could see children riding in pairs and dribbling balls in and out of soap boxes i know but there was a piece in a polo magazine the other day saying many women were ten in beauty but never could be ten in polo fucking patronizing perdita murmured daisy i hope you wouldnt use language like that in new zealand young lady said the brigadier youd be representing your country you know still patronizing later they watched her playing a chukka with seven other contenders for the scholarship brigadier canford admired the lightning reflexes the way she adjusted to a notveryeasy pony in seconds and showed up the others as she ruthlessly shoved them out of the way and catandmousewhipped the ball away just as they were about to hit it wow he said turning to drew im not sure she couldnt go to ten and shed certainly be ten in looks if she smiled more often puzzled he shook his pewtergrey head i cant think where ive seen her before apart from perdita the rutshire team for the jack gannon cup consisted of justin and patrick lombard farmers sons whod spent their lives in the saddle and who made up for lack of finesse with dogged determination and david waterlanes son mike now nearly twentyone who played like an angel when his father wasnt on the sideline bellowing at him in an exhausting exhilarating fortnight they moved round the country triumphing gloriously at cheshire being demoralized at cirencester where they drew against a vastly inferior team cockahoop at kirtlington and nearly coming unstuck at windsor where perdita was sent off for swearing so rutshire had to play the last chukka with only three men and only just won on the first friday in august they finally reached cowdray and won the semifinals by the skins of their gumshields the quorn opposing them had rumbled drews exocet weapon and spent the match giving perdita so much hassle that she only hit the ball twice the lombard brothers and mike waterlane however scored a goal apiece to put rutshire into sundays final against the mighty south sussex who hadnt been beaten for three years the entire championships were being sponsored by petfood billionaire and fitness freak kevin coley chairman of doggie dins moggie meal and the newly launched fidofibre kevin had formerly sponsored showjumping but five years ago had run off with janey the wife of billy lloydfoxe one of his professionals and rupert campbellblacks best friend after janey went back to billy kevin had patched up his differences with his wife enid but one of the conditions had been that kevin would sponsor polo instead of showjumping to avoid bumping into janey on the circuit and because their daughter tracey would meet a nicer class of young man in polo trace as she liked to be called at eighteen was playing in the crack south sussex team against rutshire in the final if she wasnt quite up to her other teammates her presence there vastly increased her fathers generosity the whole south sussex team had been driving round the country in a vast aluminium horse box evidently the latest thing in america and kevin had provided each player with four topclass ponies the south sussex team was also more than compensated by the rock solidarity of a boy called paul hedley at back and the dazzling sherwood brothers randolph and merlin whod pulled out of high goal polo for a fortnight to piss it up with the pony club randy sherwood who was known as the cock of the south had a handicap of two and was so glamorous with his long long legs and curly hair that fell perfectly into shape that girls clamoured to groom for him for nothing merlin who was quieter but just as lethal had pulled a different groupie every night of the championships randy going amazingly steady for him had spent the fortnight screwing trace coley who was as pretty as she was spoilt because hed heard rumours that kevin was thinking of including him in his team next year perdita and trace had detested each other on sight and together with randy trace spent a lot of time when they werent screwing winding perdita up not only did they drench her in a water fight when she didnt have a change of clothes and throw her on the muck heap but on friday evening offered her a roll filled with doggie dins so she spent the rest of the night throwing up perdita reacted with screaming tantrums trace suspecting randys incessant baiting might have some basis in desire stepped up the spite and now it was finals day and the number two ambersham ground at cowdray was a seething mass of caravans tents trailers canvas looseboxes for ponies and rows of cars belonging to team managers and exhausted parents breakfast of sausage egg and chips was sizzling over campfires the mobile loos had worked until the day before but now each bowl was an everest of bronco and the stench was getting worse with fifty teams present there had also been one hell of a party the night before now revellers nursed their hangovers all the beaufort and the vwh had been penalized for skinnydipping one of the quorn had been discovered in a very loosebox with a girl from the cotswold and dropped from his team perdita not in a party mood had stayed in her tent reading the maltese cat daisy having taken a fortnights holiday to drive perdita around in yet another hired car had never felt so shattered in her life she spent the morning scrubbing out the ponies boxes because the rutshire team manager miffed that drew seemed to have utterly taken over threatened dire reprisals if a blade of straw was left on the floor in despair at the greasiness of her hair daisy had washed it in the river how the hell had women coped in biblical times and it had dried all crinkly the cornflowerblue dress she had brought to wear at the finals had been slept on by ethel and was impossibly creased as was her face after two nights sleeping in the car her legs not brown enough were becoming bristly she was miserably aware of getting on perditas nerves and as all the fathers had rolled up of the loneliness of being a woman on ones own she was almost abject with gratitude to drew whod insisted she use his landrover as her base and whod come up specially that morning to invite her to lunch and to watch the match with him and sukey among the pony club daisy noticed drew was a superman a fortnight ago he had played for england against america in the annual international only his two hardfought goals and grimly consistent defence had prevented the game turning into a rout now he couldnt move twenty yards without signing autographs in his cool way drew found this gratifying marrying sukey had admittedly enabled him to buy a string of cracking ponies and build a muchenvied yard but he was increasingly irked by the curbs on his freedom sukey raised eyebrows when he ordered rather too good a bottle of claret in restaurants she winced at the size of his tailors bill and questioned him going to harley street to replace two teeth knocked out in the gold cup when there was a perfectly good national health dentist down the road and just because miguel obrien had switched to a new ludicrously expensive lightweight saddle why did all drews ponies need one too drew had never been extravagant but he couldnt see the point of parsimony for parsimonys sake so he had decided to look for a patron some ignoramus who would pay him a long salary to coach him and look after his ponies kevin coley was rumoured to be fed up with the dreadful napiers and looking for a new senior professional trace coley was impossibly spoilt but drew felt he could handle her it was therefore in his interest to be the coach responsible for toppling south sussex this afternoon while the south sussex team by invitation of kevin were all lunching on lobster gulls eggs out of season strawberries and champagne in the doggie dins tent half a mile away in one of lord cowdrays cottages the rutshire were having a team meeting the curtains were drawn so they could see the video that drew was playing of their semifinal against the quorn drew leant against the wall his thumb on the control button today we have one problem you have to mark the other guys or well lose you should never be more than two horselengths away from your man at any time you must concentrate justin you were loose in the first chukka so were you patrick drew froze the picture for a second their number three was all on his own if randy sherwood gets loose with the ball were lost trace coleys their weak link you wont have any trouble with her mike so give patrick all the backup he needs and both mark the hell out of randy ill try said mike who had a hoarse voice like a braying donkey the gentle timidness of a jersey cow and blushed every time he was spoken to drew turned to perdita who was deciding whether to race to the loo and be sick again remember youre playing polo not solo perdita their back paul hedley is quite capable of storming through and scoring so stay with him and above all no tantrums south sussex may be ludicrously overconfident but we cant beat them with three players then to perditas squirming embarrassment he replayed the clip of her rowing with the umpire three times freezing the frame of her yelling with her mouth wide open until her teammates were howling with laughter and rolling round on the floor a shaft of sunlight coming through the olivegreen curtains wiped out the picture lets go and have lunch said drew daisy hung about until drew and the team came back to the landrover sukey had done everyone proud and the lombard boys who were labradors when it came to food were soon wolfing smoked salmon quiche marinated breast of chicken mozzarella in brown rolls ratatouille and potato salad made with real mayonnaise mike whod gone greener than the minted melon balls provided for pudding and perdita who was lighting one cigarette from another couldnt eat a thing you must get something inside you insisted sukey bossily and you too daisy id like your husbands cock inside me daisy was absolutely horrified to find herself thinking it was only because drew had remembered she liked vodka and orange and had poured her two really strong ones in her present vulnerable state she was hopelessly receptive to kindness oh wheres ricky moaned perdita for the millionth time dont be too upset if he doesnt come said drew in an undertone i know he wants to but all these children riding and such family solidarity may be too much for him hes so sweet to her thought daisy gratefully getting out her sketchbook as drew took the team off to the pony lines to tack up sukey firmly screwed the top on the vodka youre driving i expect youd like coffee now instead of another drink arent you nervous said trace coley fondly as randy accepted a glass of brandy dont be ridiculous mike waterlanes their only decent player and hell go to pieces as soon as his father turns up david waterlane drove his rollsroyce with the leaping silver polo pony on the front towards cowdray he had made the mistake of going via salisbury because his bride of six months who was twenty years younger than him wanted to look at the cathedral as they drove through rolling hills topped by mohican clumps of trees and moved into the leafy green tunnels of petersfield his bride whod been primed by drew put her hand on her husbands cock and suggested that it would be more fun to stop and have their picnic in a field than join the crowds at cowdray it was only two oclock theyd seen the parade many times before and mikes match wouldnt start before ponies tacked up in the pony lines yawned with boredom as their owners gave them a last polish mothers cleared up the remnants of picnics fathers looked up at the uniform ceiling of grey cloud and decided to put on tweed caps instead of panamas mrs sherwood randys and merlins mother divorced with a brazilian lover and too glamorous for words in a peach suede suit was talking to kevin coley who looked like a pig with a thatched blond teacosy on its head kevin in turn was being watched by his wife enid who had gaolers eyes was more regal than the queen and in her spotted dress looked like a sherman tank with measles daisy marvelled that she and kevin could produce a daughter as pretty as trace cavalcades were riding quietly down to the ground past trees indigo with recent rain and cows and horses grazing alongside the faded grey ruins of the castle with its crenellated battlements and gaping windows of the fifty teams taking part in the parade only eight were playing in the four finals but there was still the prize for the bestturnedout team to be won the ground a huge stretch of perfect emerald turf was bordered to the north by fir trees and to the south by mothers having fearful squawking matches about the authenticity of various junior teams who werent allowed to ride bona fide polo ponies tabitha campbellblacks pony played high goal at cirencester no it didnt yes it did brigadier canford chairman of the pony club and lover of pretty girls was less amused to be stampeded by valkyries the beaufort are cheating theyve backdated membership of their number four hes american and only been in the country two weeks the bicester are cheating too ive just caught them trying to ditch their weak link and import a brilliant boy from rhinefield lower who doesnt have a team ladies ladies said enid coley joining the group of howling mothers polo is only a game and shell have the south sussex team manager stoned to death at dawn with vegetarian scotch eggs if they dont win murmured bas baddingham whod just rolled up and was kissing daisy at two fortyfive the parade began on they came chestnut bay dark brown dappled grey palamino the occasional extravagantly spotted appaloosa ears pricked tack gleaming stirrups and bits glittering daisy marvelled at the shifting kaleidoscope of coloured shirts and the great evermoving millipede of ponies legs in their coloured bandages many of the riders wore faceguards like visors in some medieval contest daisy wished she could paint it but youd need to be lady butler to capture that lot fatty harris rutshires club secretary seconded for the day to do the commentary had had rather too good a lunch in the doggie dins tent and was waxing lyrical over the ancient names here comes the beaufort the bicester the cotswold the vale of the white horse the craven the shouth shushex shecond team thought hed have trouble with that one said bas and a big cheer for the rutshire went on fatty harris todays finalists in the jack gannon on came the rutshire in their prussianblue shirts prussianblue bandages on their ponies gleaming legs little hermia a changed pony after a fortnights attention from perdita danced and snatched at her bit in excitement she should have ridden felicia in the parade said sukey disapprovingly hermia doesnt need hotting up but hermias the nearest she can get to ricky thought daisy and shes still hoping hell turn up next to perdita rode mike waterlane on dopey a deceptively sleepylooking pony who was faster than a ferrari and nipped all the opposition ponies in the lineout beyond him rode the lombard brothers grinning broadly and enjoying themselves oh dont they look lovely suddenly the tears spurted out of daisys eyes and she had to turn away and bury her face in drews landrover next moment a large piece of kitchen roll had been shoved into her hand a minute later when shed got control of herself drew was back with another glass of vodka and orange a great cheer rang out as cowdray the home team came on in their orange shirts and here we have the other finalists in the jack gannon unbeaten for the last three years the south shushex fatty harris got it half right this time randy merlin paul and trace rode with a swagger and there was no doubt their ponies were the sleekest fittest and most expensive of all im sure you all know that trace coley the daughter of kevin coley chairman of doggie dins and our sponsor is south sussexs number one in the final today announced fatty harris kevin raised both clasped hands in a salute to acknowledge lukewarm cheers trace lifted her whip shes left her hair loose the little tart said perdita contemptuously thatll cost them the turnout prize even if they win everything else oh i wish ricky was here ladies and gentlemen said fatty harris i give you the pony club at the sight of these serried beautifully turnedout ranks this huge army with their polo sticks on their collarbones like bayonets a deafening cheer went up fathers rushed about with video cameras mothers wiped their eyes randy and merlin sherwoods beautiful mother adjusted her mascara in the driving mirror and eyed rupert campbellblack whod just rolled up alone in a dark green ferrari to watch his daughter tabitha play in the first final for the underfourteens rupert whod just been appointed tory minister for sport eyed mrs sherwood back then suddenly out of the sky like a vast whirring hornet came a black helicopter perdita gave a gasp as it landed to the west of the pitch the door flew open and like a page from nigel dempster out jumped the carlisle twins seb carrying decorum their bull terrier and dommie helping out a redhead and a blonde whose skirts immediately blew above their heads to show off wonderful suntanned legs they were followed by dancer in dark glasses and black leather twinkle and paulie each with an alsatian and finally perdita gave a scream of delight by ricky with little chef in his arms now members of the pony club will you please walk off the pitch exhorted fatty harris we owe it to the cowdray ground and to lord cowdray to walk off in the past the temptation to gallop across the hallowed cowdray turf which so many of them were not going to have the chance to play on had been too much for the teams dreadful stampedes had resulted with the whole field being cut up before a ball had been hit which had resulted in turn in threats of not being allowed back the sight of ricky however was too much for perdita im here she screamed and digging her heels into hermia went straight into a gallop towards the helicopter followed by yelling pony club members who fortunately veered off to the left and didnt trample the new arrivals to death disgraceful spluttered sukey she should lose her scholarship for that drew shrugged the sooner shes packed off to new zealand away from ricky the better seeing her master hermia ground to a halt and whinnied with pleasure little chef leapt up and licked her nose jumping off perdita threw herself into dancers arms hugged the twins and then turned more shyly to ricky her heart was crashing around like big ben about to strike thank you so much i never thought itd make so much difference she gabbled ricky put up a hand and touched her cheek hermia looks well he said and much hhhappier she shakes hands for a polo now said perdita youd better win weve all got money on it said dancer can you get that crate of moët out he added to twinkle the twins who had only left the pony club two years ago pushed off to see their old chums everyone else landed up beside drews landrover soon the autograph hunters were swarming round drew bas and dancer it broke perditas heart that ricky whod only been out of topclass polo for three years was totally ignored what a lovely shirt said sukey to bas where did you get it marks and spencer i think said bas there you see sukey chided drew im always telling you theres no need to go to harvie and hudson seeing the flash of anger in drews eyes bas tactfully enquired after the baby hed forgotten what sex it was oh jamies at home said sukey im amazed how drew dotes on him men love having a boy dont they she turned to ricky it matters so much to a man having an heir for a second as rickys face went dead bas and dancer exchanged horrified glances isnt that tabitha campbellblack playing for the east cotchester said bas as a tiny figure jaw thrust out white sticklike legs flailing thundered down the boards come on tabitha man man man screamed the tiny figure to the east cotchester number three take the fucking man for christs sake the umpire blew his whistle thatll be forty against you for swearing young lady consider yourself lucky you havent been sent off bellowed on by her father tabitha scored three goals and east cotchester won the handley cross leaning against the landrover daisy drew rupert goodness he had a beautiful face then she drew ricky with his sombre slanting dark eyes and then drew twice trying not to make him too handsome in pencil she could never capture the blueness of his eyes having sketched bas as a merry restoration rake she had a crack at sukey not easy sukeys charm was all in her colouring she had a long face and such a naked forehead daisy found herself turning her into a polo pony id hide that if i were you looking up with a start daisy saw that ricky was actually smiling oh my god daisy ripped out the page very appropriate said ricky taking it from her im sure sukey turns on sixpence she has a turn if drew spends sixpence said bas peering over rickys shoulder bloody good thats brilliant of rupert im much better looking than that giggling daisy stuffed the page into her pocket ive done a couple of hermia in fact several she shoved the book at ricky he really was the most shymaking man ricky flicked through really looking youve got her even that little scar over her eye theyre marvellous keep them said daisy blushing i framed your cat you must come and see it you must come and have supper sometime daisy was staggered to hear herself saying it must be the vodka id like that said ricky and he always says no to philippa mannering thought daisy perhaps if he fancied perdita he saw her as a potential motherinlaw hello ricky said a shrill voice grinning up at him her two front teeth missing was tabitha campbellblack hello tab dyou know mrs macleod you played very well said daisy i know none of the others did tabitha who had all the beauty and arrogance of her father was now gouging out the centre of sukeys homemade fruitcake with both hands have you had a good camp asked ricky great i havent cleaned my teeth for a week theyll fall out no theyre used to it wheres your father chatting up randy sherwoods mother hes given beattie johnson the push which is a shame she never minded me getting into bed with her and daddy has he bought any new horses yes a stallion called lord thomas hes so good i hold the mares when he mates with them lord thomas is the perfect gentleman he always licks the mares afterwards unlike his father murmured ricky to daisy as tabitha scampered off the rutshire and the south sussex were warming up their ponies for the jack gannon the long wait had told on perditas nerves think positive she said through clattering teeth mike waterlane was grey i dont know whats happened to daddy hopefully hes had a shunt said patrick lombard tightening his girths the pale yellow flowers of the travellers joy entwined in the hedgerows brought no happiness to david waterlane stuck behind a convoy of cars on the midhurst road which was held up by a huge lorry with a sign saying horses on the back bound to be showjumpers bloody yobbos said david waterlane apoplectically there was no way he was going to reach cowdray nor his sons match for the throwin the new lady waterlane having drunk threequarters of a bottle of bollinger and achieved two and a half orgasms was well content go for the girl ordered randy sherwood as south sussex rode on to the field mark her stupid bash the hell out of her once she loses her rag theyll all go to pieces i want on the scoreboard by halftime drew told rutshire and dont let randy get loose my son is one announced a large mother whose red veins matched her dress thats a lovely age is he crawling asked seb carlisles girlfriend shes talking about his handicap said sukey in a low voice and looked very disapproving when daisy started to laugh to a whirring of cinecameras and a gratifying clicking of nikons enid coley progressed graciously into the stands noone could see a thing round her big spotted hat kevin coley was busy supervising four different video cameramen to capture traces every stroke of genius on the field seeing dancer and drew talking to mrs sherwood and rupert and being a terrible star fucker he barged into the group let the best man win he smirked at drew well it certainly wont be you drawled rupert mrs sherwood turned and smiled at kevin after all he was picking up her sons expenses do you know dancer maitland and rupert campbellblack kevin rather too well said the new minister for sport his eyes like chips of ice shut up said drew out of the corner of his mouth i hope hes going to sponsor me i wouldnt advise it went on rupert not lowering his voice at all kevin sponsored a friend of mine a few years ago and took over his wife if youre going into business with kev id slap sukey into a chastity belt pronto that is quite uncalled for spluttered kevin theyre about to throwin come on rutshire shouted bas filling up everyones glasses why are you wearing that wrist brace merlin asked randy as he lined up behind justin lombard too much wanking said mike waterlane going bright pink at his own daring i dont need to wank you little pipsqueak snapped randy nodding and smirking in traces direction ive got the real thing i hope shes better at screwing than polo hissed perdita who like a cat waiting to spring was watching the umpires hand you bitch squealed trace the umpire who was having great difficulty controlling his dapplegrey pony hurled the ball in hermia hated throwins it took all the strength of perditas frantically squeezing legs to stop her ducking out reaching over however she managed to hook randys stick so mike was able to tap the ball away thundering towards the centre of the field giving two south sussex players the slip perdita picked up a beautiful pass from mike skedaddled easily round paul hedley hit two glorious offside forehands towards goal before cutting the ball perfectly through the buttercupyellow goal posts up went the yellow flag thatll teach you to booze at lunchtime she said sweetly to randy as she cantered back after that randy really had it in for her taking a pass from patrick during the next chukka she set out once more for goal leave brayed a hoarse donkey voice behind her leave you bloody idiot for a fatal second perdita paused thinking it was mike shouting turning her head she saw it was randy sherwood imitating mike to muddle her and that he was the only player in pursuit and had now gained valuable distance the ball was ahead on her left as she stood up in her stirrups stretching over hermias nearside shoulder to hit the forehand her right leg automatically swivelled up in the air lined up along the south of the field the crowd could only see her left side one umpire was up the other end the other was too busy controlling his refractory pony to watch what randy was up to a second later he had neatly kicked her right stirrup out perdita mishit wildly and only by some miracle stayed in the saddle by which time randy had backed the ball upfield to merlin who scored bastard screamed perdita racing down the field twirling her stick in the air which was against the rules she also knew that she should have reported the foul to mike who would then make an official complaint to the umpire but she was too angry the fucking cheating bastard she screamed he kicked out my stirrup i what asked randy the picture of innocence the umpires conferred then like tweedledum and tweedledee in their striped shirts cantered over to the third man in the stands whod been gazing at mrs sherwood at the time and missed the incident altogether and who now waved his downturned palms back and forth to indicate no foul youve got to be joking said perdita hysterically bloody dirty cheat the umpires awarded a thirtyyard penalty to south sussex at the slowest most mocking handcanter randy sherwood circled and stroked the ball between the posts youre making things seriously easy for us he told a raging perdita as he cantered back despite dogged marking by rutshire the superior pony power of south sussex was beginning to tell they were sixfive ahead and drew and ricky had their heads together at halftime then as the rutshire ponies girths were loosened and they were washed down scraped and walked round by the grooms drew called a brief team meeting im going to swap you over he said youre going to number four justin and youre moving up to number two mike mike lowered the can of coke which hed been emptying down his parched throat i couldnt ill never hold randy randys got a slower pony in this chukka who wont like dopey taking a piece of him in the lineout one bit it was a wise change randys late night and heavy lunch were telling on him he was not seeing the ball so well like a fly on an open sore mike harassed him the way randy had harassed perdita earlier and was too busy to notice that his father had finally arrived randy got so mad he slashed mike across the knuckles with his stick the umpire whod finally got control of his pony gave rutshire a penalty taking it mike hit the post but a hovering patrick lombard slammed it in six all the cheering was now nonstop perdita had the line and was cantering a wilting hermia down the boards her roan coat turned the colour of red cabbage with sweat her breath coming in huge gasps ahead the ball was bumping and slowly losing momentum over the divots and paul hedley the south sussex number four was galloping over to ride her off and back the ball up the field what was that fake shed practised with ricky and dancer last week she checked a grateful hermia paul checked his big black thoroughbred perdita checked hermia even harder paul followed suit filled with the devil perdita swung hermia even closer to the boards so the ponies nearside hooves were scraping the paint off and paul whod been instructed to mark perdita at all costs stayed with her for a second his mind was off the ball leaving it free for patrick lombard to belt in and whip it away dribbling it for a few yards then powering it to mike who relishing his new freedom at number two took it up field merlin whod been covering for paul and protecting the south sussexs goal cleared once again but perdita blocked his shot she could have tried for goal but mike had an easier shot so she gave him a lightning nearside undertheneck pass the whole ground groaned as mike hit the post like chrissie evert executing an effortless backhand crosscourt volley at wimbledon perdita shot forward and whacked the ball home sevensix rutshire were in the lead the ground erupted flat caps were being hurled in the air horns tooted there were fifteen seconds left of play we cant go to extra time drew muttered to ricky our ponies have had it realizing this randy shook off mike at the throwin and raced off to level the score look at the ground opening up for randy sherwood said fatty harris watch him going into overdraught whoops i mean overdrive can randy make it seven all randy felt he could with sherwood arrogance he lifted his stick for the copybook cut shot next moment perdita streaking down the field had thrown herself out of the saddle and clinging with her left hand round hermias damp hot neck hooked randy as the final bell tolled for south sussex the crowd went crazy ouch howled ricky oh my god gasped daisy letting him go was that your bad arm nothings bad at this moment said ricky triumphantly bloody marvellous yelled drew i knew theyd win easy crowed dancer swap jerseys with me i dare you said merlin sherwood to perdita without missing a beat she whipped off her prussianblue shirt to show a flash of white breast and brownypink nipple before she dived into merlins olivegreen jersey did you see that said sukey in a shocked voice to brigadier canford indeed i did said the brigadier wish id brought binoculars damn fine little player stripped to the waist brown from the zimbabwe sun randy rode up to perdita to shake her hand grabbing it he pulled her towards him for a second she felt his hot strong sweaty body against hers then he kissed her well played you stuckup little bitch he whispered ill get you in the end next minute perdita had slapped him across the face fuck off you great oaf she screamed laughing randy cantered off trace coley whod lost a match and a lover in as many minutes burst into tears dismounting to rest hermia perdita walked off the field straight up to ricky was it ok it was the first time shed seen him look really happy it was ffucking wonderful oh god thought daisy he mustnt smile at her like that hes utterly irresistible kevin and enid coley were slightly compensated by the barrage of cameramen particularly one from the tatler who photographed them talking to lord cowdray and later handing out prizes and cups tabitha campbellblack was livid because she won a bag of baileys performance mix horse feed rather than a tshirt with a picture of a polo pony on the front im sure your performance isnt at all mixed murmured rupert to mrs sherwood who seemed to have accepted south sussexs defeat with great equanimity the brazilian lover was looking increasingly disconsolate the prizegiving was supposed to be compèred by fatty harris but having taken so many nips while he was commentating he had to pop into the portaloo immediately after the match he then had the humiliation of being locked in and towed away with all the pony club screaming with delight at the sight of his vast rednosed anguished face and hammering fists at the window horse boxes and cars were already driving off as trace coley looking sexy in her fathers panama sauntered up to receive a body brush and a blue rosette as one of the runnersup in the jack gannon hastily scribbling out his copy for the times on the bonnet of his car jnp watson wrote the star of the side however was seventeenyearold perdita macleod the rutshire number one who scored three goals working at richard francelynchs yard for the past two years she showed much of the old francelynch magic and must be regarded as high goal potential and finally announced brigadier canford we come to the mary tyler award for the most promising girl player daisy watched an expectant trace coley rearranging her panama in the driving mirror of her fathers rolls as brigadier canford put on his spectacles to have a better look then he beamed with delight which goes to perdita macleod for a second perdita froze as the reluctant cheers began to crescendo and stuffed her fists in her eyes fighting back the tears then immediately pulling herself together she strolled up and thanked kevin and brigadier canford very sweetly for her polo stick before flicking a very obvious vsign at trace on the way back immediately drew took her aside will you bloody well pull yourself together nonstop swearing stripping off on the field making vsigns at the sponsors daughter i saw you do you want that scholarship or not after all the trouble your mothers taken driving you round the country why the hell are you deliberately trying to hurt her so well no more go alandroving so late into the night sang daisy five minutes later as dizzy with pride and vodka she weaved back to drews boot looking for her bag and went slap into drew the coleys have asked us back for drinks at château kitsch thats worth seeing anyway he said but lots of potential patrons will be there and the pony club committee so it could be useful to perdita theyve just confirmed her scholarship by the way but dont tell her or she might blow it its nothing to cry about i dont know how to thank you and ive got nothing to wear mumbled daisy you look fine no onell change daisy wished just for once that drew could see her when she wasnt looking awful are ricky and dancer going theyve gone home rickys just been even ruder to kevin than rupert was told him he didnt want to accept hospitality from patrons who go round cuckolding their players it gave him a ghastly feeling of déjà vu does kevin know what déjà vu means he does now and enids hopping half an hour later enid had calmed down at least on the surface and changed into her aquamarine lurex hostess gown as her hair had been squashed down by her david shilling spotted hat she put on her prettiest blond wig with the tendrils over the forehead drenched in shalimar wearing her pearls because her diamonds might make people whod been unable to change feel underdressed enid awaited her guests radiating regality i didnt realize it was going to be a tented wank said drew as sukey applied a dash of pink lipstick it was not yet dusk but the drive up to kevins mock tudor house was lined with litup toadstools the front door was flanked with the famous moggie meal cat and the doggie dins terrier six foot high and floodlit they winked mewed and yapped when the door bell was rung inside maids in black took coats for tickets and told everyone to go through the lounge as mrs coley was receiving in the pool area perdita listened to her mother grinding gears and going on and on and on about how marvellously perdita had played and how it had been the proudest moment of her life and how everyone from rupert to brigadier canford said what a great future she had and drew this and drew that and of course being daisy she was quite unable to resist telling perdita the thrilling news which she mustnt tell anyone that shed got the scholarship just think she raved on as they drove past honeysuckled hedges and trees covered with reddening apples six months in new zealand hot springs and kiwis and daisy couldnt remember anything else about new zealand oh yes maoris of course maori maori quite contrary said perdita gloomily why wasnt she flying back to robinsgrove with dancer and ricky she didnt want to go to new zealand shed die if she was parted from ricky for five minutes hed been so lovely and her shoulder still burned where hed put a hand on it after the game if she stayed in england with him shed learn much faster than shovelling horseshit in new zealand and being made to get up early in the morning getting up early was only worth it if she were going to see ricky i wonder if youll be in south island or north island said daisy narrowly avoiding ramming the car in front which had braked suddenly oh shut up mum i want to think by the pool at château kitsch which was as blue as enid coleys hostess gown trace whod changed into a slinky black dress was having a row with randy sherwood how dare you kiss perdita macleod in front of everyone she hissed because i want to screw her said randy unrepentantly i bet shes a virgin and shed be volcanic in the sack perdita had just walked in she was still wearing muddy breeches black socks and merlins polo shirt her hair was scraped back in a pony tail her face was smeared with mud what was the point of tarting up if ricky wasnt there ignoring randys imperious wave she walked over to talk to mike waterlane on the edge of the pool knowing there was a possibility of kevin sponsoring drew sukey was chatting up enid coley perdita remembered sukey being just as deferential to grace alderton three years ago the first time shed seen ricky in the flesh i cant go to new zealand she thought the food being handed round was quite awful muesli sticks unsalted nuts prunes figs sliced bananas huge jugs of fruit juice were being pressed on guests rather than booze randy sherwood edged up to perdita my mothers just gone off with rupert campbellblack he said i think he is the coolest guy in the world and the richest i wouldnt mind him as a stepfather reaching out for a vegetarian scotch egg and hurling it at his brother randy added casually will you have dinner with me tonight but perdita wasnt listening she was far too engrossed in sukeys conversation with enid coley when one thinks of the number of miserably displaced children from broken homes whove been given a sense of purpose by the pony club sukey was saying then lowering her voice take perdita macleod she was a little horror when drew took her over but look how she played today given one or two shocking lapses of behaviour snorted enid coley mind you it cant have helped working all this time for ricky francelynch he is the rudest most arrogant man ive ever met i mean who does he think he is i totally understand his little wife going off with bart alderton kevin and bart do a lot of business together he did lose a child said sukey because he was drunk from all bart says he was rude and arrogant before that thats what stopped him getting to the top what did you say said an icy voice beneath the mud smears perdita was as white as a new polo ball she was shaking with rage there was fifthdegree murder in her eyes sukey started oh perdita id no idea you were there we were saying said enid without looking over her hefty lurex shoulder that ricky francelynchs personality stopped him getting to the top well youre going to the bottom you disgusting old bag screamed perdita and the next moment she had butted enid in the small of a very large back right into the swimmingpool jumping in after her perdita pulled off enids wig to reveal scant grey wisps and pushed her under the water where the aquamarine hostess gown billowed up to display fawn pop socks at the end of fat purple legs how dare you slag off ricky screamed perdita how dare you how dare you everyone was shouting there were even some cheers next minute kevin drew and randy sherwood who was laughing his handsome head off had jumped into the pool and were trying to prise perdita away stop it said drew pinning her arms behind her back and grimly increasing the pressure until she gasped with pain and let go did you hear what she was saying about ricky she cried hysterically youre not helping him by behaviour like this snapped drew for a second perdita struggled with him then watched with mixed emotions by sukey daisy and a drenched randy sherwood she collapsed sobbing in his arms no one understands ricky like i do ricky was so furious with perdita for deliberately sabotaging her scholarship that he gave her the sack even the sight of little chef and the ponies longingly looking out for her every morning didnt make him relent hes a hard man said plump louisa who also missed perdita dreadfully only the sullen scrawny frances was delighted at home perdita behaved more atrociously than ever before storming round the house refusing to get a job and screaming at violet and eddie when they returned bronzed from a month in la with hamish and wendy nor were matters helped by violet gaining ten as in her o levels losing a stone and getting her first boyfriend who rang her constantly at all hours of the night from beverly hills violet and eddie then went back to their respective boarding schools paid for by granny macleod which only stepped up perditas paranoia and jealousy at the end of september violet came home for a long weekend and perdita was so bloodyminded that in despair daisy escaped to harvest festival for an hour of peace eldercombe church was packed miss lodsworth who organized the flower rota had excelled herself huge tawny chrysanthemums big as setting suns gold dahlias like lions manes yellow roses sheaves of corn briar and elder glowing with berries all brought a glow to the ancient yellow stone every windowledge was crammed with apples gleaming like rubies vast vegetable marrows and pumpkins and more prosaically tinned fruit sardines and baked beans some joker had even added a tin of doggie dins daisy also noticed as she slid into an empty pew at the back that the church was unusually full of attractive women there was philippa mannering looking avid in a beautifully cut check suit and a brown beret at a rakish angle there was the pretty girl from the village shop wearing an emeraldgreen dress more suited to a wedding exotic scent mingled with the more religious smells of incense furniture polish and veneration putting paid to daisys hour of peace were also hoards of children clambering over pews chasing each other down the aisles punching their mothers and having to be repeatedly hushed for talking not children used to being brought to church thought daisy then she realized shed forgotten to kneel down when she came in and blushing sank to her knees oh please god she prayed shake perdita out of this ghastly mood and make her happy again and look after darling violet and eddie and gainsborough and ethel and please god if you think its right let me fall in love with a man who isnt married who falls in love with me and dont make it too long hell shed picked a pew next to the radiator shed be as red as those beetroots in the window in a minute please god dont make me so vain she asked scrambling to her feet with the rest of the congregation as the organ launched into we plough the fields and scatter then daisy twigged the reason for all those glammedup women far ahead in the francelynch pew poignant because he was the sole inhabitant stood ricky he was looking unusually smart in a pinstripe suit and a black tie which was the only colour hed worn since will died with the pile of huge marrows the whole service seemed like some ancient fertility rite with ricky the unattainable corn king whom everyone wanted he only is the maker of all things near and far bellowed miss lodsworth totally out of tune he paints the wayside flower he lights the evening star daisys eyes filled with tears what beautiful words would she ever find time to paint wayside flowers again ricky certainly lit the evening star for perdita she must ask him round for a drink the gay vicar who loved the sound of his own voice took a long time over the service and daisys thoughts started to wander tears filled her eyes again as she thought of the little gravestone in the churchyard in loving memory of william richard francelynch oh poor ricky daisy blew her nose on a piece of blue loo paper she felt even sorrier for him with that stammer when he went up to read the first lesson and had to announce that it came from the eighth chapter of deuteronomy a word which took him four goes his face was impassive his hands steady only the long pinstriped right leg shuddering uncontrollably betrayed his nerves now he was wrestling with the bit about god leading thee into the wwwilderness for forty years to humble thee and to ppprove thee comparing his grey frozen features with the carved stone angel beside the lectern looking at the long litup scar and the furrowed forehead as he wrestled with the difficult words daisy thought he didnt need to humble or prove himself any more she supposed because he was ostensibly lord of the manor he felt he had to do it dancer would have had much more fun daisy was sweating for him and as he stumbled over the word pomegranates she could feel the collective goodwill of the painted ladies in the congregation urging him home like the favourite in the grand national the vicar then took the text for his sermon from the second lesson god loveth a cheerful giver and was so carried away by his own rhetoric that he absentmindedly helped himself to most of the grapes hanging down from the top of the pulpit daisy was screwing up her courage to accost ricky and ask him for a drink after church when the vicar launched into the final prayer about being made flesh and she suddenly remembered the vast ox heart cooking in the oven for ethel which would burn dry if it wasnt taken out so she belted home anyway ricky had been buttonholed outside the church by the gay vicar and scores of eager ladies come to dinner this evening just kitchen sups philippa was saying im afraid ive got to work ricky said brusquely id simply love to said the vicar daisy was still giggling when she got home to snow cottage and made the mistake at lunch of telling perdita that ricky had read the lesson did you speak to him demanded perdita dropping her forkful of braised fennel with a clatter what did he say about me did you ask him for a drink i didnt get near him he was surrounded daisy was about to say by women but hastily changed it to by members of the congregation as i was leaving and i had to get back for ethels heart what about my fucking heart screamed perdita you dont give a shit that its broken youre so bloody wet one could grow waterlilies all over you and storming out of the kitchen slammed the door behind her why dont you stand up to her mum asked violet i must not cry daisy gritted her teeth after shed cleared up lunch she hoisted ethels huge ox heart out of its water on to the chopping board usually she got through cutting it up by fantasizing that she was christian barnard saving the life of francis bacon or lucian freud today it didnt work the tears started flowing again i mustnt go to pieces she whispered tomorrow ill be brave and ask ricky round for a drink fortunately the caring chauvinist was away the following day but rickys number was always engaged only when she checked with directory enquiries did she learn that the receiver was off the hook getting home from the office she found violet and perdita having another screaming match im not coming home at halfterm if shes here mum complained violet shes destroying all of us having cleaned her teeth washed put on a bit of makeup and brushed her hair daisy set out up the ride to robinsgrove the sun was sinking in a red glow the lights were coming out in eldercombe village once more daisy was knocked out by the fecundity of everything the blackthorn purple with sloes plump hazel nuts already shredded by squirrels elderberries shiny as caviar hanging like shower fittings from their crimson stems she ought to make elderberry wine then she wouldnt spend so much on vodka ethel bounced ahead crashing joyfully through the russet bracken then splashing and rolling in the stream spooking as ponies loomed out of the dusk ahead towered robinsgrove such a large house for one unhappy man i must be brave for perditas sake said daisy through chattering teeth as she pressed the door bell he can only tell me to eff off inside she heard frantic barking the door opened an inch yes said an incredibly unfriendly voice little chef had other ideas barging through the gap he hurled himself on ethel in a frenzy of tightly curled tailwagging then on tiptoe with excitement he danced round her licking her eyes and ears oh its you said ricky ccome in ethels soaking shes ok little chef seems to like her following him through the dark panelled and tapestried hall daisy noticed the telephone off the hook in the drawing room then froze ahead on the kitchen table lay a twelve bore ricky must be about to commit suicide she must get him out of the house i came to ask you to supper she babbled looking back into the drawing room you must come at once autumns awfully depressing it affects lots of people im sure thingsll seem better tomorrow ricky followed her gaze oh that accounts for the peace today i must have left it off the hook this morning rupert rang about a pony i went out to the yard to check some detail he replaced the receiver instantly it rang philippa trying to fix up a dinner date im working tonight snapped ricky and next week im going to argentina he slammed down the receiver fucking woman he was going to shoot himself and little chef thought daisy numbly i dont think you should be on your own she said in what she hoped was a calming voice i know youll never get over whats happened but nice things do happen they played invitation to the waltz on radio this morning she was speaking faster and faster edging towards the gun such a heavenly tune i played it at school and suddenly found myself waltzing round the kitchen then ethel leapt up and waltzed with me and i thought perhaps there is a life after hamish if you came to supper now you could watch television and violet learnt how to play poker in california shes teaching me we could have a game and perdita would love to see you her voice trailed off when she saw ricky looking at her in utter amazement what are you going on about daisy pointed nervously at the gun i think you should put that horrid thing away suddenly ricky smiled with genuine amusement it was as though the carved angel by the lectern had suddenly come to life you thought i was going to top myself ive been shooting partridge with rupert i was cleaning my gun look he held up his oily hands oh gosh said daisy appalled how stupid of me anyway you cant commit suicide with a twelve bore although theyre always doing it in books look he picked up the gun and held it to his temples ones arms simply arent long enough to pull the trigger daisy had gone absolutely scarlet i was just worried with the telephone off the hook and all im quite ok said ricky slotting the gun back in its case and i would like to come to supper you would daisys jaw dropped all they had in the house was six eggs for scrambling and the remains of ethels heart as if reading her thoughts ricky said better still well go out oh no said daisy appalled i didnt mean that i wouldnt dream of foisting myself on you and the children are quite capable of looking after themselves i got my licence back last week so its a treat to drive someone im not dressed nor am i he was wearing faded olivegreen cords a check shirt and a dark brown jersey daisy would so like to have got tarted up but at least her hair was newly washed that morning and her teeth were clean but perdita would never forgive her for going out with ricky ill just wash he said and you can ring home daisy was desperately relieved to get violet who was wildly encouraging go for it mum hes gorgeous got yourself a decent date at last ricky took her to a french restaurant in rutminster with low beams scrubbed pine tables sawdust on the floor rooms leading one into another and mulberry red walls covered with hunting prints the head waiter enchanted to see ricky after three years absence kissed him on both cheeks enquired after his elbow and found him a quiet corner daisy was mildly encouraged that ricky deliberately sat on her right on his nonscar side he ordered her a large vodka and orange and perrier for himself at first the pauses were dreadfully long dyou miss not drinking very much he nodded im lousy at small talk and it helped couldnt you just drink occasionally when you need it like at parties once i start i cant stop like kinta he uncrossed a pair of knives i suppose you feel its a way of making sure it never happens again she flushed as red as the mulberry walls im sorry i shouldnt remind you ricky broke up a piece of brown bread but didnt eat it does it get better asked daisy not much the flame from a scarlet candle lit up the stubble darkening his chin and the even blacker rings under his eyes oh christ thats torn it thought daisy are you ready to order meester francelynch asked the head waiter the moules marinières are very very nice ill have that said ricky then turned to daisy oh help she thought one of the things that had driven hamish crackers was her inability to make up her mind no hurry said ricky give us a few more minutes id like mushrooms à la grecque said daisy quickly and to follow les perdreaux sont superbes we serve them stuffed with foie gras and cooked in madeira partridge explained ricky they do them very well here daisy nodded hastily id like that anything not to irritate and dont overcook them said ricky and well have a bottle of the number fourteen ill be plastered said daisy aghast noone could accuse me of being a halfbbbottle man said ricky what was your husband like very halfbottle very noblelooking very serious he thought i was too silly for words but he made it possible for me to keep perdita so ill always be grateful you miss him i miss all the things he did like policies and banks and keeping the children in order and i miss having a pair of arms round me its like being a house without a roof she was boiling shed have to take off her thick blue jersey soon and she couldnt remember how many buttons had come off the shirt underneath and it was sleeveless and she hadnt shaved her armpits since philippa asked her to supper last week its such a pity she gabbled on one cant go out and buy a new husband or wife the next day like you do with puppies or kittens im sure itd be much easier to help one get over things i dont want a new wife said ricky flatly no said daisy humbly thinking of poor perdita i can see that chessie was so beautiful ive seen pictures better in the flesh her colouring was so ppperfect it was my fault i neglected her i was foultempered and arrogant and polomad i never had any money to buy her the things she wanted she had you daisy wanted to say it was no good shed have to take her jersey off horrors two middle buttons were missing to show an ancient grey bra hastily she breathed in and clamped her arms to her sides to hide the stubble then seeing ricky looking at her in amazement said quickly bart alderton sounds hell hes a sadist said ricky as the waiter arrived with their first course thats why i must get her back and while the black mussel shells rose in the spare plate like cars on a scrap heap he told daisy about chessies last taunt but thats wonderful said daisy so romantic you can win the gold cup and the westchester and go to ten like the labours of hercules id rather do that than kill the hydra you must do it ricky passed daisy a mussel theyre very good i will if dancer has anything to do with it now theyve lifted the ban on my going abroad im off to argentina next month to squander his millions on some really good ponies perdita adored dancer said daisy these mushrooms are bliss in fact the whole thing is a real treat she took a huge gulp of wine how is she asked ricky casually suffering from massive withdrawal symptoms she misses you all she added hastily i miss her said ricky shes a menace but she makes me laugh i wish she occasionally made us laugh at home sighed daisy giving you a hard time is she ricky filled up daisys glass it was not in daisys nature to bitch but faced with rickys almost clinical detachment everything came pouring out perditas endless tantrums her impossible demands her spite to the other children i havent got many wits but im at the end of them that was lovely she handed her plate to the waiter hamish going affected her dreadfully they fought the whole time but underneath she was frantic for his love and approval who was her father its so shaming whispered daisy cant be that bad she was saved by the waiter shimmying up with the partridges making a great show of how pink they were inside pointing out the foie gras stuffing the celeriac purée and the exquisitely dark and glistening madeira sauce but the moment he left ricky returned to the attack so what happened being daisy she blurted it all out i should have told perdita years ago but im such a drip i funked it tears were flooding her face and she wiped them frantically away with the sleeve of her jersey aware a drama was taking place and dying to know if this was rickys latest the waiter sidled over everything all right meester franchlynch perfect now push off ricky put a hand over daisys a large rough hand with callouses beneath the base of each long finger from endlessly holding a polo stick you are a good mother he said gently i can read between perditas lies i know what sacrifices youve made working in that ghastly christmas pudding factory not buying any new clothes for years he picked up the frayed very pointed collar of her shirt i didnt know i was going out to dinner said daisy defensively course you didnt i dont know what to do with her daisy blew her nose on her redchecked table napkin then realized what shed done oh god ill wash it and send it back she needs polo said ricky but serious polo she ought to be playing ten chukkas a day with really good players and she ought to get miles away from you so she cant kick the shit out of you as he filled her glass again he knocked over the salt cellar and quickly chucked the spilt salt over his left shoulder are you painting not much daisy was pleating the edge of the tablecloth all my inspiration seems to have dried up since hamish left and i seem to have lost all my confidence as a woman not that i had much anyway in what way ricky was stripping the partridge leg with his teeth very white and even except a front one chipped by a polo ball come on eat up it is quite difficult cutting up a partridge when your elbows are glued to your ribs daisy started forking up celeriac last week i went to dinner at philippas she insisted shed got a lovely man for me but it was just as an excuse to get her latest lover into the house he wasnt remotely interested in me and brought philippa some goats cheese that looked like tutankhamuns brain they disappeared for hours to look at some rare book and lionel insisted on seeing me home her lip trembled im sorry this is awfully boring horror films arent boring said ricky and suddenly he leapt on me disgusting old goat ricky was comfortingly furious appropriate really he tasted of goats cheese ive never been very good at rejecting people so i told him i was frigid he just leered and said im a psychiatrist little girl i can cure that daisy gave a shudder ill chuck them out said ricky angrily joel says theyre model tenants said daisy theyre always cutting their lawn cant imagine lionel modelling anything youre not to have anything more to do with them understand ricky put his knife and fork together lets get back to perdita ill take her to argentina with me next week no its a good idea you know alejandro mendoza then with incredulity but hes the greatest back in the world the mendozas are blood rivals of the obrien brothers juan and miguel who used to play for david waterlane before the argies were banned they invariably end up on opposite sides in the argentine open im going out to buy ponies from alejandro he takes a few players every year on his estancia they bring on the young ponies and in return he teaches them my handicap went up in twos the winters i spent with him there are always young boys hanging round the place perdita needs a boyfriend ill leave her with alejandro till christmas we couldnt possibly afford the plane fare mumbled daisy dancerll pick that up he said he wants perdita to play for him next year shell add some muchneeded tone hes been nagging me to take her back for weeks he can just advance her some salary theres no need to cry im sorry daisy wiped her eyes on her sleeve again i ought to get the niagara falls award for bawling im just not used to lucky breaks are you sure positive now ruperts minister for sport he can fiddle her a visa as he smoothed back his dark hair his signet ring caught the light whats your motto she asked never surrender said ricky bleakly and he wont until he gets chessie back thought daisy threequarters of a bottle of wine had loosened her tongue ive been moaning on about perdita all evening but at least shes alive whereas will isnt said ricky watching the bubbles rise in his glass of perrier sufferings supposed to make you nicer didnt work for me thats probably why ive been so bloody to perdita the guilt still knocks me sideways just being alive sometimes i panic because i cant remember what he looked like chessie took all the photographs she needed them hed be six now old enough to start hitting a ball around it comes in waves doesnt it he glared at her look i really dont want to talk about it i just think you ought to try and forgive yourself mumbled daisy were like two chickens side by side trying to defrost she thought when are you coming back to england february or march i cant stand another english winter dancers fixed up for me to make a bomb coaching movie stars in palm springs my elbow still plays up when i play too long after that they talked about dancer and ethel and little chef and rickys ponies and drank so many cups of coffee and daisy even had a crème de menthe frappé that it was long after midnight when they left the colandered barbour said ricky holding out her coat for her youve been crawling through my barbed wire outside in the back of the bmw ethels great spotted goofy face was grinning out beside her his front paws on her shoulder tail wagging his small body into a frenzy was little chef its easy for dogs said daisy with a hiccup ive had such a lovely time she said as ethel fell on her in ecstasy and ethels lick is much more efficient than cleansing cream this road is awful said ricky as they bounced down the rough track to snow cottage i must get it fixed before the winter seeing all the lights on daisy quailed surely perdita wouldnt kick up when she knew she was going to argentina desperate ricky shouldnt think she was giving him the comeon she had the door open before the car stopped do come in and tell perdita shell be so excited she called back as she scuttled up the path if ricky was there perdita might not make a scene but he had paused to look at the front gate which needed mending perdita sat on the kitchen table dressed all in black she looked like a hell cat sloe eyes glittering teeth bared in a terrifying rictus grin body rigid with loathing darling the most heavenly news said daisy how dare you go out to dinner with ricky screamed perdita i bet his telephone wasnt off the hook at all you just wanted an excuse to vamp him you cant do without it you bloody old tart can you i bet you asked him out next minute ricky had walked into the room and slapped her across the face dont you ever talk to your mother like that again you revolting little bitch he howled now go to bed perdita gazed at him her white left cheek slowly turning bright scarlet her eyes widening in horror nothing wrong with your elbow if you can hit like that she spat shes poisoned you against me i knew she would i said go to bed said ricky harshly go on bugger off with a stifled sob perdita stumbled upstairs slamming the door so hard that every ornament in the house shook there was a pause then both ricky and daisy jumped at the sound of clapping slowly violet walked into the room i always heard how marvellous you were she said to ricky but id no idea how marvellous ive been waiting for years for someone to do that good said ricky unmoved then slowly he looked round the kitchen and the sitting room at the flowers painted all over the pale green walls like a meadow in summer at the dark green ivy crawling up the stairs and the bears and tigers and dragons decorating every piece of furniture christ he said in amazement i can always paint over it said daisy hastily its stunning you said you hadnt been painting stop shaking itll be all right should i go to her leave her to stew said violet and ricky in unison oh and by the way mum went on violet philippa rang and said could you man the bricàbrac stall on saturday no she cant snapped ricky i said you couldnt said violet gleefully i told her youd gone out to dinner with ricky she sounded put out oh goodness said daisy ive been hearing how marvellous you are said ricky drily to violet but id no idea how marvellous might put the bloody nympho off after hed had another cup of coffee he went up to see perdita she was crying great wracking despairing sobs into her pillow ricky sat down on her bed fuck off its me ricky fuck off even more i hate you you better stop sulking and apologize to your mother or i wont take you to argentina ill never apologize to her said perdita tonelessly what did you say how when week after next to stay with alejandro hell teach you a few manners and how to play polo properly oh thank you perdita flung her arms round his neck he could feel her hot soaked cheeks her wet hair her lips against his cheek the bars of her ribs the softness of her breasts the contrasting bullet hardness of her nipples and then can i come back to robinsgrove if you behave yourself still she clung he could feel her heart pounding she was so like chessie hed never wanted to screw anyone more in his life but gently he disengaged himself go and apologize to your mother next day the weather turned cold bitter winds systematically stripping the trees walking through rickys woods daisy noticed rubyred sticky buds thrusting out on the chestnuts although many of the trees still clung on to their shrivelled brown leaves like ricky and me clinging on to the past thought daisy ten days later ricky and perdita left for argentina i want to ask two fffavours said ricky as he put perditas suitcases in a boot crammed with polo sticks could you possibly put flowers on wills grave sometimes for me and if little chef goes into a real decline will you promise to ring me perdita hardly bothered to kiss her mother goodbye she hadnt forgiven her her night out with ricky the wireless blared i just called to say i love you as daisy went back into the house she couldnt help envying perdita it was a terribly long journey even though they broke it in florida ricky hardly took his nose out of a frederick forsyth novel perdita braless in a tshirt and a skirt that buttoned up the front for easy access writhed and burned beside him she cleaned her teeth every three hours and had juicyfruit continually at the ready in case he wanted to kiss her she deliberately got a bit drunk at dinner and when the lights were switched out let her head fall on to his shoulder im cold she murmured ill get you another blanket as he would for any of his ponies thought perdita bitterly im still cold she whispered half an hour later ricky put an arm round her shoulders but made no pass and eventually she fell asleep ricky gazed out of the window at stars as sleepless as himself if he slept he might have nightmares about will and chessie he couldnt bear to wake up screaming on the plane as he so often did alone at night at robinsgrove ricky got very uptight at miami airport when his polo sticks were nearly put on a plane to hawaii by mistake expect the poor things needed a holiday you work them hard enough said perdita but even ricky telling her not to be bloody silly couldnt douse her sudden euphoria at the sight of the ba stickers being stamped on their luggage she was going to argentina home of the greatest polo players and ponies in the world the buenos aires flight was delayed and the plane horribly hot but this didnt upset the passengers who seemed delighted to be going home the men very handsome and as many of them blond as dark gathered at the back of the plane embracing each other and eyeing perdita with approval and chattering like a great drinks party after a shamingly large second supper of chicken sweetcorn and cake a vast vodka and tonic and half a bottle of red wine at one oclock in the morning the chatter suddenly turned into the frogsmore stream running under snow cottage and she fell asleep until six to find the chatter going on as loud as ever women passengers whod nodded off in full makeup emerged with faces crumpled and ankles swollen for breakfast they were offered cake again this time with salt and pepper bearing in mind the vast divide between rich and poor in argentina they presumably let them eat cake all the time said perdita ricky didnt smile hed had another sleepless night and ahead lay customs who couldnt be expected to be exactly probritish and because of post and telephone strikes in argentina he hadnt been able to confirm the flight with alejandro so theyd have to go through the hassle of hiring a car to drive the kilometres out to his estancia perdita however was excitedly looking down on vast faded pink rivers curling through spinachgreen forest and the blue shadow of their plane lying across buenos aires now she could see red houses swimmingpools race tracks skyscrapers sticking up like teeth and roads and railways so uniformly crisscross they seemed like tiles on a vast kitchen floor rupert had also pulled some powerful strings after a lightning whip through immigration an official located all their luggage and polo sticks and whizzed them through customs as they came through the exit doors ricky looked wearily round for an avis sign perdita in a faded purple tshirt and sawnoff pale pink jeans was pleasantly aware of all the men staring unashamedly at her then a young man in a blue shirt rushed up to his arriving girlfriend with a huge bunch of hyacinths and daffodils abandoning the english winter perdita realized she and ricky had gone slap into the argentine spring next minute a tall blond boy with a bulldog jaw and massive shoulders walked up to them looking slightly apprehensive hi ricky he said in a deep florida drawl dont know if you remember me luke alderton if you want to hit me across the airport ill understand ok but im staying with alejandro thought you might like a ride out to the estancia for a second ricky glared at him then he smiled i never had any fight with you luke its incredibly kind of you to meet us on the offchance this is perdita perdita found her hand being engulfed in an incredibly strong grip and luke looked down at her grinning lazily and appreciatively what are you doing here asked ricky being used as cheap labour to break alejandros ponies said luke taking perditas suitcases from her in return for picking up a few tips from the master he pronounced it masster thank christ for that said ricky you can look after perdita shouldnt be too much of a hardship said luke then eyeing perditas slender arms but she better start pumping iron if shes going to play high goal as he sorted out the porter with amazingly fluent spanish perdita noticed he was wearing a bomber jacket with us open printed on the back whos he she whispered to ricky barts son by a previous marriage said ricky potentially the best back in the world within seconds theyd piled into a battered mercedes and were fighting their way out on to the airport road luke pointed to a red spotted scarf gathering dust up on the dashboard you may want to put that over your eyes the drivings kinda crazy here he said as ten cars hurtled forward with absolutely no lane discipline and all went straight through a red light with furious honking next moment a huge bus with jumbo el rapido on the side tore past overtaking and cutting in front christ muttered perdita good training for the polo here said luke the carlisle twins and my brother red were down here last week with victor kaputnik they came out of a restaurant and had a race with juan obrien and two of his cousins victor nearly had a triple bypass he jumped out of reds car yelling taxi taxi he was so frightened he wouldnt let the driver go across a green light in case he hit red and the twins coming the other way luke shook with laughter whos staying with alejandro asked ricky well one guy couldnt stand the pace and ray walter broke his wrist and went home and theres an argie angel solis de gonzales exmirage pilot trying to make it as a pro not wildly probrit understandably any good asked ricky awesome hes only been playing seriously for a couple of years said luke hardly flinching as a car cut right in front of him missing them by millimetres leaning out of the window he let loose a stream of abuse how come you speak such good spanish asked perdita last time i was here it rained for forty days the only answer was to learn spanish they say my accent is orrible but at least i can understand what theyre saying on the pitch and suss out their machiavellian little games they were into flat open country now perdita looked at the huge puddles reflecting a vast expanse of sky im really really here luke smiled you will fall madly in love with argentina he said in his deep husky voice which had a slight break in it with the wild life the birds the open spaces but you will find it unconquerable the extremes the ferocity the apparent heartlessness the hailstorms that can wipe out a crop in half an hour people own masses of land not developing it or working it its just there how very unamerican said perdita looking sideways at luke she decided that he wasnt at all goodlooking but definitely attractive a tawny giant with shoulders and arms like a blacksmiths he had lean hips more freckles than a gulls egg a snub nose sleepy honeycoloured eyes barts pugnacious jaw and redgold hair sticking up like a dandy brush he was also attractive because he was so reassuring on top of the dashboard was a poem called martin fierro and a spanish dictionary lying with its spine up to which he must have been referring as he waited its the great gaucho poem he told her martin fierros aim in life was to sleep on a bed of clover look up at the stars and live as free as a bird in the sky he put his horse and his dog a long way before his wife you dont look as though you read poetry said perdita in amazement and martins a very naff name for a gaucho ricky sharing the back with two polo helmets a new saddle and numerous carrier bags of shopping was beginning to relax hows alejandro probably had ten more kids since you were last here argentines adore their kids luke told perdita their big interest is the family they wont pay taxes and they never stop at red lights he put out a huge hand to shield perdita as a car shot out who are you playing for next year asked ricky hal peters the automobile king nice guy said luke thought about nothing but cars for the first twentyfive years of his life now he thinks about nothing but polo hes given me a free hand to buy horses but every time i show any interest alejandro quadruples the price i guess im lucky to be working young american players are really feeling the cold at the moment they cant get sponsorship because all the patrons think its chic to have an argie on their side your father has three said ricky bleakly whats reds handicap now six should be higher he hates to stick and ball his mother allowed him to sit out college for a year and he never went back he won mvp awards most valuable player he explained to perdita all summer then blows it by testing positive for drugs the day before the us open gets suspended and fined is he coming down here well hes always expected like the messiah luke grinned at perdita my kid brothers kind of wild like richard cory he glitters and flutters pulses as he walks look heron on the edge of that alfalfa field with the amazing eyesight that had helped him become a great player luke pointed out egrets storks and even a snake that whisked into its hole before perdita could see it passing through a town perdita noticed someone had painted a blueandwhite flag and a malvinas belong to argentina slogan on the plinth of a statue of a general for christs sake keep your trap shut about the falklands when we get there said ricky alejandros not antibrit said luke he likes anyone he can sell horses to he still talks mistily about cowdray and guards and the parties and the hospitality and the women you didnt have to date twentytwo times before laying them they were deep in the country now driving through absolutely flat land like a table top slowly perdita was trying to absorb the immensity of the pampas the vast unclouded duckeggblue semicircle of sky like a protractor on the horizon was only broken by the occasional windmill or fringe of acidyellow poplars or milkgreen gum trees the grass seemed to flow on for ever like a millpond sea occasionally like a liner they passed an estancia with stables and a drive flanked by poplars and sailed on at last luke swung on to a dirt road potted with huge holes his left elbow sticking out of the window was soon spattered with mud as they shattered vast puddles reflecting the blue of the sky sorry he said as perdita nearly hit the ceiling you should have taken a sleeping pill on the right was a sunlit village with square white houses like a western shanty town this place is called general piran after some top brass who defended his country against the marauding british its the nearest civilization to alejandros place explained luke thats the phone exchange which never works thats the fire station theyve got two fire stations but all the houses are so far away they never get there in time the teachers are all on strike hardly surprising when theyre only paid a hundred dollars a month so all alejandros kids are at home getting under their mothers feet he is nice thought perdita how did anyone as vile as bart produce a son like that alejandros land begins here at the water he pronounced it wotturr he owns everything in front of us as far as the eye can see they had swung into an avenue lined with gums their stark white trunks rising like pillars at the end on the left was a stickandball field a polo field covered with gulls paddocks full of polished horses then a group of red modern buildings barns to the right grooms quarters to the left alejandros straight ahead said luke as he drove up to a large ugly mulberryred house with flowerbeds full of clashing red tulips primulas and wallflowers and a water tower completely submerged in variegated ivy instantly out of the front door charged a man a foot smaller than luke but with a barrelchest as big he had a huge beethoven head of black curls a brown face scorched with wrinkles by an unrelenting sun small dark eyes and a smile like a slice of water melon which showed a lot of gold fillings he wore old jeans espadrilles and a torn blue tshirt through which spilled a lot of black chesthair throwing open his arms he gave a great roar of laughter el orgulloso he shouted el orgulloso mountain everest he come to mahomet at last and he folded ricky in a vast hot embrace welcome we are so please to see you then peering round the side of rickys arm he caught sight of perdita and his little black eyes brightened even more and this is perdita she is certainly very ok seizing her hand he looked her up and down why you waste your life on polo find a nice billionaire instead i want both said perdita alejandro gave another bellow of laughter good girl good girl i speak very well english dont you theenk come and see my ponies about to lead them back towards the stables he lowered his voice and said to luke did you get it luke nodded and getting a red jewel box out of his jeans pocket handed it to alejandro just before a beautiful woman came out of the house she had heavy lids above huge dark mournful eyes a wonderful sculptured aquiline nose a big sad red mouth and long shiny blond hair with dark roots showing down the middle parting she also had a wonderful bosom a thickening waist and very slim brown legs in leather sandals reeky she hugged him it has been so long and this must be perdita a shadow of apprehension crossed her face immediately replaced by a warm and welcoming smile what a beauty she said kissing perdita on both cheeks i am claudia alejandros wife let me show you your room you must be tired nonsense said alejandro she as come alfway across the world protested claudia to see my horses said alejandro they went across a lawn down an avenue of mulberry trees past a thickly planted orange grove to ide the chickens explained alejandro to the right a lot of youths building a swimmingpool eyed perdita with interest alejandro snapped at them to get on with their work the stables were far more primitive than perdita expected a few words in spanish had been painted on the tackroom roof it says please dont tether any horses to this roof or theyll pull it off translated luke dancers latest hit single girl guide was belting out of the tack room a pack of emaciated lurchers with burrs in their rough dusty coats charged forward whimpering and weaving against perditas legs but as she bent to cuddle them a small boy brushing down a pony picked up a lump of mud and hurled it at the dogs to drive them off perdita was about to yell at him when her attention was distracted by a man with a cruel leathery face wearing gaucho pants and a white shirt who was galloping a pony very fast round a tiny corral the horses nostrils were vastly inflated and it was panting rhythmically as its hooves struck the hard ground the mans control was undeniable she could hear the horse groan as he squeezed it with his calves thats raimundo the peticero master of the horse said luke with a slight edge to his voice looks a nasty piece of work work isnt the operative word hes acting busy because alejandros here in the yard an old man in a beret was clipping a ponys mane the pony was rolling its eyes but stood motionless because a young boy relentlessly twisted its ear other horses wandered loose among the gum trees while still others were muzzled and tied up they looked very thin but wellmuscled theyre playing this afternoon explained luke argentines dont feed or water their horses eight hours before a match i guess they are thin but again argentines dont like their horses to carry a lot of weight perdita grew increasingly bootfaced when every pony she tried to cuddle cringed away with terror theyre all headshy she complained furiously shut up said luke youre here to learn not beef fortunately alejandro was concentrating on ricky boasting that every pony in the yard had been entirely responsible for clinching last years argentine open they were distracted by a boy in his twenties cantering into the yard on a beautiful red chestnut he had a bony tortured face angry slanting peacockblue eyes bronze curls and a sallow complexion wow thought perdita angel yelled alejandro breeng that mare ere i want reeky to see er then with a touch of malice these are my friends reeky and perdeeta isnt she beautiful wont she need the charity belt angel pulled up in horror and a cloud of dust growled something incomprehensible but undeniably insulting threw down the reins kicked his right foot out of the stirrup and swinging it over the horses withers jumped to the ground and ran into the house zat is angel said alejandro with a shrug still fighting zee falklands war amazing cooking smells were drifting from the kitchen seeing perdita beginning to wilt luke took her back to the house ricky and alejandro had to be dragged away from the horses to a lunch laid out on a blueandwhite checked tablecloth under the gum trees they needed two tables to accommodate the ten children ranging from twentyone downwards there were three boys patricio maria luis maria and lorenzo maria followed by three ravishing plump girls followed by four more boys the youngest being little pablo who was three all had the dark eyes and dark curls of their father claudia exclaimed in delight over the presents ricky had brought which included a dark red cashmere jersey a length of harris tweed a striped silk turnbull and asser dressing gown and a herbert johnson tweed cap for alejandro then she introduced her children to perdita dont warry said alejandro with his great laugh i dont recognize them myself sometime only the ones that play polo said claudia without rancour have a wheesky ricky said alejandro brandishing rickys dutyfree bourbon then when ricky shook his head but you used to dreenk half a bottle before chukkas it was your petrol ive changed luke asked alejandro not if ive gotta play this afternoon said luke sitting down next to perdita you are because im not said alejandro splashing whisky into his glass the oppositions very weak today he explained to ricky but luke is a good back i must look after my laurel two silent maids served them perdita felt too tired to eat but when she tried her steak it was pure poetry tender as velvet juicy as an orange and so exploding with flavour that she was soon piling her plate with potato purée tomato salad and geraniumred barbecue sauce i cant believe this food she said to claudia five minutes later its wonderful we in argentina are very like the breetish except in their cooking which is orrible said alejandro who was now wearing both his new dressing gown and the tweed cap over his black gollywog curls i like to dress like an englishman the talk was all of polo claudia didnt contribute and concentrated on the younger children i love to play again in england alejandro said to ricky when you theenk the ban will be lifted i dont know sighed ricky who was eating hardly anything prince charles is colonel of the welsh guards which makes it very difficult for him and theres the security problem that is a point said alejandro looking round wheres angel not ungry said claudia trying to force potato purée into little paolo not ungry angry angel he explained to ricky was an exmirage pilot he ate the english but when he gets to know perdita alejandro smiled at her from under the peak of his cap he will forgeeve perdita having taken far too much was now feeding the rest of the steak to the shaggy lurchers who ringed the table but kept their distance theyre so thin she protested to alejandro raimundo dont feed them they live on hares and badgers they catch out in the pampas perdita didnt think she could eat another thing but the figs in syrup that followed were so delicious she was soon piling on great dollops of cream angel is stupid went on alejandro the rest of us in argentina ave forgiven you for the falklands war oh good said perdita brightening up why is that because of benny hill said alejandro we love heem and all those lovely girls with no clothes on i love eenglish programmes upper stairs down stairs the only thing i watch else is polo on cable and weve got a veedeo of last years open ill show it to you reeky and you can point out all the ponies youve just showed me who allegedly played in it said ricky drily alejandro giggled some was previous year our doctor has tiny plane that was conscripted during the malvinas war said claudia the military say they want to fly rockets on it but when they see ow small it was it didnt get called up all the food parcels people sent us from abroad was stolen by the post office said alejandro what heavenly people thought perdita theyre so merry and funny the spearshaped leaves of the gum tree were dappling their faces as the sun moved towards the andes a dragonfly was bombing the table luke pointed out a stork black and white between the silver trunks beyond the pampas seemed to swim in the midday heat ow long are you weeth us reeky asked claudia whod had a secret crush on him in the old days and was appalled to see how grey and tense he looked probably the day after tomorrow but you said youd stay a week said perdita in horror where are you going next asked luke palm springs thats great said luke my halfsister bibis out there working in la you must call her she doesnt get out enough shes on a zero handicap but shed play super if she played more whos your patron now reeky asked alejandro dancer maitland chipped in perdita proudly alejandro nearly fell off his seat all the mendoza children were roused out of their pallid apathy you get his autograph you send us records he numero uno this week is he nice please breeng im ere hes a sweet man admitted ricky but hes very busy and has difficulty even finding time to stick and ball you stupid bitch he murmured furiously under his breath to perdita now alejandroll quadruple his prices please stay reeky pleaded claudia you need a holiday let us pamper you let them pampas you said perdita bitterly she loves him thought luke perdita was very pale now her skin the parchment colour of her whiteblond mane shell be like a little palomino when she turns brown he thought have a siesta claudia urged her as theyd finished coffee no i want to look at the ponies with ricky said perdita frantic not to miss a minute just for an hour we all do said claudia soothingly upstairs feeling utterly suicidal perdita looked round her tiny bare room the only furniture was a wardrobe a chest of drawers with no lining paper a straightbacked wooden chair and a narrow single bed with a carved headboard there was an overhead light with no lampshade and a bedside lamp on the floor which didnt work the only colour came from a picture of a gaucho cracking a whip a tiny red mat and a shocking pink counterpane she ought to unpack but she only got as far as getting out rickys photograph in its blue silk frame and putting it beside the bed the thought of all those blonde movie stars in palm springs pursuing him made her feel quite sick shed gone off luke since he suggested ricky ring his sister shed just lie on the bed for a minute did she imagine it or did a head of bronze curls pop round the door and were a pair of peacockblue eyes gazing at her with implacable hatred then the door slammed shut and next moment she was asleep waking the next morning she was outraged that theyd left her to sleep luke and alejandros three eldest sons had won their match the teachers had suddenly ended their strike and the four youngest children had gone back to school ricky exhausted but elated after haggling all night with alejandro had bought eight horses perdita not in the best mood after a cold shower found him having breakfast you promised to wake me you needed sleep he poured her some black coffee sulkily she added milk and buttered a croissant nice family said ricky very said perdita im not sure about that angel he looks as though he wants to exocet me lukell look after you said ricky look im leaving at teatime catching the eight oclock flight you cant said perdita hysterically ive got the horses i need lukes going to get them into america from there well fly them to england but why so early for christs sake alejandros got business in buenos aires hes giving me a lift to the airport whatever alejandros business was in ba it necessitated a silk shirt light grey trousers a jacket hanging from a coathanger in the back of the car his herbert johnson cap and about fifteen pints of aramis perdita cried unashamedly after they left fleeing to her bare room and hurling herself down on the pink counterpane half an hour later there was a knock on the door bugger off she howled it was luke poor baby feeling homesick no ricky sick sobbed perdita i cant live without him luke sat down on the bed and put a huge arm round her youll see him in less than three months thats a whole school term i dont want it she snapped as he handed her a large vodka and tonic then took such a huge gulp that she nearly choked isnt ricky kind of old to play florizel asked luke not having a father im only attracted to older men said perdita i used to heroworship the guy when he played for my father said luke he was awesome i watched him yesterday hell be as good as ever when his elbow heals he must go to ten all hes interested in is getting bloody chessie back shes not bloody hows she getting on with your ghastly father pretty happy i guess doesnt appear to be in any hurry to quit perdita sat up blew her nose and looked at him with red swollen eyes jolly odd having a stepmother the same age as you dyou fancy her couldnt help it at first but weve become friends her marrying dad didnt screw me up like the other two red and bibi have given her hell serve her right she lost a kid said luke reasonably does she still miss will yeah but she wont show it like ricky hes so good at bottling things up he ought to work in a ketchup factory luke picked up rickys photograph you gotta treat being down here as a chance to learn polo meet them halfway and youll improve out of all recognition and youll like it here its kinda fun how come youre so nice asked perdita luke yawned my brother reds betterlooking than me he gets all the girls very good for the character dinners about ten ill boil up some water so you can have a shower what time do we get up here six oclock and on the horses by seven god said perdita appalled what else do we have to do shift the cattle work the horses stick and ball come back for lunch an hours siesta and you go out like a light i can tell you then we play chukkas in the afternoon at least you wont be roped in to build the swimmingpool he left her not much happier she tried to sleep but she was desperately nervous about tomorrow what if she made a complete fool of herself and let ricky down at least he wouldnt be here to witness it she felt twitchy about that vile angel who hovered shadowy in the background waiting to perform some dreadful mischief she started violently at a knock on the door frantically wiping her eyes she went to answer it and found luke with only a small towel round his waist for a terrifying moment perdita thought he was going to pounce on her instead the bulldog face creased into a huge smile honey i am absolutely shitscared of spiders and theres the biggest sonofabitch in the shower could you possibly remove it for me giving a scream of laughter perdita felt better luke alderton had been only three years old when bart dumped his mother for grace and his first memories were of tears and endless shouting grace had proceeded to have two children red and bibi whom she and bart adored and spoilt impossibly grace however tended to ignore luke when he came to stay doing her duty without love or warmth then his mother had married again to a pt instructor who beat luke up so badly that a court ruled he should go and live with bart full time here he had always felt an outsider at eighteen because they wouldnt let him read polo at yale he chucked up any thought of an academic career determined to be utterly independent of bart he slowly worked his way up starting as a groom and finally getting his own yard buying ponies cheap off the race track or from other players who couldnt get a tune out of them making them and selling them on which he detested because he got so fond of them invariably riding green ponies his handicap at six was lower than it should have been he didnt have the natural ability of his brother red but he was bigger and stronger you didnt want to be in the way when luke hit the ball because hed missed out on higher education and because he could seldom afford to go out on the town with the other players he spent his evenings listening to music and devouring the classics on long journeys in the lorry hed keep the rest of the team entertained reciting great screeds of poetry longfellow macaulay whole scenes from shakespeare now even bits of martin fierro in an orrible accent all the argentines adored him and nicknamed him señor gracias because he was so grateful for the smallest favour it was the same in the states he was always in work because he was cheerful absolutely straight and very good company but although he smiled in the face of the direst provocation underneath he was as determined as ricky to go to ten after such a lousy start in life and not a penny of the alderton millions people often expressed amazement that he was so unchippy the answer was always the same theres nothing to be gained from blaming your background or other people youve got to get out and help yourself a second after perdita fell asleep it seemed luke was banging on the door telling her to get up and to wear a sweater as it was cold first thing out in the yard alejandro had turned from the charming rogue of yesterday into a roaring tyrant bellowing instructions to all the boys in the corral the ponies waited mostly chestnut all young and timid ducking nervously behind each other to avoid being caught when alejandro yelled at perdita to tack up a little chestnut gelding she was so nervous she could hardly do up the throat lash or adjust the stirrups once up she felt she was straddling an eel every male from the neighbouring estancias except luke who was off moving the cattle seemed to be gathered round the paddock to watch her as she set off in the milky misty morning light towards a row of poplar trees alejandro shouted after her to do turns at the canter ill show them she thought shoving her nose in the air dont jibe at me argentina reaching the middle of the field she laid the nearside rein on the chestnuts neck to tell him to go right instantly he did a lightning uturn and set out back to the stables leaving perdita swearing on the stonehard ground while all the onlookers roared with laughter and alejandro shouted in broken english at her she had three more falls before she and a handful of other players started stick and balling she was just getting used to the chestnut when alejandro moved her on to a dark brown mare who when it wasnt bucking shied at the ball and then on to another chestnut whom she had great difficulty in holding she was also staggered by how energetically the argentines played hitting balls up in the air juggling and tapping them twisting turning and stopping followed by ferrari bursts of acceleration before circling again then they did the whole thing all over again without stirrups and all the time talking and shouting to one another she was also aware of angel the brithater who hadnt once eaten at the same table as her since she arrived who was now riding harder and turning faster than any of the others urging his pony on with great pelvic thrusts it seemed he was deliberately galloping very close past her to upset her chestnut mare who kept taking off into the pampas she had fallen off twice more and ridden twelve different ponies by lunchtime and was so tired she could hardly eat although luke translated the whole time for her she felt desperately isolated and sick with longing for ricky he must have nearly reached palm springs by now tugged out of her siesta like a back tooth she staggered groggily out to the yard the sun was shining platinum rather than gold now and beating down on her head to her intense humiliation luke angel alejandro three of alejandros sons and two of their friends whod come to lunch were playing on one pitch while perdita had been put on another with alejandros three younger sons and four of their cousins none of them a day over twelve talk about going back to playgroup snarled perdita the ponies were tied up in the shade to the branches of a row of gum trees which divided the two pitches gulls flapped around uttering their strange cry of tero tero and swooping down to scavenge whenever play moved on a strong lemon smell from a local herb known as black branch hung on the hot steamy air the mosquitoes went to work on any available flesh after the throwin the ball came out miraculously in perditas direction now ill show them she thought lifting her stick for a flawless offside drive next second she gave a scream of rage as she was hooked by an elevenyearold cousin who then proceeded to whip the ball away down field one of alejandros sons playing back rode him off for the backhand and hit it up the field to his brother who dribbled it a few yards then sliced it to perdita instantly an elevenyearold cousin pounced on her shielding her from the ball and riding her off all of them played with such ferocious energy and skill that for the next nightmarish seven minutes she didnt touch the ball faulazo they yelled as they teased her into crossing in front of them dejala they yelled as she rode in for the big swipe and missed it hombre hombre hombre they chorused urging her to take her man and que lenta they screamed when she failed to catch up with her number four and he went up the field and scored to loud cheers a huge cow bell was rung at the end of the chukka but the boys went on playing perdita yelled alejandro change the horse better change the rider said perdita fighting back the tears she was sore all over out of breath pouring with sweat and there were three more chukkas to go i dont want to play with kids she screamed at luke theyre all laughing at me not at you said luke soothingly while saddling up a black mare with a white star for her they always talk and joke among themselves youre overreacting this ponys much easier she follows the ball and positions herself for every shot just leave it to her perdita was settling down and had even hit a respectable forehand which only just missed the goal when alejandro out of some devilry swopped one of his sons and a cousin for luke and angel angel proceeded to put on an incredible display of histrionics peacockblue eyes flashing nostrils flaring above his furiously pouting mouth as he shouted and swore at alejandro whats he saying perdita asked alejandros twelve year old who blushed he say he no want to play with eeenglish er scum charming snapped perdita choto angel swore at her as he galloped past to defend his goal and however much luke set up shots for her angel rode her off then after a whispered word with one of the cousins angel and he galloped up on either side of her and neatly lifted her off the little black mare bastards howled perdita sitting on the painfully hard ground and bashing it with her stick fucking bastards no understand eeenglish mocked angel go back home and launched into a stream of expletives in spanish perdita replied in equally basic english next minute luke had cantered up with perditas black pony im not going to translate for either of you he said softly then turning furiously on angel for chrissake pack it in five minutes later luke blocked a brilliant goal from the youngest cousin and cleared christ he really can smite the ball almost the length of the pitch marvelled perdita angel racing towards the enemy goal tried to intercept with an air shot missing he swung his pony round in pursuit and when it didnt turn quickly enough clouted it very hard round the head with his stick in a flash perdita closed on him and bashed him across the knuckles with her stick you triple bastard ill report you to the rspca turning realizing it was perdita angel gave a howl of rage and set off in pursuit so blackly venomous was his expression that perdita fled towards the next pitch scattering the polo balls which lay like a hatch of goose eggs near the goal posts angel on a faster pony and using his whip had nearly caught her up when luke thundered up and rode him off such was the force of the bump that angels horse crashed to the ground temporarily winded leaping to his feet angel charged luke about to drag him off his horse i wouldnt said luke raising his stick stop behaving like a two year old shes a woman shes a beetch and english beetch like margaret thatcher growled angel i keel her when i catch her youve been winding her up all day shouted luke dyou want to put her off completely yes hissed angel looking at his bleeding knuckles then shell go home for good for a second they glared at each other then angel vaulted back on to his pony which had just tottered groggily to its feet and galloped back to the stables back in her room perdita fell on her bed too despairing and exhausted even to cry shed been a disaster and let ricky down theyd pack her back to england there was a knock on the door it was luke again baby its ok he took her in his arms ouch grumbled perdita youve got hands like sandpaper to rub off all your rough edges said luke i made such an idiot of myself those were children the standard is ludicrous ill never cope hush hush said luke argentines learn polo like a language those boys have been playing with a short mallet since they were two by the time theyre ten or eleven theyre on a six handicap look youre jet lagged you couldnt understand what they were saying theres hours till dinner lets go into general piran and ill buy you a drink it was so hot that perdita would have liked to have worn shorts or a dress but her mosquito bites had come up in huge red bumps and were oozing and itching like mad so she settled for her pale pink jeans and a dark blue shirt a huge yellow sun was gilding the puddles and turning the poplars the colour of lemon sherbets a cloud like a fluffy white crocodile basked at the bottom of the vast open fan of fading turquoise sky luke drove slowly to avoid the potholes just two thumbs on the steering wheel i had one hell of a hassle when i first came out i was used to riding with my reins hanging in festoons alejandro and his son all stop horses with fiveinch curbs and send them on with spurs about the same length i kept being carted all the way to buenos aires perdita stared moodily at the horizon youll be playing in matches soon youll enjoy that you cant go back to england without taking some argentine silver some hope to distract perditas attention from a terrified stray dog that was cringing on the right of the road luke pointed out three tumbledown houses on the left known as death row in that house lived a bricklayer who murdered the baker because he thought hed stolen one of his pigs then four brothers turned up in a bus and killed three brothers who lived in that house next door then the grocer who lived in the third house shot himself if you hadnt bumped that sodding angel thered have been another murder this afternoon said perdita sulkily what a dinky little country this is what a dump she added as they entered the village luke pointed out the little white church with its red corrugated roof that was always having its windows broken by the football pitch next door at least it provides airconditioning in summer he went on and thats the gas station the prettiest girl works there angels dating her and spends his time filling up alejandros truck the gasoline bill at the end of the month is going to be something else he shook with laughter does he put draw reins and a fiveinch curb on her spat perdita im surprised he didnt break that ponys jaw this afternoon because of the mosquitoes they sat inside the bar señor gracias buenas noches said the owner as he took lukes order for a vodka and tonic and a bourbon ill pay for it said perdita defiantly brandishing a bill she was in no mood to accept charity from anyone how much is this worth about fifteen dollars put it away dyou want water asked perdita reaching for the jug on the bar counter luke grinned and shook his head im a tidy person i like my whisky neat on the wall was a gaudy oil painting of a bull pouring blood with pics sticking out of it like a pincushion a smirking matador with a pink satin bottom even tighter and more uppity than angels was lifting his jewelled sword for the kill god theyre cruel they never speak to their ponies except to curse them theyre different from us said luke if americans and particularly the brits have a horse or a dog that behaves badly they admit the fact and rather celebrate and make a joke of it right whereas to an argentine its a matter of pride never to have a horse or dog thats anything less than perfect they cant understand anyone not minding losing and they want to shine individually my buzz is being on a team i dont give a shit about not scoring goals if ive set up the play that leads to goals thats ok by me youre too fucking christlike snapped perdita you get no prizes for coming second luke picked up his whisky his freckled hand was so big you could hardly see the glass he didnt tell her it broke his heart every time the argentines hurt a horse or he saw a terrified stray dog racing by the side of the road he knew the cruelty she was going to witness over the next three months would be agony for her because for some reason she trusted animals far more than humans but like a nurse looking after animals in a vivisection clinic he couldnt prevent her pain only alleviate it as much as possible theres certainly a degree of roughness with horses he admitted the argies have so many they can afford to dispense with them when red and i were kids we had races jumping on ponies in the fields and galloping them round a tree and back without a bridle we could never do that with argentine ponies they just bolted in terror the argentines break them by fear and pain but they get results look at those kids today look at angel clouting that sweet little mare with his stick the fucker she was paler than ever and luke noticed that in that shirt her eyes were more navy blue than black hes ok angel he said argentine saying never judge a man until you have walked two moons in his shoes well he neednt take it out on me i wasnt part of the bloody task force back in his bare little room angel lay on his bed smoking one cigarette from another he should have been with the girl from the petrol station half an hour ago but he was too eaten up with jealousy that his dear amigo luke had taken that whitehaired shedevil out for a drink on the wall was a painting of a mirage wheeling away from a flaming british aircraft carrier with the sea and sky incarnadined by the blaze on the chest of drawers was a photograph of his elder brother pedro in uniform his pale patrician face the image of angels except for a black moustache there were also photographs of his weak and charming father who had read pravda and the daily telegraph every morning and his beautiful feckless mother whod run off with an italian and now lived in some palazzo in rome and of the huge house in which hed been brought up besides these photographs were pedros polo helmet which now had a map of the malvinas stamped on the front which angel always wore in matches and a jar of earth hed dug up from the islands on the day hed been sent home as a prisoner of war the solis de gonzales family eightgeneration irish intermarried with spanish were immensely rich angel had had a magical childhood bucking the system at the smart buenos aires boys school of champagnat and living during the termtime in a large house in the avenidad del libertador let loose on the family estancia during the holidays he and pedro had played cops and robbers on horses and later polo with his cousins who all came from large houses near by in their teens angel and pedro had hung around the polo grounds waiting for players to fall off so they could substitute for them angel had never had a lesson he played as naturally as he walked angels branch of the solis de gonzales however were no good at looking after their business affairs his father separated from his mother lived six months of the year in paris every so often the camp manager would telephone from the estancia we have no more money then sell some land angels father would say and go back to his latest mistress or the gambling tables or the racecourse at longchamps he never took care of the land nor did he put anything back denied parents for so much of the year angel had idolized pedro on the polo field they had been dynamite and almost telepathetic in anticipating each others moves but there had been no question of them taking up polo professionally polo was all right as a hobby but for a living as angels father who prided himself on his english had pointed out it was distinctly nonu he disapproved almost as much when pedro who was mad about flying but unable to afford a plane had joined the air force in the late seventies to be followed two years later by angel disapproval turned to horror when both boys set off in their mirages for the falklands both were brilliant pilots having the same reckless flamboyant courage and ability to get the last ounce out of their ancient machines in the air as their ponies on the field a fortnight after pedros plane plunged flaming into the sea angel was shot down behind british lines and escaped with a smashed kneecap and concussion when he came round he was interrogated by one particularly phlegmatic pokerfaced guards officer a polo player who spoke fluent spanish to someone as proud as angel this and the result of the war had been the ultimate humiliation but even knowing how strong the british now were he would give up polo tomorrow and climb back into his cockpit and resume the attack on port stanley returning home with the other prisoners of war he found his father had died of a heart attack it is argentine law that when a man dies his estate must be divided equally between his children angels father had inherited acres but had sold off so much that only acres were left for angel and his three sisters the sisters who had all married well were unconcerned that angel with only acres of grazing land in the middle of his rich cousins estates had been left to pay his fathers debts his mother happy with her italian was not interested his grandmother living in luxury in the plaza hotel in buenos aires and grumbling because she had to wash her own stockings claimed she had no money even to pay her own bills in despair angel had gone to his rich cousins pleading that unless they helped him out he would be forced to sell the land to an outsider a property developer who wanted to build houses there the rich cousins thinking he was bluffing ignored him then when he sold the land they were absolutely furious and banished him from their houses angel was now desperately trying to make his way as a professional polo player his secret ambition was for the argentine ban to be lifted so he could get to england and avenge pedros death by taking out the english and especially one pokerfaced guards officer alejandro wouldnt help him he was jealous of new blood particularly when it was as blue as angels but luke who knew how hard it was to get established had recognized angels talent before perdita arrived he and angel had spent hours talking in the evenings trying to improve each others english and spanish luke realized that beneath his corroding bitterness and pyrotechnic bursts of latin temperament angel was by nature merry with a kind heart and an even greater sense of the ridiculous the latter had for the moment deserted him the brits had taken pedro now this blonde witch had stolen luke angel was biding his time perdita refused to admit it but she was terribly homesick there was no post nor telephone because of the strike and she was tormented by fantasies of ricky being ridden off by starlets in palm springs used to smothering any animal she met with love she felt dreadfully deprived when the argentine ponies flinched away from her only raimundos lurchers responded when she combed the burrs out of their coats and fed them bits of meat visiting players raimundo the grooms and alejandro looked at her with illconcealed lust but her deadpan hauteur and señor gracias large looming presence kept them at bay angel smouldered at a distance losing no chance to bitch her up she was aware that none of the men except luke took her seriously as a player claudia was enchanting endlessly kind and sympathetic but beneath her preoccupation with her children perdita sensed a deep sadness her daughters were also charming with their big dark eyes and exuberantly glossy hair and breasts rising like pomegranates and they giggled in amazed delight when perdita swore and yelled at the grooms and even screamed at their father heavy chaperonage too seemed to enhance their value like jewellery locked in glass cases rather than scrambled in trays on the counter but to perdita they appeared curiously passive sitting and waiting for some man to make them unhappy luke was her salvation the argentine night came down like a blind but when it was too dark to ride he seldom took a siesta struggling instead through martin fierro don quixote or el cid with the aid of a spanish dictionary or listening to music mostly mozart but he was always prepared to turn off the tape and listen to her ranting on about how she missed ricky and how bloody the argentines were being to her and to their horses an inspired listener he seldom volunteered information about himself have you got a girlfriend she asked him once yeah are you going to marry her nope why not not in love with her i guess theres only one reason to get married because you cant not and ive seen too much unhappiness caused by broken marriages i want mine to stick a few weeks later perdita sat under a jacaranda tree which was scattering purplyblue petals all over the parched brown ground at least the drought had driven off the mosquitoes darling ricky she wrote david waterlanes been here today he brought a letter from mum hes going on to new york and promises to post this for me he bought four ponies all of which alejandro swore played in the final of last years open that makes over fifty ponies hes sold this year that he claims took part he must have changed ponies an awful lot how are you getting on have you been signed up to star in a film yet has lukes bloody sister been in touch with you do you miss me a bit i think im getting a bit better at polo there is a beautiful little irongrey mare here that alejandro has frightened out of her wits and says is too wet for polo i wish youd bought her i think shes brilliant if you send me the money i think we could get her for christ the argentines are cruel last week they started breaking the wild three year olds and goodness raimundo and the grooms adored it treating it like some macho game did you realize they drive the ponies into a corral then tie them to a stake in the burning sun for five days with no food or water alejandro caught me stealing out to water them the first night we had a frightful row he said the english were fine ones to bang on about cruelty when they sent little boys off to boarding school when they were eight i said it had done eddie a power of good anyway after that he put raimundo on guard with a gun i wouldnt mind being shot but im sure raimundo would insist on raping me first hes such a lech anyway on the sixth day its really horrific i came back from moving the cows and found raimundo and his merry men engaged in breaking proper five of them to one desperately weakened pony with sunken eyes and ribs you could play tunes on lassoing it with weighted thongs and pulling it over and over on the desperately hard ground until it was crapping everywhere in terror god i loathe alejandro for allowing it finally on the seventh day i thought that being catholic theyd rest but still unfed and unwatered each pony was blindfolded and tacked up and raimundo got on each ones back and whipped it and whipped it out into the pampas until the ponys spirit was completely broken and itll never argue with man again how can any horse fail to be screwed up when its first contact with man is fifth degree burns starvation and flagellation no wonder theyre terrified i kicked raimundo in the shins there was a bit of a row alejandro wouldnt let me stick and ball for a week and its not just the animals theyre cruel to claudia was crying the other morning and i caught luke hugging her he said he was comforting her utterly bloody alejandro has a mistress in ba he went to see her that day he took you to the airport according to luke argentine men feel theyve failed to demonstrate their virility unless they have a mistress and that only their wives get married they remain single christ what an attitude just like rupert campbellblacks when he was married i hate argentine men particularly that angel all theyre interested in is screwing and thumbscrewing and as there isnt an inquisition any more they take it out on the horses if luke wasnt here id go crackers god hes nice and he really works at his polo every evening lining up ball after ball and practising penalties hes a brilliant teacher too alejandro gets pissed off and shouts if you dont do the right thing straight away luke tells you what to do all the time but quietly and he never loses his temper except if he thinks youre not trying please please write i hope your elbows better now think of me sometimes i must go as david w is leaving in half an hour all my love perdita having handed over her letter and waved goodbye perdita wandered down to the stables the sun which had burnt the stickandball field and the pitches to a dusty liver chestnut had now set but it was still impossibly hot she could hear whoops of laughter what devilish torture had raimundo dreamed up now running through the orange grove which already had little green oranges on past the chickens she froze with horror in the middle of the yard the little pony alejandro regarded as useless stood quivering with terror her irongrey coat was black with sweat and dust her thin sides heaving her eyes rolling umberto alejandros laziest groom was holding tightly on to her while raimundo who was wearing a leather apron to protect his gaucho pants his little eyes glinting with pleasure and cruelty was attaching a long lead rope to her headcollar he then took the rope through her front and back legs and tied it firmly to the back bumper of the mercedes which angel had backed into the yard angel was now sitting in the driving seat a fag hanging out of his sulky mouth revving up the engine what the hells going on exploded perdita angel looked round your little darling wont back he sneered this lesson should teach er and he revved the engine even more loudly right yelled raimundo umberto leapt clear the grey pony made a bolt for freedom stop it screamed perdita making a lunge at angel but she was too late he had rammed his foot down on the accelerator the mercedes shot forward the little greys neck jerked frantically and she cartwheeled violently in the air crashing to the ground to be dragged ten feet before angel braked the surrounding grooms roared with laughter and cheered picking his way over the diarrhoea which had splattered all over the ground and avoiding the frantically flailing hooves of the shocked utterly terrified pony raimundo grasped her headcollar and aided by umberto and the other grooms yanked her to her feet four of them hung on to her she made a frantic leap to shake them off as they lifted her back and front nearside feet over the rope and positioned her with her back to the revving mercedes again three or four goes should make up the mind for her said raimundo evilly as perdita picked herself up off the dusty ground angel crouched over the wheel that should teach that stuckup bitch to fall in love with ponies he wished it were perdita at the end of the rope hed like to see her crashing to the ground over and over again but with her hed keep on driving raimundo was taking his time angel glanced round and gave a shout of warning too late perdita her face ashen her black eyes blazing had a pitchfork poised a foot from raimundos capacious buttocks next second she had plunged it into them giving a bellow of pain and rage raimundo jumped a foot in the air and let go of the pony who took off jerking to a halt as the slack of the rope ran out leave her alone you bastard or ill kebab you screamed perdita all the grooms doubled up with laughter swinging round in a fury raimundo was about to leap on perdita when she brandished the fork in his face dyou want your eyes gouged out you fucking sadist untie that pony raimundos sallow face had turned a dark red la puta que te pario he spat at her but backed away as the evillooking prongs stroked his eyelashes get her off me he bellowed at the other grooms but enjoying the sport too much they continued to barrack and laugh olé shouted umberto then out of the corner of her eye perdita saw angel approaching there was murder in his eyes the beautiful pouting mouth had disappeared completely dont you come near me hissed perdita rage driving out all fear flickering the pitchfork like an adders tongue between him and raimundo no wonder you lost the falklands war bullies are always cowards you run away from real men so you take it out on horses you lousy latin creeps clenching his fists rigid with rage angel advanced on her translating what she had said for the others perhaps she had better make a bolt for it i keel you english beetch angels grey shirt was touching the pitchfork now perdita had drawn it back to ram it into him when suddenly she found her arms gripped from behind drop thundered luke fuck off screamed perdita dont bloody interfere drop luke tightened his grip on her and the pitchfork clattered to the ground that hurt shouted perdita are you on those bastards side just as angel was about to leap on her luke picked her up and carried her yelling into the house desperately she kicked backwards like a buck rabbit trying to get him in the groin let me go put me down and when he wouldnt she tried to plunge her teeth into his arms which were clamped round her like steel bands the next second he had put her under the shower and turned on the cold tap for once it decided not to have cystitis and gushed out like the victoria falls funnelled through a hose pipe had enough he said fifteen seconds later gasping choking spluttering she struggled to escape are you going to behave yourself he pulled her away from the driving jet of water no screamed perdita aiming a kick at his shins now i know how enid coley felt well go back under again her drenched hair stranded her face her pale lilac dress clung to her body her eyelashes divided like a starfish as he pulled her out a second time as she opened her mouth to shriek he grabbed a green towel hanging over the shower rail and slapped it over her mouth pack it in he said sharply dyou want to get sent home i dont care mumbled perdita trying to bite him through the towel bastards how can you stand there and not mind of course i mind but were here to learn miss mcenroe dont call me that you great jerk said perdita hammering her fists against his chest which was as hard as the ground outside theyre going to break that ponys leg or teach it to rein back said luke he drew back the dingy plastic curtains covering the small window overlooking the yard angels on her back now and shes reining back pretty good their methods are cruel but they get results i hate this bloody country hissed perdita luke made an attempt at levity there are good things about it polo boots are three times cheaper than they are in the uk oh shut up out of the window she could see a huge pink moon like the inside of a guava climbing out of the gum trees even the moons blushing at the horrible way they treat ponies she snarled whys it that stupid colour anyway catching the last of the suns rays said luke suns rising in the east now gone to shine on your mom suddenly perdita had a vision of daisy kind scatty busty in her awful clothes constantly making concessions whom she hadnt written to since shed arrived glaring at luke she burst into tears hush honey hush i hate it too he murmured enfolding her in his arms and stroking her sopping hair i know its awful i guess i wanta play polo better so i can beat the shit out of them on the field one moment she was sobbing her heart out then lulled by the bearlike warmth of his chest and the comforting shelter of his great arms and shoulders she had fallen asleep like a child gazing down luke thought how beautiful she was despite the tearstains and the swollen eyelids she hardly stirred as he pulled off her lilac dress and carried her in her bra and pants into her bedroom laying her gently on the bed he removed the dark red blanket from his bed and put it over her perdita woke at two in the morning slowly the events of the previous evening reassembled themselves had it been a nightmare no her bra and pants were still wet luke must have put her to bed oblivious of any guards she stole downstairs outside huge stars blazed like shaggy white chrysanthemums the moon had stopped blushing and was now flooding the pampas with ghostly silver light a warm breeze ruffled the leaves of the gum trees which cast a thousand ebony shadows on the burnt dusty yard which was now palest grey instead of brown she could hear the occasional snort and stamp of a pony then jumped out of her skin as something cold and snakelike was thrust into her hand it was the wet nose of one of raimundos shaggy lurchers who was frantically waving her long crooked tail sweet thing perdita crouched beside her stroking her rough fur as the bitch writhed against her in delight both jumped as a great snore rent the air umberto tonights guard was slumped against the bottom of a tree an empty bottle at his feet now was her chance out in the corral tied so tight to the big stake in the centre that the argentines call a palemque that she couldnt even move her head was the little grey pony you poor little duck said perdita gently nearly breaking her neck the pony pulled away in panic the whites of her eyes glinting in the moonlight coat curled with dried sweat like an irish water spaniel at first when perdita held out the bucket she was too frozen with fear to drink but when her muzzle was dunked in the water almost over her nostrils the temptation became too much sucking in great drafts she drained one bucket and then half another watching her fondly perdita was reminded of fresco if only she could jump on her back and not stop galloping until she got to ricky and palm springs as she laid her hand on the little mares neck she quivered violently but didnt move away im going to call you tero she whispered because you and i are going to fly away from this hellhole loosening the rope so the mares nose could reach the ground she left her with a pile of hay next morning the post strike ended bringing five letters from daisy none of which perdita opened she was in a black gloom because not even a postcard had arrived from ricky alejandro having been out on the bat the night before returned at breakfast time with the pallor and red eyes of a white rat he was then thrown into a frenzy by a letter announcing the impending arrival of lando medici the richest of american patrons who always paid for ponies in readies out of a gladstone bag soon alejandro was venting his hangover on all the staff yelling at them to tidy up the place and all the ponies wheres raimundo he shouted at a wincing umberto he sick said umberto well get him up whats the matter with him demanded perdita who was busy trimming the hairy fetlocks of a gelding that resembled a clydesdale more than a polo pony just for a second umberto forgot his own hangover señor gracias give heem the eye black he what gasped perdita raimundo was in the bar with his friends last night señor gracias come in and talk to eem very quietly then he heet him across the room everyone cheer they no like raimundo very hard man what did raimundo do asked perdita in awe he run away said umberto with a grin he leave very quick señor gracias how you say too beeg to tango with angel was in the bar too upchatting girl from the gas station señor gracias turned towards him and angel ran away too all down the road like carl lewis he was very frightened he not drive car tied to pony again in an urry later perdita cornered luke he looked tired and his eyes were bloodshot from the dust i thought we were here to learn not to criticize she said sternly then that wonderful onceayear smile split her face in two you have definitely won the man of the macho award standing on tiptoe she kissed him on the cheek luke blushed beneath his freckles and his heart jumped several beats its only because theres a dearth of available women out here he told himself sternly alejandro fed up with raimundos laziness and his exorbitant whining demands was put in such a good mood when he saw the black eye that he agreed that perdita could take over the breaking of little tero she no good for polo too cheeken but eef you want to waste your time luke had temporarily routed raimundo and angel but their animosity towards perdita if less overt was in no way abated to give perdita a break luke took her away the following saturday to see a high goal match at the famous hurlingham club which left her speechless with wonder then on to buenos aires to an english production of the merchant of venice throughout most of which she slept her only comments at dinner afterwards as she gorged herself on tournedos raspberries and cream and st emilion were that shylock was almost as beady about money as alejandro and that bassanio was a wimp portiad have done much better with that suitor who talked about his horse all the time at least hed have given her some decent ponies luke who knew the play backwards had been moved to tears by the moonlit love scene between lorenzo and jessica a lemonyellow halfmoon was hanging overhead as he and perdita left the restaurant but any hope he might have had of sliding his arm round her and trying a tentative first kiss on the drive home was scotched when she fell asleep the moment she got into the car her white dress had fallen off the shoulder nearest him her skirt was rucked up to midthigh her hair rippled silver with her scornful mouth softened by sleep and pale eyelids hiding her furious eyes she looked as vulnerable as she did desirable wracked with longing luke drove through the grey lunar landscape only broken by occasional white towns or ebony clumps of trees up at five and sleeping badly of late luke kept his mind off perdita and himself awake on the long straight roads as he had done so often in the past by concentrating on a particular horse this time it was maldita a grey mare who had slipped into the yard already broken as part of a job lot a few weeks ago alejandro was allergic to greys particularly the whiter ones his father had been paralysed by a fall from a white stallion on the one recent occasion when the mendoza family had got near winning the argentine open it had been on a grey mare that alejandro had missed the clinching penalty his phobia had spread to his grooms when raimundos even crueller predecessor had broken the leg of a grey filly hurling it to the ground for branding and the following day he had died of snake bite whenever they passed a grey on the road the grooms crossed themselves the iron grey tero got by because her coat was almost black but maldita was so dazzlingly white except for a sprinkling of rustbrown freckles on her belly that she looked as though shed been through the car wash at fourteen hands she was on the small side for polo with a lovely intelligent head wideapart dark eyes clean legs and a smooth effortless stride unfortunately she was as bitchy as she was beautiful lashing out with teeth and hooves at any human who came near her and bucking them off if they tried to get on her back even when raimundo strapped one of her back legs to her belly to stop her kicking she struck out with the other leg and crashing to the ground laid about her with her front legs and teeth alejandro was all for putting a bullet through this shedevils head and dispatching her to the nearest abattoir luke however who was a genius with difficult horses begged to be allowed to have a crack at her he had begun by putting maldita in a stable with no straw and taking water and feed to her every eight hours then when she went for him immediately removing them after twentyfour hours she was so hungry that she dived her pale pink nose into the bucket instead of at him two days later she allowed him to stand in her stable while she ate starving her until the next evening he coaxed her with pony nuts into a stall which raimundo used for branding and saddling bigger horses which was so narrow she couldnt turn round tying her lead rope so tightly she couldnt move her head luke had climbed up and approached her from above talking softly the whole time he slowly ran his hands over her caressing gentling and scratching up and down her mane where once her mother would have lovingly nibbled her then progressing to her back and flanks after the first minutes of trembling outrage maldita had stopped behaving as though his fingers were redhot pokers and reacted almost voluptuously to his touch luke wished perdita were as responsive at the end of half an hour back in her box he rewarded her with hay and water after a week of such treatment he mounted her sending her into the same orgy of bucking that had dislodged the grooms and all the mendoza boys finding she couldnt unseat him she paused for breath anticipating her next devilry she was so small and luke so long in the leg he looked like some father riding a seaside donkey to amuse his children you wont need a mallet on that one shouted alejandro you can kick the ball with your feet or if you miss that beetch will kick it for you unnerved by alejandros great roar of laughter maldita had taken off into the pampas somehow miraculously missing rabbit holes and fallen logs as she hurtled along luke sat still and gave her her head amazed that the more she warmed up the faster she went staggered by the distance she could carry his pound bulk in the burning sun after nearly four miles she ran into the river that bordered alejandros land which was so deep she was forced to swim on the opposite bank luke rolled off her back and lay on the grass the heaving mare glared back at him too exhausted to move afterwards he hacked her quietly home and was further amazed that she responded to his legs and hands and had the perfect mouth and balance of a made polo pony it didnt stop her lashing out at him with her teeth and back legs as he unsaddled her but he felt he was making progress and the next day stick and balling her he found she was a natural in her darkeyed pallor and arrogant bloodymindedness she reminded him of perdita if she could trust one human he felt she could achieve anything driving home from the theatre he pondered his next move seeing general piran ahead he decided to try her in practice chukkas tomorrow it was past three oclock but the tack room light besieged with huge crashing moths was still on raimundos shaggy lurchers swarmed round perdita as she staggered groggily out of the car ive never been so exhausted in my life christ whats that she shrieked as fat umberto clearly drunk and absolutely terrified lurched out of the shadows brandishing a gun what in hells the matter said luke taking the gun from him maldita she is dead gabbled umberto in spanish what howled luke raising his hands in panic begging señor gracias not to shoot him umberto whimpered that maldita had developed colic that morning we fight all day to save her what did you try demanded luke furiously everything enemas catheters fluids to hydrate her all impossible she more busy fight us than the colic she get up she get down she roll she kick the stomach like crazy woman we try real hard then seeing the expression on lukes face umberto indignantly lifted his loose trousers up above his boots to display two huge purple bruises what you think these are love bites what did the vet say a lump of sand block her gut when did he last come this afternoon he no come back his daughter getting married this evening then where the fucks alejandro humping in ba i suppose he didnt even went explained umberto who couldnt ever have imagined señor gracias being so angry about anything he go to wedding of vets daughter along with everyone else i guess said luke why didnt anyone take her to the veterinary hospital they could have operated alejandro say she too weak said umberto leaving unspoken the truth that alejandro would be too mean to fork out the equivalent of for a green and vicious mare where is she asked luke in the first paddock under the gum trees alejandro tell me shoot her if pain get too bad he say best stable for that mare is a coffin umberto crossed himself but bad luck to kill white horse anyway she already die she not move for twenty minutes followed by perdita who only half understood what was going on luke sprinted out to the paddock although the moon had set they could see malditas ghostly white body slumped in the corner like a castoff shroud poor little bitch luke was shaking with rage but as he put his hand beneath her nearside elbow he felt the faintest heartbeat and to his joy the mare struck feebly out at him with her offfore and gave a halfwhicker of recognition which turned into a groan her white coat was drenched with sweat her belly horribly distended put some rugs on her he ordered perdita as he raced back into the house under his bed he had a complete medicine chest full of stuff given him by a veterinary friend in palm beach there was one thing that might save the mare and that was only a to chance back in the paddock he was greeted by a stream of expletives even in her hopelessly weakened condition maldita had lashed out when perdita tried to put a rug on her what are you giving her asked perdita as luke plunged the needle into the mares neck neostymine push her into internal contractions itll either kill her or make her pass the sand the mare writhed and groaned as another spasm of pain shook her body shes in such agony stormed perdita why dont we just put her out of her misery were giving her a chance said luke curtly now help me get her to her feet they both jumped as a black shadow fell across the mares contorted body it was little tero turned out in the same paddock offering silent sympathy round and round they staggered like the end of some ghastly marathon luke dragging maldita upright and along by her headcollar supporting her with his body perdita propping up her other side tero followed them at a distance watching her new friend with sorrowful anxious eyes luke could have done with more help but umberto had barricaded himself into the tack room with another bottle after twenty minutes luke felt his titanic strength was supporting both maldita and a buckling perdita and ordered the latter to bed when she refused flopping with exhaustion by the gate he threw a spare rug over her the huge expanse of sky was lightening now the stars growing pale a far cry from lorenzos patines of bright gold occasionally a farm dog barked a frog croaked by the water trough gleaming in the halflight a rabbit caught by some predator shrieked in terror a distant pounding of pop music indicated that the wedding of the vets daughter was still being celebrated twice maldita collapsed it was hard to tell now if it was lukes sweat or hers that drenched her rug occasionally she groaned and made halfhearted kicks at her agonizingly swollen belly walking her round luke was reminded of his schoolfriend spike whod been caught in the locker room with another boy terrified that the publicity could ruin his father who was a senator running for president spike had odd on barbiturates by talking to him all night and keeping him on his feet luke had saved spikes life only to have him try again successfully a week later when the story finally hit the press somehow luke felt he owed it to spikes memory to save the mare come on baby he urged her you gotta pull through just try and crap then youll feel better to keep them both awake he reeled off endless poetry shakespeare hiawatha then because maldita might prefer her own language he started on martin fierro afterwards he couldnt tell if he had dreamed it but he was sure little tero drew close to maldita several times trying to prop her up and twice he felt teros timid nudge of encouragement in his back when he was buckling with exhaustion by the time the stars had faded malditas heart had rallied beating almost as fast as her pounding little hooves had on the pampas her belly gave a massive rumble come on honey mumbled luke if you pull through i swear ill take you to palm beach windsor cowdray and deauville youll have a life without winters playing the best polo in the world but the mare was arching her back and groaning in such agony now that luke only just managed to keep her on her feet it was as though vesuvius had erupted inside her he could see a faint pink glow in the east from the tack room umbertos snores rent the air in a distant field a mare whinnied and a stallion whinnied back luke staggered his strength was giving out come on spike baby he muttered dont die youve gotta see another sunrise waking very cold and aching perdita saw little red flames flickering across the great blue arch of sky and thought for a terrified second that she was in the middle of a forest fire then she became conscious of a vast bloodred sun warming the pampas the trunks of the gum trees soared bright pink the tack room windows flared crimson and all the birds in the world seemed to be singing for joy sitting up stiffly perdita gave a gasp for in the corner beside tero a beautiful rosered mare her coat mackerelled with dried sweat was quietly grazing fast asleep against the fence slumped luke his face as rumpled as an unmade bed his shirt as perdita shook it drenched with dew maldita whispered perdita incredulously shes ok luke opened a bloodshot eye and grinned triumphantly she passed the sand what a mare if she can fight off that medication shell take on the whole world hearing lukes voice maldita glanced up gave a whicker of joy and a little unsteadily walked towards him pressed her nose against his shoulder and breathed lovingly down his neck she knows you saved her life said perdita in awe but as she stretched out a hand to stroke the mare maldita moved even closer to luke flattening her ears and lashing out at perdita protectively with a hind leg umberto snoring in the tack room barricaded against ghoul and hobgoblin by one of the feedbins was woken to a punishing hangover by the increasingly irritated din of muzzled horses kicking their water buckets peering through the cobwebs at the stable clock umberto realized he should have been up an hour ago any minute alejandro would be back from the wedding breathing fire and brandy fumes alejandro didnt like dead mares around it looked bad if potential buyers dropped in hed better get that shedevil shifted clutching his head umberto set out to rouse the other grooms the sun had now lost its rosy tinge and shone extremely painfully into his eyes next moment he nearly died of fright for ghostly in the pale light glaring through the fence at him was a dazzling white maldita fantasma aparecido he shrieked frantically crossing himself over and over again he fled screaming towards the grooms quarters as fast as his fat legs would carry him whats up with him asked perdita in amazement luke shook with laughter he left her for dead he figures shes a ghost figured she didnt have a ghost of a chance giggled perdita why dont you call her fantasma its a much prettier name than maldita and so maldita the malevolent became fantasma the fantastic within a few days she had recovered enough to play practice chukkas going straight into fast polo as though shed played it all her life she adored the game so much luke only had to shift his weight or touch her mouth to get her to do what he wanted and she was so competitive she would bump anyone at first even riding off ponies on her own side she was still bitchy if luke were grooming her she lashed out if he brushed her belly or round her ears and went for anyone else who came near her but she could sense when he was getting her ready for a match and stood like a statue even dropping her head for him to clip her mane the only other being fantasma adored was tero the two mares had become inseparable and cried bitterly if they were parted fantasma even bashing down fences to get at her friend alejandro was so staggered by fantasmas progress that he decided to waive his prejudice against greys not so much that he was prepared to get on her back but he spent a considerable time wondering how he could flog fantasma to a rich patron without them finding out how vicious and unmanageable the mare could be when she was away from luke one of the great debates raging through the argentine polo world was whether alejandro mendoza was a greater player than the mighty obrien brothers miguel and juan certainly the mendoza familys ambition in life was to beat the obriens over twenty years the two great polo dynasties had battled it out in the argentine open at palermo in the eighties the obriens with juan and miguel on ten and their two cousins on nine had predominated the mendozas however were biding their time alejandro had married at twenty in two or three years luis patricio and lorenzo would be catching up with miguels cousins and by this time miguel who drank and ate too much might well be over the top and juan as alejandro who as one who lived in a glass house and was in no position to hurl polo balls pointed out might well have died of sexual excess hardly an evening passed without one of the mendozas gnashing their teeth over old videos of the open and swearing death to the obriens alejandro was also very jealous that miguel and juan aided by bart aldertons fat salary had started their own polo club buying much of the adjoining land and selling plots to polo enthusiasts at vastly inflated prices another hotly contested tournament was the copa de republic a vast knockout competition which went on all over the country from november to april played entirely on handicap it meant that a team like the obriens the aggregate of whose handicaps added up to thirtyeight goals could be pitted against a team whose goals only totalled eight this year by some freak of fate the mendozas had drawn the obriens in the first round and were due to play them at the latters new polo club forty miles away on the first saturday in december on the thursday luis mendoza pulled a groin muscle so luke had to take his place on the friday lorenzo mendoza lost his temper with a pony that kept going up with him pulling it over to frighten it he failed to jump clear and the pony fell on him smashing his thigh sobbing with pain and rage he was carted off to hospital by an ashen claudia and the family doctor whod been presented with a horse every time he delivered a mendoza baby now angel would have to substitute for lorenzo as a result alejandro reluctant to face a rout ducked out on saturday morning complaining of an ancient back injury perdita covering the bottom of the lorries with straw to protect the ponies feet suddenly heard alejandro shouting that she better dig out a pair of clean breeches and polish her boots as shed be playing in the match that afternoon perdita went into shock horror in five hours shed be marking miguel obrien a gnat trying to curb an elephant her confidence was further eroded by both patricio and angel launching into a flurry of latin hysterics that all the press would be there and why should the humiliation of a certain mendoza defeat be quadrupled by having a stupid girl on the team whereupon luke lost his temper and told them not to be such fucking chauvinists as a final straw on going to change perdita discovered shed got the curse which was invariably as bloody as culloden on the first day how ghastly if she bled through her breeches the obriens club was far too new to have a ladies loo and she was nearly out of tampax storming out of her room she went slap into luke ill polish your boots he offered i cant play sure you can unknowns are always discovered in the copa de republic its your big break how can i play against angel and patricio as well as the obriens hush hush luke drew her to him as always his vast warmth steadied her think how proud ricky would be burying her face in lukes chest to hide her blushes perdita asked him if he knew the spanish for super tampax and if they could stop for some on the way i guess so said luke putting a hand down to stroke her aching knotted belly and some buscopan too if you need it stop worrying were on twelve theyre on thirtyeight all weve gotta do is stop them scoring twentysix goals they took two lorryloads of ponies including fantasma little tero whinnied hysterically when she discovered she was being left behind angel drove the first lorry perdita sat between him and luke who was busy working out who should ride which pony in each chukka a compulsive polo watcher he was familiar with many of the obriens horses and would probably have to rearrange the list when he saw which ones they were playing youve gotta mark juan he told angel he ought to be a twelve or a thirteen hes so good hes on to the ball before anyone else but he conserves the energy of his horses unlike reeky taunted angel who do too much and exhaust his horses dont talk crap said perdita furiously pack it in snapped luke and drive a bit slower we dont want to go up the ass of that flour lorry in front angels fingers drummed angrily on the steering wheel as he gazed moodily at the long straight road ahead of them suntanned now he no longer looked as though he was dying of jaundice bronze tendrils stuck to his forehead lean jaws continually chewing gum were covered in stubble he might have shaved for a match thought perdita the girl in the petrol station must have a skin like garlic sausage look at those sheep grazing under that pylon said luke quickly trying too late to distract perditas attention from another dumped dog cringing and terrified at the side of the road stop she screamed in anguish we cant leave him hunched over the wheel angel accelerated arent there any dogs homes in this shitty country demanded perdita we dont need them snarled angel as a nation we drive very fast which solve the problem perdida means stray in spanish he added contemptuously rigid with hatred they sat a foot apart with perdita rammed against luke but as her shirt grew soaked in sweat she was obliged to edge nearer angel who looked at her as if she were a tarantula realizing they were both going through the roof with nerves luke put down his notes and tipped his battered panama over his snub nose listen my children and you will hear he began in his deep husky drawl of the midnight ride of paul revere on the eighteenth of april in seventyfive hardly a man is now alive who remembers that day and that year put a sock in it grumbled perdita spik spanish said angel fretfully a grin spread across lukes freckled face youll love this poem angel its all about a crushing brit defeat a hurry of hooves on the village street he went on and beneath from the pebbles in passing a spark struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet that was all and yet through the gloom and the light the fate of a nation was riding that night as he related the heroic tale of paul reveres gallop through the night to alert the americans to the arrival of the british redcoats the forty miles flew by and perdita and angel strained to catch every word that was great said perdita in amazement when hed finished where dyou learn that stuff in school when i had time to kill give us something else luke laughed and put on an english accent we few we happy few we band of brothers for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother be he neer so vile this day shall gentle his condition nice said perdita then under her breath but nothings going to gentle angel the ponies who always had an uncanny knowledge that theyd reached their destination were stamping and scraping the floor in the back and heres le cloob obrien announced angel they turned into a dirt track flanked by very young gum trees on either side in various stages of development were yellow houses with crinkly red roofs like swiss chalets the club house which looked like a turreted ruritanian castle had white walls grey roofs flawless pitches front and back but as yet no windows nor as perdita suspected a ladies loo or changing room she changed in the lorry with martina a sorrel mare with four white socks who was never let out until the last moment as she was driven so crazy by the flies perdita was trembling so badly that she could hardly zip up her boots she felt a stone overweight with the super tampax and all the kleenex stuffed inside herself the oncecrocusyellow polo shirt now faded to primrose with a huge maroon satin number one on the back was almost falling to pieces it had been worn the last time the mendozas beat the obriens in the open and on every occasion they had met since trying to put her head through a sleeve perdita nearly ripped it further luke let her out the primrose yellow suited him she thought it emphasized the sleepy honeycoloured eyes in his brown face and the yellow streaks in his reddygold hair he looked in terrific shape too the massive shoulders and chest tapered down to the lean cowboy hips and long legs the obriens looked in even greater shape everywhere perdita seemed to see the emeraldgreen colours they had chosen to emphasize their irish origins which were worn by players grooms and supporters alike both their lorries were green and so were their lead reins antisweat sheets buckets and bandages and there were green braids on their splendid horses tails which were left down until the last moment to protect them from the flies perdita felt her stomach disappear there was miguel huge and thickset with a permanently hard ugly smirk on his face and lithe handsome juan whom shed last seen being forcibly ejected for bonking his hosts wife at the waterlanes party both swinging their sticks round and round to loosen up their shoulders then she noticed a vast woman with a swarthy deadpan face and black hair drawn back into a bun who was standing near the obriens with grimly folded arms whos sitting bully she asked luke juans wife then at perditas look of incredulity known as the policia when she accompanies him to palm beach he drops all his girlfriends goes to church and prays and becomes the model husband the moment she leaves hes back with a blonde on each arm perdita started to laugh the good news went on luke is that because shes around juan hasnt been able to have his extramarital prematch hump which miraculously lifts his game instead he and juan lunched with victor and sharon kaputnik victors thinking of buying a dozen horses off them unless he sees something he fancies better at alejandros tomorrow theyre not playing their best horses today theyre saving them for the open so they have no doubt about wiping the floor none said luke lets hope pride comes before several falls will you do up my kneepads asked perdita i dont want anyone particularly angel to see how much im shaking the bad news went on luke tucking a strap into a buckle is that one of todays umpires jaime calavessi bumped one of the obrien boys wrong last week after the match tiny as mrs juan is euphemistically known and her three sons chased jaime round the field and nearly broke his jaw so any decisions he makes today will be nervously proobrien the other umpire is juans brotherinlaw so he wont be unbiased either a large crowd had gathered giving a great air of carnival little boys raced about hitting balls with short mallets young players sat inside the boards anxious to get as near their gods as possible voluptuous girlfriends sisters and mothers constantly turned against the hot dusty wind to secure their cascading glossy hair with plastic bulldog clips perched on bonnets of cars smoking and chattering nonstop they were getting high on tins of diet coke spectators wandering along the pony lines were amused to watch fantasma whod been muzzled to stop her savaging anyone standing on her two front legs and lashing out with both back ones a ripple of excitement went through the crowd as miguels wife who was small dark and as pretty as mrs juan was ugly rolled up with victor and sharon kaputnik victor fatter and balder and more like a bilious little hippo than ever was obviously enjoying playing the obriens off against the mendozas in chile they like you anyway he was saying loudly in argentina they cheat you and laugh all the way to the bank they only entertain you if they know youre going to buy their ponies bloody rude said perdita furiously how dare he bitch about argentina and my god sharons been gentrified when perdita last saw her as victors bimbo in sharons hair had been dyed the colour of strawberry jam her splendid breasts had floated like beachballs out of her skintight polyester dress and her sixinch spike heels must have terrorized any lurking moles as she tripped on to the rutshire pitch at treadingin time today her hair the discreetest palest auburn curled softly on her collar and she was wearing a white muslin mididress white stockings and flat white pumps vast pearls which some poor oyster must have needed an epidural to produce circled her neck and wrists the bracelet had gone from her ankle the heavy makeup from her eyes the graciousness of her entrance however was somewhat marred clinging on to her big picture hat with one hand and holding up her white parasol with the other there was nothing left to prevent the hot wind from the andes blowing her dress over her head to reveal a white suspender belt and french knickers my people used to have an estancia in chorley wood she was telling an uncomprehending mrs miguel oh best of luck hooarn she cried priding herself on her pronunciation as juan cantered on to the field followed by a cloud of dust and the eyes of every woman round the pitch impossibly arrogant and handsome teeth flashing beneath his ebony moustache so much copied by the young argentine bloods black curls flowing from under a very unlrish tartan hat juans long thighs gripped a bay mare who was so glossy he could have checked his reflection in her quarters a great cheer went up as he started hitting the ball around the merest tap sending it miles across a field as brown as raimundos goatskin apron idolo my hero i am ere yelled a busty blonde through cupped hands earning herself a wave from juan and dirty looks from both sharon and mrs juan who had stationed themselves grimly on the halfway line surrounded by supporters that bay juans riding is very powerful luke told angel three days without oats and she can still play but juan has trouble stopping her dont forget hell also try and hit you too late knowing the others were depending on him luke kept his nerves to himself as he went round checking girths and bandages to give perdita confidence in her first chukka hed put her on a dark brown pony called chimango which meant bird of prey who was as steady as a rock but who swept down on the ball like a hawk luke shouted juan cantering up he bent down and gave luke a great hug my dear friend ow are you how is alejandro still bent as a paper cleep no more than you said luke we hear youve been selling victor carthorses did you wax their fetlocks beforehand no we use ladies razor giggled juan your father is very well he ring me tomorrow wiz zee andicap listings if he go up we ave to look for another ringer under juans ponys elegant hooves the ground was cracking and blowing away in clouds of dust i ear you reduce to playing wiz girls alejandro must be sleeping he said he is not said perdita outraged he means slipping luke reassured her thats even worse this is perdita said luke ay ay ay sighed juan peering under her hat you are twelve goal in looks señorita what does it matter about zee polo bloody sexist muttered perdita as juan rode off hes pissed said luke well show him said perdita as she mounted chimango angel and patricio were about to ride on to the field wait perdita leant forward and removed a piece of straw from angels ponys eyelashes put on the rimmel mascara next said angel sarcastically oh fuck off knock it off said luke picking up his stick now come on you guys we may be the underdogs but were gonna fight like pit bulls and fight they did the obriens expecting a canter over were unpleasantly surprised to find themselves pegged both juan and miguel had lunched not wisely but too well under a punishing overhead sun lobster steak tournedos and dulce de leche churned uneasily in their bellies not used to drinking juan was seeing the ball if not double at least one and a third which led to a lot of misses and botched shots at goal the crowd expecting a bloodbath were captivated by such a young and aggressive side perdita goaded miguel like an angry wasp angel turned on by the odds stacked against him hurled himself on juan as though he was a mirage pilot once again he was also brilliantly interchanging with patricio as luke constantly fed them with passes while doggedly taking out one obrien player after another as they thundered towards goal the cognoscenti however noticed that although perdita was often in a position to score goals angel and patricio never passed to her and that alejandros ponies enjoying lukes light hands and sympathetic riding were going really well the girls noticed angels hawklike good looks studying their score sheets and not realizing that he was a poor relation of the solis de gonzales they were turned on by his ancient name they were soon even more excited by his clowning miguel sobering up and getting paunchy was deeply unamused by this new young stag entering the forest just as angel was throwing himself out of his saddle for a nearside forehand miguel put his knee under angels knee so he overbalanced and tumbled off his pony next second angel had leapt to his feet belted after the pony and jumped on again before miguels brotherinlaw the umpire could whistle man down idolo shouted juans busty blonde admirer transferring her loyalties this piece of circus produced roars of laughter from the crowd and seemed to shatter the obriens concentration juan throughout the first half was noticeably eyeing sharon kaputnik who was standing behind victor coyly resting her pointed chin on his bald head which enabled her to eye anyone she chose at the beginning of the third chukka luke came out on fantasma whose beauty drew all eyes like the rising moon she was so quick at the throwin that luke immediately got the ball out lofting it upfield over patricios head so he was able to ride miguel off and score two minutes later miguel one of those aggressive backs who got bored hanging around the back line and irritated because luke was playing so well came roaring down with the ball tearing after him perdita lurched forward to hook his stick a second later to her utter humiliation he had blasted the ball taking perditas stick and very nearly perdita with him acutely aware of angel and patricio raising their eyes to heaven perdita had to decide whether to dismount and pick up her stick or race to midfield where raimundo was brandishing another one she opted for the latter as angel careered down the boards to stand in for her and bump miguel miguel clouted the ball straight at angels face seeing it coming angel threw himself off his pony get back on that horse screamed patricio as miguel picked up the ball again and took it towards the mendozas goalmouth i dont want to be killed yelled back angel once more the crowd howled with laughter fortunately fantasma believed in defending her goalmouth as ferociously as she protected luke or even a bucket of pony nuts seeing miguel hurtling towards the goal she calmly sent his much larger pony flying stumbled and miraculously righted herself then positioning herself perfectly for luke to hit the backhand she instantly wheeled round and displayed a staggering burst of acceleration which enabled luke to power the ball upfield juans umpiring brotherinlaw was so struck with admiration that his whistle dropped out of his mouth what a horse thought luke exultantly devastating the obriens defence with an offside forehand he put the ball twenty yards in front of a remounted angel only perdita and an obrien cousin were between angel and the goal now angel didnt want to pass to perdita but as a hundred and fiftyfive pounds of obrien cousin with razorsharp elbows hurtled towards him it seemed the easier option the sweat cascading into her eyes made it difficult for perdita to see the ball aim for the left goal post dont go to pieces she told herself frantically as she scooped up the ball and tapped it into position youre going to be hooked bellowed luke glancing round she saw juan thundering down on her a predatory smile on his handsome face lowering her stick aware of angel on her left she flicked the ball to him under her ponys neck and with a lovely click of his mallet angel stroked in an exquisite nearside cut shot making the score to the mendozas on the halftime bell well played angel said patricio falling on his neck as they cantered off the field bastards thought perdita patting her pony over and over again we made that goal back at the pony lines morale in the mendoza camp was sky high the obriens might have scored nine goals but they had all been penalties it was only when she stopped playing that perdita realized how hot it was towelling the sweat off her face she wrung out her wet shirt she would have liked to have drunk a whole bottle of evian but limited herself to a few gulps which she immediately spat out angels olive skin had hardly changed colour but luke rode up with his face brick red from the heat and delighted that fantasma and his team had played so brilliantly well played you guys theyre mad now theyre rowing amongst themselves that was a helluva shot angel and from you patricio youre making juan look as though hes never been on a horse before then taking a swig of diet coke he turned to perdita well done baby you made that last goal setting up the shot for angel perdita could have wept with gratitude particularly when he turned on the others you gotta give perdita more work shes dying of loneliness and heat stroke out there for a brief minute he massaged her shoulders pressing his thumbs in unknotting the muscles and i hope you notice shes covering for you whenever you get loose patricio put a perfunctory hand on perditas shoulder which was an amazing concession but angels eyes were still as cold as an alaskan lake christ i wish there was a ladies loo said perdita taking a swig of lukes diet coke and rubbing ice all over her burning face use the mens room said luke ill keep guard but be quick perdita was in such a hurry that at first she didnt notice the gasps and groans that were coming from the nextdoor cubicle the walls of which seemed to be heaving as violently as fantasmas sides after the last chukka then overwhelmed by curiosity she climbed on to the lavatory seat and peering over had to stifle a scream of laughter for there was sharon her big hat lying like a whole brie on the floor her parasol neatly folded in the corner and her muslin skirt and silk petticoat once more over her head while juan bronzed hands clamped to her snowwhite bottom drove in and out with far more energy than hed shown on the field oh hooarn hooarn gasped sharon as one of his brown hands disappeared into her bush aym comin glancing out of the glassless window perdita saw a grimfaced mrs juan advancing towards the gents and not wanting to be blamed shot out of the door hysterical with giggles she told luke sharons umbrella is down probably thinks its unlucky indoors but juan is definitely up pity grinned luke therell be no holding him now sharon was certainly holding him just then said perdita doubling up with laughter again talk about long dong juan shall we tip off victor then he wont buy any of juans ponies come on said luke trying to be serious get back on chimango weve got a match to win thank god my father isnt playing murmured patricio to angel as aware of the admiration of the crowd they rode back on to the field i love my father but señor gracias is better captain he doesnt shout all the time and he puts us on the right horses i hope he stops that shit miguel killing me said angel chucking away his cigarette i cant believe were so much ahead and can beat them said patricio but as they went into the fatal fourth the sun went behind a donkeygrey cloud and everything went wrong angel trying to block a shot went straight across juan who was given a thirtyyard penalty which miguel tipped between the posts patricio at last obeying lukes nagging gave perdita a lovely pass just in front of goal which she promptly hit wide then down the other end angel backed the ball by mistake to miguel who promptly scored i know about zee horses sighed raimundo at midfield but not about zee players two more dubious fouls were called against the mendozas and then juan liberated by his bang in the loo suddenly woke up eyes sparkling medallion glittering in the returned sunlight he went into an orgy of brilliance notching up nine goals in one chukka hooarn has not lost his touch said sharon smugly as juan swaggered back to the pony lines acknowledging the cheers with his stick steady down steady down we can do it we can do it urged luke walking round banging his right fist into the open palm of his left hand juans on a really fast pony this chukka angel dont get into a horse race with him you gotta outfox him and not let him get the ball but nothing could stop juan and his magic mallet now tapping in four goals in as many minutes he levelled the score getting the ball out yet again he set off upfield vamos vamos yelled the crowd as angel whipped and spurred his slower pony after him luckily the ball hit a divot juan missed it and angel checked his pony for the backhand instantly miguel crashed into him broadside ramming him so hard that the pony swung round degrees totally winded up went the sticks of the mendozas faulazo they yelled faulazo yelled claudia and the mendoza supporters faulazo yelled almost the entire crowd jaime the umpire shot a nervous glance at mrs juan who folded her arms implacably and shook her head jaime was just awarding against angel for crossing miguel when perdita took matters into her own sweaty hands charging up to miguel she bashed him on the wrist with her stick stop it you great bully she screamed thats the third time youve tried to kill angel for chrissake perdita roared luke lifting his stick miguel would have clouted her back if the obrien brotherinlaw hadnt bravely ridden between them giving perdita a bollocking he awarded the obriens a free goal why you do that angel asked her in amazement i hate you spat perdita but i hate dirty play even more unfortunately alejandro had chosen the worst possible time to arrive and witnessed the whole incident guilty at rolling up so late after a little detour to buenos aires and expecting carnage he was irritated to see how staggeringly well his team had done without him stopping only briefly to kiss sharons hand and embrace victor and make sure they would be staying the night in general piran he went off to shout at his team youre all loose stop tapping and eet it you change wiz angel luke so you can mark juan and as for you he turned roaring on perdita ow dare you it miguel you should ave been sent off i said we shouldnt ave played her he added to luke finally glancing at the four ponies being walked round for the last chukka he bellowed that they were the wrong ones and ordered raimundo to tack up others immediately luke had gone very still leave those ponies as they are he said softly to raimundo then taking alejandro by the arm drew him away from the others you asked me to captain this side because you were too goddam lazy to play and you dont like being pussywhipped they played like angels right and unless you want my fist in your fucking face get off my case alejandro was so flabbergasted that he sauntered off to regain some ascendancy by extravagantly complimenting sharon now calm down said luke turning back with a grin to his astounded team theyre only two goals ahead and were younger fitter and braver lets bury them seeing juan mounting a black thoroughbred who could have won the kentucky derby he put angel up on a very fast dark brown mare hed intended to ride himself then he had a battle with his conscience if he rode fantasma again they had twice as good a chance of winning but if victor and sharon took another look at such a showy beautiful horse they might want to buy her he glanced over at fantasma who was dying to get back into the action standing gazing at the pitch her dark eyes wide with excitement scraping up the dust with her hooves she ran her muzzled nose restlessly along umbertos arm until he cursed her as he led her round luke went over and tightened her girths hed have to find more money from somewhere else perdita was now riding a beautiful chestnut called cuchilla good milk perdita angel called to her as they cantered upfield for the throwin perdita ignored him i say good milk perdita oh fuck off she snapped she assumed it was some beastly crack implying that she should be breastfeeding rather than playing somehow in the last chukka the mendozas steadied but it was a pandemonium of frantic swordplay and scrimmaging around the mendoza goalmouth until it seemed impossible that the goalhungry greenandwhite posts hadnt swallowed the ball finally taking a fearful risk luke left his back door open and took the ball upfield outrunning juan snaking fantasma past the two obrien cousins then passing to angel once again only perdita who was glued to miguel stood between him and goal aware there was no way angel would give perdita the chance to score miguel galloped forward to bump him off the ball discounted ignored perdita waited despondently behind him good milk indeed then to her amazement angel had passed miguel with a ravishing offside forehand landing right at her feet for a second she froze as miguel yanked his horse round so violently that he cut its mouth and pounded towards her then with her back to the goal and no time to position herself she executed that most foolhardy of shots known as the millionaires because only a rich man can afford to jeopardize his pony in this way pulling the ball towards her she slammed it between cuchillas beautifully clean front and back legs and under her boundup tail having miraculously missed any limbs the refractory ball hit the posts and bounced back bad milk perdita shouted angel then galloped up screaming dejala dejala dejala next moment he had scored and the crowd went wild only one goal behind with two minutes left bad milk perdita said angel riding up to her as they cantered back for the throwin jaime calavessi who longed for an obrien victory to get him off the hook hurled the ball in taking no chances juan tapped it away and set out like paul revere on his thoroughbred black pony glitz as he galloped down the boards patricio raced alongside him waiting for a chance to ride him off and pinch the ball failing to tempt patricio on to his line juan suddenly pulled glitz up in a frenzy of outrage twirling his stick to indicate hed been crossed manufactured yelled luke patricio angel and perdita in unison then advancing on a cringing jaime that foul was manufactured faulazo yelled the obriens closing in on jaime jaime fingered his aching jaw glancing up he saw an unsmiling mrs juan draw her finger across her throat in a superb display of arrogance miguel walked his pony off to a spot thirty yards from the mendozas goal as though the penalty was a fait accompli jaime awarded the penalty to the obriens its not bloody fair said perdita as they lined up behind their back line this whole game is rigged and why does that bastard angel keep saying good and bad milk to me luke was revving fantasma up to block miguels shot but suddenly he laughed the word leche means milk and luck in spanish i guess angel was trying to wish you luck jaimes conscience was troubling him there was only a minute left and miguel was messing around joking with the other umpire his brotherinlaw making a great play of teeing up the ball jaime caught sight of perditas anguished face shed played so well and she was so much prettier than mrs juan and he was after all a susceptible argentine shutting his eyes waiting for a thunderbolt to descend he blew a foul on miguel for wasting time when all the obriens closed in on him he appealed to the third man who woke up with a start deciding that the obriens were getting above themselves he upheld jaimes decision giving the obriens no time to reassemble themselves luke lofted the ball over their heads slap between the posts with a minute to go the score was tied the throwin was murder sticks going everywhere luke felt fantasma wince as the ball hit her smack on the knee but such was her courage that she limped for only a few paces then set out again vroom vroom vroom to defend her own goal the clock showed only twenty seconds left as luke saved the mendozas from certain defeat with another backshot swinging round he streaked up the field like a man on a motor bike outrunning juans black thoroughbred passing the two obrien cousins what a glorious horse any minute he expected her to take off like pegasus leering like some terrible shark miguel was now coming towards luke and fantasma at rightangles luke waited until the last moment to pass to patricio who passed to perdita im going to score at last she thought joyfully then groaned in horror as she hit wide they were all in the goalmouth now raising such a dust with their flailing sticks that noone could see five seconds to go then miraculously perdita saw the ball six feet in front of her one of the obrien cousins was looming in through the smokescreen on her right clambering halfway up cuchillas neck only just managing to stay on by clinging on to the martingale with her left hand she lunged forward and with a onehanded billiardcue shot ignoring the pony crashing in on her left she shunted the ball between the posts she would have fallen under the pounding hooves if someone hadnt grabbed her primrose jersey ripping it apart in the process so her slim brown shoulder was laid bare and tugged her back into the saddle coughing and spluttering she swung round reluctant to take her eyes off the jubilantly waving red flag then realized in amazement that it had been angel for a second they glared at each other then yelling weve beaten the obriens they fell into each others arms having drunk a great deal of champagne they drove home in a manic mood yelling juan obriens body lies amouldering in the grave but his cock goes pumping on and howling with laughter it was a beautiful evening a great stretch of brownflecked cloud lay like a turneddown sheet over an endless blue blanket they had each been given a little silver cup perditas lay between her thighs clinking against lukes angel clutched his and in its reflection he occasionally examined an eye that was turning purple where miguels elbow had caught him luke drove his heart simultaneously bursting with pride and heavy with foreboding hanging from the windscreen was the red white and blue rosette fantasma had won as best playing pony even though shed nearly savaged the vip presenting the awards when he tried to pin it on her headcollar everyone wanted to buy her now alejandro might even overcome his greed and hang on to her himself worse still angels arm lay along the back of the seat grazing perditas hair was he going to lose her and fantasma wondered luke then he told himself not to be absurd neither was his to lose as he listened to angel and perdita reliving every stroke of the game it never occurred to him to mind that it had not occurred to either of them that he had set up every goal they scored juan asked me for my card said angel he asked me for other things said perdita stupid prat i dont like used men i wouldnt touch him with a pitchfork dont talk to me of peetchforks shuddered angel then waving airily at the pampas my greatgrandfather used to own all this land we was in charge of the frontier to the north to buenos aires it was civilized to the south it was indian my greatgrandfather and the army destroyed the indians they were orrible very nonu perdita giggled you make margaret thatcher sound like karl marx how long did it take to tattoo that heart on your arm about a bottle of wheesky said angel perdita screamed with laughter oh christ thought luke i meant to bring them together but not that much give us a poem luke said perdita something to cool us down luke thought for a minute whose woods these are i think i know he began his voice was hoarse from the dust and shouting his house is in the village though he will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up with snow listening perdita thought about snow in rutshire and battling through the drifts to take hay to rickys ponies the woods are lovely dark and deep went on luke with a slight break in his voice but i have promises to keep and miles to go before i sleep and miles to go before i sleep ive got miles to go before i sleep thought angel until i get to england and avenge pedros death eagle said luke pointing to a quivering dot in the sky there are three good things about the argentines said angel their nature birds flowers and theengs their women and their individuality but they are very ghastly in a crisis you were pretty good today said perdita i think the argentines are the loveliest funniest people in the world later they went to a local nightclub to celebrate sharon kaputnik regal in midnight blue with her red hair piled up on top was practically held together by sapphires if you threw her into the river murmured luke shed sink like virginia woolf alejandros the wolf said perdita hes had his hand up her skirt all dinner i dont know if its a compliment to alejandros rightarm muscles or the beef that he can cut it up with a fork victor as usual adoring the sound of his own voice was slagging off the obriens all argentines are crooks alejandros not laike that said sharon whose eyes were getting rather glazed nevair said alejandro whose hand was still burrowing miguel boasted theyd win easy today went on victor easily victor easily corrected sharon you ought to learn to talk proper laike what i do she very beautiful whispered angel shes hell hissed perdita all you argentines are too stupid to see how naff she is and someone should get alejandro a finger bowl all aym interested in is buyin that lovely waite pony fandango said sharon luke aching all over from bangs and bumps was overwhelmed with tiredness the strain of captaining the team was now telling on him a bang on the ankle which was now so swollen he couldnt get a shoe on ruled out any dancing so he was forced to watch perdita and angel joyfully celebrating their armistice on the dance floor perditas arctic blond hair flew loose and newly washed as usual luke had boiled up the water for the shower her body was starkly but seductively clad in an elongated black tshirt angels khaki face was deadpan his eyes never moved from perditas as his body writhed like a snake sharon gazed at angel greedily who does that young man play for in palm beach she asked luke no one at the moment ayll have a word with victor an hour later perdita having bopped also with alejandro and victor came back and threw herself on lukes knee like a child oh luke darling im having so much fun its all due to you without you alejandro would never have let me play and hes just been really complimentary and youll never guess she put her mouth to lukes ear as her hair tickled his cheek and he smelt her scent and felt the excited heat of her body his senses reeled sharon whispered perdita is going to put a mogadon in victors brandy so she can spend the whole night with angel thatll be three men in one day she is a whore dyou think angel will shout port stanley at the moment of orgasm and stick a blueandwhite flag on her bum so perdita wasnt falling for angel luke felt almost giddy with relief then reality reasserted itself and alejandro says i can ring ricky when i get home went on perdita joyfully arent the argentines the most adorable people in the world perditas euphoria was tempered the next morning while sharon enjoyed her beauty sleep and possibly alejandro as well victor played in a practice game with alejandros young sons and angel perdita and patricio who all had fearful hangovers determined to try out fantasma victor had only been deterred because alejandro lied that shed come up slightly lame from her bang on the knee yesterday you see how good she was no need to try er victors game had not improved since he slumped around on other horses like a sack of pony nuts crossing everyone as the sun grew hotter and her headache worse his uselessness began to irritate perdita the others were letting him get away with murder they couldnt be that hungover as he teetered towards her she rode him off so viciously he nearly fell off come ere yelled alejandro whod just arrived then dropping his voice as she drew near lay off you stupid beetch his conniving little eyes were vicious with fury at the prospect of losing a good deal your job ees to make veector look breeliant and for im to score as many goals as possible so for the next halfhour they all cantered round tipping the ball on to the end of victors stick greeting every goal with roars of applause your horses are much better schooled than the obriens said victor as he rode off the field flushed with triumph he proceeded to buy twenty horses and said that after lunch he would haggle with alejandro over a price for fantasma luke whose ankle was murder had spent a frustrating morning in the village telephoneexchange tracking down his patron hal peters the automobile billionaire he finally located him in the four seasons in new york closing a megadeal with some italians fantasmas a dream shouted luke lines me up for every shot changes legs at a gallop got acceleration that brings tears to your eyes she outran all the obriens ponies yesterday and shes only four you talking about a woman said hal peters who wanted to show off to the italians and their bimbos is she pretty prettiest horse you ever saw silver as a unicorn and all the grace if we have her on the team everyonell talk about her best publicity you could have but weve gotta move fast people are after her pay what you like said hal luke belted back to the house to tell alejandro he could top any bid of victors and the haggling started in earnest i buy her for as a two year old said alejandro bullshit said luke she only came into the yard two months ago and you told me patricio only paid for her alejandro gave a great roar of laughter that was when he bought her now i am selling her they settled for in the afternoon luke had a telephone call at alejandros from his father also in new york off the drink and living on shrimp and diet coke in order to shed ten pounds before the palm beach season bart was not in a good mood he did however congratulate luke on going up to seven in the latest handicap listings and asked him to join him bibi and red in the fathers and sons tournament which began in the middle of december ive got to fly a lot of horses back for myself and hal said luke but if you can put in a substitute for the first two games i should make the semifinal hows red lousy said bart got himself involved with some actress called auriel kingham christ luke tried not to laugh wasnt she at college with grace almost said bart shes junked her husband whos citing red so weve got reporters staking out the house night and day bart however was much more furious because the underhandicapped player known in the game as a ringer whom hed signed up to play with him juan and miguel in palm beach had been put up two places in the november handicaps which put the aggregate of the teams handicap over the required twentysix i called the american polo association snarled bart i said weve paid him money and he signed the contract eight months ago and well pull out altogether because it wrecks our team but the assholes wouldnt budge luke privately thought that the apa having been pushed around once too often by bart had probably decided to take a stand ive gotta find another ringer at once said bart you got any ideas im pissed off with juans and miguels cousins sure said luke guy called angel plays like one too hes rated one here but hes at least four got class too ill bring him back with me it touched luke that despite their differences his father trusted him more than the obriens when it came to finding players having told angel he limped outside christ his ankle hurt he saw that perdita was cantering tero round the corral the change in the little mare was amazing she had filled out her irongrey coat gleamed like stainless steel her long silverblond mane still unclipped to indicate she was a novice fell coquettishly over her eyelashes her brown nose looked as if it had been dipped in paprika she no longer trembled or flinched away when perdita touched her and this morning a huge victory she had accepted a polo from perditas hand schooling and stick and balling her mostly behind alejandros back perdita had fallen totally in love with the pony and was desperate to buy her for apocalypse next summer but ricky hadnt answered any of her letters and hed been out when shed rung him last night now tero was executing a perfect figure of eight not flinching at all at the stick perdita was swinging around to get her used to it oh happy horse to bear the weight of perdita thought luke instead he said angels gonna play on my fathers team in palm beach next season thats great said perdita battling with jealousy what did angel say hes so fired up that he galloped three times round the stickandball field yelling sheet sheet im going to play for the flyers i warned him hed have to play with the obriens and that my father isnt easy but at least its a polo boot in the door lucky thing said perdita fretfully id love to play in palm beach as luke stroked teros satin neck it was difficult to tell if his hand was shaking the mare or the mare shaking him not looking up he drawled why dont you come and spend christmas with us its kinda wild and we can certainly arrange some polo dear mum wrote perdita that evening im having such a fantastic time i hate hate hate the way the argentines treat their horses but i adore them as people theyre so larky and funny yesterday we beat the obriens an incredible turnaround i got a cup so at least im bringing home some silver from argentina and since the match the argies have been so nice and are taking me seriously as a player at last theres an american here called luke alderton hes seriously nice too hes going back to palm beach next week after the open and has asked me to go with him and spend christmas there its a fantastic offer as their high goal season starts in january and as rickys not coming back to england until march theres nothing for me to come home to hope you dont mind violet and eddiell be home and id only disrupt things love perdita ps hugs and kisses to ethel and gainsborough thats the first letter ive ever seen you write to your mother said luke when she gave it to him to post perditas face shut down i keep telling you we dont get on luke still had eight more horses to buy for hal peters so the haggling went on amicable but deadly for the next four days going out into the yard the day before they were due to leave perdita was staggered when raimundo asked her into his little wooden house for some maté a herbal tea which gauchos drink out of a silver cup from a communal straw although perdita thought it tasted like grass mowings peed on by a dog shed learnt enough tact in the last months to say it was delicious and to thank raimundo for the honour as she left his house she stroked his lurchers who jostled against her desperate to be petted and looked at the ponies wandering loose under the gum trees in the twilight she couldnt see tero anywhere has she been turned out in one of the paddocks she asked alejandro sell her to victor asked perdita aghast shell hate it we must get her back is all right said raimundo soothingly señor gracias got her very cheap as alejandro theenk her hopless it was the only one e did alejandro overcharge him for the rest hurtling off to find luke perdita threw her arms round his neck oh thank you thank you ill persuade ricky to buy her promise you wont sell her on oh can i ride her in palm beach on their last night there was a massive barbecue called an asado under the stars luke pointed out the southern cross guitars strummed in the background everything was already packed as they were driving the horses to the airport first thing in the morning in thirtysix hours thought perdita ill be in palm beach she was so nervous and excited she fed all her dinner to the lurchers those dogs will go into mourning when you leave said alejandro try this he put some stringylooking white meat on her plate ugh said perdita tastes like chewing gum without any flavour what is it intestine said alejandro no worse than aggis i had aggis once in england it looked like sheet when i eat it i wish it was perdita laughed my stepfather was scottish he used to recite poems to haggises stupid dickhead we will all mees you said claudia sadly to luke youll see us in palm beach in less than a month said luke it wont be the same we will not be together every day who will mend my washing machine and the childrens bicycles who will tell them stories at night as pudding arrived a beautiful cake of meringues peaches and cream perditas mind started to wander was she doing the right thing staying with luke in palm beach and obviously sooner or later bumping into chessie and bart would ricky ever forgive her for fraternizing with the enemy would chessie still be as ravishing perdita was worried too because her image of ricky was becoming increasingly remote she kissed his photograph every night but often panicked because she couldnt remember what he was like her heartache had certainly lessened would seeing chessie trigger off all this hurt again absentmindedly she fed a piece of meringue to a hovering lurcher the eenglish are a strange people said alejandro they love their dogs more than their usbands we argentines are more romantic love is for always having seen that claudia was deep in conversation with luke perdita cracked back but not necessarily with the same woman in argentina went on alejandro the firelight flickering on his swarthy wrinkled face we ave a saying with you bread and onions it mean eef you really love someone money doesnt matter just being with them even if you only have bread and onions to eat is enough sure said luke whod been listening with half an ear id go along with that crap and bullshit howled angel and perdita simultaneously money ees essential said angel emphatically particularly eef youve once ad it i go to palm beach to find very rich beautiful woman perdita grinned im going to marry the richest man i can stand lukes face was in darkness he turned back to claudia later fuelled by bourbon alejandro became very sentimental i haf to tell you luke angel even perdita eef she learn to control the temper you are the three best pupil i ever have but luke his voice softened will always be my amigo and special friend one day señor gracias you step into my boots as the greatest back in zee world luke was touched but not too carried away the following morning not to check the horses they were taking with them alejandro tried to distract him by merrily checking and rechecking the bill wiz inflation at one hundred per cent eets probably gone up in the last five minutes he kept saying as he fingered his calculator like a lute player but luke was not to be deflected at the back of the lorry he discovered that alejandro had substituted a donkey of an old mare for fantasma only after much argybargy and histrionic protestation that luke was utterly meestaken fantasma was located muzzled hobbled but still trying to kick out in an old pigsty at the bottom of the garden with grey dapples ringing her white coat unfortunately as luke led her out the heavens opened as though the river plate had been diverted on to the yard and all the dapples ran alejandro was philosophical i cannot elp it eef my grooms want me to ang on to a good horse he said as he waved them off angel shook his head the argentines are a people very simpaticos but utterly irresponsible the flight was a nightmare of delays misroutings and arguments with officials over the authenticity of papers and fantasmas irritable inability to keep her hooves to herself then on the way to miami tero went berserk and nearly kicked the plane out she would have had to be put down if luke hadnt calmed her with a shot and almost more with his solid inevitably reassuring presence having groggily settled the horses when they arrived perdita fell into bed and slept for twentyfour hours waking alone in a very comfortable double bed she had no idea where she was groping for a light switch she realized she was in lukes bedroom the only furniture apart from the bed was a chest of drawers and a record player the colour in the room was provided by the books which covered the walls and much of the carpetless floor but in orderly piles four whole shelves were devoted to tapes and records mostly classical and luke must have bought every book on polo albeit secondhand the rest of the books seemed to be poetry and novels american english and translations from every european language including latin and greek opening the curtains perdita was almost blinded by sunshine blinking she realized shed been sleeping in the attic of an lshaped barn to the right she could see a row of loose boxes and behind them a stickandball field with floodlighting so horses could be worked after dark beyond were paddocks dotted with pines gums and palm trees she could see tero and fantasma grazing contentedly theyd become even more inseparable after the ordeal of their first flight below her in the yard luke stripped to the waist in a pair of faded bermudas was talking nonsense to a pony as he hosed the soap suds off her dark brown coat a siamese cat with blue eyes and a blue collar weaved voluptuously between his legs watched jealously by a ferociouslooking black mongrel who had gone berserk when luke got home yesterday whos that pony perdita shouted down luke glanced up and smiled ophelia came from miguel obrien just a year ago when i first walked into her stable she used to turn her back on me put her head down in the corner and shake you couldnt put a halter on her how dyou sort her out handled her very gently let her get away with a few things all she needed was a little tlc perdita remembered how all the ponies had come racing in from the paddocks and nearly sent luke flying yesterday shed never seen horses so affectionate and so relaxed the mare was flattening her ears now as luke hosed under her headcollar then unbuckling it he gave her a gentle pat on the rump and sent her trotting off into the paddock to join the others what time is it she asked about halfeleven luke squinted up at her if you can get your ass into gear weve been invited to lunch by my father ive gotta wash my hair squeaked perdita feeling quite unable to face chessie and all my clothes are dirty i suppose i could wear my new leather trousers i wouldnt youll be far too hot said luke borrow one of my shirts second drawer down youll find coffee next door orange juice in the ice box and after argentina the showers like niagara my father wants to discuss the fathers and sons final tomorrow said luke as he drove into palm beach the beauty of this tournament is that families are forced to bury the hatchet once a year in order to play in it after the poverty and primitive barbarity of the pampas perdita couldnt believe palm beach on either side of the road reared up vast ficus hedges like ramparts of green fudge occasionally through towering electric gates she caught a glimpse of pastel palaces so like blocks of icecream that she expected them to melt in the burning sun occasionally down a side road she caught a glimpse of the ocean apart from the odd security guard noone was around in the streets limousines stealthily overtaking made lukes dusty pickup truck look very shabby in the back a security guard in himself sat lukes ferocious mongrel who growled every time an increasingly nervous perdita leant towards luke to check her reflection in the driving mirror hes worse than fantasma she grumbled let him get used to you said luke hes kinda over protective where im concerned he came from juans yard when the argies go home they often abandon a dog bastards said perdita whats his name leroy because hes big and black and from the south is red coming to lunch asked perdita i guess not he got his picture on the cover of people magazine this week as polos bad guy and auriel kinghams toyboy the piece inside was less pretty a charitable interpretation would be that the reporter stitched him up but i recognize reds style in most of the snide quotes like what luke shook his head ruefully describing chessie as an ageing bimbo and as shallow as a paddling pool saying she was such a gold digger she must have majored in opencast mining and that dad has to employ all his security guards ready gelded golly said perdita in awe i adore him already chessie is ok said luke firmly oh please make her have gone off prayed perdita as luke swung round the corner on the right towering above the ficus battlement was the biggest palest pink house in the road there you are alderton towers said luke it used to be eight houses dad knocked down three to extend the garden this one belongs to him and chessie the one beyonds kept for servants and guards anothers for guests and the other two for red and bibi what about you asked perdita thinking indignantly about the tiny kitchen and the bedroom overcrowded with books i make my own way said luke barts gates were swarming with press who were being almost kept at bay by two large guards go round to the back snapped the larger one when he saw the pickup truck then recognizing luke oh sorry mr alderton welcome home the reporters surged forward in excitement its luke the brother you got anything to say about red and auriel kingham mr alderton dont know anything said luke grinning knock it off you guys said the guard punching them back as his mate pressed the remote control to open the gates oh my god thought perdita im not ready for this instead of a lawn the front garden was covered in periwinkleblue slats like the deck of a ship which only stopped to take in the occasional massive mastlike tree the lack of foliage outside however was more than compensated by the tropical plants inside a drawing room almost as big as a hockey pitch was overflowing with scented orchids of all colours jungle flora rioted also over the wallpaper and the chintz on two vast sofas thirty feet apart on either side of the green marble fireplace did bart and chessie occupy one each on cosy winter evenings wondered perdita like at robinsgrove the grand piano was covered with silverframed photographs of members of the alderton family mostly on polo ponies but perdita only took in the one at the front of an adorable blond browneyed small boy who was so like ricky he could only be will she had never seen a picture of him before no wonder losing him had broken rickys heart tearing her eyes away she was staggered by the paintings including a gauguin two dalis a jackson pollock and three andy warhols which covered two walls spotlit polo trophies like a great leaping silver shoal of fish covered a third the fourth all window and now open looked on to a beautiful swimmingpool flanked by high walls entirely smothered in bougainvillaea honeysuckle stephanotis jasmine and pale pink roses through a wroughtiron gate on the other side the ocean flashed as peacockblue as angels eyes thats the best painting in the room said luke pointing to some massed pink waterlilies above the fireplace everyone says i married bart for his monet drawled a voice perdita swung round hell she thought shes more stunning than ever even ferocious leroy thumped his stubby black tail luke darling murmured chessie wafting the scent of lily of the valley into the room giving him the benefit of her body in a soppingwet limegreen bikini she weaved into lukes embrace as voluptuously as the siamese stable cat had earlier thank god youve come home to bring some sanity to this dump you look incredible as usual said luke kissing her on both cheeks this is perdita hi said chessie i hear youve been in argentina isnt it bliss but arent they lecherous juan and miguel would have gangbanged me years ago if they werent so terrified of losing barts custom chessie must have lost a stone since perdita last saw her and was on the borderline that appears exquisite in clothes but rather too thin uncovered with her very short streaked hair flawless golden skin and shadowed eyes she now looked more like the new boy every prefect wants to take behind the squash court than a rather tooknowing botticelli angel you stupid cow perdita told herself her own hair hadnt been cut for four months not used to the heat her face was still flushed from the hair dryer lukes red and white striped shirt belted with one of his few ties which had looked so sexy and original when she had teetered on his bed to see into the tiny mirror now just looked silly and her bloody brown leather trousers were too tight and punishingly hot it was entirely lukes fault for not being insistent enough that she shouldnt wear them beside chessie she felt like a carthorse let loose in the paddock at ascot despite her cool exterior chessie was plainly in a foul mood i was going to make bloodies but the colour reminds me too much of your unspeakable brother so i thought wed have margueritas instead pressing a bell she led them out to the swimmingpool where she and luke sat in the sun and perdita took refuge under a blue and white striped umbrella all because of him rattled on chessie weve been bombarded by the paparazzi one of the guards found a photographer up in that travellers palm yesterday afternoon barts had to double the security its like colditz ready gelded indeed auriel kingham was such a big star that perdita couldnt resist asking is she as beautiful in the flesh what flesh said chess scornfully there isnt an inch of cellulite that hasnt been sucked out shes so lifted she could wear her pubes as a moustache ouch said luke halflaughing wheres dad talking on four telephones reading faxes dictating letters playing with his computer thinking about polo why do i always end up with obsessives hell be out soon to give you his divided attention what took you so long she snapped as a maid came out with the margueritas grabbing one she drained half in one gulp hi conchita luke smiled up at the maid id honestly rather have a beer please ill have yours as well then chessie grabbed lukes marguerita and hurry up with that beer she shouted at the maids retreating back then turning to luke have you seen that piece in people luke nodded how dare he call me a bimbo hes the bloody bimbo selling himself to any man woman or rottweiler as long as they pick up his bills oh cmon said luke he was probably looped when he gave the interview he doesnt mean it course he does chessie lit a cigarette with a shaking hand your kid brother was born with a wooden spoon in his mouth for stirring things hes only jealous because youre prettier than him said luke feeding potato chips to a slavering leroy well he shouldnt expose his jealousy in public along with everything else and how your bloody father can play with him in the fathers and sons tomorrow after all those things hes said about me luke shrugged thats polo i know it hurts im sorry having finished her marguerita chessie reached for the second one barts secretly delighted she said bitterly because people said he ran the best barn in palm beach and was the only highgoal patron who fully carried his weight on the team hell need to be tomorrow redll be coked up to the eyeballs and bibis so busy working all hours shes completely out of practice and out of shape she added maliciously as a girl wandered out of the sitting room unlike you said the girl furiously i dont spend all day having my body and my ego massaged hi lukie she added kissing him you look great this is my sister bibi luke said to perdita amid all this paradise and effortless access to wealth perdita was amazed how aggressively plain bibi was admittedly her face wasnt helped by barts heavy jaw and a sallow skin but her hair the colour of marmalade and scraped back in a bun and huge hornrimmed spectacles only emphasized a big nose and hazel eyes that were unmadeup and bloodshot from the overnight flight from la her figure was also totally disguised by a severely cut lightweight pinstriped suit the only thing she couldnt hide were long beautiful coltish legs she was obviously trying to look much older than her twentytwo years totally ignoring chessie she accepted a glass of perrier from the maid and sharing the shade of another blue and white striped umbrella with a panting leroy started questioning luke about argentina perdita was getting saunaed in her leather trousers she must make some contribution to the conversation but a mixture of jet lag and chessies utterly haunting beauty had knocked her for six bart joining them a few minutes later made her feel even more shy a few more grey hairs had been added to his wolfs pelt and a few more crows feet to his angry aggressive eyes but he was suntanned and lean from frantic dieting and had kept his moviestar looks putting a brief hand on lukes arm but ignoring perdita he turned to bibi hi sweetheart what did the saudis say if they dont get those twenty lightnings before christmas theyre going to cancel the order ive shouted myself hoarse at the factory but they wont take any notice said bibi furiously bart turned back towards the house ill talk to them after lunch said chessie so icily that bart stopped in his tracks this is perdita she added bart nodded unenthusiastically in perditas direction then anxious to conciliate chessie new bikini nice suits you cost enough said bibi spitefully i saw the bill if red moves in with auriel you can fill his house with all your clothes they had lunch by the pool tunafish open sandwiches and a taco salad so delicious that despite the heat perdita wanted to wolf the lot chessie who hardly ate anything moved on to white wine when bart wasnt obsessively taking telephone calls he and luke and bibi discussed tactics and what ponies they would ride tomorrow bart would mount red and bibi luke would bring his own every time luke tried to draw perdita into the conversation bart rode her off he looked really cheerful however when he heard that victor had been fleeced by alejandro i saw lando medici at the players club last night he told luke he was boasting about this wonder pony he bought from alejandro fanfare or something the grey responsible for the mendozas taking out the obriens in the copa de republic i told miguel he was slipping to let her go is that a fact luke grinned thats three people alejandros sold fantasma to he murmured to perdita i really liked that piece in people said bibi loudly shut up luke said to her softly is it serious him and auriel with her it is i cannot understand how red can fall for such an awful polo player said bibi i played against her in a charity match in palm springs she simply cannot control her horses whats in it for red bibi shrugged he just says i want that and she buys it for him like what four ponies last week shit said luke chessie was so fed up with bibi and bart that she suddenly rolled over to brown her back and started asking perdita all about argentina youre probably too jet lagged today but next week ill show you worth avenue and we can go shopping id love a haircut said perdita ruefully ill take you to xaviers he wont chop it all off its gorgeous hair shes my rival thought perdita in confusion and suddenly shes being so nice to me if ricky saw her again now how could he possibly fail to be a million times more in love with her luke who was acquiring even more freckles in the sunshine was having his work cut out trying to persuade bart to give angel a years contract is he as idle and conniving as the rest of them asked bart hes lovely butted in perdita youll really like him im not gonna socialize with him said bart rudely i just want to know if the guys any good my husband has so much charm said chessie lightly having refused the fruit salad she lit a cigarette and as bart was now jabbering on the telephone to some jap turned to bibi hows your love life fine said bibi picking only lychees and guavas out of the fruit salad then adding to luke i sure appreciate you telling ricky to look me up in la then smiling evilly almost toadlike she turned back to chessie i know dads cute but how could you dump ricky he is to die for we spent a lot of time together really chessie drew slightly faster on her cigarette hes being such a wow with all the movie stars hes coaching went on bibi slowly pouring too much cream over her fruit salad being ricky he hasnt a clue who any of them are and keeps yelling come here you to stacy keach and pamela sue martin and stefanie powers they just adore him luke put a hand over perditas dont rise he murmured shes only winding chessie up of course the women are spectacular in la went on bibi everyones beautiful there you must be the exception said chessie sweetly but she was balling her napkin hows rickys elbow asked luke holding up pretty good said bibi in fact he seems to be spending a lot of time on both elbows screwing his brains out there are women coming out of his ears oh cmon said luke sharply chessie didnt react perdita had less restraint i dont believe it she stormed rickys not like that how dyou know said chessie sharply im his protégée said perdita simply ive been working in his yard for the last two and a half years he fixed up for me to stay with alejandro and im going back to england to play with him in dancer maitlands team next year weve already met she added to chessie you gave me a lift home from david waterlanes party the night you got off with bart there was a stunned pause both bibi and chessie were looking at her as though she were a maggot whod strayed into their raddichio youll never guess drawled chessie as bart came off the telephone your sons brought a little trojan polo pony into the house perdita works for ricky and shes going to be playing for him when were in england next year you could be marking each other shell give you a hard time said luke evenly shes pretty good come on baby taking perditas hand he pulled her to his feet ive got work to do thanks for a great lunch briefly he kissed chessies rigid cheek see you tomorrow dad bart alderton was an indelibly competitive man but not altogether a bad one to spite grace and ricky who had both patronized him he had stolen rickys wife wills death however had shaken him to his workingclass roots afterwards he had been magic to chessie displaying uncharacteristic gentleness and patience not only wheeling in an army of bereavement counsellors but also listening endlessly and comforting her himself he had also been jolted by how much his defection had destroyed grace and the animosity this had aroused in bibi and particularly red until bart met chessie driven on by grace he had been a total workaholic who only played polo so hard because he liked the snob element and was addicted to winning but in chessie he had acquired the perfect accessory to flaunt on the sidelines having fallen in love with her as well he was so frantic to stop her ever going back to ricky that becoming a better polo player and annihilating ricky on the field had become his ultimate fix he was faced therefore with the conflict of winning on all fronts it was hard satisfying chessie in bed if his elbow had been hit by a ball the day before his right shin was black and blue from a pulverizing rideoff and he had to fly off to new york first thing in the morning how too could he concentrate on a board meeting if he felt as though hed been hit by a truck or when half his mind was on whether he could dump the sales seminar in detroit and the speech to the la chamber of commerce in order to make tomorrows final that afternoon when luke and perdita came to lunch in palm beach he was desperate to stick and ball but he was supposed to fly to washington immediately to meet the saudi minister of defence to clinch an order for helicopters picking up his briefcase he went out to the pool to find chessie doing backstroke with absolutely no clothes on at all surreptitiously being watched through the wroughtiron gates by two security guards whose crotches were bulging as much as their side pockets chessie he snarled christ she was beautiful with her breasts so small and firm they hardly splayed to the sides at all and her curling waist and the red jewels of her painted toenails smiling sleepily and lasciviously up at him she deliberately opened her legs so he could see the pink shining coral of her labia come out of that pool he said hoarsely fuck off you two sons of bitches he roared at the security men dad are you coming clutching a burgundy briefcase bibi appeared impatiently at the drawingroom window jolly nearly mocked chessie not closing her legs christ you slut said bibi in disgust you handle the defence minister said bart not looking round iranians like women they dont listen to them raged bibi you oughta be there dad give me twenty minutes said bart fives quite enough for your father said chessie you bitch said bart a minute later as he slammed the bedroom door why dyou keep winding bibi up for chrissake why does your bloody son wind me up screamed chessie why dyou have to play with him tomorrow weve been through all that said bart roughly then drawing her to him youll have to pay for it you know he felt her breath quicken punish me then whispered chessie he left her after half an hour sated sore but satisfied she hated him but he had totally cracked her sexually she wouldnt be swimming in the nude for a few days perdita was in a far worse mood than chessie i do not believe it she stormed too angry to cry as they drove back to lukes barn in wellington ricky is not promiscuous sure he isnt said luke bibi was just paying chessie back for asking about her love life bibis boyfriend skippers what we call a trust fund baby he lives off his father and does damn all and now hes playing her up hes an asshole but it always hurts i cant see ricky fancying her said perdita shes not remotely glamorous can be said luke as they drove past scummy canals full of condoms and coke tins when shes dressed up for the evening with her hair loose and her jewels on and her contact lenses in she looks fantastic shes tired too grace knew all the polo schedules well in advance so everything ran smoothly chessies not interested so bibi has to do all that as well as running the la office shes got a terrific body pity about the face and that chessies a bitch said perdita gazing moodily out at an airport where hundreds of private planes mostly alderton lightnings flocked like seagulls and shes so bloody beautiful mind you its easy if youre that rich christ id like to spend a million pounds on clothes and a hundred years in a beauty parlour if only i wasnt so broke how can i compete with that sort of thing luke touched her cheek with his hand youre beautiful no one holds a candle to you he ought to go home and tune up the horses for tomorrow he also had a mass of paperwork to go through having been away so long but to cheer perdita up he took her to palm beach polo club which was only a mile from his barn entering the gates they passed incredibly manicured land flawless lawns tennis courts and swimmingpools on the left were khaki lakes and polo pitches flanked by mushroomcoloured houses with wonderful gardens overflowing with hibiscus oleander and bougainvillaea fountains and sprinklers sparkled in the brilliant sunlight only the palm trees lurching lanky and gawky with their scruffy mopheads seemed out of place six years ago there was nothing here said luke cattle grazed and most of it was swamp that house belongs to an oil heiress shes twentythree that house cost fifteen million the husband bought it for his wife because she likes to watch polo they spend two weeks a year here and thats polo island and theres the house auriels rented they look like upmarket mud huts said perdita sourly fancy paying fifteen million for one of those theres the players club ill take you there tomorrow after the match and theres field one doesnt that give you a frisson driving on luke pointed out the most amazing barns each one painted in a different colour pale pink skyblue black and white all openplan and with the sort of gardens you could open to the public youd expect the ponies to spend all day painting their toenails and reading vanity fair said luke instead they come out on to the pitches and get bashed and yanked to pieces in the roughest polo in the world it all looks so perfect but up in those palm trees live rattlesnakes and in those smooth brown pools lurk alligators they symbolize the play a handful of the richest men in the world converge on palm beach every january merely for the buzz of taking each other out my father rolls up like genghis khan with seventy horses hes run out of challenges in the boardroom screwing a billion out of the government raking up another billion in the portfolio stripping assets stripping girls is nothing to being within an inch of death while you kick the shit out of victor kaputnik or lando medici or even hal peters on the field over in the uk you dont get the thrust of the patron they dont play to win here but to annihilate wow said perdita startled out of her sulks you do sound disapproving talk about the sermon on the mounted luke grinned sorry i was getting heavy its taken the fun out of polo but i guess ill exploit it until i make enough dough not to have to sell on ponies i like come and see the bestrun barn in palm beach as he swung the truck to the right leroy jumped across perditas legs scrabbling at her leather trousers not that it mattered beastly hot things and started barking provocatively out of the window at a couple of rottweilers who nearly broke their chains barking back barts barn el paradiso was built in the middle of an orange grove a colonnade of white pillars smothered in white roses and jasmine led up to where loose boxes painted duckegg blue the alderton flyers colours contained the sleekest fittest thoroughbred ponies perdita had ever seen an amazing tack room housed a computer giving printouts of every chukka every pony had ever played on the end was built an apartment with a bar a kitchen a shower room a massive jacuzzi to soothe aching polo bones and a living room with a vast portrait of bart on a pony as well as a stubbs a herring and two munnings on the walls how extraordinary thought perdita to have two such lavish establishments within half an hour of each other and no wonder they needed all those security guards and rottweilers on the gates outside white geraniums and impatiens grew in blue tubs and hanging baskets and a fountain fell as regularly as a transparent comb into a pond edged with white irises everywhere the orange blossom wafted suffocatingly sweet luke whistled at leroy who at a safe distance was still winding up the rottweilers come and meet red he said overwhelmed by such blatant perfection perdita snapped back sulkily that she absolutely loathed men with red hair oh well perhaps i dont she admitted in a small voice a second later for there cantering round a jadegreen paddock with a cordless telephone in one hand and a polo stick in the other his reddybrown boots the same colour as his sleek sorrel pony and his gleaming chestnut hair was red alderton but there was no red in his deep smooth mahogany suntan which was enhanced by onyxbrown eyes with thick very dark lashes a short straight nose and a wonderfully passionate smiling mouth for three and a half years perdita hadnt been remotely sexually attracted to anyone but ricky but red jolted her not only was he the bestlooking man she had ever seen but from the way he had knotted the reins on his ponys neck and was guiding her round the paddock with his thighs and his lean supple whipcord body he was also the most effortlessly gifted polo player hi you guys he said waving his stick at them and still giving himself time to execute another perfect shot be with you in a second lucy baby i gotta go hell be home tomorrow wont he so id better not call who did you say chuck had run off with a typical gemini red lived on the telephone adored gossip and had an increasingly low threshold of boredom people were invariably pleased to see him because he made them laugh and had so much charm despite his languid insouciance however he had barts killer instinct and although he adored luke had to beat him at everything normally he never bothered to stick and ball he was only doing so today because luke by sheer grind had gone above him in the november handicap ratings he was now winding up his conversation look meet me at cobblestones at six tomorrow love you too baby cobblestones is the bar where all the players and grooms hang out explained luke and thats not auriel kingham hes talking to thought perdita as red switched off the telephone luke introduced perdita shes from england shes going to play with ricky and dancer maitland next year i met dancer at a bandaid concert in new york last week said red christ i wish i didnt know it was christmas nice guy though kinda fun to play with i figured my stepmother had put me off english women for good but he smiled at perdita who blushed to the roots of her hair i guess you could convert me how are you enjoying this hot swampy mosquitoinfested paradise realizing perdita was too jolted to speak luke said we only arrived yesterday bring any good ponies one genius said luke and im not selling her on where did you get that one miguel bought her said red got the speed but still a bit green thank christ youve come back to help us clinch the match tomorrow before the semifinals auriel and i had our own private party and i went on to the pitch absolutely looped all i could see was two balls two mallets eight goal posts four ponys ears in front of me sixteen players four screaming umpires and after the match my father twice over chasing me round two polo fields out to bury me jesus throughout this languid patter dispatched with the broadest of grins reds eyes roved over perdita in a way that made her feel edgy and hopelessly excited at the same time the telephone rang making the sorrel mare jump hi lorna sweetheart how ya been sorry i didnt call ive been up to here then suddenly flaring up oh for chrissake get off my case red switched off the telephone so she couldnt ring back then as leroy bounced up and nipped the sorrel on her pink nose making her jump more than ever he added and keep that brute away from me he was so pissed off waiting for you to come home he bit me last week hell bite a patron one of these days hows auriel said luke calling an unrepentant leroy to heel pretty good said red blandly im teaching her to play polo shes teaching me other things shes in la making a movie about the corrupting effect of money as shes making five million bucks out of it i guess shes being corrupted all the way to the bank dyou want to play in a charity match next sunday asked luke red looked wary not a lot its for ethiopia bob geldofs flying down auriel better throwin said red she adores publicity who else is playing victor shark nelligan bobby ferraro and alejandro against hal me jesus and hopefully you how much were playing for free bullshit shark and alejandro wont even tack up for free nor am i going to be bashed around by all those thugs for nothing three thousand said luke ill think about it said red what colours hal peters on purple doesnt suit me grumbled red drains all my colour make it four ive got to buy auriel a christmas present ive had three offers for the world cup and two for the open by the way at that moment a car drew up in front of the barn and a man in a crumpled dark blue suit got out mr alderton im from the daily news how the hell did you get in here snapped red those rottweilers oughta be fired we had an appointment well we dont any more right could you just tell me about your relationship with miss kingham i could said red amiably watching the reporter brighten at the possibility of a scoop but im not going to he glanced at his watch i must fly literally ive gotta party in la this evening christ i better call the airport the minute he switched on the telephone it rang red listened for five seconds and then said aw fuck off lorna as he held the telephone at arms length perdita could hear the stream of abuse cantering back to the stable he calmly lobbed the telephone into the pond my brothers allergic to commitment sighed luke he suffers from the sevenminute itch thats why he took up polo said perdita at least his attention span lasts a chukka hes not a bit like you she went on as they drove back to lukes barn not a millionth as nice hes ok said luke he just cant handle people getting heavy but screwing out of you hes always broke countered luke because hes so generous not just with himself but to everyone else he could make a fortune playing polo patrons adore having him on their teams because hes so glamorous but theyre cautious players these days tend not to party till three oclock in the morning before a final theres too much at stake reds a party animal hes likely to turn up looped or not at all you love him dont you sure hes my kid brother but i hope to christ he gets back in time tomorrow red however did not get back in time perdita came in from stick and balling at midday the following morning to find chessie had telephoned to ask her to lunch at the players club and then to watch the match perdita was livid i havent got anything to wear i cant wear shorts or a dress because my legs are so pale and i havent had time to shave them and she only wants to pump me about ricky and i want to help you on the pony lines id keep out of the way advised luke youll enjoy chessie and she needs some friends reluctantly perdita did find herself liking chessie she was so unrepentantly bitchy and even more ravishing today in pale pink bermudas and a tshirt to match her pale pink and perfect mouth perdita absolutely adored the players club with its yellow and white striped awning and dark forestgreen walls inside which were covered with photographs of famous players there were the napiers looking thuggish and jesus very unholy and miguel and alejandro conniving and juan younger before he grew his celebrated black moustache and bobby ferraro and shark nelligan the two great american players ill be up there one day vowed perdita they took rickys picture down said chessie drily probably because bart offered them so much money hell be back said perdita quickly oh theres luke made it for the first time this year said chessie they stopped in front of lukes photograph he was so brown his freckles had almost joined up and he was smiling so broadly his eyes had almost disappeared lovely open face mused chessie and goodness he deserves to be up there he works so hard making those ponies night after night until he falls off with exhaustion and red just swans in and takes his pick of barts ponies i long to slip luke the odd billion in his tea bartd never notice he spends that in a year on vets bills and mrs juans electrolysis perdita giggled shes a horror isnt she the umpires are more scared of her than miguel chessie also showed perdita the glass case full of trophies the world cup a towering threefoot samovar and the gold jaipur horse on an ebony stand missing from its space on the green baize was the fathers and sons cup to be contested in a couple of hours perdita wondered if luke was getting nervous wheres the westchester asked perdita without thinking incarcerated in new york said chessie mockingly and i imagine its going to stay there they lunched on sancerre and lobster salad served by beautiful blonde waitresses in dark green shirts the colour of the walls and white shorts showing off their long smooth brown legs reds had most of them said chessie dismissively hell get some competition when he meets angel said perdita gosh this lobster is wonderful and the orange juice here is the best ive ever tasted i had four glasses for breakfast i went into a supermarket with luke last night and they were offering a free bottle of champagne for every bottle you bought thats palm beach said chessie bitterly when men get married they offer them a free bimbo as well is red really keen on auriel asked perdita forking up raw spinach likes the publicity said chessie although he wont admit it and adores annoying his father its also a wonderful coup for her she may be the most famous fortyfive year old in the world but heterosexual men are like gold dust in america and in palm beach nonexistent i promise you the women round here are carnivorous if i left bart for a weekend some frisky bit of crumpet would snap him up and its not just the bimbos every time he goes out to dinner he feels some crones claw on his thigh does red really go through lots of women chessie nodded this afternoon at the match youll see legions of amazing girls enjoying the sunshine and loathing each other theyre known as the red army they turn up in droves to watch him play like rupert campbellblack said perdita chessie perked up he adored ricky so much he bypassed me i was very disappointed they say there isnt a marriage he cant crack now he really is attractive i cant see what the girls see in red hes so narcissistic i mean he dyes his eyelashes they arent that colour at all and in the evening he wears eyeliner and just you watch the way he takes off his knee pads and smooths down his breeches before the presentation as they drove over to field two perdita felt despondent chessie was right shed never seen so many beautiful girls mostly blondes with hair that looked as though it had been tossed in the tumble dryer no one seemed to be looking at her perhaps it was because shed come from argentina where men stared and whistled at anything remotely passable that she felt so invisible in her old jeans and grey shirt dearie me said chessie happily as they drove past the pony lines and heard shouting i suspect ethelred the unready hasnt turned up she was right bart luke and bibi and their opponents the van dorens the father once a great player and still with a ninegoal mind and his three sons were all waiting to play reds pony for the first chukka was tacked up in his duckeggblue bandages and saddle blanket the umpires were looking at their watches but there was no sign of red the aldertons had won the fathers and sons match for the last three years and with bart on five red and luke on six and seven respectively and bibi now a useful one they should have walked it today but without red they were stymied the paparazzi out in force for red were enjoying listening to an apopleptic bart yelling at luke and bibi i dont know the shorthand for asshole or son of a bitch grumbled a girl reporter i wonder if theyre grammalogues the van dorens who were cool and wasp with very long arms to hook their opponents sticks were much amused that red hadnt arrived like every other player in palm beach they were fed up with bart bringing in ringers and spending so much on ponies that he priced everyone else out of existence chessie sitting in the aluminium stands with perdita was most amused of all the little shit she remarked not lowering her voice at all i warned bart not to rely on him and best of all his ghastly mother is sitting down below us take my napkin rub thy brow hamlet the silly old bag rolls up at every match the spectre at the feast to drool over her baby im afraid shes going to be disappointed yet again having only seen grace once a long time ago perdita couldnt identify her at first the one in the scrambledeggyellow dress said chessie perdita was shocked it was though medusa and jack frost had ganged up on grace in a single night turning her face to stone and her dark hair hoarfrostwhite she had aged twenty years she looked grieferoded and quite out of place on such a lovely day rain all morning had given way to brilliant sunshine every leaf and grass blade glistened palm trees like unkempt emaciated drunks lurched above the flawless green field and the mushroombrown houses a large crowd had assembled on both sides behind the boards the true polo addicts watched with the sun behind them those more interested in getting a tan principally the red army faced the sun pitch and ponies beckoned oh i wish i could play thought perdita bart will murder red when he arrives said chessie with satisfaction last year red got so fed up with bart shouting that he hit a ball straight into his ribs the year before bibi got knocked unconscious in a rideoff bart just bundled her into an ambulance and went on playing blood certainly isnt thicker than polo whyve they got three ambulances ones barts anothers the van dorens the third belongs to the club good thing theyve brought two fireengines to put out the blaze when red finally turns up look gracie is twisting her hermes scarf to shreds said chessie gleefully talk about grace under pressure we are not amused poor grace was even less amused a second later when a passing cameraman yelled up into the stands for mrs alderton yes called back grace rising regally to her feet but the cameraman was looking at chessie mrs alderton yes said chessie silkily can i get a picture of you on the pitch at divotstomping time sure said chessie if there is one doesnt look as though this match is going to get started she added in an undertone to perdita that will really wind up the old bag looking at graces stricken face perdita totally understood why red and bibi loathed chessie the crowd was getting restless down on the pony lines bart and luke were still arguing about a substitute luke had tried to ring angel but hed pushed off to spend the day with some argentine players and couldnt be traced which did not endear him to bart he wanted a sixgoal substitute which would enable red to play if he turned up luke who wanted perdita was arguing that theyd never find a six as good as red and with a lower handicapped substitute at least theyd get a fouror fivegoal start which theyd be more likely to hold on to because the van dorens were chiefly strong on defence bibi was backing up luke leroy who disliked rows because they reminded him of his former home in miguels yard came to his masters aid by biting bart sharply on his booted ankle causing barts security guards to reach for their guns luke called leroy off the row escalated up came the umpire shark nelligan a roughtough cowboy with crooked teeth who repeatedly claimed he was not going to kiss anyones butt shark hated luke because hal peters had been sharks patron in mediumgoal matches last summer but fed up with being ripped off and bawled out hal had switched to luke for the highgoal palm beach season youll have to forfeit bart said shark with some relish if youre not on the pitch in five minutes you can hear the aldertons rowing three continents away said chessie at least youre sitting in the best part of palm beach to hear all the latest scandal whose horses are unsound whose are for sale which pros are about to be dropped whos made the latest hothorse deal chessies eyes sparkled wickedly whos screwing who youre the latest gossip me gasped perdita chessie lowered her voice only a fraction luke bringing you back from argentina cassandra murdoch his girlfriend is shattered but im not his began perdita aghast thats her down there chessie pointed out a tall brunette in a rustcoloured shirt and white sawnoff jeans lukes levelled with her wrote to her some weeks ago saying it was over and how desperately sorry he was theyve been together for three years shes wiped out even more cutup than the pitch is going to be if they ever start playing but luke and i arent having an affair said perdita deeply shocked hes my friend faithful and just to me mocked chessie rumour has it youre sharing his bed i am not i may be sleeping in his bed but hes sleeping in one of the grooms caravans chessie shrugged im only passing on whats being said perdita was so shaken it was a few seconds before she realized luke was yelling at her perdita move your ass youve gotta play frantic desire to escape from chessies interrogation overcame any nerves perdita might have had she shot down the steps and only for a second as she raced along the boards was she aware of the holloweyed anguished face of cassandra murdoch one of the grooms had picked up her knee pads gloves boots and stick from the back of lukes car keeping on her jeans she dived behind a trailer and swapped her grey tshirt for the alderton flyers duckegg blue with the streak of dark blue lightning down the front and back and borrowed a band from a groom to tie back her hair there was no time to discuss tactics with a weak number four you could leave him advised luke but chuck van dorens very solid so stick around were going to be a fucking laughing stock snarled bart glaring at perdita two broads for chrissake knock it off dad said luke curtly zipping up perditas boots weve gotta fivegoal lead lets bloody well hang on to it next moment he had shoved perdita up on to reds pony for the first chukka a skewbald with a broad white face and a jaunty walled eye this horse is called spotty said luke adjusting her stirrups he couldnt outrun a fat man but he gets everything done because hes so handy and he never runs out of gas he also counts the crowd and shows off accordingly today hell shift faster than the lightning down your back vaulting on to the dark brown ophelia he cantered beside her on to the field where the van dorens bart and bibi were waiting news sizzled round the pitch that this was the english girl luke had brought back from alejandros the crowd relaxed happily in anticipation of slaughter at last bart was going to be taken out tempers tend to get up a lot on the polo field but never as much as when the most united families play together bart determined to play better than both luke and bruce van doren swore at his team nonstop how dare you call me an asshole you stupid dickhead screamed back bibi as she missed an easy undertheneck shot at goal ive never been so insulted in my life im not a fucking board meeting dad do not address me as a board meeting leave her alone luke shouted at his father cant you see she plays doubly horrible when you yell at her all the time at first luke refused to be rattled which annoyed bart even more i dont know why the fuck i asked you to come back from argentina he howled cant you be more constructive in your criticism said luke sarcastically dont give me that lip yelled bart leave it leave it he added thundering down the pitch and seeing perdita in front of him about to attempt a nearside forehand for christs sake leave it to me you stupid bitch dont call her a bitch you evil fucker roared luke the crowd straining to hear every expletive were highly edified the van dorens were so amused they failed to stop bart from scoring sixlove to the aldertons perdita used to playing with ricky was unfazed by the abuse but was amazed on the other hand by how much bart had improved having been coached regularly by miguel he now played well up to his five handicap a far cry from the ballchasing traffic hazard of three and a half years ago and with a polo helmet covering his greying hair and lined forehead and softening the crows feet round his sexy slanting eyes he looked virile handsome and much younger than his fortyseven years perhaps chessie might have trouble holding him after a dicey start herself as she frantically adjusted to the vastly superior acceleration and handiness of reds ponies perdita played gloriously spoonfed by luke who was desperate for her to do well and used to playing with him anyway she scored three goals finding themselves playing against two women and expecting a walkover anyway the van dorens initially behaved like gentlemen when they came in for a rideoff against bibi or perdita they just brushed them but after bibi and perdita had crashed back into them like a flying ton of bricks several times they sharpened up perdita too loving every moment of riding these wonderful ponies and turned on by the crowd who whooped at every good shot or goal scored and groaned at every miss had never enjoyed a game more in her life gradually however the van dorens the better side on paper gained the ascendancy at halftime when chessie was photographed pretending to tread in divots the score was tied at seven all by the middle of the sixth chukka the van dorens were running out the winners at and the heavens opened up went the tailgates like seats after a ball game off along the boards drove the lincolns the bentleys and the cadillacs of spectators anxious to get away before the mass exodus and assuming the van dorens had won bart had yelled himself almost hoarse when perdita lost her temper stop screaming and muddling us all she screeched at him and crashing off like a dodgem car with a ferrari engine sent the youngest van doren flying and scorched off to score a goal then almost before theyd changed ends and thrown in luke had got the ball out and handed it to her picking up her whip perdita belted down the field and scored again tying the score despite the downpour the lincolns bentleys and cadillacs stopped in their tracks and started hooting encouragement spurred on by perdita bibi scored as well to the flyers a minute to go chuck van doren got the ball out this time and leaving his back door open raced down the boards looking dangerous one glorious offside forehand took the ball well within striking distance another would find the flags luke pounding back to defend his goal desperately attempted to hook chuck the sight of the ball bouncing past however was too much for leroy barking joyfully he shot on to the pitch and just avoiding being trampled to death by chucks pony bore the ball triumphantly off into the pony lines the crowd whooped and screamed with laughter up went the van dorens sticks it had after all been an alderton dog who had crossed chuck shark nelligan who in the past had been bitten several times by leroy awarded a penalty three to the van dorens make him miss please make him miss prayed perdita unable to look fortunately the strain was too much for chuck who hit wide as play began the final bell went well played congratulations said the van dorens smiling and gracious in defeat as they shook perditas hand bart grinning from ear to ear and extraordinarily ungracious in victory dropped his ponys reins and taking his whip and his stick in his left hand put his right arm round perditas shoulders yelling hoarsely we beat those preppy fuckers we pussywhipped them thatll teach them to patronize bart alderton you played real super baby a square was roped off and despite the heavy drizzle a lot of people gathered round mostly to get a look at lukes latest acquisition who had played so well and who got the loudest cheer as she went up to get her little silver statue of a father with his hand on his young sons shoulder although she could see her reflection all pink hot sweaty and damphaired in the great silver cup from which the van dorens being the losers had the first swig she felt terrific particularly because luke was so delighted just then the heavens opened again and across the cutup pitch wearing dark glasses cream chinos a cream silk shirt a pale blue blazer braided with jadegreen silk and carrying a black umbrella across the front of which was written shit its raining sauntered red alderton sorry dad he said without a trace of contrition i got held up lucky you had perdita to fill in id never have played so good and this hangover would not have fitted under my helmet no fuck off ive got nothing to say to you he snapped as the paparazzi swooped id have disinherited you if wed lost said bart furiously i guess you would red put his head on one side and mom will probably disinherit me anyway so i better go make my peace well done he added to perdita youre definitely not just a pretty ass after luke had checked his horses he took perdita for a drink at the players club she was no longer invisible now everyone congratulated her immediately bart drew her aside and without even consulting chessie or luke invited her to stay at alderton towers you cant stop in lukes pokey rathole any more i like it protested perdita well luke cant like sleeping in a mobile home sure i do said luke well come for christmas dinner we have it at el paradiso luke raised an eyebrow in the direction of leroy who was looking up showing the whites of his eyes like two sickled slices of boiled egg his legs splayed out behind like a frog he was still carrying his polo ball and thumping his tail oh bring the goddam dog too if you must said bart irritably but im not having him terrorizing my rottweilers infuriated with red bart was doubly anxious to bring luke back into the fold like many men whose business enemies were legion he valued family ties very highly even while constantly abusing them his aim was to have luke financially dependent on him like the other two so he could manipulate him the neatest thing he could do would be to buy perdita half an hour later he and chessie had to leave to change for some silver wedding party perdita sensed that bart would rather have stayed and gone through every play of the match chessie was equally reluctant just another lot of geriatrics whinnying at bart and thinking what an unsuitable marriage hes made she said bitterly as she drained her glass of champagne shes far too young for that kind of evening thought perdita just before he left bart thrust something into perditas hand go buy yourself something nice he said chessiell take you to worth avenue glancing down perdita saw it was a wad of bills i cant she said trying to sound shocked sure you can youd get a fee as a pro you sure played a pros game this afternoon perdita waltzed back to luke look what your fathers given me jesus i could do with that right now thought luke perditad played so well he wanted to take her to chez colbert and pour moet down her all night but he simply couldnt afford it hed been financially crippled buying and flying back four horses of his own from alejandros who might take weeks to adjust to the palm beach climate he still had to pay grain bills and the grooms salaries nor had the fat cheque promised by hal peters arrived yet and he felt it was uncool to hassle he tried to persuade bibi to come out with them but she said she had too much work and had to fly straight back to la you played super she said to an amazed perdita you must be floating on air perdita giggled im floating on hairs the first thing im doing tomorrow is get my legs waxed very painful worse than childbirth warned bibi ill hold your hand said luke no one shall accuse me of not being present at the waxing the rain had stopped giving way to a glorious evening with a huge apricotpink moon and clouds rising like an indigo tidal wave on the horizon orion was lying on his back with the dog star above him it was hard to tell the other stars from the lights of the incoming planes the air was as soft as a shawl round perditas shoulders isnt palm beach the most heavenly place in the world she said taking lukes hand red was waiting for them at cobblestones the famous polo bar early diners were devouring huge steaks veal and french fries or mountaineering through vast salads in the front room which was very light decorated in icecream colours with some rather crude paintings of polo games on the walls dont think my father would fork out two million for any of those said red sweeping them into the darker bar at the back he was already very high and giggly drinking green devils a lethal concoction which included vodka crème de menthe and cointreau immediately he ordered a bottle of dom perignon for perdita and luke luke bought a packet of crisps for leroy who sat on a bar stool as close to his master as possible youll have to drop that ball now said luke if you want a potato chip i gotta job for that brute said red ill buy him a dozen polo balls if he eats auriels yorkshire terriers she ordered them tunafish sandwiches on the airplane and they threw them up just as we were landing then taking perditas arm he spun her round towards a square doorway concealed in the back of the bar that my darling is the famous disappearing door when husbands barge in here looking for their errant wives the lovers nip out through that door and thats the phone where all the players make assignations with people they shouldnt i dont know why they dont install a second booth for juan obrien and jesus a crowd had soon gathered round them congratulating perdita admiring reds blue blazer with the green silk braiding and asking him what the hell had happened auriel gave me a ferrari today in the colour of my choice i chose red to match my hair and my bank balance i couldnt just leave her and fly back what we all want to know asked bobby ferraro the great american player who was so strong no horse ever answered back and who was playing for the kaputnik tigers in lukes charity match is whats she like ok said red got more stitches in her face than i have in this coat but ok over the laughter bobby ferraro insisted no whats she like in the sack pretty good said red grinning takes some getting used to first time she gave me a blow job her wig came off in my hands i havent been so embarrassed since they repossessed my helicopter everyone yelled with laughter youre a shit red said luke shaking his head he had tried to call angel to get him to join them but angel was still out carousing miguel and juan are hopping youve brought this greaseball over said red they wanted another cousin they could manipulate theyll give him a hard time so will bibi shes got awful bossy not when she sees angel said perdita luke turned to talk to bobby ferraro who was handsome in a chunky neanderthal way bobbys known as allbrawn because hes so thick red told perdita comes from montana they turn the ponies out at night there if the wolves dont catch them they know theyre fast enough to play polo he yawned his fingers drummed on the bar he was getting restless unnerved perdita blurted out what did you read at university dirty books mostly sorry what did you major in underwater basketweaving oh stop taking the piss howdya like my ponies fantastic perditas face brightened ive never ridden anything like them spotty was terrific and that bay mare with the four white socks in the last chukka was like a porsche with four legs she came round so fast i nearly came off her each time whats her name havent a clue said red my father owns them juan and miguel school them i just sit on their backs arent you interested in horses not particularly a polo pony isnt an animal its a means to an end i disagree said perdita coldly so does luke luke loves them too much for his own good said red dismissively eats his heart out when he sells them on he ordered another green devil i wouldnt said luke and will you please lay off on saturday night christ its only a charity match snapped red but its my first game with hal ok and i want to win i hear hals found god said red thats one helluva pass luke grinned is auriel coming to watch you on sunday i guess so said red he seemed abstracted where are we going to eat charlies crab luke yawned hed been up at five and jet lag had finally caught up with him the adrenalin pumping in the match had given way to aches and pains all he wanted to do was to go home talk to his horses and fall into bed but perdita was obviously dying to go out on the town ill pay said red as long as you pay for the drinks here i owe them so much they wont give me any credit lets go he got off his bar stool and then got back on again second thoughts lets not following his gaze perdita noticed a girl with tousled dark hair in a flamered dress telephoning with her back to the room although she had picked up the receiver it was plain she was only pretending to telephone after a few minutes she looked round and gave a start of surprise hi lucy said red softly long time no see hi red where have you been hiding she had big brown eyes a face and body so oliveskinned soft and supple that they looked as though theyd spent their life in linseed oil and she smelt of dollars and diorella this is perdita said red my brother lukes just brought her back from argentina she played a blinder this afternoon stood in for me and scored four goals thats great said lucy who seemed to be laughing at some private joke and not remotely interested in goals suddenly perdita felt de trop she had a feeling lucy had something to do with red not getting back for the match she turned back to luke who was being chatted up my daddy owns a chunk of florida a stunning redhead was telling him youre a seriously good polo player are you as good in bed luke was just laughing perdita was furious dont be fatuous she said to the redhead just bugger off i was only asking the redhead flounced off silly cow said perdita crossly then added to luke chessie was telling me about cassandra murdoch luke looked at her steadily so that you went out with her for a long time and shes absolutely heartbroken she doesnt deserve that shes beautiful said luke why did you dump her then lukes gaze was unflinching because i met you i guess perdita felt herself blushing but there isnt she began i know but it wasnt fair to cass at that moment a waiter sidled up and whispered something to red and lucy oh christ gasped lucy the colour draining from her face my husbands just come in see you darling and pecking red on the cheek she shot out of the famous disappearing door instantly red shot round the bar to the darkest corner and engaged an eager brunette and her disgruntled boyfriend in conversation i guess my brothers been playing fast and lucy said luke a second later a man with a blazing red face and upturned white hair stormed into the back bar flanked by two enormous heavies jesus muttered luke putting three fingers through leroys collar red shouldnt tangle with that whos he winston chalmers said luke best lawyer in town on his fourth wife specializes in getting off very rich very guilty people im sure theres some mistake mr chalmers said the manager who was trying to block his advance mrs chalmers hasnt been in for days winston chalmers pushed him away as easily as a bamboo curtain luke alderton he bellowed i want to see luke alderton i know the fuckers here sure i am said luke you know my wife lucy never met her first time i clapped eyes on her was this evening said luke getting to his feet and towering over winston chalmers seems a nice lady thats bullshit said chalmers get him he ordered the heavies the next minute one of the heavies had hit luke across the room then as he struggled to his feet the second heavy helped him up and hit him again in the stomach then the first heavy came in with a punishing right to the side of the head knocking luke to the floor again then he gave a yell as leroy buried his teeth in his arm no one moved in the bar except perdita stop it you bastards she screamed snatching up a bar stool dont be silly honey said the second heavy trying to wrench the stool from her were bigger than you and call off this fucking dog screamed the first heavy reaching for his gun perdita put down the stool and grabbed leroys collar drop she screamed drop drop mumbled luke raising himself a couple of inches leroy dropped luke collapsed back on to the floor winston chalmers stepped over him kicking him in the ribs tell your friend he said to perdita to stay away from my wife if he contacts her again hell get acid in that ugly mug of his he is not ugly screamed perdita running after them out into the parking lot with leroy barking at her side but they had jumped into their big cadillac and were screaming off past a bank at the end of the road inappropriately named fidelity federal going back into the bar perdita found red chucking a bucket of water over luke what the hells going on she screamed didnt you hear luke saying hed never met her before this evening and now hes out cold and hes got to play on sunday she knelt down beside luke luke lovie are you ok call an ambulance she shouted at red im ok groaned luke feeling his jaw but i swear ive never met that woman before in my life i know you havent said red starting to laugh as he pulled luke to his feet whenever i call her up i keep getting winston so i say im luke alderton three days later perdita saw her first big sunday match and was staggered by the razzmatazz it had poured with rain all night so four helicopters were brought in to blowdry the field after a lunch of lobster chicken bilberries and champagne which cost each guest a head there was an auction for band aid and so that noone could avoid coughing up silver buckets were passed round the tables which were soon filled up with and bills each woman as she left was presented with a toy model of hal peters cheetah convertible and as she reached her allotted seat waitresses rushed forward to wipe off the rain with towels favoured clients of hal peters found glasses and bottles of champagne in ice awaiting them on the field before the match two pop groups belted out do they know its christmas any more and as both bob geldof and auriel kingham were alleged to be putting in an appearance during the game the media were out in force even with the temperature in the high sixties the huge grandstand was filled with women smothered in jewels and huge hats as if they were going to a wedding some of them were young and very beautiful but many were old perdita noticed some disgusting old crones looking like egyptian mummies whod spent the afternoon at estee lauder almost more gaudily dressed were the men who rolled up in jackets and trousers in an amazing variety of lime greens terracottas and crocus yellows and panamas with coloured ribbons bart whod paid for perditas lunch and her stand ticket was wearing an extraordinary petrolblue silk coat woven with yellow snaffles the teams had been expected to attend the lunch luke looking very pale had eaten nothing he had refused to see a doctor but perdita was sure he was still slightly concussed and his right shoulder was giving him such hell that he had to resort to repeated shots of novocaine his amusement on thursday night which had been aided by alcohol had given way to dread that he might be seriously injured he could only feed his ponies and pay his grooms if he were able to make and sell on horses from dawn to midnight and play high goal for hal peters it was crucial they won their first match this afternoon even leroy kept a respectful sixfoot distance from his master that morning as the teams lined up in front of the grandstand luke was further irritated by red who couldnt stop laughing at hal peters who was so fat that you could hardly see his pony beneath him hal however who was an even worse rider than victor kaputnik was loving every minute grinning from very clean ear to ear his face aglow like a dutch cheese he waved to all his friends in the crowd the commentator announced each player and they then had to canter forward to loud cheers taking off their hats while hanging on to their whips and sticks and controlling their ponies hals horse an opinionated piebald called horace nearly carted him back to the pony lines much to the joy of the crowd victors canter forward was even more hazardous as he had to hang on to a new and rather startling ginger toupee as well as removing his hat ay encouraged victor to wear his toupee announced sharon in the stands ay think one is as young as one looks there was another dicey moment when a vicar took the microphone and exhorted the crowd to pray for these brave players and begged god to look after them all and save the president aymen said sharon bowing her head hal being a bornagain christian insisted on putting his gloved hands together and closing his eyes during the prayer horace would have taken off again if luke hadnt grabbed his reins hal is about to be borne away again said red wiping his eyes pack it in snarled luke and where the hells auriel auriel who had promised to ride on to the pitch in a cheetah convertible and throwin had not turned up oh shell show said red arrogantly she likes making an entrance lukes reply was drowned by a rock star in a maroon shirt slashed to the waist inviting the crowd to sing along to the star spangled banner among the two teams there was great potential for aggro the thuggish shark nelligan was determined to take luke out for pinching his patron alejandro and shark both backs hated each other anyway and shark was particularly irritated today because alejandro being the higherrated player had retained the number four spot forcing shark to play at number three shark also hated bobby ferraro because he was younger and better looking jesus the chilean hated alejandro because theyd tangled over a cuban beauty last year and jesus had a longstanding grudge against victor because victor had sacked him after finding him on the floor of a trailer with sharon all of them except luke mistrusted red because he was conceited and unpredictable after ten minutes when auriel still hadnt shown up and the pop groups had played do they know its christmas twice more her place was taken by hals wife myrtle who was even fatter and jollier than hal and who whooped and thrust up her arms to the crowd as the purple cheetah convertible cruised to midfield chessie who was sitting in the stands with perdita looked at mrs peters in horror is hal advertising spare tyres as well as cars she said if he gets seriously caught up in polo hell certainly dump mrs peters in a year or two for a markii model with bumlength hair and a café au lait sprayon tan luke says they adore each other said perdita and pray by the bed every night mrs peters ought to pray for a fiftypound weightloss said chessie she was looking particularly beautiful in beige bermudas a white cricket shirt with the sleeves rolled up and a straw hat trimmed with pale pink roses perdita whod had her hair cut and thinned and was wearing a kingfisherblue suit which had given absolutely no change from one of barts bills was also feeling pretty good chessie had taken her to worth avenue on friday and increased perditas conviction that if she couldnt have ricky shed only settle for a seriously rich man huge thunderclouds were now gathering on the horizon with all the delays mrs peters didnt throwin until a quarter to four which wasnt much fun for the ponies whod been eaten alive by flies for two hours as the players waded in as though they were killing rattlesnakes a huge illuminated scoreboard like a blackpool illumination flashed up the name of the player hitting the ball and later whether hed hit a safety or a penalty or scored and how many seconds were left in the chukka ay hear angel that charmin argentine boy is playing for bart this season sharon said to perdita victor was most impressed by him do give him our number that player is most attractive she adjusted her binoculars bay jove whos he my stepson said chessie drily hes very appealing said sharon he never stops appealing snapped chessie hes the bane of every umpire in palm beach sharon was bubbling with happiness and hardly able to keep secret the fact that victor had poured so much money into the tory party that he was to be knighted in the new years honours list lady sharon lady kaputnik she kept murmuring to herself what a shame victor hadnt changed his name to something like cavendish whapshott oh theres hooarn arraiving she squeaked in excitement hello hooarn not a pantigirdle untwanged said chessie as juan in a black bomber jacket teeth flashing progressed along the crones to sit beside sharon mrs juans obviously been left in argentina murmured chessie the commentator meanwhile was filling every second with chatter the leather contraption these brave ponies wear on their heads ladies and gentlemen he was telling the crowd is called a bridle perdita giggled but she soon forgot the commentary and the crowd unable to believe the ferocity and the gladiatorial splendour of the game nor the crookedness of the umpiring as egos and mallets clashed below her why doesnt the argentine umpire ever blow a foul on alejandro she asked bart who had just joined them after yet another piece of deliberate obstruction because hes playing with him in the rolex challenge cup said bart youll also notice a tremendous dimension of intimidation not picked up in palm beach you dont make fouls anyone sees bart was furious that peters cheetahs despite the collective weight of jesus luke and red were losing badly against his detested rival victor kaputnik the large crowd always interested in a new patron watched hal peters charging round like a baby elephant crossing every player in sight so the umpire kept awarding penalties to the other side which alejandro effortlessly converted jesus was playing beautifully when alejandro allowed him to but red was simply not trying all his energy going into arguing with the umpire luke had to cover up for him again and again lukes novocaine was also wearing off his head was muzzy and he really had to concentrate to see the ball red in fact was sulking he had boasted that the notoriously unpunctual auriel would for once be on time because she was so crazy about him now she had made a fool of him by not turning up perhaps shed got wind of the fight at the end of the chukka the sun came out cautiously coats were being shed and crepey elbows and arms hanging in festoons emerged from wildly expensive littlegirl jerseys theyve even got designer liver spots in palm beach said chessie why does she bitch about everything wondered perdita on the field matters were getting serious the orange and black shirted tigers were leading the lentenpurple cheetahs when luke came out in the third chukka on fantasma who throwing off any jet lag showed staggering bursts of speed enabling luke to scorch down the length of the pitch and score two goals her action was so smooth and graceful that she jarred his damaged shoulder far less than his other ponies her coat was as dazzling white in the sunshine as the thunderclouds as usual her beauty caught everyones eye thats a good pony said bart runs to a stop so many horses stop on their back legs and take so much more effort to get started victor however was absolutely outraged that was the mare i bought in argentina he bellowed at alejandro you told me it had broken its leg i paid for that mare eees different mare protested alejandro innocently would i cheat you veector yes said victor hal wasnt very pleased either it was his first palm beach match and all his clients had flown down to watch him i thought you said your brother was a six hes playing like minus six and wheres his famous womanfriend you promised he grumbled at luke a minute later luke picked up the ball god his shoulder was agony now and giving fantasma her lovely head he took it upfield again carefully he placed it five yards in front of goal on the end of hal peters stick nows the chance for hal to be a hero for his team said the commentator hal took an almighty swipe and missed halftime and the crones took out their compacts and fluffed powder on their faces people poured on to the pitch to tread in and play some sponsored game in which they wriggled along a rolling poll and tried to hit a ball between two posts a helicopter dropped and bills on to the pitch and people scurried hysterically after them heartshaped gas balloons floated into the air trailing red ribbons down in the pony lines victor in between threatening to sue alejandro and luke for diddling him over fantasma was on his car telephone to hong kong trying to close a deal halftime ten minutes in england and normally fifteen in america stretched out to fortyfive minutes the game was losing all momentum they were just throwingin when another helicopter landed on the pitch bringing bob geldof cheering hysterically the crowd rose to their feet gaunt whitefaced unshaven totally unsmiling and all in black he was driven round the edge of the field in an open peters cheetah looking as though hed been to hell and caught it on an offday thats an attractive man said chessie takes suffering head on he reminds me of ricky said perdita unthinking chessie glanced at her for a second her eyes filled with tears yes he does she said bob geldof then picked up the microphone thanked the crowd for raising the incredible sum of and said he was sorry he couldnt stop but he had other engagements in new york and la as he left the wind got up and the rain came down and all the crones dived for cover under the roof at the top of the stand hanging baskets rocked hazardously in the wind men watched golf on tiny portable televisions perdita looked over a sea of coloured umbrellas as the players came back on to the field peters cheetahs were still down and luke was the colour of the pitch the fourth chukka was characterized by jesus having a shouting match with shark nelligan you should have checked he screamed at shark you dont ave to eet me so hard you came in front of me you greaseball bellowed shark you always do for chrissake shut up fucking eedioto screamed jesus if you take the name of our lord in vain once more young man you will not play for me again hal sternly chided jesus who thundered off in a frenzy of latin shrugs alejandro smote the resulting free hit yards down the pitch bang in front of victor and the goal leave the fucking thing victor youll only miss it yelled shark thundering down the pitch now victor kaputnik has the chance to be a hero for his team said the commentator victor took a great swipe and missed luke rode him off and backed the ball up the field to jesus who dummied round alejandro and passed to red who hit the ball once then took an idle shot at goal and missed luke rode up to him for fucks sake he hissed those heavies have totally buggered my shoulder get your finger out all youre doing is riding up and down breaking up the divots i cant pull rabbits out of the hat every time said red sulkily its only a fucking charity match ill murder that boy said bart furiously im going to chew him out he had just reached the pony lines at the beginning of the fifth chukka when a figure entered the stands smothered in a minklined barbour a fur hat dark glasses and several silk scarves she was so surrounded by minders that a rumour went round that it was princess diana or the presidents wife i want absolutely no publicity she was saying in a loud deep throaty voice to the bowing and scraping club secretary ive just come to watch a friend play polo miss kingham is here on a private visit said her publicity manager to the press a chukkas anonymity however was more than enough for auriel as red rode back to the pony lines after failing to score once again auriel called out to him instantly a smile illuminated his scowling face and he cantered towards her immediately she whipped off her fur hat her dark glasses her silk scarves and her barbour everyone recognized her and screamed with delight and the press swarmed on to the field lighting up the gloom with a firework display of flash bulbs auriel then insisted on going down to the pony lines and massaging reds shoulders and running her hands through his damp hair this is a fucking circus said luke on whose shoulder the latest shot of novocaine had totally failed to work hal peters in the meantime was kneeling down in the pony lines dear lord jesus if you think its right make hal peters and his team win this match and was nearly run over by shark nelligan returning on his fastest pony for the last chukka now will you start playing properly begged luke as he and red rode back on to the pitch dont worry ill win this match for you said red what a beautiful woman said hal peters gazing so hard at auriel that he bumped into the umpire red who always got a charge from holding back and lulling the opposition into a feeling of false security now proceeded to storm through with a volley of goals all in front of the press and the television cameras red red red was suddenly the only word on the commentators lips despite disapproving strongly of red perdita couldnt help melting as he hit the ball on the ground in the air to the left to the right underneath over behind and in front of his matching sorrel pony she realized that he was so supremely gifted he could win a match off his own stick if he played like that all the time said bart in an itoldyouso voice to chessie hed go straight to ten red also had rickys ability to get the last ounce out of his pony as he felt her tiring he picked up his whip hal peters was in ecstasy the lord has answered my prayer he told luke the tigers were only one goal ahead now with two minutes to go victor at this point decided to fall off and lie on the ground sharon busy making an assignation with juan looked without interest at the pitch then the horrid possibility dawned on her that if victor passed away shed never be lady kaputnik oh victor oh may husband she screeched hes done it on purpose muttered chessie to perdita then theyll put in a ringer instead to win the match water water moaned victor on ran an official with a silver tray a jug and a glass picking up the jug shark emptied it over victor dislodging his ginger toupee get up victor he said brusquely youre not hurt dont speak to me like that squealed victor you havent had your cheque yet from the ground he could also see the freckling of rust spots on fantasmas belly it is that mare alejandro i remember the marking spitting with fury he laboriously climbed on to his pony the umpire chucked in the ball come on you guys said luke faintly all he could see was a swirling mist in front of his eyes it was like riding through a snow storm next moment victor had crossed red and the argentine umpire suddenly taking against alejandro awarded a rightful penalty three to the cheetahs now is luke aldertons chance to be a hero for his team and level the score for another chukka said the commentator i cant take it my shoulders fucked gasped luke you take it jesus down came jesus in a slow theatrical canter alejandro cantering across goal blocked the shot for the tigers jesus pounded down to score but the next moment alejandro with a tengoal swing had hit the ball again lofting it halfway upfield into the stands only just missing sharon as the whistle went as the players surged together to shake hands fantasma showing a responsibility belying her four years swung round and gently bore luke back to the pony lines as though she were carrying a tray of waterford glass lukes hurt cried perdita fighting her way through the crowds she found luke slumped on an upturned bucket with fantasma and leroy ferociously but misguidedly protecting him from two of barts paramedics mrs peters sportingly stood down so that auriel could present the prizes the crowd surged forward to get a closer look auriel had reached an age when people wanted to see how many times her face had been lifted if it was all makeup or whether the cracks were showing in fact she was an astonishingly beautiful woman she wore a smokeblue chiffon dress to match her smokeblue eyes and her wafting dark hair certainly wasnt a wig and she had a good enough pinkandwhite skin not to need much makeup with her full bosom and hips emphasizing her incredibly slender waist wrists and ankles she made the lean blond suntanned polo beauties look slightly commonplace by comparison up came the players victor his toupee firmly in place was vulgarly delighted to win the cup it takes two teams to make a game droned on the commentator and they need two towels and a mirror to wipe away the perspiration each player gets something to take home i expect most of them would like to take home miss kingham red however was the only player auriel kissed and the crowd and the photographers went crazy despite his totally noncontributory first five chukkas red also won the most valuable player award to auriels somewhat exaggerated ecstasy hes stolen lukes thunder and probably his patron thought perdita furiously fantasma who won best playing pony came on muzzled and gazing fretfully back for luke a shimmer of silver white in the sun that had just returned she disappeared under a royalblue rug which stretched from her flattened ears to her newly brushedout but angrily whisking tail these horses are thoroughbred and specially trained chipped in the commentator we honour these brave animals which are seventyfive per cent of the game the blanket of honour is just our way of saying thank you to the ponies thats my pony yelled victor clutching his cup im getting winston chalmers on to you and luke alejandro if id known how good she was said alejandro to the argentine umpire id have keep her myself any disappointment hal might have felt at not winning was dispelled when he was photographed arm in arm with auriel by the entire press corps you smell wonderful miss kingham he said his dutch cheese face redder than ever its my own fragrance said auriel who had a heavily mascared eye for publicity its going to be called auriel ill send your wife a presentation pack i just adore your cheetah convertibles in the players club hal who was teetotal bought everyone else champagne wheres luke he asked gone to hospital said perdita whod arrived with leroy on a lead hes dislocated his shoulder he was in agony even before the match started bart clobbered him by the pony lines and threw him into an ambulance im going to see him in a minute he asked me to make his apologies oh poor luke wish him our best said mrs peters how brave of him to play with a dislocated arm when did he do it asked hal red suddenly looked wary on thursday night said shark nelligan evilly lukes been knocking off a married woman her husband stormed into cobblestones with halfadozen heavies and took him out both hal and mrs peters looked extremely disapproving who was the woman asked sharon winston chalmerss wife lucy said shark who was really enjoying himself pretty woman sighed bobby ferraro winston chalmers is handling my divorce said auriel in amazement then turning to red you didnt tell me lucy was having an affair with your brother didnt think it was any concern of mine said red going deadeyed that was a barnstorming game you played hal id never have guessed it of luke said mrs peters really shocked nor would i said red shaking his head thou shalt not commit adultery said hal sanctimoniously perdita looked out at the evening sunlight slanting across the pitch the thunderclouds had retreated and were turning coral pink in the players club garden begonias and impatiens glowed like jewels after the rain horses were being ridden home three abreast to their barns i wouldnt put anything past luke alderton shark was saying people who steal patrons steal other peoples wives and their horses chipped in victor bullshit said perdita draining her glass of champagne it isnt luke whos having an affair with lucy chalmers its red every time he gets winston on the telephone he pretends to be luke id stick to someone your own age in future she added to a furiously mouthing auriel and always remember to put your toyboys away before you go to bed the moment i divorce you chessie screamed at bart over the buzz of his electric razor youll be cut out of the forbes four hundred richest people list and ill be in it christmas had got to chessie as it had always got to her when married to ricky shed had to look after will as well as having rickys father and her parents to stay this year when she had nothing to do except instruct a fleet of servants shed decided she missed feeling sweaty exhausted and put upon like per cent of the worlds married women watching his wife rearing out of the bath her maenads face sullen as the water slid off her golden boys body bart tried to be conciliatory i know you miss will worst at christmas honey but theres a perfectly simple remedy have some more kids with me give you something to do and fill the gap any child i had with you could never mean as much as will yelled chessie bart had walked out after that it was the pattern of their relationship that she would play him up and he would punish her if she went too far but this time she knew she had overdone it and when she called his office on the flimsy excuse of asking him to find out if red was coming his secretary miss leditsky who was mean lean and sexy said he had meetings all day and had asked not to be disturbed feeling like a row chessie rang red the number you have called is being checked for trouble said the operators recorded message you bet it is chessie slammed down the receiver the little beast must have had his telephone cut off again the post didnt improve her temper the first christmas card she opened was postmarked australia and addressed to bart and grace the second to bart and chrissie i saw three yachts come sailing by said chessie gazing moodily out on to an ocean as blue as marys robes then with a stab she remembered will tunelessly singing little lord jesus asleep in the hedge it had been one of hers and rickys few shared jokes noone came to sing carols at alderton towers theyd be too terrified of the rottweilers and the security guards and the paparazzi still hanging around for the latest news on reds breakup with auriel shed go crackers if she didnt do something grace was in uruguay with a woman friend so tomorrow for the first time bibi and supposedly red as well as luke and perdita were coming to christmas dinner with her and bart who was cockahoop at having all his family under one roof theyre bloody well going to have a better dinner than ever they had with grace thought chessie suddenly excited at the challenge the telephone rang mr alderton for you mrs alderton said conchita chessies heart eased bart had forgiven her mr luke alderton added conchita yet luke calmed her more than bart would have done as he said in his deep slow sleepy voice that he and perdita would be there at eight tomorrow and would chessie mind if they asked angel who was on his own and might cheer up bibi whose boyfriend skipper had begged off again at the last moment anything to put her in a better mood said chessie is he presentable christmas presentable said luke wouldnt even need giftwrapping hes very glamorous good said chessie might put your rotten brothers perfectly straight nose out of all those joints he smokes is he coming havent seen him hows your shoulder so so which means bloody painful thought chessie ill be off games till midjanuary at least ill miss the challenge and the january cups and have to put in a substitute for the sunshine league christ said chessie appalled thats losing serious money let bart help out you know hes dying to nope said luke firmly and is it true youre squeezing into one of those grooms caravans while perdita hogs your bed i cant believe you havent bonked her yet luke laughed making ponies taught me one thing to be patient if you bump young horses too early theyll throw in the towel chessie sighed you love her dont you shes a lucky girl luke in fact was fighting depression a caravan was indeed not the ideal place for a shoulder injury or for lying awake night after night wracked by desire out of the tackroom window hed just seen perdita flying off to the mail box desperate for a word from ricky she pretended it was because she was frantic for him to buy tero who was improving by the day but luke understood that all the loving kindness of christmas and pop songs singing i just called to say i love you every five minutes on the radio made her miss ricky more than ever lukes heart was even heavier because hed had to sell a favourite pony that morning it was the only way he could feed his other ponies and pay the grooms wages and give them christmas presents and take perdita out in the evening which was what she expected after long days schooling all his ponies in addition perdita having screwed up red and auriel by spilling the beans about lucy chalmers was getting increasingly uptight about meeting red tomorrow at christmas dinner finally luke had spent an agonizing two hours yesterday trying to comfort his exgirlfriend cassandra murdoch who was coming apart at the seams chessie spent a fraught and joyful christmas day doing what she did best in the world after sex cooking keeping the kitchen staff in a flurry stuffing a fresh goose with truffles creating an exquisitely delicate smoked salmon mousse in the shape of fishes one for each person and finally as it was christmas making a surprise pudding which she knew red adored by seventhirty she was really pleased with herself the tenfoot christmas tree which grazed the top of the el paradiso living room was covered with tinsel and glass balls the exact duckegg blue of the alderton flyers shirts holly with the berries painted blue decorated every priceless painting blue paperchains crisscrossed the room and three huge vases were filled with skyblue delphiniums in the dining room the dark crimson tablecloth was laid with a new blueandgold dinner service decorated by blue candles and crackers with a centrepiece of gentians forgetmenots scabious dyedblue carnations and father christmas in a blue polo shirt and white breeches driving a sledge pulled by four model polo ponies the whole effect was gloriously vulgar bart whod spent the day working and stick and balling absolutely adored it principally because of the tremendous effort the chronically lazy chessie had made to please him she was wearing a duckeggblue wateredsilk dress very clinging to emphasize the fragility of her body and leaving one arm and shoulder bare to show off the flawless tawnygold skin the colour which exquisitely enhanced her bruisedblue eyes and her greenishgold curls had never suited any of his players even red so well christ you look miraculous bart put his hands under the diagonal of duckeggblue silk to stroke a small pointed breast which seemed to leap upward at his touch he noticed that the scheming minx had left her neck and wrists bare in anticipation of his present and he loved her for it open it before the others arrive he said roughly taking a blue velvet box out of his white dinnerjacket pocket even chessie gasped it contained a pendant bracelet and earrings of emeralds as big as wrens eggs oh bartholomew breathed chessie they will make everyone greeneyed very old bart couldnt resist boasting the stone of the pendant comes from louis xivs sword they had drinks outside now that the blazing heat of the day had given way to a suavely cool beautiful evening christmas didnt seem so impossible a pale luminous prairie sky arched overhead the palm trees rattled and on the velvet air drifted a heady scent of orange blossom chessies diorissimo and merrily roasting goose stuffed with truffles which was driving the lean stable cat crazy as he weaved himself around chessies bare brown legs the frogs and crickets croaked to a counterpoint of contented snorts from barts ponies whod had an extra christmas helping of carrots and molasses chessie put a hand cold from clutching her vodka and tonic in barts i love you she said softly ive started my new years resolution a week early i wont bitch all evening bibi arrived first and dropped a pile of presents unceremoniously under the tree to stress the insignificance of the occasion with her frumpy black dress which bypassed every curve her lack of jewellery and makeup and her hair scraped back she looked like a minor character in a sixthform production of lorca what was the point of dressing up for her father and two brothers when skipper her boyfriend had stood her up yet again getting into the office at am every day for the last year so that she could handle the am calls coming from new york had drained her emotionally and physically even the knowledge that against all the odds as a woman shed managed to settle a strike of mechanics this week didnt lift her spirits she made no comment on chessies decorations beyond remarking acidly there had certainly been some changes and why didnt they stick up the blue argentine flag to match then as she kissed her father she caught sight of chessies emeralds emptying cartiers again daddy she said even more acidly then still speaking directly to bart one thing to cheer you up red and auriel are definitely off it was on the car radio auriel is quoted as making no comment which must be unique for her red as saying it wasnt the difference in age that screwed them up but auriel being such a famous woman that the press wouldnt leave them alone thats the best christmas present im gonna get said bart delightedly then as bibi asked for a perrier this is a celebration for chrissake and he filled her glass with champagne again to exclude chessie bibi started discussing a fax that had just come in from hong kong she would reserve the heavy sniping for later when red arrived the growing tension was broken by the arrival of perdita luke and leroy who had a red bow round his thick neck and who promptly chased the stable cat up a palm tree and collapsed panting on the floor luke as black as his dinner jacket under the eyes still had his arm in a sling just a formality he explained as he kissed chessie stops people clutching it his bottlebrush hair slicked back in the shower was beginning to stick up spiky hair unspiky personality thought chessie those are lovely cufflinks she added perdita bought them for me and a shirt said luke not adding that hed given her money to buy them and all the other presents she was happily putting under the tree having made no comment about chessies duckeggblue dress bibi went into ecstasies over perditas cream silk trouser suit you look sensational you must have been jet lagged last time we met and you have terrific dress sense not me chessie said perdita simply she took me to worth avenue and pointed me at the right shops im sorry about wearing trousers but my legs are so bruised from practice chukkas youve heard red and auriel are officially kaput bibi asked luke cant say im not pleased admitted bart and grace was going bananas shall we call and tell her bibi picked up one of the portable telephones chessie bit her lip i think youre a shade premature said luke trying not to laugh as leroy went into a frenzy of barking as the most stretched limo in the world drew up and out jumped an indian chauffeur in a turban to open the doors for auriel red and two yorkshire terriers luke only just grabbed leroys collar in time i am not ready for this i am truly not ready for this screeched auriel dont forget to get all those gifts out of the car raschid this must be the most glorious barn ever and the perfume of the orange blossom is just like my own fragrance orange blossom glancing at auriels left hand bart was at least relieved to see no engagement ring despite jewellery everywhere else including a diamond bracelet on her perfect ankle grinning insolently red dropped the yorkshire terriers in front of luke i told you id bring a christmas takeout for leroy merry christmas dad he added to bart merry christmas my ass snapped bart so glad to know you mr alderton said auriel taking barts hand then turning to bibi in her frumpy black dress and you mrs alderton chessie gave a gasp of laughter im afraid im mrs alderton but you look sixteen for that you may call me chessie i prefer francesca said auriel its more gracious and i can see francesca you are a very gracious lady gee thanks said chessie i hope you dont mind my gatecrashing your christmas festivities went on auriel red assured me you wouldnt mind red is so generous murmured chessie wondering how the hell she was going to divide seven smoked salmon fishes between eight she supposed it was better than five thousand and ive brought you all gifts from my new range went on auriel its called auriel and it is glorious fragrance for you francesca fragrance for you bibi antiseptic cream for you she couldnt bring herself to use perditas name and aftershave and cologne for you bart and you must be luke if you like it i know youll tell all your friends id better organize another place said chessie pressing a bell bart was absolutely furious what the fuck dyou think youre doing he hissed taking red aside following yonder star said red nodding in auriels direction oh star of wonder star of light star of world class bank account shut up snarled bart how dare you barge in here with her its goddam rude to chessie and shes too goddam old for you you can give chessie a good twentytwo years said red coolly perhaps we ought to swap christ he looked round the living room what have we heah conchitas blue period or blue collar period why are you kicking my ankle luke chessie did it all oh right that explains it mom liked things simple said bibi she always had red roses and she always wore her rubies at christmas dinner dyou remember red im starving said luke evenly smiling at chessie it smells incredible i thought wed dine in half an hour after weve opened our presents chessie told him gratefully mom believed in selfcontrol taunted bibi she always made us wait to open our presents till after dinner have you heard from her red we called her this evening said auriel accepting a glass of champagne from conchita what a gracious lady now grace truly is a gracious lady crack murmured chessie to bart can you hear the breaking of new years resolutions you were at school with grace werent you auriel why dont you have a very old girls reunion but auriel had drawn bart down beside her on the sofa reds been showing me videos she purred my youre a fine player i hope to join red in england this summer when he plays on your team auriel and red luke reflected five minutes later got away with murder because people were so anxious to go to bed with them red in terms of behaviour auriel in terms of conversation i never have time to practise she was now telling a glazed bart thats why my handicaps only minus one i wish we were minus her luke murmured to chessie her egos even bigger than her boobs not a lot said chessie drily barts going to fall down her cleavage if she gets any nearer its so embarrassing we havent got her any presents just giftwrap red thats all she wants judging by the number shes doing on dad red turned to perdita whod been increasingly edgy all evening about seeing him again hi judas he said coldly then grinning and lowering his voice you did me a good turn tipping auriel off about lucy chalmers after a lot of footstamping she admitted she really cares he dropped his voice an octave aping sincerity which means i get all my bills picked up red bought me a sheraton sideboard from christies for christmas isnt that darling auriel was now telling a blanching bart she paid for it red murmured to perdita didnt you give her anything red smiled he had a trick of letting those amazing kholed eyes suddenly gaze deep into yours so for a second you thought he was being serious shes had her labia pierced so i gave her a couple of diamond studs makes it hard eating her out like getting bits of grit in ones oyster perdita gave a scream of shocked amusement i want you personally to design me my own airplane the alderton auriel i can just picture it flamingo pink auriel was now saying as though she was bestowing a great favour on bart who was desperately trying to prevent a yorkshire terrier fornicating with his left leg without actually kicking it i think wed better open our presents said chessie good idea said luke im sorry about angel hes not usually as late as this who said bibi sharply your fathers new ringer said chessie luke thought he might be lonely away from home for chrissake snapped bibi hes lovely chipped in perdita luke rang to ask the name of his street he said i look out of the weendow then came back and said it is called one way christmas is for the family bibi glared at luke why dyou want to ask some hick argy wholl be completely out of his depth lame ducks are better than lame dicks said red draining and refilling his glass on cue leroy barked the rottweilers bayed the yorkshire terriers yapped and bibis heavy jaw dropped as angel came through the door for the last fortnight hed been enjoying the sun and the girls of palm beach he was tanned a smooth milkchocolate brown his bronzed curls were bleached and streaked white jeans and a blue sleeveless tshirt covered with car oil and black rubber tyre marks clung to his wonderfully elongated elegant body he looked a hundred million dollars and was carrying a rose pink poinsettia going up to chessie he said for you i am very unwise man bearing gifts i am sorry i am late i ad flat tyre and got opelessly lost how lovely thank you said chessie taking the plant then adding to luke you were quite right hes so beautiful i think well keep him just for stud purposes now let me introduce everyone you know bart bart and angel nodded at each other without friendliness and barts beloved son red by whom he has been well fleeced very funny said red shooting his stepmother a look of pure hatred i watch the match against the kaputnik tigers angel told red zat last chukka you play like an argentine i nevair realize you zat good well thank you said red mollified luke says youre pretty sharp too how are those bastards juan and miguel treating you terrible began angel then seeing barts look of disapproval terribly nicely and this is barts daughter bibi went on chessie hi said angel thinking what a pity bibi didnt have reds looks and auriel who needs no introduction angel kissed auriels hand how darling sighed auriel and what a glorious poinsettia weve got an english setta at home said perdita idly i am sorry im not properly dressed said angel who was utterly unfazed luke say dinner at the barn i thought we would be aving pony nuts it smell wonderful he smiled at bibi who didnt smile back inside she was seething how could she possibly keep angel in order and at a distance if luke included him on a social footing now hed never get up in the morning she was even crosser because angel was so utterly devastating and she hadnt bothered to tart up and everyone else looked so stunning she loathed her black dress which was one of graces castoffs tomorrow shed go out and buy a new wardrobe just as they were about to open their presents grace rang to wish red and bibi a prolonged merry christmas listening to bibis cries of i miss you mom nothings the same without you angel thought how beautiful fragile and vulnerable chessie looked and decided which side he was on the second telephone rang it was tokyo for bart the japs obviously dont know its christmas either said chessie savagely sloshing two inches of vodka into her glass perdita had never seen such presents and was amazed how everyone took them for granted bibi however was delighted to open an envelope containing a set of keys for an alderton skylark oh daddy thank you she gasped kissing him reckon if youre going to be my new polo manager youd need a helicopter what exploded red and angel bart smiled malevolently bibis worked her ass off this year im fed up with having her so far from home so ive put her on the board and made her my new polo manager shell operate out of florida and new york from now on sheet whispered angel to perdita think of working for zat ugly cow red wasnt even remotely appeased when bart gave him a stubbs if you hock it said bart ill disinherit you and what about luke thought perdita in outrage bart had only given him a disgusting monogrammed gold penandpencil set luke however was knocked out when chessie gave him a signed first edition of his bible marco on polo and also first editions of longfellow and emerson my wicked stepmother he said hugging her chessie flushed but made no comment when she tore open some red paper containing a cushion embroidered with the words eat drink and remarry which was a joint present from bibi and red perdita felt a bit despondent chessie had given her a gucci bag and bibi a very pretty whiteandyellow dressing gown but she had had nothing from red bart or luke luke had buggered off in fact she took a slug of champagne god she wanted to be rich then suddenly clattering along the floodlit rosefestooned colonnade and through the french windows came little tero her dark eyes darting with panic she was all done up in a scarlet headcollar scarlet bandages and with pieces of holly and mistletoe braided into her tail and still unhogged mane tero gasped perdita so loudly that only lukes strength stopped the pony bolting then she recognized perdita and gave a deep throaty whicker of joy sure knows her new mistress said luke putting the lead rope in perditas hand i dont believe it whispered perdita bursting into tears she flung her arms round lukes and teros necks oh youre so kind i so dreaded leaving her oh darling darling luke thank you and she kissed luke just under the left jaw bone breathing in his strength and goodness for a second luke felt dizzy with relief perdita would have to stay in palm beach another three weeks while tero went through quarantine noone however upstaged bart alderton two minutes later he returned from the stables leading spotty the skewbald perdita had ridden in the first chukka of the fathers and sons spottys wall eye gave him a very oldfashioned look and his skewbald markings included white quarters and brown back legs so he looked as though he was wearing stockings kept up by garters a brilliant wilful merry courageous pony who could keep going for ever and who refused to be intimidated even by juan or miguel he caused cheers and yells of laughter whenever he played heres a good old boy said bart handing a second lead rope to perdita merry christmas and thanks for clinching the fathers and sons spotty and you should get along oh breathed perdita handing teros rope to luke i love this pony hes a dream to ride you are so so kind and flinging her arms round bart she covered his face with kisses like a child red was seething first bibi on the board and barts polo manager and now spotty thats a good horse dad he and bibi said simultaneously who was only saying last week that spotty looked as though the milkmans horse got his mother said bart smugly that sort of horse is only conceived said auriel dreamily when the stallion jumps over the fence and couples with a mare at the moment of the eclipse well hes certainly eclipsed tero thought chessie furiously why didnt you give spotty to luke she hissed drawing bart aside hes the one who needs him bart smiled chillingly i want luke so short of dough he has to come to me and beg stupid idiot said chessie dont you realize when that horse goes to england rickyll be playing it in matches against you all summer looking at the enraged faces perdita didnt care she was used to being the centre of a family row two really good ponies could turn her career around it never entered her head as she left luke to take both ponies back to their stables how she would pay for flying them back to england youd better come and play on my team and bring spotty with you bart told her thinking how amusing it would be to take perdita off ricky as he picked up one of the telephones to take a call from australia dinner is served announced conchita almost on cue the second telephone rang bibi picked it up suddenly her eyes gleamed and her sallow face lit up she looked almost pretty ricky she cried joyfully how are you whod you want to talk to oh right i am flattered ill take it next door ive been missing you too darling perdita turned grey as reality reasserted itself like a stubbed toe here she was in palm beach spending christmas with the sworn enemy of the man she loved taking his ponies and accepting his hospitality and money bibi had probably told ricky everything rubbing it in like washingup machine powder into a cut no wonder he hadnt answered her calls seeing her look of utter desolation a returning luke put his good arm round her shoulders somehow chessie managed to stay cool lets go and dine she said to auriel adding maliciously i know bart will enjoy having you on his right may i be allowed to say grace asked auriel dropping her voice dramatically i wouldnt said chessie its not an awfully popular word round here dinner was out of this world chessie had retained all her old skills not feeling hungry herself she was only too happy to give up her smoked salmon to auriel but incensed that red took one bite and dropping his fork promptly lit a yellow sobranie bibi was still on the telephone the bitch if she was trying to get off with ricky there was no way chessie was going to allow her to get off with angel too turning her languorous blue eyes towards him she asked if hed telephoned his family today i did said angel who had finished his smoked salmon and was looking at reds discarded helping as longingly as the orange stable cat who had jumped on to the table that cats been trying to get at the goose all day said chessie putting it back on the floor cat said angel clutching his smooth brown forehead that is cat in american then he started to laugh zat is why i am so late of course it is gatto too in argentina we have the same word gatto for a jack i ave my flat tyre on the freeway i look up gatto in the dictionary it say cat i keep stopping drivers and ask them if they have a cat in their car they drive on as eef i am crazy man my english is not very well but i am learning it more better by phoneylingus thats my husbands perversion said chessie she is beautiful thought angel and so sweet what part of america you come from he asked im english suddenly wildeyed and distraught angel rose to his feet luke didnt tell me chessie put a hand on his arm youve forgiven perdita cant you forgive me im sorry about your brother you must miss him dreadfully particularly at christmas it was a horrible war she was so beautiful thought angel sitting down again he could forgive her anything this is wonderful food he said as bibi floated back into the room oblivious of black glances from perdita and chessie who she talking to asked angel my ex said chessie bitterly el orgulloso said angel in disbelief he not interested in ugly cow like that she look like an orse and not a very pretty one ricky likes horses better than anything else perhaps thats the attraction looking down the table seeing his dramatically underhandicapped ringer mauling his wife bart toyed with the idea of sacking angel on the spot but having played practice chukkas with him yesterday decided he was too good to kick out so early in the season used to calling the conversational shots he had to confess himself beaten by auriel as she regaled him with stories of famous movie stars she knew namely herself bibi having also left her mousse was bitching to red in french about the dishonesty of miguel and juan theyd installed four boarders at the barn and were charging them each a month straight into their own pockets and the reason juan came back for the geldof match was to charge dad expenses for screwing sharon kaputnik answered red also in french this one doesnt seem much better added bibi dismissively the way hes mauling chessie hes just another jumpedup gigolo whereupon angel butted in perfect french i have never asked money for my sexual services he told bibi coldly and turned back to chessie red was highly amused bibi went scarlet angel needed putting down but not like that the goose was even better than the smoked salmon this turkey is simply delicious francesca said auriel feeding large slices to the slavering yorkshire terriers the white meat is so subtly flavoured i used truffles under the skin said chessie grateful for any praise rickys father used to pronounce it truefles she added idly true was the one thing you werent to ricky said red nastily its all awesome chessie said luke who was eating a lot despite not being hungry bart was off the telephone to sydney at last to my beautiful and gifted wife he said raising his glass to the second mrs alderton said red draining his glass yes to mom agreed bibi they had a pause before pudding im gonna make a fullscale assault on american airlines bart told auriel my agent says im his favourite client said auriel hes closing a deal with a really good author to write a book on the auriel kingham phenomenon seeking control of the company went on bart id like to write my own autobiography but i dont have the time went on auriel by november id purchased nearly five per cent of american airplanes do i hold on to the stock as investment do i go for control of the company went on bart dustin says he cant wait to make a movie with me confided auriel about a beautiful sophisticated woman whose sons college friend falls madly in love with her or do i sell out for a nice profit asked bart traditionally older men have always married younger women right like you and francesca but getting it on with younger guys is definitely a thing of the future said auriel bart forgot about american airplanes red needs sons he said brusquely auriel smiled warmly into barts eyes thats ungallant mr alderton what makes you think i couldnt give them to him why the bellboy in the elevator this very morning was saying you dont look a day over twentyfive miss kingham i wonder if i ought to get my face elevated said chessie examining herself in her spoon angel who normally hardly drank got very giggly just looking at you geeves me zee duck bumps he told chessie how dare he flirt so blatantly in front of dad thought bibi looking at her stepmother luminous skin like ivory in the candlelight one beautiful bare shoulder so close to angels lips her hatred bubbled over look at those emeralds glittering like drops of crème de menthe the new dinner service must have cost a fortune not to mention the blue silk dress she was sure it was ungaro chessie was fleecing bart as she had fleeced ricky she was like bindweed that delicately but lethally winds itself round a delphinium until it snaps this barsac is truly amazing said auriel assuming bart had chosen it you have as much a taste for fine wines as fine pictures it is good said bart ninetyfour years old in fact older than both your ages put together fancy that said chessie from the other end of the table reds eyes slid towards perdita nice isnt she perdita shrugged auriels jolly boring what dyou see in her very good in bed said red picking up one of the polo ponies pulling father christmass sleigh and mounting it on the pony in front im learning a lot you can never be too good in bed he let his eyes run over her body the better you are the more you can manipulate people and im very expensive but youre rich said perdita admiring his flawless cheekbones ten million thats just a piece of chicken shit perdita giggled in disbelief to exist here you need at least a hundred million said red youre quite different from luke sure said red i have no principles at all bart came off the telephone from tokyo again now we can have pudding said chessie coldly sorry honey you can keep the phone bart put the receiver down on the table beside her immediately the other telephone rang sydney again dad said bibi jesus christ said chessie shut up you utterly bloody thing she added hysterically as the first telephone started to ring again furiously she snatched it up go away then suddenly in the candlelight her face lost all its expression hi she drawled did you ring here about two hours ago it was as though a huge thorn had been tugged out of her side i thought not she smiled luxuriously at bibi who had turned an ugly maroon ricky having mindlessly sat through down and out in beverly hills three times surrounded by other lonely people was now at a party in beverly hills surrounded by blondes but lonely as one can only be at christmas ringing on the flimsy pretext of finding out how perdita was getting on ready to hang up if he got bart he had come through to the only blonde he had ever loved how are you asked chessie ok said ricky flatly then he was almost sobbing no im fffucking not i mmiss you me too are you coming to england this summer yes can i see you of course whenever then aware luke and bibi were listening shes fine ill pass you on to her perdita its ricky perdita turned away from red like a dog who hears the crunch of his masters car on the drive hes rung to talk to me she stammered noone but you lied chessie shooting round the table perdita picked up the cordless telephone like a baton in a relay race and hurtled into the night outside the frogs stepped up their croaking what a pity you cant kiss one of those frogs and turn it into a prince bibi drawled chessie it might make you less badtempered ricky said he definitely didnt ring earlier perdita came back ten minutes later so insulated with happiness she put the glittering blue christmas tree in the shade ricky was on terrific form really really cheerful palm springs must have done him so much good he cant wait till next season nor can i i cant wait to get spotty and tero home luke suddenly looked grey and exhausted dont worry said chessie softly running a hand down his cheek youre much nicer than any of them perditall realize it one day with everyone on diets for the polo season chessie had decided against christmas pudding or hard sauce or pecan pie and then irrationally settled for something far more fattening sweetened whipped cream shaped like a polo ball rolled in melted chocolate and then coated in coconut oh how darling said auriel chessie must have known it was your favourite dessert red they always make it for him at the club no it isnt snapped red suddenly i feel sick oh poor baby auriel was all concern i better take you home the smaller of the yorkshire terriers was sick chessie flushed i should have forgotten you werent on solid foods yet red and provided you with a bottle of cow and gate then turning spitting with rage to auriel it must be such a drag picking him up from playgroup every day dont forget to put the baby alarm on when he goes to sleep tonight revolting little toyboy auriel however oblivious of the sniping and able to forgive a potential customer was telling a deliriously happy perdita about her new range you were saying you couldnt wear a dress because of the bruises in my range weve invented a cream which completely disguises them ill mail you some you ought to send some to chessie drawled red then she could use it on her ass mrs regularly beaten there was a shocked pause pack it in snapped luke what are you talking about stammered chessie your little hangup said red about having pain before pleasure weve all heard smacks and screams coming from your bedroom he got no further seizing him by the collar bart had hauled him to his feet dont you speak to chessie like that he bellowed i wont ko you id probably kill you but you get out of my house now the glasses jangled the rafters shook leroy shot trembling under the table the second yorkshire terrier was sick dont touch him screamed auriel im only stating facts said red laughing as he drifted towards the door truth shouldnt hurt anyway i thought that was what turned chessie on get out yelled bart and you can forget about playing on my team in england this summer until you learn some manners back in rutshire daisy was dreading christmas all on her own eddie and violet were flying off to la to spend a week with hamish wendy little bridget and a twomonthold addition to the family called fergus i must keep cheerful until they go daisy kept telling herself as she took the bus into cheltenham to buy them christmas presents i mustnt cling i must stay jolly for ethel and gainsborough her boss the caring chauvinist had sourly given her the afternoon off after all christmas was his busiest time but daisy had managed to escape from the office party before he started chasing her round the desks an added grievance was that shed already had an afternoon off early in the month to show her paintings to a london gallery i really like your work the owner had told her i could easily sell your paintings if you used brighter colours daisy gazed dolefully out of the bus on frostbleached fields bare trees khaki stubble beige houses and grey woolly sheep all blending in she thought how hard it was to paint brightly in winter particularly when all the money shed saved to buy a car had been spent on mending the washing machine and her hair needed cutting and she was seven pounds overweight even three years after hamish had left her she still suffered from wildly ricocheting moods only that morning shed wept to find a list toads eddies tooth gainsboroughs mouse sunset which shed once scribbled down as topics to keep the conversation going with hamish at dinner she had forgotten how demanding badtempered and intolerant hamish had been the breakdown of the marriage she now felt had been all her fault suddenly out of a ploughed field rose four magpies one for sorrow two for joy three for a girl four for a toyboy thought daisy longingly what dyou want for christmas her mother had asked the day before and daisys mind had gone completely blank because all she wanted was a man shed tried going into pubs but she always drank too fast out of nerves then had to hide her empty glass in her skirt so men didnt feel they had to buy her a drink there were a few party invitations but without a car she had to rely on lifts shed even been to a gingerbread meeting for single parents last month but all the men had beards and kept insisting they werent remotely chauvinistic but very caring daisy had got off with the only attractive man whod afterwards turned out to be married and only posing as single to take advantage of lonely women cheltenham was hell absolutely packed with people grumbling about the difficulty of parking their expensive cars and spending fortunes the postchristmas sales were already on im a markeddown dress no one wants thought daisy she passed the record shop shed get the wham record for eddie and beethovens fourth piano concerto for violet on the way back out of the loudspeakers belched last christmas the hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight she thought to herself so many fears so few hopes daisy bit back the tears and nearly got run over crossing george street before plunging into the supermarket to buy a tiny turkey for christmas dinner for her ethel and gainsborough fresh luxury bird said a large sign of a fat turkey holding a piece of mistletoe with wishbone removed for luxury carving how awful thought daisy when shed got so much to wish for perdita forgiving her eddie and violet wanting to spend christmas with her one day money getting all right her paintings being good enough for an exhibition eddie and violet passing their exams perdita not getting pregnant in palm beach would she ever have a man in her life to carve the turkey rubbing her eyes she ran out of the supermarket she was getting nowhere eddie wanted the new adrian mole book violet was taking emma for a levels and wanted the complete jane austen the caring chauvinist wanted the latest jeffrey archer in the corner of hammicks a beauty wafting a cloud of jolie madame was thumbing mindlessly through a biography of wellington constantly looking at her watch and checking her face in the mirror she wore a wedding ring lucky thing thought daisy wistfully to have a lover and a husband handing over the books to the assistant she burrowed in her bag it was only after the till had been rung up that she realized shed left both her cheque book and her cheque card behind she wished that the carpet would swallow her up but it was such a hideous green it had probably swallowed several people before that day and was suffering from frightful indigestion her account was in stroud and overdrawn so there was no possibility theyd guarantee a blank cheque at a cheltenham branch there was no way she could buy anything now for eddie and violet which hamish and wendy would construe as a further example of parental neglect and a reason to assume custody running sobbing out of the shop she collapsed on one of the octagonal benches in front of the clock at the north end of the arcade a drunk reeled up to her and offered her the remains of his whisky bottle go away howled daisy then conscious of being ungrateful howled even louder mrs macleod said a soft voice frantically wiping away the tears and the mascara daisy looked up it was drew benedict who seemed to have arrived from a different planet hed obviously been playing polo somewhere hot and he handed her his greenandred paisley silk handkerchief which smelt faintly of french fern i got an afternoon off for christmas shopping daisy blew her reddened nose noisily and i left my cheque book behind taking her arm drew pulled her to her feet ill get you some money waving aside her frantic apologies he took her to his bank and drew out ive got to see my lawyer about a contract have a pair of boots fitted buy something for sukey and some arsenic for her ghastly mother whos staying with us ill give you a lift home in a couple of hours embarrassed but cheered up daisy scurried around managing to get everything done in time and even buying a bottle of polo aftershave for drew because she felt so guilty dragging him out of his way when he must be so busy she was also shocked to find herself going into the ladies at cavendish house to clean her teeth redo her face and retie her hair back in its elastic band it was too dirty to wear loose as she went past the scent counter she sprayed herself with jolie madame outside the beauty whod been reading wellington was sobbing uncontrollably as an embarrassed but very goodlooking man ushered her into a taxi dont cry darling he was saying ill ring you every day when emma goes out to walk the dogs if patrick answers ill hang up its only nine days oh come all ye faithful sang the loud speaker daisy yelled a voice it was drew in a dark green mini between them they managed to fill up the back seat with their purchases the temperature had dropped the sun was setting in nougat colours pale purple and cyclamenpink where have you been to get so brown asked daisy middle east with the carlisle twins playing for victor kaputnik against the sultan of araby contrary to what people say the country is not dry everyone was so drunk on sunday afternoon that the ball stayed in the same place while everyone swiped at it how lovely said daisy pay was good went on drew cheerfully the twins have gone to italy so they can ski into switzerland next door and put all their loot into a swiss bank ill bank mine when i play snow polo at st moritz in january how the hell dyou manage without a car very badly said daisy gloomily drew had removed his coat and was wearing a light blue cashmere jersey so new it still had the creases in and which matched his eyes rutshire cirencester and guards polo stickers curled on the windscreen how did perdita get on in argentina she adored it said daisy on the evidence of one letter but she found the argentines a bit cruel they train the best polo ponies in the world and shes spending christmas in palm beach with bart aldertons son luke bloody nice said drew approvingly she couldnt be in better hands and a very good polo player might get her over ricky dyou think rickyll mind her spending christmas so near bart alderton drew shook his head rickys not smallminded barts the only person hes got any fight with like all polo players drew drove very quickly overtaking much faster cars on bends with a centimetre to spare he was so nice to talk to daisy wished he would slow down she longed to ask him in and tried to remember if shed drunk all that bottle of cheap white last night and if shed put it back in the fridge it was only drinkable if it were cold thats declan oharas house hes just moved in said daisy pointing to towers and battlements hidden by yew trees and huge wellingtonias i think his telly interviews are so wonderful everyones going to midnight mass at cotchester cathedral to gawp at him were going to a party there on new years eve said drew promises to be the thrash of the decade ruperts got a terrific yen for declans daughter taggie hes coming back specially from gstaad to have a crack at her whats she like asked daisy wistfully ravishing but too tall for me i dont like standing on tiptoe to kiss girls the setting sun was firing the windows of snow cottage as they bumped along the dirt track ricky ought to do something about this road its terrible said drew disapprovingly you need a snow plough rather than a car weaving singing her eyes screwed up with sleep ethel temporarily distracted them from the mess left by the children all the kitchen chairs had been pulled out orange juice cartons bowls barnacled with muesli overflowing ashtrays littered the kitchen table thank you so much said daisy writing out a cheque at once then blushing furiously but would you possibly mind not cashing it until the new year wont be going near a bank before then said drew getting a bottle of moët out of a cavendish house bag lets have a drink daisy having extracted two clean glasses from the washingup machine hastily cleared the kitchen table as the cork flew out of the bottle ethel fled out of the room not much use for shooting said drew as daisy put some anemones shed bought in water beautiful arent they she said fingering the scarletandviolet petals theyre for wills grave then blushing and wishing she hadnt said that she added ricky asked me to keep an eye on it while he was away drew eyed her speculatively dyou find him attractive yes confessed daisy taking a huge gulp of champagne one couldnt not but hes only interested in chessie and im too old for him i was six when he was born and seven when i was born said drew i might have been allowed to give you your bottle i can give you mine now said drew topping up her glass idly he picked up her sketch pad immediately becoming transfixed with interest theres hermia and theres wayne youve got his wicked eye to a t christ theyre good and recognizable even in their winter coats taking the sketch book to the light he looked at it more closely and thats marvellous of little chef he gazed at daisy with new respect drew had bought a lot of paintings since he married sukey because he liked them and expected them to shoot up in value if daisy could catch such vivid likenesses without being chocolateboxy she might well be worth investing in thats good thats kinta dangerous brute whens perdita coming home sometime in the new year drew looked up sharply and the other children theyre going to la to my ex you cant stay here on your own ive got ethel mumbled daisy not much of a guard dog drew filled up her glass again dont you get frightened by yourself no lied daisy anyway i usually wear so many jerseys against the cold any rapist would get dead bored before he managed to undress me lots of people asked me to stay but ethels a bit of a liability she broke three christopher wray lamps and got into a chicken coop last time we went away its all wrong come to us for christmas dinner daisys eyes filled with tears youre so kind but honestly ive got to paint putting a hand on her shoulder drew felt it trembling youre not ok daisy gazed at the bubbles rising in her glass im getting better at being single she mumbled pleating her dark red skirt but my heart isnt really in it id love to find a man but you never find mushrooms when youre looking for them do you anyway at my age youd have to break a marriage up to get married yourself and i couldnt do that knowing how awful it was for me daisys cheeks were bright pink but she was deathly white under her eyes which were still redrimmed from crying outside the bookshop her lovely soft mouth had nearly disappeared in her desperate attempt not to cry again drew who said nothing and went on stroking ethel had a reputation for coolness because he had an analytical mind and always thought before he spoke being in the army for nine years had also given him a certain fixity of outlook but he was extremely kind in a detached way never took himself very seriously and was an excellent listener i bet you havent had any lunch said daisy leaping to her feet ill make us some scrambled eggs lots of people are like me she rattled on theres a frightfully pompous piece in the paper today saying the new singleton is the emblematic contemporary figure her hands shook so much she spilt most of the eggs as she cracked them on the edge of the bowl her coordination was so jiggered she could hardly manage to watch the toast and cook the eggs at the same time this piece rabbited on about always looking your best in case mr right mark ii came along but i dont see anyone except my awful boss and it seems silly looking smart while im painting or walking ethel dyou think the badgers would appreciate bright red lipstick to match a red scarf and taupe eyeshadow besides i dont think anyone would put up with me now she scraped the wooden spoon frantically against the bottom of the pan you get into such awful habits living alone talking to yourself wiping your hands on your trousers oh bugger ive turned off the grill i turned it off said drew i adore the way your bum judders when you stir those eggs he added turning off the gas as well and i like cold scrambled eggs next moment he had taken her in his arms oh no squeaked daisy what about sukey shut up said drew gently shes at home making lists for easter i have a marriage of convenience it was the only way i could play polo the arcticblue eyes which turned down at the corners were suddenly anything but cold daisys resolve weakened its still wrong hush two wrongs make a mr right said drew and kissed her daisy was utterly lost until one kisses a man one cannot tell if one truly desires him and something melted inside daisy and as drews tongue coolly and languorously explored her mouth her hands shot upwards to tangle in his fine silky hair and then to feel the wonderful muscular strength of his shoulders she was so taken by surprise that next moment she found herself upstairs thank goodness shed changed the sheets that morning ethel hadnt shredded a bone in her bed and there were more clothes on the chair than the floor lovely room said drew admiring the huge roses peonies and delphiniums which daisy had painted growing out of the skirting board itll be like screwing on the lawn on a summer evening i havent slept with anyone for three years mumbled daisy in panic as drew slowly undid the buttons of her black cardigan until he could drop an infinitely leisured kiss on her bare shoulder itll come back its like riding a bicycle whispered drew as his hand slid round to the back to unhook her bra ill need stabilizers to start off with said daisy feeling wildly unstable christ said drew lifting one heavy breast after another in delight they are beautiful and he really admired them from all angles before bending his head and kissing each nipple as he slowly removed her skirt her laddered tights and her pants grey as a dishcloth which ought to have been retired years ago daisy curled up with embarrassment i havent shaved my legs or anywhere else im like an old ewe the welsh guards were always known as the sheep shaggers thats better he went on as daisy laughed and as his warm hands moved over her body just grazing the hairs he had her leaping with desire still dressed he sat beside her on the bed and stroked down her belly this is the only bit that needs cutting back he said parting her pubic hair and gently fingering all you need is a bit of spit and polish dont hurry my darling ive no desire to get back to my motherinlaw daisy giggled shuddered tensed came and then burst into tears appalled drew pulled her into his arms darling whats the matter i never came with hamish sobbed daisy never in fifteen years i never believed anything could be so lovely then wed better make up for lost orgasms its my turn next dreamily daisy watched him undress apart from slightly bow legs and a shrapnel scar from the falklands he was wonderfully built stocky and muscular without being fat even his cock seemed to have biceps as with the ball of his thumb seldom far away from her clitoris he drove her to extremes of joy she was amazed anyone so phlegmatic could be such a sensitive imaginative lover he didnt even mind when ethel unaccustomed to sex and stumbling upon an unbelievably jolly romp decided to join in with a great leap on the bed afterwards as she sat wrapped in a scratchy dark blue towel watching drew have a bath daisy said again that she felt quite awful about sukey dont said drew who certainly scrubbed himself very vigorously as long as she doesnt find out it wont hurt her anyway ive always had a crush on you me said daisy incredulously ever since you got rained on the first time we met at the pony club and i could have hung my polo hat on your nipples a crush helmet giggled daisy ive been wondering went on drew what youd look like without your clothes on hairy said daisy drew shook his head as he reared out of the bath absolutely gorgeous pulling off her towel he gently squeezed her right breast promise never to lose any weight he glanced at the watch that hed left on the edge of the basin christ i must go then seeing the shadow of desolation flicker across daisys face ill ring you tomorrow morning how asked daisy when sukey rides out with my motherinlaw outside rickys ash trees like a clump of swaying broomsticks were trying to sweep the stars out of a pearly grey sky drew kissed her again merry christmas mrs macleod im afraid youve got yourself a toyboy daisy felt it was all dreadfully immoral but she couldnt help being hugely cheered up particularly when drew rang her as promised next day saying how much he wanted to see her again going into the garden she found midges dancing and crab apples glittering crimson against a bright ultramarine sky breathing in the wildrose scent of a pale pink rambler called the new dawn which clambered up to the cottage eaves and always seemed to be in flower daisy hoped it would be a new dawn for her and she might do some brighter paintings on christmas day she had another surprise ricky rang up stammering badly and thanked her for the drawing of little chef shed sent him as a christmas present its fffantastic how is he fine but missing you and perdita fine in palm beach staying with the aldertons oh god why had she blurted that out she must have wrecked his christmas but after a long pause ricky asked youre not by yourself yes but ive got a lot of friends dropping in well one friend good then after a really long pause have you got perditas number perhaps he was keen on perdita after all thought daisy after hed rung off if she hadnt met drew again she might have been very jealous later on violet rang from la daddy and wendy have gone out eddie and i spend our time babysitting oh mummy its awful daddy was present at the birth and wendy insisted we watched the video last night it was disgusting eddie nearly fainted and theyve got a white album of even more disgusting photographs even of the afterbirth and they show it to everyone and wendy breastfeeds in public in the shops and at parties and shes gone completely californian no salt in food no getting brown no drink no fags i wish we could come home i love you mum youre not too lonely on your own daisy put down the telephone feeling so happy drew seemed to have ignited some creative spark daisy painted and painted late into the night listening to the foxes barking and singing i just called to say i love you that she slept until she was woken by drews telephone call in the morning on boxing day it turned bitterly cold in the west a band of crocusyellow was fading into daffodil below a dark purple cloud having shaved her legs and her armpits daisy rigged up a mirror in the drawing room lit the fire and did a series of sketches of herself in the nude if drew liked her body maybe it wasnt that bad she mustnt be too obvious she mustnt glamorize herself completely absorbed she didnt hear the door bell at first wrapping herself in a rosepink shawl shed draped over the sofa to hide two large cigarette burns she opened the front door and gave a gasp for there was drew in a red coat white breeches and browntopped boots i decided to change the quarry he said shoving her back into the house and slamming the door how lovely wheres your horse gone home sukey thinks im having a drink with rupert does he know you arent yes ive covered up enough for him over the years imagine rupert being used as an alibi for me thought daisy amazed you been down a mine asked drew taking in her charcoal smudged face and hands dyou want a drink asked daisy no i want you drew ripped off her shawl as he took her in his arms the taut athletic muscular hardness of his body evoked some distant memory something familiar yet incredibly disturbing stirring like a hibernating butterfly at the back of her consciousness his face was icecold against hers so were his hands as they moved over her body there was nothing measured or leisurely about his approach today whisking her into the drawing room he laid her down on the threadbare carpet unzipped his flies and forcing his way into her came almost immediately sorry darling he murmured into her shoulder that was bloody selfish but i couldnt help myself pleasured my lady with my boots on stay there i dont want to ruin your carpet easing himself out he returned with some kitchen roll that was lovely sighed daisy truthfully after years of indifference from hamish the greatest aphrodisiac for her was that drew wanted her so much how was your party at lunchtime he asked undemanding said daisy flattered that hed remembered mawled wine and retired colonels rabbiting on about wind breaks and frost pockets i still feel awful about sukey the same thing happened to me at christmas i remember the telephone always smelling of paco rabanne when i came back from being out and not understanding why when hamish claimed no one had rung then there were all the dropped telephone calls dont torture yourself said drew leaning up on his elbow and stroking her belly every situation is different ricky married for love and look where that got him i didnt im not attracted to sukey we never sleep together but i love jamie and im fond of the old thing this isnt doing her any harm and its doing me so much good he slid his fingers inside her and this is definitely not a frost pocket catching sight of them both in the mirror he reached over and adjusted the angle so they could both watch hamish never did that either said daisy afterwards sounds a prat then out of the blue if you didnt come with him what about perditas father burying her face in his chest daisy decided to tell the truth and the circumstances because she trusted drew to keep his trap shut so it might have been some handsome rock star or polo player said drew afterwards could have been me i was eleven and very precocious dont think there were any children present jackie wasnt into paedophilia making a joke of it suddenly made the whole thing less awful youre not shocked asked daisy having been a friend of ruperts for fifteen years nothing shocks me anyway you were a baby daisy felt weak with gratitude my parents were dreadfully upset they tried to sweep it under the carpet but as they had fitted carpets at home it was rather hard im getting rather hard too said drew pulling her on top of him oh i love you said daisy covering him with kisses then added hastily but dont worry i say i love you all the time to ethel and gainsborough and the children im honestly not getting heavy i know youre not said drew guiding his cock inside her i told you i didnt want you to lose weight can i draw you before you get dressed said daisy later if you want to said drew sitting down on the sofa as long as you hide it from perdita shed be bound to sneak to sukey oh his face is so lovely when he smiles thought daisy pinning a fresh piece of paper on the board youll have to draw an erection in in a minute said drew they were on the carpet in each others arms when drew looked at his watch jesus its nearly eight oclock dyou mind running me over to ruperts i havent got a car said daisy miserably ill try to ring for a taxi or borrow philippas drew brushed her hair back from her forehead and kissed it the car i came here in is your christmas present its only an old banger but itll get you about its all right sukey didnt pay for it i bought it with my sultan of araby money an old banger for an old bangee said daisy but i really cant take it drew stopped her protests with a kiss after shed dropped him off and bumped back home grinding gears and singing at the top of her voice daisy hid the drawing of drew in the potting shed but she soon retrieved it and put it in her bedroom after all the children werent coming back until the new year and drew was without doubt the nicest thing that had happened in all her life quarantine as lukes comely headgroom lizzie was fond of pointing out is a real asskicker but predictably perdita left all the hassle of scrubbing out the boxes with disinfectant isolating spotty and tero and dealing with the interminable inspections by vets and government officials to luke and his grooms luke even arranged for spotty and tero to be flown to heathrow cheap as part of a twentypony job lot which victor kaputnik was smuggling in from argentina via palm beach aware that perdita had no money luke picked up the bill for that too he refused to hear a word against her but it would be fair to say that his grooms regarded perdita with a dislike bordering on hatred they worked for the best boss in palm beach but now this spoilt little bitch had swanned in ordering him around squandering his money and dragging him out to the high spots every night lizzie had even made a day chart until perdita went back to england and the barn returned to normal having spent her last day stick and balling in the tiniest bikini to top up her tan for ricky perdita popped in on chessie to say goodbye on her way to the airport luke was delayed at the barn because ophelia was tied up with colic but said he would catch up with her perdita found chessie by the pool in the same limegreen bikini shed worn the day after perdita had flown in from argentina and which was now much too big for her nor did chessie hitch it up in time to hide a dark bruise on her left hip gosh what have you done asked perdita without thinking been gored on the horns of a dilemma said chessie bitterly oh for christs sake put on a bikini and come into the pool with me im sure this umbrella is bugged and probably the ice in your glass perdita didnt want to swim it would crinkle her newly washed hair and she wanted to look her best in case by some miracle ricky met the plane but such was the force of chessies discontent that five minutes later she was dogpaddling into the centre of the pool every time i go shopping bart insists that two guards accompany me rattled chessie whod lost all her normal laidback cool and whose jaw above the blue water was rigid with tension i darent ring england i know the telephones bugged look can you give ricky a message tell him not to risk getting in touch with me securitys too tight but tell him ill ring him somehow the minute i get to london for a stunned second perdita disappeared beneath the water then she emerged spluttering and had to paddle backwards until her feet touched the bottom i dddont understand the reason ricky rang at christmas said chessie hysterically was to tell me in those few desperate seconds that hes still absolutely mad about me only me talking to you later was just a smokescreen but he seemed so happy to hear my voice thats because hed just heard mine cant you understand all ricky wants is to have me back id love to go but im not sure if one should turn back the clock and would i be constantly reminded of will again and ricky hasnt got any money and would i hate being poor again despite the warmth of the pool and the day perdita suddenly felt icy cold and dizzy her mouth had gone dry and acid she wanted to scream at chessie not to be so bloody selfish screwing up rickys life again then chessie disarmed her by bursting into tears im dying of homesickness i havent been back to england since will died and now barts bought rutminster abbey so we can spend the summer there and think of all the memories i cant face it and i know i cant not face it perdita wanted to plunge into the soft silky water which was the same duckegg blue as the alderton flyer shirt ricky had been wearing the first day shed fallen in love with him and never come up again involuntarily her thoughts strayed to red the only other man whod seriously jolted her but red was a playboy as if in answer to her prayer the rottweilers started barking furiously and there chatting to one of the guards and stroking the head of the nolonger snarling dog stood luke thats the one said chessie reading her thoughts hes the nicest strongest man youll ever meet luke has no money thought perdita and after the glitz of palm beach she was never never going to be poor again the divide between rich and poor was further intensified when they got to miami airport which was its usual shambles of bewildered passengers and despairing hairtearing insolent porters luke hadnt even had time to change his shirt which was soaked with sweat his white jeans were filthy and dust streaked one side of his face ophelia was still fighting colic he ought to drop perdita off and go straight back to her but he couldnt tear himself away shed been so manic when shed set off to see chessie now her eyes were glittering with unshed tears and her mouth trembling perhaps miraculously shed suddenly realized she was going to miss him he bought her a vodka and tonic and they sat in the bar perdita in whom deep unhappiness invariably manifested itself as bad temper stared moodily at the other passengers luke stared at perdita frantic excitement was generated because paul newman and joanne woodward were on the same flight and immediately wafted through to the vip lounge christ hes attractive grumbled perdita why the hell cant i travel first luke was tired and had to resist snapping at her that she was bloody lucky to have her return ticket paid for at all committed to play for hal in chicago houston detroit and then greenwich in the fall there was no way hed get to england to see her this year he took her hand im gonna miss you will you write perdita shrugged im a stinking correspondent not to ricky you werent thought luke remembering the dozens of unanswered letters at least youll have your own bed back perdita tried to pull herself together adding listlessly thanks for everything its been great what did chessie say to you asked luke nothing said perdita about to blurt the whole thing out oh hell thats all i need coming towards her was her old pony club enemy trace coley clanking duty free and looking a million dollars last time we met perdita muttered to luke i tried to drown her mother trace however was prepared to suspend hostilities in order to swank hello perdita long time no see what are you doing here buying ponies im bringing back two said perdita defiantly daddy bought me seven said trace im playing medium goal with him and drew benedict and the most heavenly mexican out of cowdray next season i must check in lets gossip on the flight then glancing down at the label on perditas handluggage oh poor you economy gets so hot and smelly on this flight what a pity youre not travelling first she is she is said a voice perdita gave a start for there lean as a spear in black jeans and a shirt the pale scarlet of a runner bean flower stood red he was as high as a kite his tiger eyes glittering and absolutely reeking of auriels new scent perdita baby i had to come and say goodbye hi luke do introduce me perdita shrieked trace coley whose eyes were popping like a squeezed peke youre red alderton and youre having a walkout with auriel kingham and youre an absolutely brilliant polo player i wouldnt argue with any of that said red he turned reproachfully to luke how can you let this poor baby travel economy then he smiled wickedly at perdita i never gave you a christmas present so ive upgraded you instead paul and joanne are in the vip lounge and are dying to meet you lets go and say hello luke looked at his brother his face expressionless you are an absolute shit red whatever his feelings about chessie ricky returned brown and incredibly chipper from palm springs he was delighted that perdita had improved so dramatically and that she had brought home two such good ponies tero having driven victors grooms crackers on the journey calling piteously for fantasma had now chummed up with spotty and the two were inseparable spotty wearing three extra rugs and an expression of outrage on his redandwhite face at the arctic conditions that greeted him was soon bickering with wayne over who should be boss of the yard the first time he and tero were turned out kinta who was a thug and a bully went for the timid little mare shoving her into the water trough and laying into her with teeth and feet immediately spotty bustled round the corner to teros rescue and kinta whod never come across a skewbald in polo or in her previous racing career spooked and ran away in horror after that ricky moved spotty and tero to another paddock where slavish with gratitude tero followed spotty everywhere but still had to be given a nose bag every day to stop spotty and all the other ponies pinching her food the argentine ponies ricky had smuggled in through france in the end arrived looking very poor and miserable but soon picked up as the winter turned mild the best tonic of all was that rickys elbow had recovered having played every day in the warmth of palm springs he was back to his old dazzling form this summer he would play high goal with bas mike waterlane and dancer and medium goal with bas dancer and perdita at the beginning of march they started getting the ponies ready for the new season walking them out then trotting them then riding them up and down the steep rutshire hills to harden up their muscles ricky also applied for membership for dancer and himself at the rutshire polo club and was stunned to receive a letter from brigadier hughie saying they would be unwelcome going straight to the top ricky rang david waterlane the club president who after some huffing and puffing admitted that bart alderton was behind the blackballing chaps poured a lot of money into the clubs diminishing funds over the past three years got hughie eating out of the palm of his hand bart says rutshires reputation shouldnt be tarnished by allowing in two players with police records one an exjunkie and david waterlane added heavily a queer polos accommodated plenty of those in the past said ricky and bad hats too cant be the real reason barts bought rutminster abbey admitted david due to move in with chessie in april doesnt want you bumping into chessie week in week out at the club see his point wouldnt like to spend every weekend avoiding clemency put me off my game what did fatty harris think about all this demanded ricky oh his palms been so liberally greased by bart hell be able to bath in margaux for the rest of his life hes quite happy to send you and dancer to perdition and miss lodsworths on his side shes never really forgiven you for your disgusting language or dancer for his burst watermain fraid theres not much i can do about it ricky was absolutely furious cirencester was a much better club than rutshire but it was twentyfive miles away instead of four which was too far to hack to and anyway his family had always played at rutshire bas baddingham whod been skiing when the blackballing took place came roaring to rickys rescue dont worry well marshal support at the next agm and get you reinstated the agm was held on the third sunday in march at the dog and trumpet in rutminster high street excitement that spring had arrived and a new polo season was on the way was slightly doused by an overnight blizzard perdita whod just passed her driving test pinched daisys car to drive into rutminster the roads were very icy and she enjoyed skidding all over them she couldnt understand why her mother was so protective about a clappedout volkswagen and had even burst into tears when perdita backed it into a wall the other day and if she can afford a car thought perdita pulling up with a jerk beside brigadier hughies rover she can jolly well buy me a new pair of boots the meeting was already packed brigadier hughie waved perdita to a lone empty seat in the second row on the left by the window in front of her sat sharon kaputnik smothered in mink and victor smothered in smugness over his recent knighthood on the right sat a solid phalanx of players in tweed coats and check shirts their heavily muscled arms and shoulders overflowing on either side of the back of their narrow gold chairs and making the rows look even fuller the more highly handicapped players had suntans from playing abroad the left side seemed to be largely inhabited by nonplaying members including miss lodsworth and her cronies their capaciously drooping cashmere bosoms resting on their tweedskirted bellies their feet sensibly clad in brogues and coloured wool stockings miss lodsworth who was wearing burgundyred tights to match her face was making lists bad language five ponies abreast in eldercombe high street loose grooms dogs in rutminster park cruelty excessive use of whip wrote miss lodsworth in her masculine hand and glared at perdita who having been guilty of at least three of these sins glared back at a table facing the room sat brigadier hughie fatty harris and basil baddingham on the end sat posy jones the pretty club secretary who was already getting too hot in her prussianblue jersey he looks like a nineteenthcentury french cavalry officer thought posy gazing surreptitiously at bas there was something exotic and unenglish about the highly polished gold buttons on his blazer the beautifully manicured hands and the uniformly dark gold suntan his glossy patentleather hair was exactly the same vandyke brown as his moustache and his wickedly roving eyes hes really attractive decided posy then flushed as bas shot her a look of unashamed lust the reason the minutes were not recorded as accurately that year was because bass long fingers kept idly caressing the back of posys navyblue stockinged legs as he gazed equally idly at perdita perdita was seriously worried the purpose of the meeting for her was to get ricky reinstated and bas seemed to be the only one of rickys supporters to have turned up the twins and jesus were playing in the cartier open and handicap in palm beach mike waterlane was too terrified of his father to be any use and drew hadnt arrived yet i cant think whats happened to drew said sukey who was planning the menu for a dinner party on tuesday he went to look at a pony outside cotchester and was meeting me here as rutminster cathedral struck the halfhour brigadier hughie rose to his feet better get started our president sir david waterlane has been delayed by a puncture and is about to come through the door i expect thats him now so ill shut up instead in wandered seb carlisle blond hair ruffled tie over one collar yawning widely and holding a treble whisky in one hand a ripple of laughter went round the room we thought you were in palm beach said brigadier hughie disapprovingly cartilage playing up murmured seb sorry im late then noticing perdita on the end of the row he made a furiously chuntering miss lodsworth and her cronies budge up so he could slide along and sit next to her how the hell did you get that whisky whispered perdita booked a room on victor and ordered room service whispered sebbie giving her a smacking kiss we can try out the bed if this meeting gets too boring perdita shook her head weve got to get ricky reinstated thats why i came back said seb ive brought you this it was a feature from the american magazine polo saying that luke had recovered from his shoulder injury and was playing gloriously again the accompanying photograph showed luke in the barn with leroy bristling at his feet and an adoring fantasma resting her pink nose on his shoulder with her top lip curled upwards oh how sweet murmured perdita thats a dream horse when shes not savaging patrons and biting other ponies in the line out said seb luke ought to rename her fangtasma hows lukes spoilt brat of a brother asked perdita ultracasually spoilt said seb fancy red do you dont be so fucking stupid snarled perdita going absolutely crimson be the only one who doesnt said seb grinning victors frightfully excited he added lowering his voice because his companys just discovered a cure for piles i know a cure for piles of money its called polo said perdita can we get started said brigadier hughie sternly apologies for absence were received and minutes of the previous meeting passed before they moved on to last years accounts which had been disastrous owing to the weather attendance and bar takings were right down not surprising interrupted seb taking a slug of whisky when it takes the barmaid five minutes to chop the cucumber for each pimms matters are not helped brigadier hughie glared at seb by far too many players not settling their bar bills they were lucky he went on that basil baddingham who ran a most successful wine bar in cotchester high street had joined the committee and agreed to act in an advisory capacity to keep an eye on fatty muttered seb fatty harris feeling curiously naked without a panama or a flat cap from under which to crinkle his bloodshot eyes was livid that bas had been brought in and even more so because the bounder was fingering posy jones which fatty felt was strictly his prerogative another more serious problem went on the brigadier sternly is that far too many players have been using commander harriss mobile telephone without paying there were calls recorded to paris florida chile tokyo palm beach and sydney the bill for the two summer quarters came to well over in future a lock will be put on the telephone there have also been complaints the brigadier peered over his bifocals from several local restaurants that certain players after winning matches havent behaved as well as they might there was the case of the star of india in rutminster high street that was my brother dommie said seb tipping his ash on sharons mink which was now hanging over the back of her chair and he had extreme provocation he mistook the kitchen door for the gents and found the chef piling pedigree chum into the chicken vindaloo pan so he landed him one the room rocked with laughter thats quite enough seb snapped david waterlane whod just arrived with snowflakes melting in his hair we dont want post mortems we want better behaviour curried unanimously murmured perdita where is drew said sukey glancing at her watch the roads are awfully icy i hope he hasnt had a shunt the meeting droned on the news wasnt all bad announced brigadier hughie they had bart alderton to thank for the magnificent new pavilion new stands and excellent new changing rooms then seeing victor turn puce at such preferential treatment of his hated rival and of course we must thank victor kaputnik sir victor if you please reproved sharon i beg your pardon sir victor for providing us with a splendid firstaid hut and a years supply of his excellent medical products and for a new marquee for sponsors lunches we must also thank him for boarding our third and fourth pitches and for giving us a new commentary box to replace the one that blew away and is probably someones garden shed now moving on to the social calendar brigadier hughie praised miss lodsworth for her excellent floral arrangements in the tea room and announced dates for several barbecues and cocktail parties the highlight of the season however would be in june when lady kaputnik had very kindly offered her home for a ball but felt was the limit she could accommodate at one time three fifty would be stretching it even for sharon said seb grinning broadly as he returned with his second glass of whisky the meeting switched to the perils of ringworm brigadier hughie remembered ringworm in singapore perdita fought sleep and looked out of the window the blizzard had come from the west so the trees in the hotel garden resembled a head and shoulders ad with their east sides black and bare and the west sides powdered with snow pigeons drifted disconsolately round a blankedout bird table yellowandpurple crocus tips rose like flood victims out of an ocean of white snow it was hard to believe shed be playing chukkas again in a month if seb and i and perdita can get here thought bas as his fingers moved upwards to caress the softness of posy jones thighs why cant the others he had a lunch date but he wondered if it was worth booking posy into a room upstairs for a quickie he liked the way her bosom rose and fell as she wrote the shorthand outline for wrongworm rather than ringworm which brings us to the matter of dogs said brigadier hughie i cannot reiterate too strongly that they should be kept on leads during matches here here miss lodsworth rose to her feet i for one david waterlane pointedly unfolded the sunday express whats all this about rupert campbellblack and declan ohara getting drunk together and your brother firing declan from corinium television he asked bas in a very audible whisper sharon kaputnik discreetly unfolded the news of the world to read the same story it was nearly midday brigadier hughie was rabbiting on about the necessity for a decent walkietalkie system drew benedict must have plenty of experience of walkietalkies having recently left the army where are you drew not here said fatty harris thankfully he feared drews exacting standards far more than bass yes i am sorry im late hughie said drew walking in there was a pileup on the cotchester bypass my experience of walkietalkies was they never worked coming back to earth warm from daisys arms he sat down beside sukey and took off his jacket it wasnt ponies he was trying out whispered seb nudging perdita hes got his jersey on inside out catching drews eye behind sukeys back seb pointed frantically to his own sweater and then at drews drew looked down and hastily put his jacket on again i warmly recommend drew benedict for the committee said brigadier hughie smiling at drew i cant think of anyone who shoulders responsibility more willingly and i know his wife sukey will be a tower of strength has drew got someone else whispered perdita utterly riveted so rupert says whispered back seb but drew wont say who she is hush thundered miss lodsworth down the row any other business said brigadier hughie looking at his watch and gathering up his papers i have said miss lodsworth rising to her feet again first i would like to deplore the repeated use of bad language on the field hear hear chorused the old trout quintet who flanked her fatty harris heaved a sigh of relief miss lodsworth would bang on until twelve when they had to vacate the room anyway so no one would have time to bring up the matter of ricky and dancer bart had already lined fattys pockets liberally but there was much more to come if the blackballing survived the agm perdita looked despairingly at bas who grinned and squared his shoulders to interrupt miss lodsworths invective but as the cathedral clock struck twelve distraction from bad language and ponies thundering five abreast was provided by a government helicopter landing on the lawn outside blowing snow off the trees and sending it up in swirling white fountains as if the blizzard had started again then out of the door spilled dommie carlisle and jesus followed by a brunette and a blonde who ran shrieking across the lawn in their high heels and finally the minister for sport rupert campbellblack bas heaved a sigh of relief posy blushed and pulled down her jersey the last time shed seen rupert shed been wearing no clothes at all miss lodsworth inflated like a bullfrog the press woke up and started scribbling leaving the girls by the fire in the bar the three men came straight into the meeting this is an honour minister lied brigadier hughie rupert always spelt trouble i thought you were in florida we were eight hours ago said rupert he hasnt been near an agm in twenty years hissed fatty harris i didnt know rupert played polo whispered perdita only as a hobby between showjumping said seb but hes bloody good christ knows how far hed have got if hed taken it up seriously come and have a drink rupert said the brigadier getting to his feet weve just finished no we havent said bas amiably item eleven any other business they want to lay the room for a luncheon party said brigadier hughie fussily no time for that now oh yes there is said rupert as he reached the top of the aisle the dull winter light fell on his blond hair and the crows feet round his hard dissipated blue eyes hes divine thought perdita wistfully no one could resist him as a member of this club for many years drawled rupert i want to oppose the blackballing of ricky francelynch and dancer maitland not a matter for an agm snapped david waterlane putting down the sunday express these things should be discussed in camera oh dear brigadier hughie mopped his forehead with a red spotted handkerchief oh dear oh dear the press scribbled more feverishly miss lodsworth dammed up in midflow turned puce hardly the time said fatty harris when better rupert was speaking very distinctly as though he was dictating to some idiot typist i think the press might be interested to know that ricky francelynch the best player rutshire has ever had having survived a horrific car crash and six even more horrific operations is anxious to return and bring back some glory to this clappedout club this is disgraceful how dare you spluttered brigadier hughie dancer maitland may have been a junkie once went on rupert but has since raised millions for charity this winter offering his services free to band aid if you want crowds at rutshire ricky and dancer will pack them in bart alderton rupert was speaking even slower now so even the reporters doing longhand got everything down not only stole rickys wife but now wants to rob him of the chance to return to the club he loves and for which his family has played for generations bart has therefore poured fortunes into the club and certain club secretaries pockets rupert smiled coldly at fatty harris on condition that ricky and dancer are kept out pretty shabby behaviour hear hear said victor barts walked off with rickys wife hes the one who ought to be blackballed hey steady on said david waterlane thats going a bit far if we stuck to that rule we wouldnt have any members left rupert turned to the players dyou lot want to play for a club as bent as it is lacking in compassion i resent that sir said fatty harris no shouted dommie from the back of the hall if you dont reinstate ricky and allow dancer in im off down the road to cirencester so am i said seb draining his whisky and raising perditas hand and sos she and so am i said bas and i said drew ignoring sukeys look of disapproval and me brayed mike waterlane ignoring his fathers even blacker look of disapproval and i said jesus whod been nudged in the ribs by dommie and i said victor dont be silly victor said sharon seeing her ball for fast rolling away anyone else said rupert every player and most of the nonplaying members except miss lodsworth and her satellite crones got to their feet this is most irregular spluttered brigadier hughie but conclusive said rupert briskly i agree said david waterlane turning to fatty harris whose pockets were suddenly feeling very unlined youll have to accept a majority vote stanley i declare the meeting closed and now you can buy me a glass of beer rupert and tell me what really happened with you and declan ohara i would said rupert as the press swarmed round and the waitresses surged in to clear the room but weve got to go straight back to florida dommie and jesus are playing in the finals dommie jesus and the girls could now be seen running across the white lawn to the helicopter as the blades blew the rest of the snow off the trees dyou mean you flew all the way from florida just to vote minister asked the rutshire echo rickys a very old friend said rupert bart alderton was so incensed at the result of the agm that he promptly put rutchester abbey back on the market and cancelled his trip to england preferring to spend the summer playing polo on the american circuit this meant that although ricky was reinstated at rutshire polo club he was deprived of chessies return why dyou all have to interfere in my life he shouted at rupert of all the ungrateful sods complained rupert furiously to bas all this was extremely bad news for angel who banned as an argentine from playing in england had hoped for a restful summer retained by bart but spared his company after a brilliant season in which he had contributed in no small way to the alderton flyers sweeping the board angel was tipped to go to four or even five in the november handicap listings but this was no compensation for living in a horrible little bedsitter with no curtains nor airconditioning and only a trickle of cold water which stopped altogether when the meter ran out nor for being bullied by miguel who operating his own mafia bitterly resented angel constantly seeking alejandros advice nor being bitched at by juan who equally resented angel being as goodlooking as he was and much better bred angel detested bart and dreamed of cuckolding him with the exquisite and discontented chessie his worst cross however was bibi who had taken on the job as barts polo manager with all the fervour of a neophyte finding angel surly and temperamental she was constantly pulling him up for never getting up in the morning and letting down the flyers by slopping round in sleeveless tshirts designer stubble and too long hair flapping under his polo helmet in return angel had not revised his opinion at christmas that bibi was a spoilt uptight ugly bitch he was fed up with her recording his botched shots in her little red book and noisily remonstrating with him between chukkas argentine women were beautiful submissive admiring and not like this angel had been often tempted to walk out but swallowed his pride and clung on because he was desperate for a green card which would establish him as a registered alien and enable him to work anywhere in america half the foreign grooms and lowgoal argentine players were like him in the states illegally and although they didnt pay tax they could be arrested fined and immediately sent home if they were rumbled which made angel feel very insecure the day before the first round of the world cup angel was taking six ponies round the vast oval sandy exercise ring at palm beach polo club persistent drizzle and lowering dark grey clouds reflected his mood refusing him player status the infernal bibi insisted that he do grooms work when he should be stick and balling the sole compensation was that ahead above the rump of a sleek sorrel pony bounced the even sleeker rump of samantha shark nelligans blonde and beautiful groom working for shark for four years had bashed any assertiveness out of samantha and she thought angel was absolutely wonderful as angel squeezed his pony and dragged the other five into a gallop to catch her up the april drizzle suddenly became a deluge a second later angel was overtaken by jesuss chilean groom who like a cat loathed getting wet and was thundering his six ponies home as fast as possible next minute angel was into a horse race wanker he screamed at the chilean as his own six ponies fanned out nearly pulling his arms off he managed to stay put until he caught up with samantha then one of her six horses kicked up a clod of sand into his face and he had to let go of three of the lead ropes for fear of garrotting samantha from the back in the stampede that followed he was bucked off and letting forth a stream of expletives he watched the rest of his ponies disappearing into the everglades bibi whod just arrived by helicopter totally drained after filling in for bart and having to address the boston chamber of commerce last night was absolutely furious a mocking bird perched on the fence laughing at her and now angel hobbled into the yard minus six of the horses who should have been playing in the world cup tomorrow nor would she listen to any excuses that jesuss groom had triggered off the cavalry charge it was all angels fault for trying to cut corners ponying too many horses at once who were now no doubt stuffing themselves with scrub drinking contaminated swamp water and being threatened by alligators and rattlesnakes a prolonged search rounded up four of the ponies two in victors garden where they disturbed lady kaputnik sunbathing in the nude one trying to enter the players club without membership and the fourth outside the local hypermarket probably knew they were offering halfprice carrots this week for the easter bunny said angel bibis lips tightened miguels best pony maria and glitz the black gelding juan always saved for the vital fifth chukka were still missing ill look for them in the skylark youd better come with me she ordered angel and bring some headcollars angel growled histrionically he hated woman drivers particularly in helicopters and bibi had only just passed her test why dyou need a helicopter he hissed as he climbed into the passenger seat i thought you flew everywhere on your broomstick bibis bloodshot eyes glared at him over her huge hornrimmed spectacles if you want to go on working for my father dont give me any more lip ok the control stick had been taken out on the passenger side but angel still had pedals and a collective lever in front of him a groom locked the doors and gave bibi a thumbs up satisfied everything was in order she started the two engines with a last look round to see everything was clear she pulled on the power with the collective lever and with a shudder the skylark lifted off the apron scattering orange blossom putting up the mocking bird and sending the ponies galloping around the paddock making a slow turn through degrees to make sure no other machine was coming in behind her she called the control tower who asked her her destination local flying along the coast and around the everglades and palm beach not above a thousand feet replied bibi trying to appear wildly confident shed only done a few hours without an instructor but she was damned if shed betray any nerves too much engine said angel idly concentrate on the job said bibi curtly there are some binoculars behind you peering down angel saw scummy canals swamp olivegreen scrub ribbons of grey road and emeraldgreen polo pitches there was the big stand the aquamarine flash of a swimmingpool and the whiteandyellow awnings of the players club but no sorrel or black ponies as they flew towards the ocean sighting shrimppink swimmers and a few small boats on the azure water the sun beat down on the glass bubble and the weather seemed perfect nice piece of real estate said angel squinting down at donald trumps house youre looking for forty thousand bucks worth of horses reproved bibi im going to switch on to automatic pilot angel watched her set the white balls on the autopilot indicator and when she was satisfied they were stable click on the switch hesitantly she took her hands off the controls but the skylark held its course and height bibi snatched the binoculars shed show this latin creep how to search theres victors barn thought angel leaning over to see if he could see a naked sharon the everglades seemed to stretch out for ever the canals glinting dully like crocodiles eyes in the baking sun in the distance was a line of hills where as usual hung a bank of elephantgrey cloud as they drew nearer angel disliked the look of the rain that hung like a dingy lace curtain between the swamps and the clouds bibi had not noticed any storm and was still busy scouring the scrub for ponies then suddenly they were into rain bibi whod never faced a downpour before hadnt realized that the clear glass of the bubble would immediately lose its transparency like the frosted glass in a bathroom making visibility impossible instinctively she reduced the power and the skylark immediately slowed making it even harder to see out without forward speed to clear the glass of rain next moment one of the engines had stalled seeing bibis white knuckles on the controls angel realized she was absolutely terrified christ the altimeter doesnt seem to be working the rain became denser a white snake of lightning unzipped the sky what am i going to do screamed bibi i can fly elicopters angel said let me take over dont be stupid said bibi hysterically ignoring her totally in control angel reached across and turned off the autopilot he had the pedals and the collective lever on his side but no control stick gently but firmly he tried to remove her hands the skylark was loosing height fast now and they were encased in lashing rain dyou want to get us both keeled let go leave it to me bibi was too frightened to resist flying a helicopter from the lefthand seat is not recommended in the flight manual but somehow angel managed to turn the machine round so they were flying out of the deluge and into the sunshine to steady his hand angel rested his elbow on bibis knee now he could feel the heat of her body her tshirt drenched with sweat her heart hammering her ribs and the surprisingly full firmness of her left breast instinctively he moved his elbow up until it was resting in her groin glancing down bibi saw angels grooved brown arm with its down of dark blond hairs lying along her thigh suddenly her legs seemed to have a mind of their own and closed to increase the pressure on his arm as the skylark shrugged off the rain and emerged into bright blue sky she found herself wildly excited by such physical contact which was heightened by terror and a feeling half of resentment half of slavish gratitude towards this handsome boy who had so effortlessly taken over and probably saved her life she was in no hurry for him to remove his arm as they cruised slowly back to the polo club but as barts barn came into view angel handed back the control stick you breeng us down i think shall i she asked tentatively is ok i am here overwhelmed with relief that she wasnt going to be shown up in front of the grooms bibi asked somewhat ungraciously where hed learnt to fly in the argentine air force four years said angel simply four months in zee malvinas helicopters whispered bibi disbelievingly no mirages said angel when they got back to the barn both ponies had been caught and were no worse for their joy ride bibi rang luke the moment she got home why didnt you tell me angel flew mirages in the falklands you didnt ask said luke flatly he and his brother pedro brought down more brit planes than any other pilots angel crashed behind enemy lines and was interrogated by the brits pedro was killed angel doesnt like to talk about it bibi told luke about the storm and angel saving her life i guess youll have to be a bit nicer to him in future said luke curtly i gotta go you might tell dad what angel did then he might be a bit nicer to him too bibi felt rebuked red claimed that luke hadnt even been sleeping with perdita but hed certainly been in a vile mood since shed gone back bibi despite her cranky exterior had a very big heart she had never really got on with grace who quite blatantly preferred red jealous of reds dazzling looks and charm bibi had nevertheless been conscious that bart preferred her to red of whom bart was also wildly jealous but then bart had fallen for chessie and for months on end had had no time for bibi at all and bibi had felt as though shed lost a lover being so rich she couldnt comprehend any man loving her except for her money being barts daughter she worked triply hard in the hope people would think shed got to the top by her own abilities rather than by nepotism perversely in the same way that an actress lets herself put on weight or is habitually late for auditions so she can blame her fatness or the lateness and not herself for not getting the part bibi wore huge spectacles and ugly baggy clothes and scraped back her hair so she could attribute this to her not having a steady boyfriend anything rather than the agony of being hunted for her fortune what she really wanted was an oldfashioned billionaire and loads of children but felt that this was as against her feminist principles as it would have been to have a nose job in order to attract men ahead lay one of the busiest weeks of bibis life frantic at the office she was also organizing a large charity ball for cancer relief in palm beach after a panic on friday afternoon because one couldnt serve nonvintage champagne if one was charging a ticket bibi got home to a smirking chessie and a thunderous bart her trust fund baby boyfriend skipper who was supposed to be taking her to the ball had begged off again saying his stepmother was dying the rat said bibi furiously skipper loathes his stepmother perhaps hes planning to hold a dance on her grave said chessie who was having a manicure and its too late to get someone else bibi crashed down a large white jasmine someone had sent for the tombola take a shower honey said bart ill find you a partner the moment she was out of earshot he dialled the barn i guess ive gotta thank you for saving bibis life he said to angel is nothing for a start i want you to have dinner with us tonight angel said he had a previous engagement cancel it mrs miguel ask me to deener ill square mrs miguel shell understand angel was outraged particularly as mrs miguel had also asked shark nelligans groom samantha and angel would have had samantha on a plate as well as the asada mrs miguel must be already cooking having dressed for dinner frequently at home angel was further incensed when bart ordered him to wear a tuxedo the hireshops open on worth avenue and for chrissake dont get a coloured shirt or a madeup tie and see you shave properly and dont be late bibill expect you around half seven youre going to the ball cinderella bart summoned bibi out of the shower she was wrapped in a pink towel her soapy hair rising in a unicorn horn above her head she had a glorious body and wonderful shoulders reflected bart such a pity she covered them up with all those butch suits and baggy dresses ive found you a guy angel luke tells me he saved your life did he tell you why he saved my life said bibi suddenly hysterical because he was ponying five horses and they carted him and we nearly lost the lot id rather have no partner than him anyway ill be too busy organizing things and hes a hick he may have flown mirages but hes got no savvy hell probably roll up in jeans i sent him to worth avenue said bart and i called them to make sure he hires the right gear bibi was thrown into a turmoil i hate him she thought furiously hes my social and professional inferior i must not let myself be fazed but instead of the blackandwhite sackdress which made her look like an overweight zebra she picked from her wardrobe a clinging coralpink dress which had a short skirt and was cut low back and front shed bought it to wow ricky in la but had never had the guts to wear it chessie and bart had gone off to a drinks party and in a rare act of charity chessie had sent her maid esmeralda who used to be a beautician to help bibi dress oh miss bibi just let me make you look gorgeous by half past seven bibi was ready her mane of hair flopped dark red and curly round her face and down her back replacing her heavy spectacles with contact lenses she had allowed esmeralda to draw kohl round her big brown eyes and apply three layers of black mascara shed always been embarrassed by the size of her mouth and painted well inside it as grace had taught her but tonight esmeralda took the lipbrush round the full outline and filled it in with bright coral the voluptuousness of esmeralda rubbing moisturiser and brown makeup into her back and shoulders with those magic fingers that daily massaged chessie had made bibi realize with a pang how much she craved the caress of another human being her red shoes had spike heels which she would plunge into angels feet if he started cheeking her then she put on her diamonds chandeliers at each ear stones as big as marbles round her neck and left wrist inherited from graces mother they lit up her sallow skin which the coral dress had already warmed you look beautiful miss bibi cried esmeralda in ecstasy shed always felt bibi got a raw deal if only my nose werent so big you crazy said esmeralda no one worries about a borzoi having too big a nose bibi was so excited she thought shed faint i am waiting for a man i really really want she thought then angel ruined it by arriving an hour late by which time bibi had drunk threequarters of a bottle of champagne to steady her nerves she needed it angel with his bronze curls slicked back to show off the exquisite bone structure of his forehead temple and cheek bones his beautifully planed cheeks and jaw denuded of stubble and his eyes flashing like an angry siamese cat completely took her goldspotted breath away how could such angelic features conceal such a black heart with one of those diamonds i could buy half a dozen ponies thought angel sourly as he paused to admire the beautiful pale pink house the pale turquoise sweep of swimmingpool the tree house in the multibranched grasp of the ficus the bluedecked lawn going into the ocean and the other wonderful houses peeping out of the trees on the opposite bank bad luck to live in fairyland reflected angel when you didnt look like a princess all the same bibi looked much better than he expected and her breasts were amazing tawny smooth and full in that tight coral dress and hed never dreamt the rest of her was so slim were not going in that she said in horror as angel opened the door of his filthy mini we go in mine no in mine angel took her arm firmly bibi was about to jump away but the sureness of his touch made her feel very unsteady on her red heels for a second they glared at each other bibi dropped her eyes first and getting meekly into his car threw a wickedlooking pair of spurs hed left on the passenger seat into the back you going to use those on me she spat trying to control the hopeless thumping of her heart not unless i ave to leaning across her to lock the door angel deliberately brushed her breast with his arm i only keep them for big matches and im only a lowgoal friendly angel switched on the ignition nothing friendly about you he said it was a hot muggy evening the ball was held in the garden of a house which reared up ghostly white in the moonlight like the taj mahal faint stars dotted a gleaming grey sky like children kept up too late vast oblong cars dropped off their passengers outside a big blue and white striped marquee one of the men valetparking looked at angels mini in disdain and took the keys from him by the tag as though they were some particularly mangled shrew the cat had brought in lurking paparazzi went beserk when they saw bibi with such a handsome stranger look this way miss alderton smile miss alderton whos your escort miss alderton whats he been in miss alderton angel looked as though he was going to smash all their cameras so bibi hustled him into the marquee hes called angel she shouted over her shoulder can you spell that miss alderton bibi had worked hard the marquee looked enchanting palms were banked at each end round the edge were tables draped in long pale pink tablecloths topped with pink roses pale blue delphiniums and white freesias a pale pink balloon rose from each dayglo pink number the floor was covered in green astraturf which kept catching the high heels of the women so their swooping progress towards one another was not unlike that of mechanical dolls their faces were dolllike too thought angel beautiful tremendously overmadeup and unsmiling because smiles betrayed lines round the eyes their jewels glittered in the candlelight but although they made a lot of noise as they chattered away like the everglades outside there was no real communication between them and their eyes swivelled continually and rapaciously to see if anyone over their partners shoulder was richer more famous or more interesting bibi used to attending parties like this with trust fund babies who were perfectly at ease and tended to know everyone was worried angel would be gauche and out of place but although she was kept frantically busy organizing the tombola finding peoples seats seeing the waitresses kept the moët circulating and working the room herself because half the people in the room hadnt yet bought alderton airplanes every time she glanced across at angel he had been collared by another predatory lady and was looking quite at ease fighting her way to his side she introduced him to a master of foxhounds from virginia in a red coat who announced that the hunting season went from september to december pity its over said his mettlesome wife gazing hungrily at angel we must have a dance later argentines have such a wonderful sense of rhythm ive got a big big day tomorrow she went on im organizing adopt a handicapped animal day does that include lame ducks drawled chessie ravishing in black lace who had popped up on angels other side you ok bibi asked angel dont be unflattering said chessie ill look after him your father wants you to go and chat up george ricardo bibi hes not struck by alderton lightnings enough yet she looks quite good tonight she admitted as bibi sulkily retreated into the centre of the room angel shrugged ok eef you cut off her head chessie laughed not very kind i ate leetle hitlers said angel moodily its in the blood sighed chessie bart is the biggest bully and grace is appallingly bossy never stops trying to improve people its rubbed off on bibi she always goes out with such wimps they never answer back oh god barts glowering at me hes wildly jealous of you hasnt forgiven me for chatting you up on christmas day angel flushed slightly it was best part of dinner looking across bibi went cold not content with enslaving ricky and her father chessie was out to catch angel as well by a hasty shifting of place cards bibi made sure she and angel were nowhere near her and bart unfortunately when they sat down she discovered that on angels right was a beautiful very tarty woman with tanned shoulders rising out of a turquoise taffeta strapless dress turquoise toe and finger nails and turquoise pearls to match my husbands thinking of sponsoring a polo team she said squeezing angels arm how would you like to come and play for us he plays for my father snapped bibi champagne and longing had made her more aggressive angel had been drinking perrier starving he wolfed his own egg mayonnaise and ring of caviar and then bibis continuing to drink bibi tried to pump him about miguel and juan i dont want to talk about them said angel eef i tell you you will run to your father and why you interrupt when ozzer people he nodded at the tarty woman in turquoise want me to play for them she says that to all goodlooking players she hasnt got a husband what prospect do i ave wiz you your father say to me eef you stick at one you go on playing wiz me eef you go up youre fired if i play well i lose my job eef i dont i get fired anyway he gazed moodily at a quivering pink balloon full of ot air like everyone in palm beach angel had such a big mouth thought bibi that when he yawned he looked really bored stuffed breast of chicken followed and every time she tried to engage him in conversation a new vegetable was plonked between them once again angel wolfed everything on his plate and bibi ate nothing are you sleeming you dont need to angel looked her up and down you look good tonight why dont you look like that all the time i could hardly wear this dress to the office youd get better results said angel forking up her chicken i want to be taken seriously as a woman noone know youre a woman in those orrible suits why you deliberately make youself look awful with those beeg glasses and your hair scraped back i nevair knew you had a body before this evening why you ide it i dont know mumbled bibi because youre frightened of sex you dont think anyone will love you except for zee money and would they asked bibi with a sob of course if you stop hurling zee weight around leaning across angel pinched the turquoise womans roll spread it thickly with butter and tipped salt over it thats so bad for you reproached bibi zere you go again stop trying to improve people across the room bart was singularly unamused to see his grossly underhandicapped ringer getting on far too well with his daughter he should never have let them sit by themselves detesting small talk hed intended spending dinner talking polo with angel whats a toyboy boomed the queen of englands second cousin who was sitting on barts right you americans mr aldgate are so good at remembering names bibi felt as though for twentytwo years shed been a ship wrecked at the bottom of the ocean which is suddenly aware far above of a sun warming the surface what kind of woman are you looking for she asked angel like my mother but with none of her defects he took bibis wrist examining each diamond i want a woman who is sexually liberated with a mind of her own then looking straight into bibis eyes that i can dominate utterly bibi felt her entrails go liquid that is obnoxious she said furiously out of the corner of her eye she could see her father bearing down on them looking bootfaced he was going to order her to work the room again the band were playing shall we dance she asked angel no said angel then seeing her face fall lets start wiz the first lesson i do zee asking will you dance wiz me oh yes please breathed bibi leaping to her feet and her fate was sealed because angel was the best dancer shed ever met as he instantly became one with every horse he rode he now became part of the music wow said chessie enviously watching angels gyrating pelvis and flying feet and his utterly still face talk about travoltage gradually the room cleared to keep up bibi kicked off her red shoes her scarlet toenails flashed like swarming ladybirds her dark red hair flowed like seaweed and her lovely body writhed like a flame then the band switched to rock around the clock and each time angel took her hand and put his other hand on her waist to swing her around it was as though he was giving her an electric shock finally such was the violence of her turning that he had to catch her as she fell dont move he hissed as she tried to wriggle free thats zee second lesson dont move until i say meekly bibi rested in his arms luxuriating in the heat of his body and the strength of his arms we go now said angel we cant said bibi aghast they havent even drawn the raffle yet returning to their table angel took a sheaf of pink tickets from her bag and tearing them into tiny pieces dropped them on the floor you win me i am first prize bibis jaw dropped her heart was pounding so hard she could hardly whisper your place or mine mine said angel i want you to see my ovel and i dont want your father barging in in zee middle ignoring a furiously waving bart they slid out of the french windows picking a gardenia whiter than the moon angel put it behind bibis ear angel lived in a rundown housing estate near the airport bibi was appalled by his room which was tiny airless and impossibly hot with only a minute chest of drawers a narrow bed little wider than an ironing board no carpets and no curtains this is awful why didnt you tell me would you have listened whyve you put tin foil on the windows zee sun gets up earlier than i like to do down the landing was a grimy bathroom with a john a cracked basin and a creaking inadequate shower miguel found this room said angel he theenk eet five star for spy of alejandro well move you tomorrow right im so sorry i feel terrible bibi moved to the chest of drawers admiring first the photograph of pedro hes like you and so handsome hes dead snapped angel thats a purple heart said bibi in surprise dad got one in korea eet was sent me by american pilot removing his dinner jacket and black tie angel threw them in the corner he won eet in vietnam he say it was the most important of his medal and he wish to present it as a token of respect to the professionalism and unbreakable courage of argentine pilots but thats wonderful sighed bibi the eenglish say we were kamikaze but a fighter pilot as to be in complete control we were fighting for something that was ours we knew it was dangerous but we ad to go on slightly frightened by the fanaticism in his eyes bibi picked up the jar of earth whats this malvinas earth i brung it back one day it will be argentine earth tears triggered off by champagne filled bibis eyes im so sorry i dont need peety snarled angel i need vengeance a simenon paperback lay face down by the bed bibi blushed as she remembered how she and red had bitched in french about angel at christmas as he pulled his shirt out of his trousers she went over and put her arms round his neck for a second angel went rigid i thought i was the one calling the shoots im just checking the monitors whispered bibi looking down he could see between her breasts to her scarlet pants and breathed in the remains of giorgio and the acid reek of hot hopelessly excited woman her nose might be like concorde but her eyes were dark long loving and glazed with desire she was barts daughter rich as an arab sheik and the key to worldly goods angel laid a warm steady hand on the back of her neck then stretched his long fingers round to the front to gently stroke her cheek bibi gave a moan as he spat on the thumb of his other hand and smoothed away the mascara that had streaked under her eyes her mouth huge red and smudged was trembling as angel ran a lazy tongue along her upper lip then back along the lower one then slowly as his hand slid down her neck to caress her collar bone he kissed her properly simultaneously he turned her sideways so his left hand could slide into her coral dress to stroke her breasts the bra was built in his right hand reached for the zip and she was naked except for her red pants and her diamonds god thought angel what a glorious undreamtof body he could have rewritten the song of solomon just for her comparisons with pomegranates twin roes and sheafs of corn were totally inadequate her hands were shaking so much a pearl button flew off as she undid his shirt his jockey shorts were made up of two pieces of blueandwhite argentine flag youre so beautiful muttered bibi burying her face in the silken softness of his chest ive never met anyone as beautiful as you flattery will get you a preek as hard as a truncheon said angel with a slight smirk dropping to her knees bibi very gently put her lips round it her tongue flickering like a captured moth just managing to control himself angel drew her to her feet and laid her back on the narrow bed running his tongue up the smooth hillock of her breast he fastened on her nipple and slid two fingers between her legs christ he could restore polo sticks in the slippery linseed oiliness rubbing expertly until she was moaning with ecstasy anxious not to lose the momentum only when he was sure she was on the brink did he open her mouth with his tongue and drive his cock deep inside her as his hips had undulated on the dance floor so they writhed on top of her now his pelvic bone driving her towards pleasure omigod im coming gasped bibi bucking as joyously as a pony angel gave a groan that turned into a sob and came too you are old phoney he whispered in her ear a minute later all that macho talk and you are soft as marshmallow inside and despite the repeated roar of landing and departing aircraft which shook the little room as a terrier shakes a rat he immediately fell asleep bibi lay on her side reliving every moment of the last halfhour which would spoil her for the fumblings of trust fund babies for ever as she waited for stubble to darken his cheek and admired the long lashes sweeping the scattering of freckles like the inside of a tiger lily on his cheekbones she also counted his ribs and remembering how he wolfed his food at dinner wondered how many meals hed been skipping perhaps he was sending money home to his peasant mother bibi imagined her blackeyed in her black dress a black scarf over her greying hair with a certain dignity in her prunewrinkled face despite her desperate poverty in the slums of buenos aires she would rescue angel she would give him a massive pay rise bart would never know about then she would buy him the best ponies in the world and he would lovingly consult her on every move light was creeping along the edges of the tinfoil every lining has a window of silver thought bibi gazing down at this glorious animal lying beside her so much in need of her protection this is adoptanunderhandicappedanimal day she said out loud and had to stuff her face into the pillow to stop herself laughing bart was outraged when bibi drifted into the office at eleven in the morning still in her coral dress absolutely bowlegged from screwing with stars in her eyes far brighter than the diamonds still in her ears having languorously closed a deal with a japanese for twentyfive skylarks she went home to bed you ordered angel to take good care of me was her only explanation and oh boy he obeyed you almost to the french letter she woke early in the evening adrift with love and having showered and washed her hair drove down to worth avenue where she bought a wildly expensive skintight rustred cotton sweater and tight offwhite jeans putting them on she dropped her pinstriped suit in the waste basket and set off for the barn as she drove up the colonnade of iceberg roses the ground was littered with white petals bart liked them swept up on the hour and bibi was about to give the grooms a rocket then thought what the hell it was roses roses all the way rounding the corner she found ponies running all round the orange grove and stickandball field and the barn deserted except for two lugubriouslooking men in shiny dark suits how in hell did you get in here she snapped trying to catch the glitz who clattered past her covered in drying suds tail still wet whisking water everywhere with his duckeggblue lead rope flying were from immigration said the taller and seedier of the men weve got occasion to believe he consulted his notebook one rafael solis de gonzales is working here without a work permit bibis heart plummeted she had a sick feeling her father must have tipped them off not here she said firmly i know all the grooms only by their given names admittedly but we dont have a rafael answers to the name of angel no way gasped bibi hoping she wasnt going scarlet out of the corner of her eye she saw a trainer on the end of a slim brown ankle hanging down from one of the rafters of the nearest box all the grooms must be hiding up there everyones out in the exercise ring with the ponies said bibi quickly walking away from the stables ill make enquiries and call you tomorrow seems weird having horses of this quality running loose queried the taller immigration officer fortunately the second less repulsive immigration officer had a date with his wifes best friend in half an hour right he said shutting his notebook but you better getcha act together by tomorrow you can come down now bibi shouted up into the rafters as soon as theyd gone tentatively grooms and lowgoal foreign players clambered down wheres angel asked bibi sharply gone said juans cousin rubbing his back where a rafter had dug into him he caught the six oclock flight out of miami bibi clutched on to one of the white pillars what did you say herbie from the polo office called at lunchtime saying emigration ad been tipped off and were after him and on their way down they search his room said miguels cousin and found one thousand buck cheque from mr alderton shit said bibi did he leave a forwarding address e didnt have time but alejandro know where he live who tipped off immigration herbie say it was mr aldertons secretary bibi was devastated going home she cried herself into total insomnia and by dawn had decided to fly to buenos aires angel hadnt been paid for the first fortnight of april hed left clothes behind at the barn and she wanted to apologize for bart shopping him but these were excuses she knew she couldnt live without him miami airport had been reduced to even worse chaos than usual by polo players whod been knocked out of the world cup returning home to argentina it was hard to tell if the airport officials were more bemused by the amount of luggage alejandro and his family had accumulated which included two vast van loads of prams toys furniture polo sticks and worth avenue clothes which would be flogged for five times their value or by the bullying of alejandros mistress mr mendoza and his sons must each have five seats to sleep in she was yelling theyre international polo players who need their sleep having acquired angels address already from alejandro bibi sauntered into first class wrapped in her own thoughts she was oblivious of the everflowing champagne the caviar the poached salmon the free scent the washing kit the rests for head and feet the interested glances of businessmen across the gangway but when she went to the john she peered round the iron social curtain which divided first from economy and for the first time saw the redfaced mothers trying to quieten fractious children and puking babies the men leaning snoring into the gangways all packed together like sardines and breathed in the hot foetid air with a shudder she thought of angel sitting there last night and vowed he would never go economy again back in her seat deeply apprehensive about the morrow bibi concentrated on the guidebook which was so badly translated that she nodded off until six thirty that was the longest sleep shed had in months waking she felt more cheerful and able to cope reaching buenos aires she booked into the plaza hotel showered and washed her hair and put on a new short and clinging shockingpink cotton jersey dress it was the beginning of autumn and the great dark green trees outside were beginning to turn as she bowled along in a taxi the wide roads heroic statues and bosky parkland reminded her of a lusher paris the taxi driver didnt freak out when she told him her destination perhaps he was used to driving into the slums this cant be right she said five minutes later as he drew up outside a row of beautiful midnineteenthcentury houses with exquisite wroughtiron balconies on the edge of a park sí he pointed to the name and number they are apartments uncharacteristically overtipping heart hammering bibi went to the door there beside the bell was the name solis de gonzales in copperplate perhaps angels mother worked as a maid bibi rearranged her mental picture to an ancient retainer still in black and wrinkled like a prune but with a white apron and depended upon by all the family she pressed the bell sí said a voice is angel i mean rafael there you are not tax inspector said a female voice in fluent but husky broken english bibi felt sick perhaps angel lived with a rich mistress but the woman who answered the door of the private lift although a charming blonde in a cashmere grey twinset which matched her eyes was well into her fifties the pearls at her neck and the rings flashing on the hand she extended were not those of a poor retainer come in she smiled at bibi angel go out hell be back soon would you like some coffee she tugged a black embroidered bell pull please said bibi who was gaping at the apartment at a glance she noticed a sisley a pissarro and a utrillo of a mackerelled sky as well as marvellous eighteenthcentury oils of dogs horses and hunting scenes making up three sides of a square with the fireplace were white sofas with grassgreen and violet cushions to match a beautiful black violet and green carpet which covered most of the polished floor on a big polished table in front of a huge mauve vase of michaelmas daisies were silverframed photographs of beautiful people playing polo or leading in racehorses there was angel as a solemn little boy there were pedro and angel together arms round each others shoulders beyond the park outside which was crisscrossed with rustpink paths and dotted with trees smothered in shocking pink blossom huge flatroofed buildings rose like liners out of an ocean of dark green it is so beautiful here stammered bibi are you angels mother no i am his aunt betty his mother is in rio i theenk or perhaps paris she marry an italian where you stay the plaza angels grandmother my mother live there you will perhaps have tea together bibis mind was reeling is angel ok he arrive very mad said aunt betty rolling her big grey eyes he say his boss reported him to immigration so he catch next plane angel is very impulsive he regret it i think he play polo well he plays wonderfully said bibi on my fathers team there was some misunderstanding ive come to beg him to come back this girl is not so plain after all thought aunt betty as the maid came in with coffee and a plate of croissants and greengage jam she has good clothes and she love angel bibis eyes returned to the paintings that was definitely a little watteau in the corner her father would go berserk not having eaten for fortyeight hours and suddenly feeling dizzy she sat down and took a croissant but i dont understand angels so poor angel have very extravagant family he had to sell family land to pay his fathers debts after the malvinas war the family has not forgiven him i would help heem out but my husband the brother of angels father is very tight she rubbed her thumb and forefinger together like a cicada he go through all my cheques he would keel me if i gave angel money but he is away in europe so angel can stay ere till he get back this is delicious coffee said bibi gazing into its sable depths angel could be a great polo player but he is so proud aunt betty shrugged we are the eighthgeneration spanishirish angel have all zee aristocratic insteencts of his father and grandfather but no money to back it up its difficult for him to how you say lick the bottom when he was eighteen his mother was so worried about him she sent heem to a psychiatrist after two sessions the shreenk say there is nuzzing i can do angel have indelible superiority complex bibi started to laugh then jumped out of her skintight dress as the lift clanged outside the door reaching for her bag she frantically fluffed her hair and daubed blusher on her blanched cheeks i leave you said aunt betty please dont said bibi in panic he may still be mad at me angel looked pale and desperately tired and went paler still when he saw bibi why you ere to say im sorry to ask you to come back nevair your father he betray me why dont you both go for a walk in the park take the mercedes angel said betty angel gazed moodily at the maniacal traffic which roared and raced round them and said nothing until they passed a vast heroic statue of a field marshal in a napoleonic hat astride a prancing horse with a woman with flowing hair in a long dress leaning against the plinth that is one of my relations on my mothers side said angel trust an argentine to ride while the woman walked i expect she was searching for his fiftytwo said bibi dont be stupid snapped angel grudgingly he showed her the airport which the antipollution lobby were clamouring to close down and the great hippodrome at palermo where the greatest polo tournament in the world the argentine open took place and then down the avenida del libertador full of embassies and softened by huge trees my cousin sylvestre lives there how beautiful said bibi impressed not beautiful growled angel just beeg i show you better house five minutes later he drew up outside some huge iron gates flanked by a high spiked fence inside loomed a truly beautiful house built at the turn of the century and influenced by the petits hôtels of france the gravel path up to the peeling dark green front door was choked with weeds two lichened urns spilled over with pale pink geraniums a lawn on the right grew three feet tall and was filled with nettles and willow herb angel opened the front door with a latch key i lived here as a boy said angel as they wandered from room to vast room in the holidays we went to the country this was the chinese room where the tradesman come and my grandmother pay the bills this was the drawing room where pedro and i were allowed down for tea with my parents on the walls was a sepia mural of gods and goddesses the frame of a vast mirror was covered in gold leaf the glass itself was so coated with dust that bibis reflection gazed back at her softened hugeeyed and strangely beautiful workmen had left beer cans on the marble fireplace who does it belong to now it has been bought by a foundation said angel bitterly different designers will decorate each room free to show off their skills a landscape gardener will redesign the garden to suit the time the ouse was built the public will pay to see over it the money will go to open a clinic i wish they give it to me to buy ponies you must have been so happy here said bibi humbly i didnt appreciate it then when the sun shone we were always trying to get to the camp to play polo my grandmothers ouse down the road has been turned into a school in the garden two huge trees were covered in the same shocking pink blossom whats that tree jacaranda said angel no zats blue its called pala borracho that is drunken stick it means the end of the summer standing behind her he could feel her legs quivering and see the languorous curve of her waist into her hips what a backview if she never turned round he could love her there was an old mattress in the corner angel turned her round to face him her breasts were pretty lovable too why you come here to see you where you stay the plaza ouf dont tell my grandmother shell try and borrow money off you he examined her face she wasnt beautiful and argentine men want to feel proud of their wives and he was reluctant to admit how much hed enjoyed making love to her and how he now longed to throw her down on the dusty mattress in the corner and set her alight again he knew she was crazy about him and he could manipulate her like a bendy toy her vast income could buy him the best horses and if he took american citizenship he could beat the argentine ban and play in england suddenly he had a vision of the languid british officer with the cold falklands light falling on his even colder face with the butt of jaw and the turneddown curiously unemotional blue eyes he also remembered the voice which grew softer as it became more brutal you do want to play polo again dont you rafael the sooner they operate on that knee of yours the better just give me a few details they hadnt tortured him except to allow him no morphine and to make him stand on his damaged knee hour after hour then after hed fainted and come round the british officer had continued talking theres no way argentina can beat the brits noone will know what you tell us itll just end the war quicker and fewer of your mates will get killed i play polo too my handicap would probably have gone up to seven if it hadnt been for this bloody war polos an addictive game angel are you ok bibi was suddenly terrified of the expression on his face youre miles away about miles said angel tonelessly bibi took a deep breath dyou think its possible to fall in love in fortyeight hours is possible in fortyeight seconds said angel and pulled her into his arms under the dusty chandelier her hair was a light bay i want to marry you mumbled bibi into his bomber jacket which said world cup on the back if it didnt work out we could always get divorced but at least you could stay in the states we could find a home and a barn of our own away from my father and you wouldnt have to work for him any more angel put up his hand to still her trembling lips i dont want to be keeped you wouldnt be sobbed bibi itd be your money too ive got loads for both of us angel felt quite choked himself youre so sweet you wont boss me around i can wear the trousers sure you can angel looked at her watch we have time all the time in the world whispered bibi unhooking her pearl earrings and putting them on the mantelpiece i am playing in the mundialito this afternoon said angel hooking them on again theres a horse in pilar chico i very much want to try before if we urry we ave time then seeing the outrage on bibis face on zee way we look for a ring i buy it he added hastily i sell my watch this morning and tonight after zee match i make love to you so you wont get up for three days despite such promises bibi managed to gird her ransacked loins and meet angels grandmother at the plaza the next day but who is she angels grandmother kept saying to betty beforehand shes very rich mama you know angel hasnt got any money but who are they aeroplanes explained betty better than cars not as good as railroads not a great beauty is she added angels grandmother loudly as bibi approached shell never hold him my dear she advised bibi later you must remember that in argentina flattering the husbands ego is of supreme importance you must constantly demonstrate how much you love him oh i do sighed bibi but i ave to warn you jeanbaptiste my usband was constantly unfaithful to me my son pierre was constantly unfaithful to his wife thats why she run away with this italian rafael will be unfaithful to you american women who marry argentines are always shocked by their promiscuity but you mustnt take it personally they just have to demonstrate their virility despite being the longdistance target of angels obsessive loathing drew benedict had an excellent season in england not only were he and bas on the rutshire committee where they made themselves very unpopular with fatty harris by putting the club on a sounder commercial footing but drew had also been elected to the handicap committee of the british polo association polos governing body this meant players and patrons alike courted him for inside information the latter even offering him large backhanders to keep the handicaps of their team members down drew never accepted cash but several extremely nice ponies found their way into his yard which sukey who handled drews tax returns was amazed he had acquired so cheaply one of drews first tasks was to handicap ricky and dancer turning up at the rutshire at the beginning of the season drew noticed with a stab of envy that ricky was back to his old form hitting the ball with relentless accuracy getting the last panting ounce out of his ponies but still hogging the play too often roaring at perdita dancer and even bas to leave the ball on drews recommendation ricky was rated at seven two places lower than his handicap before he smashed his elbow he could always be put up in july perdita riding spotty and tero was so improved that to rickys intense irritation drew put her up to two he was even crosser when dancer whom ricky wanted rated as minus one to keep the teams collective handicap down was after a freak fortyyard forehand slap between the goal posts rated by drew at nought the bugger barely watched two chukkas exploded ricky in the bar afterwards how can he assess anyone on that drew said bas philosophically removing a sprig of mint from his pimms has other fish to fry he only spent ten minutes at a rutshire committee meeting the other night before beetling off must be establishing alibis any idea who she might be havent a clue snapped ricky who didnt want to hear about other peoples extramarital rompings with bas on six the collective handicap of the team was fifteen which meant they could play together in mediumgoal tournaments thus apocalypse was born looking it up they found that the four horsemen of the apocalypse famine justice pestilence and death had stalked through the land on white black red and pale horses so the beautiful jetblack shirts designed by dancers marketing department each had a different coloured horse on the front and a number in the same colour on the back the helmets were also black giving the entire team a sinister air bas was justice perdita pestilence the lean emaciated dancer appropriately famine and ricky the pale rider on the pale horse the custardyellow wayne filled the bill perfectly was death as a team their first problem was that they were all attacking players and bas as the secondbest player in the team was reduced to playing back which didnt suit him at all the second problem was organizing their schedules dancer had endless concert recording and television commitments bas as well as running the bar sinister in cotchester high street and pulling off numerous property deals was always sloping off to paris or the south of france or even the seychelles to appease one of his demanding mistresses even worse in may just before the season proper began bas joined forces with rupert declan ohara and various businessmen and local worthies and set up a consortium called venturer venturers aim was to oust the local itv station corinium which was run by bass corrupt and machiavellian brother anthony second baron baddingham this meant that bas had to spend much of the summer in secret meetings or canvassing round the area which drove ricky mad because bas kept missing matches or having to switch dates it just takes a lot of spade work explained bas soothingly impressing the right people that were the right people to run a television station i cant see you are at all snapped ricky you cant even organize yourself to play in a polo team when venturer get the franchise rupert and i are determined to get polo particularly the rutshire regularly on television its the ideal television sport brave and incredibly charismatic men speak for yourself and ravishing women it just needs promoting youll be grateful next year i am not interested in next year weve got a merrill lynch match tomorrow and weve already changed the date three times to fit in with you anyway what makes you so sure youll get the franchise because my brother is such a shit said bas and coriniums programmes are so frightful and all the staff are in such a state of anarchy since declan left we cant not despite bass frequent absences apocalypse had a wonderful first season with rickys handicap going up to eight perditas to three and dancers to one in the july ratings venturers publicity on the other hand got worse and worse and as autumn gave way to winter it looked less and less likely that they would wrest the franchise from corinium for a start the press got wind of the story that rupert was running after declans teenage daughter taggie then that he had seduced cameron cook anthony baddinghams mistress and coriniums star producer into his bed and on to venturers side this was followed by endless leaks about other staff venturer had poached it was also rumoured that bas was having an affair with declans wife maud and was also keen on taggie with rupert and bas behaving so irresponsibly drew didnt see why he should behave any better having played one season with the repulsive and demanding kevin coley and his dreadful wife enid whom he frequently wished perdita had drowned in the swimmingpool drew was looking for another patron he found being dependent on sukey more and more irksome but if he left her he would be solely dependent on patrons like kevin he had also become accustomed to having money which enabled him to spend a lot of time with daisy macleod his endless committee meetings in fact gave him the perfect alibi he also established a commendable reputation for uxoriousness leaving long before the end of the meeting never staying for drinks afterwards he pretended he must rush home to sukey then beetled off to bed with daisy as a loving wife sukey accompanied him to most matches so daisy avoided these except when perdita was playing on these occasions drew would invariably manage to touch daisys hand in the pony lines or murmur some endearment as he passed her at treadingin time sometimes when he rode out daisy would meet him in her car and when autumn came it was extraordinary how frequently the east cotchester foxes ran in the direction of snow cottage often they met in london in the great western hotel or at sukeys house off kensington church street at first daisy was appalled that drew could make love in his and sukeys ancient fourposter but as he was fond of pointing out a standing prick has no conscience love too made daisy worry less and less about morality her gratitude to drew was unbounded because he had completely transformed her life he had given her comfort and endless advice on bringing up her children and animals even ethel didnt take flying troilistic leaps into daisys bed at the wrong moment any more drew had also persuaded her to give up her job and trebled her income by finding her commissions she was now not only painting peoples dogs and horses but also their wives children and houses and everyone seemed delighted he had even asked an utterly unsuspecting sukey to show daisy how to do invoices and tax returns and introduced her to several galleries who showed interest in putting on exhibitions but as she tended to sell whatever she did it was difficult to get enough paintings together termtime gave daisy a great deal of freedom eddie and violet were still at boarding school perdita spent every day until long after dusk up at rickys whenever drew was able to see her therefore daisy downed brushes and instead painted all night and most of the weekend the holidays however were a nightmare because violet and eddie having taken against hamish and wendy refused to go to la any more insisting on staying at home and hogging the telephone drew was used to ringing daisy three times a day in the morning when sukey walked the dogs from his car telephone and then just to say he missed her last thing at night while sukey was having her bath all this was pegged when the children came home and now christmas was approaching and daisy was ashamed that she was dreading it more than ever towards the end of november on the eve of venturers crucial interview with the independent broadcasting authority in london all the papers were seething with speculation as to whether theyd win the franchise daisy however was only concerned that drew after a week playing polo in dubai with prince charles was flying home a day early unknown to sukey in order to spend a whole night with her this was a rare treat they had only managed twice since the affair had started daisy had done no painting for twentyfour hours she was so frantic polishing the house putting flowers in every alcove making the most succulent scallop prawn and lobster pie and lighting a fire of apple logs in the sitting room shed just got out of her bath and was painting her nipples rosemadder when she heard a car door slam outside goodness drew was early tearing off her bath cap shaking out her very clean hair she dived into the clinging bottlegreen wool dress shed bought specially dragged on the fantastically expensive brown boots drew had brought her back from deauville and squirting je reviens behind each ear charged downstairs drew was pounding on the door he must have left his key behind darling how heavenly yes i thought youd be pleased to see me said violet standing pinkfaced on the doorstep in her navyblue school uniform we spent the afternoon inspecting some ghastly roman fortifications at cotchester they said we could have the night off yesterday but i thought id surprise you have you got a tenner for the taxi as daisy scrabbled up a shoal of coins from her bag her mind was racing she darent ring drew on his car telephone in case he was giving someone a lift besides if she warned him he might not come and after a weeks absence she couldnt bear it thats ninefifty said violet there might be a pound in the lining of my dark blue coat said daisy as violet went out to pay the driver daisy tugged the blue bow off ethel shed just have to brazen it out mercifully violet seemed far more interested in rupert campbellblacks memoirs which were plastered all over the scorpion and in abridged form in the late editions of every national newspaper daisy had been too preoccupied with drews visit to turn on the wireless or read a paper all day absolutely riveting stuff mum said violet in excitement rupert had an affair with this journalist beattie johnson who was supposed to be writing his memoirs then he ditched her and shes had her revenge by telling everything about rupert and his women in the scorpion the daily express said it would have brought the government down if the tories were still in power there was a hiss as the potatoes boiled over on to the gas flame we were all reading it on the coach said violet turning down the gas until bloody miss lovettstanding confiscated it all about kinky foursomes and ruperts exwife being frigid and even implying rupert might be a bit gay tomorrow its going to be all about underage schoolgirls lucky things and how rupert got into politics by sleeping with the foreign ministers wife who loves being spanked violet giggled and blushed which clashed with her red hair she was nearly very pretty now oh poor rupert said daisy for a moment distracted from her panic over drew i didnt know anything about it you are out of touch said violet fondly you must have been painting all day gosh im starving something smells delicious what are we having for supper fish pie said daisy faintly i havent mashed the potatoes yet ill mash them violet prodded the potatoes with a fork then to daisys horror she opened the fridge and discovered passion and kiwi fruit salad two bottles of champagne and a large plate of smoked salmon yum said violet peeling off a slice of salmon whos coming round suddenly she took in the huge bunch of freesias on the table the pink candles the two laid places and the bowl of chocolates mum youve got a lover of course not to hide her blushes daisy grabbed the salt and added more to the potatoes drew benedicts coming round sukeys away and hes been so good to perdita i invited him to take pot luck lucks the word said violet christ this smoked salmons good drews a great friend of ruperts isnt he hell be able to give us all the lowdown grabbing pieces of iceberg lettuce with the avidity of a starved rabbit violet suddenly noticed a painting of a springer spaniel emerging from the reddening bracken which was propped up against one of the kitchen chairs thats lovely bit like ethel whos it for drew and sukey mumbled daisy she was doing it for drew then as a way of getting it into the house he could give it to sukey the subterfuges they resorted to were quite awful drew er commissioned it lied daisy its a surprise present for sukey drews coming round to fetch it this evening thats nice said violet i love it when husbands love their wives enough to surprise them like that you havent painted in its left ear so i havent said daisy then jumped as ethels great bassbaritone bark rang out she must warn drew before he let himself in with a latch key skidding down the frozen garden path the night air hitting her burning face like a cold shower she crashed into drew who was getting carrierbags full of drink and dutyfree scent out of the car hello darling lovely welcome thats a nice dress violets here gasped daisy christ suddenly as cold and distant as the stars above drew reversed back into his car daisy couldnt bear it she knows youre coming she gabbled she hasnt turned a hair i told her you were picking up flashs picture and id asked you to supper because sukey was away drew havered hed been looking forward to getting mildly pissed and screwing daisy all night for the past week a stilted dinner with a beady schoolgirl who might easily sneak to perdita and limited booze because he had to drive home was no substitute please stay ive missed you ok drew chucked the carrier bags back into the car but we must be careful hi said violet who was emptying the cream intended for the passion fruit salad into the potatoes and reading about rupert in the daily mail which had extensive extra coverage on all his exes isnt it awful the mail says venturerll never get the franchise now they wont said drew rupert was always the wild card in that consortium the iba wont like his escapades one bit i spoke to bas before i left dubai this morning ruperts in a frightful stew tried to resign from venturer but declan and bas wont let him saying theyve got to stick together but i reckon hes cooked their goose poor rupert drew expressed sympathy but didnt feel it rupert arrogant enough to think himself above the law had always been flagrantly indiscreet because hed never cared what people thought drew believed that discretion was much the better part of valour and the only way of having your cake and eating it ruperts dead attractive violet added half a pound of unsalted butter to the potatoes and its not as though hes married now i think its disgusting married men playing around but ruperts been single for ages she turned to daisy who hadnt had time to put on any makeup you look exhausted mum ill put the potato on top of the fish pie you go and have a drink with drew taking the bottle of moët from daisy drew followed her into the sitting room where daisys apple logs had nearly gone out im so sorry she moaned noticing that drew after a week in temperatures of more than was shivering like a whippet crouching down in front of the fireplace she pulled four more firelighters out of their packet and shoving them under the logs started frantically to puff what a stupid mess i couldnt get in touch with you did you win lost one won two said drew filling up three glasses and taking one into violet returning he waited until he could hear the crash of the potato masher on the bottom of the pan then said let me help you kneeling down he put his hands under daisys skirt and encountered bare daisy jesus christ daisy gave a muffled squawk i didnt have time to put any pants on violet arrived as i was getting out of the bath slowly drew ran his hand over her generous buttocks then slid it between them to her still damp bush no violet we mustnt gasped daisy shes only got to page two of the memoirs murmured drew three to go shut up and enjoy it daisy could feel his breath on the back of her neck as gently assuredly his fingering continued all right violet gasped daisy a minute later fine thanks drew propped the drawingroom door shut with his back as with trembling hands daisy unzipped his flies and slid her mouth over the rampant red firemans helmet it was over in ten seconds oh goodness your cockll smell of firelighters said daisy collapsing on to the sofa come on baby light my fire said drew handing her her glass that was crazy mumbled daisy as the apple logs sprung into merry flame but incredibly nice said drew sitting down close to her very rupert sort of behaviour is he ok not at all crucified hes let venturer down and worried sick about the effect the memoirs are going to have on the children worst of all hes now decided hes madly in love with declans daughter taggie and theres no way now declanll ever let him marry her he put a hand on daisys thigh whens violet going tomorrow early ill pop back midmorning sukeys not back till the afternoon christ that fish pie smells good i didnt have any lunch he kicked open the door slightly you ok violet violet came in hanging her head oh mum i was so busy reading about rupert ive eaten all the mashed potato and all the scallops out of the fish pie oh darling wailed daisy never mind theres a packet of smash in the cupboard there was admitted violet but two moths and a bluebottle flew out so i threw it away drew fortunately thought it was funny ill take you both out to dinner i love him thought daisy in passionate gratitude imagining the scene hamish would have made she knew drew had said he couldnt leave sukey but she could still hope contrary to every expectation venturer won the franchise and youll never guess what said drew when he rang to tell daisy ruperts getting married to taggie ohara im going to be an usher and ive persuaded her to commission you to paint ruperts old olympic horse rocky as a wedding present can you do it in a week ill try said daisy you are wonderful ill smuggle you into the house while ruperts in london and there are masses of photographs and ive got you an invite to the wedding itll be the thrash of the century cotchester cathedral first then back to ruperts hell pay for everything because declans flat broke but hes so happy hed buy taggie the sun and the moon dyou like her adorable and virtually untouched by human hand she must be nearly twenty years younger than rupert lucky sod then realizing what hed said and you look about twelve my darling anyway ive always been attracted to older women i love you sighed daisy gratefully can i really come to the wedding what ought i to wear ill take you into bath and buy you something the crumpet will be astonishing so youve got to look stunning as sukey had been nagging him about overspending all week he would take perverse pleasure in blueing her money on daisy not since the civil war when it had been a royalist stronghold which only yielded to the roundheads after a long and bloody battle had the sleepy market town of cotchester witnessed such scenes of mayhem police had been bused in from all over the west of england to control the crowds who despite driving snow and bitter east winds had turned up to catch a glimpse of rupert and his bride the media who almost outnumbered the crowd were going berserk because rupert had banned them from the cathedral and refused to the rage of his mother and his motherinlaw even to allow the wedding service to be privately videoed we are not fucking film stars and the only record we need of this marriage is tags wedding ring dusk had fallen and the snow turned to sleet as daisy arrived there were such traffic jams in the high street that she was frightened she might be late she was also slightly apprehensive about the clothes drew had bought her which consisted of a black velvet blazer printed with big pale pink roses black velvet knickerbockers a white frilled shirt and black buckled shoes she had added a bright pink cummerbund and tied her hair back with a black satin bow but all her nerves disappeared when the first person she saw was drew holding a vast blueandgreen umbrella over the tory leader and her husband as they progressed to loud cheers and the popping of hundreds of flashbulbs through the great doors of the cathedral next minute basil baddingham a wonderfully elongated figure with his redandyellow umbrella bucking in the wind like a spinnaker sail dived forward to shield daisy from the blizzard darling you look so sexy just like dick turpin bags i be black bess daisy giggled the flash bulbs popped theres that koo stark yelled a fat flushed woman pointing at daisy well done getting the franchise said daisy breathing in the heady scent of givenchy for men and bass gardenia marvellous isnt it about time my awful brother got his comeuppance when can i come and see your etchings gazing down bas massaged the inside of her rosepatterned arm with his thumb any time daisy was anxious to spin out the conversation as long as possible so she might grab a word with drew on his return journey how was ruperts stag party hell bas put down his umbrella as they entered the cathedral rupert wouldnt drink wouldnt chat up any of the stunning crumpet wed provided just banged on and on that he wasnt good enough for taggie with which i entirely agree and how he wasnt going to see her until this evening and how he was suffering from the most godawful withdrawal symptoms which is not something thatll happen in their nuptial bed this evening inside the cathedral to the smell of musk incense and antiquity were added wafts of a hundred scents and aftershaves and of huge banks of white roses lilies and freesias the womens jewellery much of it paid for in the past by rupert and their excited painted faces were lit up by thousands of white flickering candles and the clothes they wore were also in jewel colours sapphire ruby garnetpink emerald and amethyst satins silks and taffetas all rustling and gleaming daisy thanked god shed taken so much trouble with her appearance we could fill the bridegrooms side alone with ruperts stepparents and his exes murmured bas now where can we find a space to squeeze you in for christs sake stop gassing bas snapped drew hello daisy you look pretty just finding a glamorous unattached man for her to sit next to said bas maliciously no lets make it two and he swept daisy off to a pew ten rows in front which was already noisily inhabited by the carlisle twins mahoganytanned from playing in the mexican and argentine opens and janey lloydfoxe an incredibly glamorous journalist married to billy lloydfoxe ruperts best man and old showjumping crony theyll tell you who everyone is said bas massaging janeys collarbone and sliding his hand down the front of her bright blue suit mrs macleod you look stunning said seb patting the space between him and dommie hows that sexy toffeenosed daughter of yours janeys just telling us how furious the bishop is the bishops got a thumping crush on taggie janey smiled wickedly at daisy so he agreed to marry her in christmas week which is quite unprecedented before he realized she was marrying his bête noire or rather bêtecampbellblack and declan told the bishop it was going to be the tiniest wedding and now look at this circus she waved a goldbraceleted hand at the packed pews who were yelling away like a vast drinks party and someones lit all the candles which were meant for midnight mass god look at that janey paused in her lecture as a brazilian polo player with blackcurrant ripple hair and an amazing brunette on his arm shimmered past and the bishops even more miffed because ruperts mother thats her up the front with her fifth husband and roulette chips rattling round in the bottom of her bag insisted on inviting an outside priest to help thats him in the red cassock im sure hes got breeches and boots underneath like richard chamberlain in the thorn birds here comes the brides mother said dommie as declan oharas wife maud swept by in a fuschiapink suit clashing dazzlingly with her piledup red hair that suit cost more than the wedding put together said janey scribbling frantically balmain i think shes determined to upstage the bride and thats ruperts immediate exmistress cameron cook even more determined to upstage the bride said seb as a furiouslooking girl in a clinging leopardskin dress and no hat on her short sleekedback hair stalked by camerons taken up with declans son patrick explained janey to daisy hes the beauty following her isnt he amazing looking but it must be hell for cameron handing the torch over to taggie so publicly my god theres victor and sharon kaputnik how the hell did they get invited victor paid me said seb simply half of which i split with rupert you never told me i should get a cut protested dommie as victor carrying his telephone and sharon all in white like a great swan filled up almost an entire pew thats declans other daughter caitlin went on janey as a pretty teenager with grassgreen hair clumped by in a black cloak and doc marten boots she refused to be a bridesmaid unless she could wear jeans she added as caitlin slid into a pew two rows in front already inhabited by her brother and cameron cook and promptly lit a cigarette daisy was aware of drew going steadily back and forth bringing in different people smiling slightly in her direction he made so much less din and worked twice as efficiently as the other ushers particularly bas who couldnt resist squeezing and joking with every girl he accompanied i love drew thought daisy i love his dependability and sense of responsibility interesting shes turned up said dommie offering daisy a swig of brandy as the arrival of ruperts exwife helen caused a ripple of interest she was wearing a dark grey suit with a white puritan collar and a tiny grey hat with a veil over her huge yellow eyes shes stunning sighed daisy bit earnest said janey beattie johnson was dead right describing her as a lead balloon at an orgy thats their son marcus sweet boy never got on with rupert taggie might bring them together a colossal cheer went up from outside the cathedral as dancer came in glamorously emaciated in a light grey morning coat his glittering grey eyes emphasized by kohl his streaked tousled mane coaxed forward to hide the mantan join on the hairline hes going to sing the anthem said dommie and im the only member of the press ruperts allowed in to witness it said janey smugly although that acolyte whos just whisked by in that white laundry bag looks suspiciously like nigel dempster ill kill nigel if thats the one i want went on janey lowering her voice and her neckline by a button who asked daisy el orgulloso murmured janey pointing at ricky whod just sat down beside dancer look at that duelling scar and those hard hard cheekbones beneath those dark dark eyes and all that sadness waiting to be comforted and he still never takes off that black tie in mourning for will he is lovely agreed daisy i could cheer him up in fact im going to have a crack at him this evening janey had to raise her voice above another even more deafening burst of cheering accompanied by pealing bells oh look here comes my husband and the bridegroom having not seen rupert for eighteen months when hed been chatting up pretty mothers and cheering on his daughter tabitha at the pony club championships daisy was shocked by his appearance he must have lost a stone and a half and was as white as his carnation as he stalked up the aisle he was followed by janeys husband billy whose top shirt button was missing and whose morning coat had split on the left seam running to keep up with rupert smiling and waving at everyone he paused to kiss janey ruperts in the most frightful tiz ive been trying to forcefeed him quadruple brandies but he wont drink because hes got to fly the helicopter afterwards see you later and he was off to the front pew simultaneously trying to calm rupert down and turning round to chatter to ruperts score of stepparents in the rows behind what a lovely man said daisy isnt he said janey who was however looking at the bridegrooms cold unsmiling face perhaps ruperts having second thoughts i never thought taggie was very pretty thats because youre not a man said dommie offering daisy another swig were awfully late starting oh do look he started to laugh the next moment janey daisy and seb had joined in for on caitlin oharas heavily laddered black knees sat a little blackandwhite mongrel gertrude with a pink bow round her neck bristling with disapproval and shutting her eyes to avoid caitlins cigarette smoke i do think you ought to take that dog out said her mother petulantly its so selfish of rupert not to allow the television cameras in rupert looked at his watch go and ring and see whats happened he snapped at billy do use sir victors phone said sharon kaputnik graciously waylaying billy on the way down the aisle and cutting off a furious victor in midcall to new york oh look whispered janey to daisy here comes sukey benedict silly old fossil always doing up other peoples buttons thats a nice suit sukey she called out as bas maliciously showed sukey into the pew in front drew chose it said sukey lowering her voice in deference to her surroundings hello twins hello daisy i absolutely adore the picture of flash drew couldnt resist giving it to me before christmas such a good likeness drew on his way back from delivering yet another of ruperts stepmothers froze in his tracks when he saw where sukey was sitting bloody bas stirring it again hello darling stagewhispered sukey just telling daisy how much we love flash drews eyes flickered its very good a great party of showjumpers and their wives whod obviously just finished a good lunch were ushered into a side aisle as a returning billy sat down beside rupert whispering that taggie was on her way with stately dignity the bishop mounted the steps to the pulpit which was topped with pinkandwhite carnations leaning out for a first glimpse of the bride he looked thunderous the heathen had invaded his church i should like everyone to spend the next five minutes before the bride arrives he announced heavily over the microphone in silence praying for the happiness of rupert and agatha and examining their own marriages everyones jaw dropped in amazement then because none of them wanted to think about their marriages they all started yakking again ignoring the bishop stomping furiously back down the aisle rather suspect vowel sounds said ruperts mother who on earths agatha grumbled ruperts father thought rupert was marrying someone called taggie dyou think ruperts got aids murmured sharon kaputnik nervously he looks so thin oh do stop phoning for a second victor where the fuck is she snarled rupert i bet declans had a shunt i should never have let her out of my sight his knuckles were white where he gripped the edge of the pew a muscle flickered nonstop in his cheek just a simple service thought the bishop inflating like a bullfrog as he began the long procession up the church followed by choirboys and acolytes im sure thats nigel dempster said janey nigel she hissed the passing acolyte flicked his censer in her direction winked and moved on i want to marry drew thought daisy as handels water music petered out and the organ swelled to the soaring yellow roof with here comes the bride rupert who was tone deaf didnt recognize the tune but the congregation stumbled to their feet its ok its your opening number said billy soothingly and slowly up the long long aisle came declan ohara his hair was almost all silver now the worry of the fight for the franchise had dug great trenches on his forehead and on either side of his mouth his morning coat was crumpled he was wearing odd socks tears poured down his cheeks but daisy glancing round thought his face should have been hewn out of rock on mount vernon surreptitiously taking a pencil out of her bag she started to draw him on the back of her service sheet beside him almost as tall but half the breadth and shivering frantically like a young poplar in a forceten gale walked the bride she wore ruperts mothers tiara shaped like the new moon in her cloudy dark hair now covered by the slightly yellowing campbellblack family veil her dress of heavy ivory silk only finished two days ago was already too big for her the train glittered in the candlelight like a dragonflys wing and seemed to have a life all its own as it slithered iridescent over the faded flagstones look at that body sighed seb oh lucky lucky rupert the bishop of cotchester waited in his gold robes on the redcarpeted steps rupert glanced round for a second he gazed unbelievingly at the trembling white figure then the tension seemed to drain out of him walking straight down the aisle with his arms out a huge smile suddenly transformed his face the handsomest man in england once again meeting taggie just level with daisys row he drew her against him shutting his eyes for a second stilling her trembling checking she was real then he looked down at her and mouthed i love you hello daddy interrupted the shrill voice of tabitha campbellblack angelic in light and dark pink striped taffeta with a coronet of pinkandwhite freesias over her nose dyou like my dress a rumble of laughter went through the cathedral you look gorgeous said rupert taking her hand then turning back to taggie and putting his arm round her shoulder lets get this over with oh how sweet mumbled daisy wiping her eyes glancing round drew smiled at her fleetingly dearly beloved intoned the bishop who managed to conduct the entire service without once looking at rupert it was disgraceful that such an utter bounder should have captured such a beautiful innocent child i agatha maud stammered taggie gazing in wonder at rupert take thee rrrupert edward algernon forsaking all others said the bishop forsaking all others repeated rupert squeezing taggies hand thatll be the day said janey still scribbling everyone jumped out of their skins as victors telephone rang the bishops temper was further taxed when gertrude the mongrel whod been held up to watch unable to bear being put asunder from her mistress a moment longer wriggled out of caitlins arms again the congregation rocked with laughter as she scampered along the pew up the aisle her claws clattering on the flagstones and stationed herself firmly between rupert and taggie who both had to exert the utmost selfcontrol not to laugh as well i would like to take as my text the words forsaking all others began the bishop heavily and launched into a long rant about aids the perils of infidelity and the low morals of his congregation gertrude the mongrel listening intently started to pant let flesh retire speak through the earthquake wind and fire oh still small voice of calm bellowed the congregation i wish my flesh would retire whispered janey fingering the beginning of a spare tyre i find weddings frightfully unsettling dont you particularly when the couple are so madly in love one starts looking at ones own marriage or lack of marriage in your case daisy and saying why arent i as happy as them oh look theyre going to sign the register and here comes dancer to sing the anthem lucky rupert lucky taggie thought dancer as he adjusted the microphone and gazed out over the sea of cynical mocking faces waiting for him to make a cockup as the lovely strains of glucks orpheus swept over the cathedral like a river of sunlight dancers eyes were automatically drawn to rickys face as pale and frozen as ruperts had been a quarter of an hour before dancer had given his heart irrevocably to ricky three years ago in prison but ricky would never have any idea what is life to me without you sang dancer in his haunting light tenor he played it absolutely straight no frenziedly flying blond mane no jabbing fingers no juddering pelvis just a slight smile lifting his sad clowns face a shiver of amazed joy ran through the congregation daisys cheeks were not the only ones to be soaked with tears i like that crooner said ruperts father loudly didyer say hed made a record or he had one what a pity he didnt take up opera whispered sukey dont think hed have made so much money said seb and he certainly wouldnt have been able to support a polo team nudging daisy he pointed to sukeys fingers which were tangling with drews paddling the centre of his palm and caressing the inside of his powerful wrist captain benedicts going to get it tonight whispered seb in daisys ear then seeing her look of anguish squeezed her hand spect all this reminds you of your own marriage dont cry everyone thinks youre stunning at last the organ broke into the wedding march and down they came taggie and rupert glued together taggie with her veil back dark tendrils escaping on to her forehead eyes huge with love all her lipstick kissed off in the vestry kept breaking into laughter at ruperts outrageous asides youd think rupert had won a gold and the world championships all in one said janey opening another notebook i must say she is pretty now he absolutely adores her said the leader of the opposition checking her mascara in a powder compact and shes so enchantingly unsmug about getting him out into the snow went rupert and his bride and the cheers and the bells rang out as the flashes of a thousand photographers lit up the high street i mustnt cry daisy told herself as she followed the twins out must just go and have a word with the horse physiotherapist said sukey bolting off down a side aisle then so quickly daisy couldnt believe it was happening a warm hand slid into her frozen one and drews voice whispered wow i want to worship you with my body daisy had always longed to see inside ruperts house which shed admired so often from the penscombechalford road lying serene and golden against its pillow of beech woods now thickly counterpaned with snow inside dom perignon flowed faster than the frogsmore after a rainstorm as a wildly yelling party spread through the ground floor out into a large marquee where a band was playing youd be so easy to love the lineup took less time than usual because rupert was more interested in talking to taggie than any of the guests and ruperts father eddie was busy chatting up maud ohara and sniping at his first wife ruperts mother daisy wandered from room to beautiful pastel room absolutely knocked out by the pictures two gainsboroughs a van eyck a manet several stubbs a rembrandt and a cotman for starters and listening to the comments of ruperts army of exes hasnt let go of her hand for one moment has he terrified of someone telling stories out of school good thing she was too dyslexic to read the memoirs shell never hold him i just cannot believe ruperts ability to bounce back those memoirs must be the most damaging publicity anyones ever had but now hes hitched to this sweet young thing all the press and the shadow cabinet are clamouring for him to stay hes told the leader of the opposition hes not even going to stay on as an mp because it involves too many late nights ah well well all have to find someone else that dancers dead sexy isnt he darling hes gay i heard he goes both ways and he is rickys patron and the way into ricky and you know how much we all want that i think rickys more attractive than rupert more unobtainable up until now you mean wandering on daisy heard desperate weeping peering into ruperts dark green study she saw ruperts exmistress cameron cook slumped over the desk i cant help it i know rupert wouldnt have made me happy but id rather be miserable with him than happy with anyone else she sobbed no you wouldnt said declans son patrick gently stroking the back of her neck we both knew today would be a nightmare for you right you just hang in with me he was so young and handsome and certain lucky cameron thought daisy she wondered where drew was there were so many beautiful women around she felt a wave of relief that she wasnt married to hamish any more hed have been belting round kilt aswirl attempting to get off with all of them the irish contingent were already dancing in one corner the twins were having a fight scuffling like bear cubs you bloody well could have given me a cut of that five grand dommie was saying i gave you half the money from that pony of his i sold back to victor sitting under a mournful landseer bloodhound daisy found tabitha campbellblack drinking champagne and feeding profiteroles to ruperts pack of slavering dogs ive had eight profiteroles she informed daisy dyou think daddys fertilized taggie yet i wouldnt think so said daisy dyou like her yes but daddy wont let me go on the honeymoon shall i draw a picture of you asked daisy yes please said tabitha later having danced with the twins and bas and several foreign showjumpers and rocked and rolled for an amazingly sexy energetic ten minutes with dancer daisy wandered upstairs to repair her face going through a door she found a bathroom the wall was covered with photographs of rupert in his showjumping days in one he was riding a splendid chestnut mare and being presented with a cup by a famous middleaged beauty underneath she had scrawled so happy to mount you grania how would taggie cope with that every time she had a pee wondered daisy hamish had never really coped with her past opening the door on the other side daisy found herself in a bedroom with old rose walls pinkandyellow silk curtains and a great jacobean fourposter which was so smothered in fur coats that it seemed to have a slumbering animal life of its own perched on a yellow chaiselongue in an olive green overcoat was sukey benedict talking to mrs hughie hello daisy said sukey love your outfit so original dont you think edwina how are you getting on in snow cottage not too lonely then before daisy had time to answer drew and i were just saying we must find you a super chap drews brothers home on leave soon perhaps youll come and have kitchen sups when hes staying as daisy sat down at the dressingroom table sukey turned back to mrs hughie having mouthed bit of a bohemian pointing in daisys direction she continued were off to st moritz to play snow polo after christmas its going to be just like a second honeymoon with trembling hands daisy got a tube of base foundation out of her bag i wont be able to ski of course my gynie said it wasnt wise as i lost the last one at three months sukeys voice was as insistent as philippas burglar alarm its funny we had no difficulty getting jamie but weve been trying and trying for this one i had my tubes blown and drew was about to have a sperm test when i found i was pregnant is that really drews mistress looking back at me thought daisy numbly as she gazed at her ashen face drew had never mentioned the miscarriage and swore he never slept with sukey drews over the moon because hes always wanted a huge family sukey was off again hes being so caring at the moment he gave me the most gorgeous recording of cosi fan tutte our favourite opera as a celebration present weve been playing it all week he says at least if im listening im not scurrying about thats what i gave drew for christmas its our favourite opera thought daisy looking down she saw shed spilled base all over her new velvet knickerbockers frantically rubbing it away with a kleenex she fled downstairs slap into drew ive been looking for you everywhere he said putting his hands round her pink cummerbund sukeys leaving said daisy with a sob shes just told me the good news that youre having another baby and youve both been trying for ages and youre going to find me a super chap and you gave her cosi for christmas it was the tape you gave me explained drew taking her hands it was the only way i could get it into the house and play it nonstop look ill come and see you tomorrow meet me on the north side of eldercombe woods at ten thirty daisy glanced into the study which now contained the bride and bridegroom locked in each others arms no its no good i cant cope with half measures any more she sobbed fighting her way through a hall full of people eating plates of chicken she passed janey lloydfoxe telephoning through her copy rupert said open quotes bugger off close quotes daisy opened a side door and went out on to the terrace it was bitterly cold and snowing steadily the magnolia on the lawn buckled under its weight of whiteness the valley stretched out through the blizzard shadowed electric blue and darkly furred with woods daisy gave a gasp as a ghostly figure rose up from a bench his face was deathly pale his hair his eyebrows and the shoulders of his morning coat were covered in snowflakes only his hollowed eyes were as black as whirlpools he was like some doomed figure in a blackandwhite russian film i hate weddings wept daisy so do i said ricky you must be frozen daisy dabbed her eyes with the basesmeared kleenex what are you doing out here trying not to be a spectre at the feast thought id try out a wedding to see if i was cured now i know im not i should be over her its three and a half years not at times like this comforted daisy weddings are killers christmas is a killer not being able to drink doesnt help and seeing people as blissful as rupert and taggie is worst of all youve got all four chessie looked like an angel as a bride said ricky her hair was filled with spring flowers i thought id arrived in heaven i loved her so much but i couldnt show it she found me utterly uncommunicative i showed it too much said daisy sadly hamish found me utterly claustrophobic you cant win really you dont want me but you want me to go on wanting you sang the bandleader i wish i wasnt so attractive to birds sighed dancer seeking refuge in the pantry you wouldnt be so rich if you werent said bas who was already very drunk dancer had seen ricky go on to the terrace it broke his heart to see him so miserable weve got to do somefink positive about ricky youve done a helluva lot protested bas youve financed the bugger and put up with his moods but i tell you hell never win his beloved gold cup or get to ten with the present team you think i ought to stand down and be a nonplaying patron said dancer stoically you gotta level with me christ no its me who should said bas ive got far too many business commitments to play high goal and next year im going to be run off my feet with venturer we start transmitting at the beginning of the following year and rupert and i are planning to revive the westchester in the states in september dancer whod been arranging his tangled curls in the reflection of the window swung round but the westchesters rickys holy grail he said excitedly youre not having me on you fink you could sure said bas topping up both their glasses theres been such a polo explosion particularly in america ruperts mad about the idea and he never gets involved with anything that doesnt mean big bucks dancer shook his head well miss you on the team you give us class and a lot of headaches you need a seriously good defensive back who dyou suggest money no object alejandro mendozas the best said bas but hed rip you off and hes not allowed in ben napiers a bastard and wouldnt even charm you while he ripped you off shark nelligans an animal you know anything about luke alderton thats an idea admitted bas youd like him hes playing brilliantly at the moment scored two penalties from beyond the halfway line in the american open and hes got this amazing grey fantasma hes rock solid and hed be brilliant at defusing perdita and ricky ill ring him tomorrow dancer was really happy now and im knocked out about the westchester is there anyfing i can do for venturer i expect so said bas hullo janey darling slowly he undid the buttons of her bright blue suit and did them up again correctly wheres ricky i cant find him anywhere said janey fretfully its absolutely infuriating ive just filed copy only to find ruperts father has suddenly proposed again to ruperts mother with nine other wives and husbands to be taken into consideration i wonder if the daily mail diary page has gone to bed i could flog it to nigel anyone seen rupert and taggie patrick ohara put his head round the door we must get them to cut the cake or my fatherll be too drunk to make his speech hes been rehearsing snatches of yeats all week so many loved ruperts moments of glad disgrace said janey drily i hope declans not going to quote yeats at those philistines they know far more about snatches not the irish said patrick rupert and taggie whod escaped upstairs gazed over the white valley its all yours now he murmured removing her veil and her tiara and ruffling her long dark hair if i really told you how much i loved you youd be still here gathering dust and cobwebs in a hundred years dyou know i feel faint oh darling interrupted taggie all concern i bet you havent eaten since yesterday faint with longing went on rupert im fed up with all these people shall we go but we havent cut the cake said rupert shocked and im supposed to thank your parents for letting you pay for the entire wedding declan wants to make his speech hell make it whether were here or not we ought to stay said rupert doubtfully its your big day only because i married you id much rather we were alone what is life to me without you said rupert dropping a kiss on her forehead go and change declan quite understood their leaving early maud who was pathologically jealous of her daughter chuntered with disapproval but was secretly relieved only a few guests realizing they were going fought their way through the snowstorm like arctic explorers to wave them off no you cant go too caitlin ohara told gertrude who was whining irritably or youd have to spend six months in quarantine on the way home as rupert now in a dark suit did a lastminute check of the helicopter taggie came out of a side door wearing a scarlet wool coat over shiny black boots with her long hair lifting in the wind she made a brilliant splash of colour have my bouquet she said shyly throwing it to daisy ruperts so thrilled with your painting of rocky its his best present as rupert was about to help taggie into the helicopter tabitha hurled herself on her new stepmother i want to go on the honeymoon she sobbed she could really said taggie looking up at rupert you both could she added taking marcuss hand no they bloody couldnt said rupert throw some confetti said billy lloydfoxe giving tabitha a huge handful to distract her but as she flung it most of the pinkandblue circles were caught up in the whirling blizzard and swept away where are taggie and rupert demanded ruperts mother from the warmth of the drawing room gorn said ruperts father looking out of the window on what used to be his valley strordinary behaviour in the middle of ones own wedding damn rude i call it grumbled ruperts mother anyway as i was saying my darling old cook dropped dead this morning before lunch said ruperts father shocked how frightfully selfish so ive no one to cook for me come and live with me in the ritz i dont think rudolpho would like it whos he my husband thought you were married to someone called luigi that was the one before declan waved as the helicopter soared into the white night lighting up the swirling snowflakes and the igloos that had formed over yew tree and rose bush and they are gone ay ages long ago he said huskily these lovers fled away into the storm god bless them both as daisy handed him her last kleenex he turned to her smiling through his tears and you got the brides flowers darling he touched her cheek youre so pretty you deserve a decent husband thank you said daisy even if he is somebody elses whispered a voice behind her leaping round daisy found drew with the brown velvet collar of his coat turned up and his blond eyelashes thick with snow i thought youd gone i dropped sukey and came straight back im sorry about what she said but it is you that i love in march luke flew through similar snowstorms over whitecapped peaks to denver colorado he had arranged to meet dancer who was in the middle of a punishing but wildly successful fortyfiveconcert tour across america to coincide with the launch of his new album four horsemen dancers noisy entourage had taken over the warwick hotel which was barricaded up like fort knox four security men screaming hes gonna bed for chrissake to the hordes of fans stamping their feet in the snow outside smuggled luke in after two hours on stage during which he reckoned to run six miles and lose as many pounds to the accompaniment of rockets squibs flame throwers videos and millions of watts of flashing lights dancer was slumped on a sofa eating doughnuts and unenthusiastically sipping herbal tea sweetened with honey to protect his voice he had kicked off his shoes and undone the top buttons of the crumpled white regency shirt hed worn on stage his streaked mane now dark with sweat was drawn into a pony tail the famous face was tanned and flushed with colour and with the light behind him it was hard to tell how much of this was stage makeup the demoniacally glittering eyes were hollowed and bloodshot he looks more like mephistopheles than a fallen angel thought luke christ i could murder a bottle of bourbon dancer winced slightly as lukes powerful handshake pressed a plethora of heavy metal rings into his hand wiv sixtythousand people screamin at you it takes about three hours to come down off the high sit down what can i get you bourbond be great said luke dancer nodded curtly to a minion with strawberrypink hair who was eyeing luke with considerable excitement i just love the album said luke the whole of palm beach polo club is thrumming to the beat of the four horsemen blacksmiths shoe to it grooms strap to it every car stereo booms it across the pitches its the best tune since high noon thanks luke grinned lazily up at the minion who went as pink as his hair how many more weeks have you got to do he went on even making an armchair look tiny as he sat down abart a month and ten cities sighed dancer god i wish it was over i have promises to keep and miles to go before i sleep murmured luke nice said dancer selecting another doughnut about miles in my case what dyou want to eat the tbones come off dinosaurs here luke shook his head well perhaps later said dancer i wish we could go to a restaurant but wed only get assled leave the bourbon out and op it you lot he added to the entourage we oughta stay youre going to talk terms insisted the lawyers in their pinstriped suits we oughta stay said the minders eyeing the breadth of lukes shoulders you oughta get out of that shirt dancer its sopping said his dresser piss off snapped dancer trust you to keep all the nice ones to yourself dancer ouch squealed the pinkhaired minion as a doughnut hit him on the forehead bye bye luke so nice not to be allowed to meet you reluctantly grumbling the entourage dispersed luke picked up a photograph on the side table of a jubilant apocalypse team winning the royal windsor cup the print had obviously been chosen because for once ricky was looking relaxed and smiling perdita flushed and sweaty didnt look her best but lukes heart still jumped in pain how is she he asked his face impassive tricky said dancer bitching at that lovely mother rowing with ricky screaming at umpires believing the world owes her a year after tax little miss mcenroe in fact but rewarding situation normal said luke every bit of affection going on the animals went on dancer fishing but i reckon shes still a virgin luke drained half his bourbon i wouldnt know she the only reason youre taking the job asked dancer gouging the jammy centre out of another doughnut and chucking the rest away yes and no i guess your albums great and you could play real good polo if you spent more time and rickys potentially the best player in the world and ive always wanted to visit stratford sweating from the central heating luke took off his us open bomber jacket underneath he wore the muchpatched blueandgreen check shirt perdita had given him the christmas before last it was the nearest he could get to her ugly but seriously attractive decided dancer as he admired the generous friendly face and the marvellous body but luke looked weary beneath the freckles like some young civil war general whos been fighting without sleep for too many days in the burning sun but still has to radiate calmness and confidence to the troops we gotta win the gold cup this year said dancer flatly youre the boss said luke but youve all gotta get your act together you never fielded the same team twice last year and i know its hard when youre working but youve gotta make time to practise dancer smiled ill make twelve million on this tour i guess i could take may june and july off i can write the odd song in the mornings youll be stick and balling every morning dancer shuddered fucking hell the nick cured me of getting up early rickys been abroad buying ponies dyou need any ill bring ma own said luke oh that straightforwardness and that deep husky florida drawl thought dancer it conjured up images of orange juice sunshine blond beaches and all the time in the world to train ponies and make love perdita needed her swollen head examined im looking forward to meeting your dream machine he said fantasma lukes face softened shes a onceinalifetime mare im two goals better when i ride her and shes so clever if i play her in jeans shell buck me off but if i put on boots and whites and a polo shirt she knows shes going to a match and becomes the soul of responsibility he blushed slightly i guess i just adore her having heard from ricky how pushed luke always was for cash dancer started picking polish off his nails now about dosh i was finking after all he had sent the lawyers and the accountants packing and it was his money about plus all expenses airfare for you and the orses and of course a car and youll stay with ricky that sounds just about ok said luke trying to be cool then he laughed a slow rumbling infectious laugh jesus man its fantastic beyond my wildest dreams and theyre pretty wild sometimes you sure course said dancer fuck the lawyers and its a grand every time we win for a second luke frowned my father does that makes players superaggressive your father wins a lot of matches pointed out dancer and hes coming to england this year whats he going to say about you playing for the enemy thats my problem said luke the weeks until luke left for england were the longest of his life he made a day chart and through sleepless nights read a lot of poetry and for the first time stick and balled in jeans in the hope of getting a decent tan but merely ended up with more freckles he had however played more magnificent polo managing with angels and fantasmas help to power hal peters cheetahs to the finals of the rolex and the world cup here he was only beaten by the obriens and his father who was predictably foaming at the goalmouth that luke was off to play for ricky hal peters who had very reluctantly released luke for the summer said he would be praying daily that luke would not succumb to dancers wicked ways sitting on concorde being plied with champagne and caviar which he was too excited to eat luke wasnt sure he hadnt already succumbed his only sadness was that leroy wasnt sitting beside him in a collar and tie the hulking black dog had seemed to shrink to pugsize as he crept into lukes suitcase burrowing frantically under the new sweaters bought for an english summer gazing up at luke with despairing eyes luckier were fantasma and the rest of lukes ponies who having completed quarantine would be over with the grooms in a fortnight normally luke would have insisted on travelling with them but fortunately fantasma had at last suspended hostilities with lizzie lukes comely head groom and grudgingly allowed her to look after her when luke wasnt around his longing to see perdita again and dancers increasingly frantic pleas to come and sort out apocalypse had also sent him on ahead luke was so nervous and excited at the thought of perdita coming to meet him that he had drenched one shirt with sweat he took another from his overnight bag yellow and white striped it came from worth avenue and had been given him with a honeycoloured silk tie to match his eyes by lizzie and the other grooms for his birthday the previous day it had never occurred to luke to match something to his eyes he considered his mug too ugly to be enhanced by anything he wore at least the concorde johns were big usually he could hardly get his shoulders through those buckling doors it was a beautiful shirt but his hands were shaking so much he couldnt do up the cufflinks so he rolled up the sleeves and left off the honeycoloured tie it seemed strange to leave new york in blazing lunchtime sunshine and arrive three hours later in the middle of the english night like plunging into hades he anticipated a long wait at customs seeing polo sticks officials invariably imagined drugs or illegal currency and tended to disembowel everything but under dancers aegis he was whizzed straight out into the airport his knees hardly able to carry him his crashing heart bruising his ribs walking past the eager faces searching everywhere for perdita but she wasnt there it was as though miguel obrien had clouted a penalty two slap into his belly twenty minutes later the crowd had dispersed fighting despair exhaustion and postchampagne depression luke mindlessly gazed at the new york times crossword if he nipped off to call rickys hed be bound to miss her give it five more minutes then he caught his breath for pummelling her way through the crowd forming to meet the next plane scowling with fury like a winning yachtsman pegged by a sudden squall came perdita there was a smudge on her cheek her hair was escaping from its plait she still wore breeches boots and a ripped polo shirt but as choirs instinctively turn eastwards in the creed everyone swivelled round to gaze at her bloody bloody traffic she screamed ive been in a traffic jam on the m for over an hour and when i parked the car outside some dickhead in a peaked cap rushes up and tells me i cant so i left it i expect its been towed away by now with waynes bridle just back from the menders in it christ i hate this country hush sweetheart ive come miles and id like to say hello luke held out his arms and she went into them for a second she was rigid with rage then she relaxed against him her hair smelt of sweat the stables and cigarette smoke but her clear white forehead glowed like the moon then she looked up and grinned i am really pleased to see you i need you so badly you do asked luke madly encouraged to sort out my game said perdita im playing like shit and that asshole ricky wont let me near the ball not knowing whether to laugh or cry luke laughed you havent changed i didnt have time i came straight from the yard dyou know the kaputnik tigers thrashed us yesterday and victor didnt do a bloody thing all the match oh yes he did he fell off luke went to bed deeply depressed ricky had welcomed him guardedly and without any friendliness making it clear he was the boss of apocalypse and would only seek lukes advice if he needed it after florida in the nineties robinsgrove seemed bitterly cold as a polo player luke was used to lousy accommodation but there was something particularly chilling about rickys spare room with the heavy dark furniture bare floors applegreen walls and a royalblue best playing pony blanket instead of a counterpane there were no flowers and a pile of yellowing tatlers and harpers and queens indicated that no one had used the room since chessie left woken next morning by the cuckoo however he looked down eldercombe valley and freaked below him lawns dotted with daisies flowed into an orchard foaming with coralpink apple blossom then into paddocks full of buttercups and sleek grazing ponies then falling into the jadegreen ride which fell threequarters of a mile down between wooded cliff walls to the little cottage where perdita lived the sweet scent of the montana clambering round his window and the primulas and dark red wallflowers below were fighting a losing battle with the rampant reek of the wild garlic which was sweeping the woods in an emeraldgreen tidal wave and whoever wakes in england sees some morning unaware thought luke wandering downstairs in search of breakfast he paused to examine the photographs in the hall christ that was a westchester team beside the grandfather clock he found ricky drinking black coffee feeding pieces of sausage to little chef and making lists matching ponies to players for the mediumgoal match at the rutshire polo club that afternoon this house is incredible said luke and the view from my room is to die for and who are all those guys in the photographs in the hall oh various relations said ricky uninterested luke admired the drawings of ponies crowding the kitchen walls those are neat who did them perditas mother not bad is she shes just painted rupert campbellblacks wife taggie even rupert liked it after the hundredth sitting paint must never hope to reproduce that faint halfflush that dies along her throat murmured luke whats she like perditas mother ricky looked up from his lists and frowned sweet like a hot bath after hunting i wonder if waynes fit enough to play two chukkas to rickys and perditas irritated envy dancer had provided luke with a brandnew dark green mercedes stuffed full of classical tapes as don giovanni serenaded nesting birds on the way to the match luke was so knocked out by the beauty of the rutshire countryside that he kept forgetting to drive on the left side of the road like sleeping yellow labrador puppies the ancient cotswold villages seemed to sprawl across the wooded valleys the fierce sapphire of the bluebells had been faded by a hot april to pale periwinkleblue but the verges frothed with cow parsley the fields were full of cowslips silver cuckoo flower and leaping lambs and many of the trees were putting out acidgreen leaves against a threatening navyblue sky to the right perdita pointed out david waterlanes splendid queen anne house peeping over its dark fan of yew hedge and the sweep of land rupert and bas had snapped up on which to build polo yards then driving through large lichened gates up a long drive of beech trees passing little gazebos and towers on the edge of grassy rides or adding lustre to a view they finally reached the clubhouse and the fields with their ring of splendid trees and the magnificent stands donated by bart the presence of both the prince of wales and dancer maitland in the same match had attracted a much larger crowd than usual for a thursday afternoon perdita who had changed into her black shirt with the red horse on the front and who was more nervous than she cared to admit of playing in front of luke again shot off to the pony lines she was enraged to go slap into daisy what are you doing here cheering you on said daisy not altogether truthfully drew was playing for opposing rutminster hall with david waterlane the prince and an underhandicapped chilean called josé is luke playing asked daisy how many times do i have to tell you fifteens the limit for medium goal luke and ricky add up to sixteen between them were playing with dancer and mike waterlane wholl be useless because his fathers playing for the other side is luke here over there listening to some stupid mozart tape and she raced off to find ricky yelling at louisa whod replaced frances as head groom and whod put in the wrong bridle for tero fischerdieskau finished the aria coming down to earth wishing he was as successful with women as don giovanni luke discovered an adorable brunette tapping on his window unable to find the button to lower it he opened the door and the next moment was being licked all over by a large scruffy english setter im desperately sorry gasped the brunette ineffectually trying to tug the dog off its ok i like dogs particularly when they come on the end of such pretty ladies the brunette blushed im sorry to bother you but im daisy macleod i wanted to thank you for being so kind to perdita lukes jaw dropped from perditas chronically unflattering descriptions hed expected some bushyhaired middleaged weirdo with vinaigrette stains all over her caftan christ shes not much older than me he thought it was so wonderful of you to give her tero last christmas went on daisy shes so adorable she used to be petrified of me but she wintered in the field near our or rather rickys cottage i used to feed the ponies carrots and terod always lurk at the back never barging like the others then i discovered she adored toast and marmite and we used to have secret trysts behind hawthorn bushes so i could feed her when the others werent looking shes got such a sweet way of coming up and giving you a little nudge in the back she got so tame she came into the kitchen while we were having christmas dinner she adores spotty they lie down side by side perdita says ponies never normally do that in case their legs get entangled im sorry she flushed again i didnt mean to bore you bore me said luke im just blown away how young you are you havent got a portrait getting all wrinkled in the attic only ones painted by me giggled daisy i saw your drawings in rickys kitchen if i save up will you do fantasma when she comes over ill do her for nothing after all you did for perdita shed never have survived argentina without you goodness hes tall thought daisy as luke got out of the car and what a friendly charming and amiable face you felt you could tell him anything daisy shivered in the sharp east wind which whistled across the field shed been baking when shed left the shelter of snow cottage particularly as shed just blowdried her hair for drew not wanting to waste a chance to get brown she had unearthed an ancient blue sundress with lacing across the front which was now strained horizontally across her breasts duotanned legs on their fifth day were turning purple taking off his us open jacket luke put it round her shoulders youll need it coming from florida stammered daisy luke grinned im tough what a lovely man thought daisy will you come to dinner tonight she blurted out but before luke had time to answer perdita had thundered up on spotty what a cockup neither dancer nor mike has arrived the prince has got to be in london to unveil some plaque by seven and rickys having a blazing row with that prat harris who says weve got to forfeit if the match doesnt start on time your mothers just asked me to dinner said luke i dont know what rickys plans are why dont we eat out bloody stupid idea snapped perdita rickyll be in no mood to go anywhere if we have to play two against four and she stormed off luke grinned at daisy lets go find a seat on the way they passed ricky shouting in the pony lines kintas bandages were too tight spotty had the wrong martingale tero the wrong bit luke hoped ricky was just psyching himself up it was so nice to have someone to sit with thought daisy as they climbed to the top of the stands luke was greeted from all sides by players who knew him from palm beach trust you to pick up the best piece of crumpet in rutshire ive been trying to become mrs macleods toyboy for years yelled dommie patting the seats beside him and offering a bite of his mars bar to daisy go on you might burst even more out of that exciting dress welcome to rutshire he added extending a hand to luke nice dog said luke as decorum the bull terrier greeted his friend ethel so delightedly that his tail dislodged the tweed cap of brigadier hughie in front lovely agreed dommie apocalypse certainly needs you luke we lynched them two days ago rickys absolutely livid youre here worried youre going to queer his pitch or dommie giggled at his own joke pitch for his queer i see dancers given you a new merc whatd you have to do for that bend over thats not funny rumbled brigadier hughie disapprovingly should think not said dommie more likely bloody painful totally unfazed luke grinned broadly oh here come the prince and drew said daisy excitedly as rutminster hall rode on in their cherryred shirts and security men with expressionless faces and walkietalkies spread out round the field luke admired the upright figure of the prince of wales hes a good back he told daisy always takes his man out its incredibly difficult to get past him have you ever played against drew daisy couldnt resist asking luke nodded hes pretty good gets all his team working for him never has any passengers captain benedicts having an affair with someone said dommie unwrapping another mars bar we tried to tail him the other night but he really shifts that bmw im surprised sukey hasnt put a combination lock on his flies feeling her leap beside him as though the dentist had hit a nerve luke decided that daisy in addition to being terrified of perdita was also in love with the handsome captain who was now tapping the ball around the field with incredible assurance heres josé the mexican sharons latest and heres seb cried dommie gleefully green as the field people are going to tread him in at halftime forgot he was umpiring today when he got pissed last night ben napiers the other umpire he hates ricky so much hell give goal after open goal to rutminster hall aware that hed got the attention of the entire stand dommie opened a can of coke with a hiss and asked loudly what were all riveted to know is what will happen when your fiendish father meets ricky on the field this summer will we have the first polo murder sticks flying duel in the sun bart coming at ricky at mph and isnt chessie going to love it two knights jousting for her favours well luke shrugged and grinned back at him you expect me to answer all that ill give you time to think said dommie oh look here comes the puffatrain since she had acquired a title sharon had been slowly modelling herself on sukey today they were both wearing blue puffas blue guernseys striped shirts with turnedup collars navyblue skirts and stockings and gucci shoes good afternoon dominic said sharon graciously good afternoon luke when did you arrive not waiting for an answer she sat down and gathered up her binoculars now wheres the prince oh doesnt cerise suit his hayness hullo hullo your hayness the prince of wales turned nodding rather vaguely towards the stand weve met him several taimes sharon told luke and of course we ad cocktails with his mother when sir victor got his knaighthood drews known him for years said sukey slightly acidly look at the love bites on josés neck i thought youd gone vegetarian sharon chided dommie dont be cheeky dominic said sharon icily ponies neighing like mad were already arriving for the second match fatty harris on his third whisky was shouting in the warmup area the throwin will be in five minutes ricky or youll forfeit youve had half an hour to get ready you just delay and delay oh fuck off snarled ricky rutminster hall had dismounted to rest their horses except for david waterlane who rode over to the stands to cadge a cigarette seeing luke he yelled that black mare you sold me in palm beach why does she drop her head all the time i guess shes bashful she hasnt been paid for drawled luke the stand collapsed with laughter david waterlane rode off discomfited he owes ladbrokes half a million said dommie you may be rather low down the list ricky was in despair there was bloody luke alderton grinning up in the stands and he couldnt even get a polo side together as if in answer to his prayer dancers black helicopter soared over the trees and landed behind the clubhouse mercifully dancer was already changed racing towards the pitch telling the autograph hunters hed see them after the game and trailing security men he jumped on to the pony louisa was holding terribly sorry rick he said quailing at rickys stony face i overslept i was recording till four oclock this morning i hope youre going to get a chance to see england luke said sharon pressing her knees against his back ayd love to show you round i hope perditas going to take me said luke but thanks all the same dancers security guards are going to have a punchup with the princes in a minute said dommie happily oh thank goodness said daisy here comes mike waterlane driving his golf gti to a screeching halt at the side of the pitch a sweating mike leapt out and to the disapproval of miss lodsworth and her satellite trouts continued to bray into his portable telephone as he did a onehanded strip out of his pinstripe suit down to his dennis the menace boxer shorts if you can go to five million i think ive got just the job he went on as he wriggled into his breeches and his black apocalypse shirt but if you want much more land you might have to go higher as he zipped up his boots louisa fastened his knee pads and plonked his hat on his head ill get back to you later this afternoon he added hoarse with excitement and handing louisa the telephone in exchange for his stick and whip jumped on to his old pony dopey and thundered off on to the field what the fuck dyou think youre playing at howled ricky and david waterlane in unison mick jagger had a house under survey mumbled mike discovered its got dry rot wants us to find him another one mike waterlane is so thick announced dommie that he started cheering for reading university during the boat race last week luke laughed oh to be in england now that april was there luke wasnt laughing half an hour later apocalypse was a complete shambles ricky as usual was overextending himself and his horses doing everything including all the shouting never giving perdita or dancer a chance to score or mike whose head was full of dry rot a chance to defend ricky was a brilliant player but he couldnt take on rutminster hall all good players who knew what each other were doing singlehanded and whenever he wasnt blasting his own side he was shouting at the umpire ben napier who as dommie predicted gave penalties at every opportunity to rutminster hall while drew was taking one of these in the third chukka ricky whizzed off to change ponies only to find wayne had slipped his bridle and gone trotabout in the direction of the teatent get me a fucking horse he screamed to the edification of the entire crowd by the time another pony had been saddled rutminster hall had scored again bringing the score to the princes security men sneered discreetly at dancers minders drew by contrast was playing beautifully for daisy the supreme pleasure after sleeping with him was watching him on the field she longed to cheer her fingers itched to draw him on her score sheet but sukey was all too noisily just behind oh well done drew well played oh look were going through oh dear its gone over no it hasnt oh well stopped drew i must put my glass down to clap fatty harris whod slipped in a fourth whisky while waiting for the off was providing the official commentary the wince of prales takes the backhand oh well hit your majeshty at halftime profoundly depressed frozen without his jacket luke went out to stomp in the divots dogs whisking everywhere made him long for leroy daisy had drifted to the right and luke noticed that the first player back on a dapplegrey with black points was drew benedict luke watched him ride past her masking her for a second from the stands and sukey ill ring you this evening said drew softly and rode on perdita next back charged up to luke i havent had the fucking ball all afternoon im really pissed off take out the prince he was loose most of the first half then at least ricky can come through lukes advice worked with the prince pegged ricky took the game by the throat and in a flurry of breathtaking goals had pulled back the score to by the end of the fifth chukka the crowd forgot the icy wind ner ner nerner ner dancers minders taunted the princes bootfaced guards its the last chukka and ive done nothing thought perdita furiously spotty a fearful exhibitionist who only caught fire when applauded was also sulking then miraculously mike hit a lovely backhand in perditas direction there was no one between her and the goal posts leave it bellowed ricky ignoring him perdita put her reins in her stick hand and gave spotty a couple of whacks with her whip spotty bridled in outrage then shot forward perditas first forehand put the ball ten yards in front of goal man coming yelled ricky heedless perdita careered after it she was going to tie up the score on lukes first day almost nonchalantly oblivious of the shouting behind her she lifted her stick then howled with exasperation as she was hooked you fucking bastard she screeched then turning round she gave a gasp of horror gosh im terribly sorry sir off thundered ben napier dont be fucking stupid in a second perdita switched from abject contrition to outrage theres nuffink in the rule book abart swearin at royalty said dancer galloping up off insisted ben napier pointing towards the pony lines you asshole shouted perdita why dont you get out the fucking rule book and learn to read off said ben napier triumphantly abuse of umpire for chrissake help me perdita pleaded to seb the second umpire but seb terrified of opening his mouth in case he was sick merely shook his head in a blind fury perdita lifted her stick and hit the ball straight into the bonnet of a nearby bentley choking on his cucumber sandwich the owner leapt out waving his fist miss lodsworth turned puce and everyone else looked very excited as perdita galloped off straight to the tower of london said dommie luke gave a highly embarrassed daisy a reassuring smile three against four is no contest rutminster hall ran out the winners by luke found perdita sobbing into spottys shoulder we could have won we could have bloody won he took her in his arms its ok sweetheart over her shuddering shoulder he saw an utterly dejected dancer riding up you coming back to robinsgrove he asked i played like a pig wiv the trots fink ill go home said dancer you did pretty good except for being late said luke ill call you tomorrow back at robinsgrove having dropped perdita off at snow cottage luke put on two sweaters and went into the yard where all was activity louisa trundled by with a wheelbarrow loaded up with tack to be hung up kinta had a cut mouth which one of the younger grooms was rinsing out with salt and water another groom was sweeping up the yard and swearing at little chef as he chased the stable cat through a pile of straw and shavings while yet another was being greeted with a thunder of whickering and whinnying as she raced round lobbing wodges of hay into racks later most of the ponies would be turned out luke felt a wave of longing for fantasma is there an axe round here he asked louisa you going to chop off perditas head for treason louisa tried to make a joke but she was depressed about losing and having wolfed two kitkats to cheer herself up on the way home im going to light a fire said luke i dont want to die of pneumonia the logs were wet and took a long time to kindle like perdita thought luke wryly he noticed the yellowing cups and the gap still over the fireplace where the munnings had been he had just retrieved his dutyfree bourbon from the kitchen and was pouring himself three fingers when ricky stalked in glaring disapprovingly at the greenyblue flames and the acrid smoke that was drifting out into the room bit late for a fire he snapped daisys just rung says youre welcome to supper any time after eight you coming too asked luke christ no he was about to stalk out again when luke said we oughta talk we ricky raised his eyebrows theres nothing to talk about luke poured a second large bourbon and handed it to ricky i dont drink you better start said luke gently you gotta loosen up hearing the crackling from a painted stick little chef trotted in and seeing the fire stretched out blissfully sitting down luke took a slug of his whisky and a deep breath you shouldve walked it today with three fucking incompetents it was your fault said luke steadily entirely your fault youve totally demoralized perdita and dancer for a start perditas dying of hypothermia and loneliness out there waiting for a pass and when she gets one shes so uptight she goofs dancers the same hes worried the whole time not where to hit the ball but whether hes going to hit it at all and mike waterlanes out to lunch he was just cantering about not marking anyone then when ricky opened his mouth in outrage luke went on no i havent finished no one knows what theyre meant to be doing theres no game plan you just fluster them by shouting right and at the same time youre telegraphing every punch to the opposition youre always going to be the most marked man on the team if you give the others the ball they can take it away the logs suddenly deciding to be cooperative burst into flames flickering over rickys set frozen face they gave it a rare illusion of mobility luke got up and threw on another log forget the gold cup he said brutally if youre not careful youll lose every game this season have you flown three thousand mmmiles to give me this crap said ricky softly i was playing for england when you were still in high school im captain of apocalypse sure you are said luke and youve got unique charisma right thatll make guys go over the top into the face of hell for you and make horses run till they drop but youre abusing it youre too fucking arrogant i know youre sore dancer hired me without asking you i dont want to steal your thunder i wanna learn all i can from you and i wanna give something back potentially weve got a brilliant side and youre so goddam lucky youve got a patron whos a saint a patron saint he pays you a fucking fortune and all you do is give him earache little chef jumped on to rickys knee and started to growl at luke rickys face was grey his eyes black whirlpools of fury his long fingers curled round his glass for a second luke thought he was going to hurl it in his face my horses havent left he said slowly id rather get on the next plane home than spend summer watching you selfdestruct get out hissed ricky in the kitchen luke found that his legs were shaking violently outside the wind was systematically stripping the cherry trees and the montana out in the yard wayne confined to barracks with a puffy hock and suffering mild indigestion from wolfing too many cucumber sandwiches cream cakes and a clubhouse tablecloth hung out of his specially bolted door like a burglar about to crack a safe hed hoped the footstep would be rickys but luke would do unable to stop shaking luke clung on to the ugly yellow lopeared head ive blown it he groaned hed been so excited this time yesterday flying over the atlantic dreaming of perdita of the gold cup of shaking hands with the queen and going to stratford and tintern abbey hed have to pay back dancers fee and holding a sobbing perdita in his arms earlier had made him realize once again how hopelessly he was still in love with her he jumped as the stable cat weaved her way round his trembling legs picked up she purred against him for a second then jumping on to waynes withers settled down happily on his quarters christ thought luke in horror that poor guy killed his kid when he was looped and i force liquor on him look im sorry he said going back into the drawing room i came on too strong ricky looked up then suddenly smiled no you didnt everything you said was right i know it in my head but the moment i get on the field i tense up and ever since chessie buggered off and will died ive never trusted anyone least of all myself picking up his glass he examined it for a second then drained it lets get plastered reluctant to break the mood luke waited until an hour later when ricky went off to have a pee to call perdita he got an earful tell your mother im really sorry he said when he could get a word in but ricky and ive got a lot of things to work through ill take you both out tomorrow what makes you think id want to come snapped perdita even though she knew there was no hope with ricky she was furiously jealous of luke spending an evening alone with him ill take your mother then said luke hanging up after midnight when theyd moved four white and four black horses round the green baize board until they could see sixteen of them they tottered out to the stables the ponies surprised to be roused blinked sleepily teros feed was still in her manger and she shrank to the back of her box as they approached gets so uptight she wont eat for fortyeight hours after a game said ricky clumsily putting another rug on her and having great difficulty doing it up she will when we start winning said luke you wait till you see fantasma sweeps down the field like a yacht in full sail i had a horse called mattie once said ricky stumbling off towards the forage room best pair of legs i ever saw on a pony or a woman christ she was beautiful faster than kinta cannier than wayne turned quicker than spotty you always have one you love best dont you absolutely plastered he tripped over an upturned bucket and just managing to right himself sat down very suddenly on a bale of hay his black curls were ruffled his black eyes crossing you know chchchessie dont you sure said luke leaning against the door beautiful isnt she incredible she happy with your father luke shrugged i dont know i guess all marriages are africa they did an autopsy on one of shark nelligans ponies the other day the hide looked fine but inside where the spurs had gone in the scar tissue the tearing and the bruising were appalling thats marriage same way i gotta horse cut to pieces outside scars everywhere inside shes one of the best mares ever hard to generalize ricky felt poleaxed with misery even talking about chessie crucified him and with performances as lousy as todays how could he ever win the gold cup let alone get to ten or bring the westchester back to england i cant stand other people being happy he mumbled shamefacedly it makes me sssuch a shit dyou think ill ever get over her sure you will said luke thinking that he hadnt remotely got over perdita you need some fun stretching out a hand he found ricky had collapsed on his hay bale nudged asleep perhaps by the velvet muzzle of matties ghost little chef curled into the hollow of his back with a martyred sigh fetching a couple of rugs luke covered both of them god he was handsome even with that wicked scar running livid down the side of his face no wonder perdita loved him giving a wideawake wayne a handful of pony nuts luke wandered off to rickys library to find something to read tomorrow theyd get down to work a fortnight later luke went into rutminster with ricky to look for a new bit for kinta returning home he found his grooms and ponies had caught an earlier flight and were already installed racing round to the yard he called fantasmas name recognizing his voice she promptly tried to bash her way out of her box and finding that impossible stood back on her hocks and cleared the dark blue halfdoor clattering up to her master whickering in ecstasy nudging him all over searching his pockets for polo mints christ what a beautiful horse said ricky who wasnt given to superlatives i never expected her to be so big i cant believe shes grown so much said perdita in amazement nearly a hand said luke proudly and shes filled out everywhere went on perdita when you see the girth on her said luke his voice breaking slightly as he buried his face in fantasmas neck you realize why shes got so much heart its a real privilege to own a horse like this ouch he yelled as fantasma resentful of being abandoned for a fortnight took a sharp bite out of his arm then nudged him apologetically bitch said luke grinning and getting out a packet of polos thats because i didnt take her with me on concorde he also found it faintly embarrassing having insisted that all the apocalypse team get up early and work all their ponies every day that he waived the rules with fantasma instead he hacked her gently round the rutshire countryside she gets awful bored if i stick and ball her he told ricky apologetically and only just tolerates practice chukkas i guess she saves herself for the real thing if she takes out your bloody father ill forgive her said ricky grimly if rickys hatred for bart grew deep inside him like a beast then bart was equally obsessed with ricky the prospect of coming to england with enough ponies for a cavalry regiment and publicly showing the world who was the better man gave him an unbelievable sexual frisson he was therefore outraged by a piece in the april issue of polo magazine questioning the future invincibility of the flyers hitherto bart alderton has been shored up by the mighty ten goalers juan and miguel obrien and wildly underhandicapped ringers allied to the volatile and extremely vocal napier brothers and an unknown mexican this summer in england will bart be able to retain the flyers supremacy having fired off a solicitors letter to polo magazine bart went into an orgy of ponybuying nor could the pleadings of bibi that alderton airlines had recorded their first loss in twenty years that bluecollar and whitecollar workers had to be laid off and bart ought to be there to fire them personally that the vicepresidents of the various sections of the alderton empire were at each others throats stop him spending may june and july in england the layoffs and losses were just symptoms of a worldwide malaise bart told bibi airily business would pick up in the fall anyway he was always at the end of the telephone or a fax machine he couldnt understand either why bibi as his polo manager couldnt accompany him and chessie to england things wouldnt run nearly as smoothly without her but bibi insisted that one member of the alderton family must stay home to mind the shop nor was she prepared to leave angel who was still banned from playing in england loose on his own on the us circuit for two and a half months the punishing hours she worked for bart had already put a great strain on her marriage surely angel could spare you for the big matches marriages need ventilating grumbled bart totally forgetting that he wasnt prepared to leave chessie on her own for a second in england as it was he already had security guards following her twentyfour hours a day and had bugged the telephones and rooms both at the huge house he had just bought near cowdray and at the flat in knightsbridge chessie got her revenge by spending a fortune on clothes and enlisting the help of the guards even to choosing the colour and shape of her lingerie if the worlds press was clamouring to witness her first meeting with her exhusband in four and half years chessie reasoned she better look good to the presss disappointment this meeting didnt occur until the final of the queens cup apocalypse who under lukes crash course had finally got their act together stormed through their side of the draw taking huge delight in thrashing the kaputnik tigers consisting of victor the twins and the great american number three bobby ferraro in the semifinals before meeting bart the napiers and an unknown mexican in the final lukes greatest headache on the day was keeping apocalypse calm it was like ponying three wild mustangs along a freeway perdita suffering from appalling stage fright became more histrionic and picky than ever ricky whose stomach had been churning all summer at the prospect of bumping into chessie had been throwing up all night dancer the most frightened of the three hid it the best and consequently became the recipient of a lot of flak from perdita and ricky particularly during practice chukkas and while they were watching videos of earlier alderton flyer matches its only because you take criticism so well that we can tell you things luke kept comforting dancer most patrons worried more about the bank manager than playing badly dancer acutely aware he was the weak link in the team was terrified of letting apocalypse down he had to mark ben napier who was twice his size and four times his strength he hardly slept the night before and in his fitful dreams was ridden off by the whole world as none of the three could keep anything down there was no question of a team lunch to create solidarity before the match dancer because he liked to get up slowly cope with his nerves on his own and arrive as late as possible to avoid being mobbed flew to the guards club by helicopter the others went by car ricky drove with perdita in front because she felt sick and luke and little chef dancing across lukes knees to bark at every dog they passed in the back as he was the team mascot dancer had given him a collar of jet from which dangled a tiny ivory horse that dog is so spoilt grumbled perdita he even gets the gardeners to bury his bones for him luke had done his homework on the alderton flyers he had watched every match they played in england and by judicious chatting up of grooms and other players had familiarized himself with every pony theyd be riding and had briefed apocalypse accordingly teams topheavy with my father and the napiers yelling their heads off and all wanting their own way the only person theyve got to boss around is this mexican guy called josé who cant understand a word of english which may enhance his peace of mind but doesnt make for cohesion well flatten them on paper the flyers were much stronger the game plan was to harass the hell out of them until they fouled out of exasperation then against long accurate penalties from luke there would be no defence if the match went apocalypses way the others would leave luke as a rocksolid wall of defence and concentrate on attack luke wished he felt more cheerful as ricky overtook everyone on the m the damp patches under his arms joined across his back until his whole shirt was soaked in sweat and luke could see his shoulder muscles as rigid as petrified snakes it was a close punishingly hot day thunder grumbled on the horizon the heatwave was in its third week wild roses and the creamy discs of elderflowers draped over the hedgerows shrivelled in a day a heat haze undulated on the tarmac ahead it was a relief to come off the motorway into the dark green oak and chestnut tunnels on the road to windsor behind fernfilled verges and ramparts of purple rhododendrons luke caught glimpses of large pinkandwhite houses which reminded him of palm beach lawns yellow from the hosepipe ban and paddocks full of jumps and ponies whisking unpulled tails across glossy rumps men in shirtsleeves and girls in sundresses were drinking outside pubs christ id like to spend the afternoon knocking back pimms and watching someone else make a fool of themselves said perdita in a hollow voice luke felt as if an icecube had been slipped into his hand glancing down he saw it was perditas hand reaching back to him although the nails were bitten and dirty and the palm calloused he had to resist lifting it to his lips instead he squeezed it gently give us a poem luke she asked once more unto the breach dear friends once more began luke his deep voice slightly croaky from dust they were passing windsor castle now and luke thought ruefully of the sightseeing he had hoped to do he hadnt been to london yet let alone stratford or close the wall up with our english dead he went on in peace theres nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility but when the blast of war blows in our ears then imitate the action of the tiger not the kaputnik tigers i hope said perdita im so scared ill probably play like victor christ look at those crowds and those tents from the carpark came a humming like a vast swarm of bees as chauffeurs not wanting to melt away kept on the airconditioning of their limos no wind displaced the wilting flags along the pitch but inside the hospitality tents electric fans could be seen ruffling vast clumps of pink peonies and pale blue delphiniums as men wishing theyd worn striped shirts which didnt show the sweat and beautiful women refusing red wine because it would make their faces even pinker toyed with lobster cold beef and strawberries and cream ricky aware that the alderton flyers and their wives were lunching in the tent of alfred dunhill the sponsors suddenly thought he saw chessie and nearly ran over a programme seller oh look said a fat waitress chucking leftovers into a grey plastic dustbin theres that perdita the one that said eff off to prince charles ow yes said her friend excitedly hello perdy can we have your autograph thought you was in the tower stuck up little madam she added as perdita gazed stonily ahead down by the pony lines crowds surged forward to admire apocalypses equine stars wayne appeared to be sleeping peacefully but was actually wondering how to bite his way through his new reinforced lead rope they did awfully good teas at the guards club spotty the showoff was thrilled to see so many people fantasma as usual was standing on her front legs lashing out simultaneously with both back barrels thank god youve arrived said lukes groom lizzie despairingly ive got one more stud to screw into her hoof and i cant get near her in this mood next door to fantasma perdita was trying to calm down a frantically trembling sweating tero god the flyers horses look well she said gloomily theres glitz and that chestnut andromedas even faster than fantasma thats because the napiers cut their horses up before a match said luke taking the spanner from lizzie and picking up a now comparatively docile fantasmas nearside hoof one touch of their spurs and they fly bastards i hate them stormed perdita thats the right attitude said luke napiers keep their horses in all the time theyre not so relaxed as ours could have fooled me said lizzie rubbing a large purpling bruise on her arm im sorry honey luke patted her cheek as he handed her back the spanner thirty minutes to the parade wed better get changed he added propelling ricky who despite the heat was shivering even worse than tero towards the players changing room and where am i supposed to change demanded perdita in the ladies said ricky curtly and get gawped at id rather use the lorry but you can all flaming well stand guard or guards while i have a shower later ricky sat in a dark corner of the changing room taking ages to zip up his boots buckle his knee pads and his lucky belt and button up his lucky gloves which had almost fallen to pieces he must get a grip on himself hed only get chessie back by hammering bart at the moment he wouldnt know where to stand to hit a sixtyyard penalty suddenly he froze as bart came in and dived for the nearest loo prolonged peeing followed by a volley of farts and a vile smell told him bart was as nervous as he was ricky felt slightly better and better still when bart came out and spent several minutes combing his wolfs pelt forward to cover a receding hairline and resmoothing his shirt into his belt and his breeches into his knee pads and boots he then dived into his locker and produced some bronzing gel called indela newly launched by victors pharmaceutical empire which didnt run when you sweated outside a band redder than their tunics were playing the british grenadiers as clouds blacker than their bearskins marshalled on the horizon a curious light had turned the field viridian as military men with lean figures strode around barking instructions into walkietalkies ricky who was madly superstitious was slightly cheered as the band bored with military marches launched to the ecstasy of the crowd into four horsemen four horses white horse black horse red horse pale horse plague famine justice death riding riding riding roared the crowd stamping their feet in time on the wooden boards as the menacing music swept through the ground isnt that marvellous cried perdita unfair bloody advantage hyping up apocalypse snarled bart to the napiers and the uncomprehending mexican lets object said ben napier two spots of colour staining his cadaverous cheeks as exactly on cue a vast black helicopter cast its shadow over the pitch with great difficulty and the help of a dozen security guards dancer fought his way through to the pony lines fuckin ell dont it sound grite he grinned at his teammates i might go out and give them an encore i love the guards club he went on lowering his voice they cant believe anyfink as cockney as me can play polo colonels keep comin up and saying ullo dancer you over from new zealand again perdita giggled even ricky smiled slightly but he was watching bart whod cut all the apocalypse team even luke stone dead and was now shouting at the napiers and into a telephone at the same time how could chessie be married to that he thought with a shudder luke edged closer to his father i dont give a shit if it has crashed bart was saying i cant bring them back to life put winston chalmers on to it at once ill call you later whats happened luke asked one of barts grooms whom he knew from palm beach the groom pulled a long face alderton pegasus totalled in the desert with no survivors shit said luke dad should fly home and miss a final pigs would fly said the groom the queen had arrived state trumpeters and drum horses from the household cavalry in their gold uniforms followed by the band were lining up between the goal posts to lead the two teams with the two umpires as a bolster between them ten abreast on to the field players tend to ride their oldest quietest horses in the parade in case the bands and the crowd overexcite them apocalypse however stuck to their theme ricky rode the pale yellow wayne perdita was on hermia her redchestnut friend from pony club days who leapt all over the place snatching excitedly at her bit dancer had a safer passage on black geoffrey the hangover horse luke had reluctantly agreed to ride fantasma the only white horse in the yard and had great difficulty controlling her a natural loner she longed to be out in front leading the parade when she wasnt humping her back in temper she was taking bites out of poor kind geoffrey on her right and less advisedly out of umpire shark nelligans horse on her left despite this apocalypse in their black shirts with their black hats over their noses looked both sinister and threatening ricky had just galloped wayne back after the parade and was mounting a hopelessly overexcited sinatra when he heard a frantic clicking of cameras as journalists and photographers broke through the ropes then he heard a soft voice saying hello luke darling catching a great waft of diorissimo ricky swung round as though a rattlesnake had bitten him colour draining from his face the heat had made everyone appear as though theyd been boiled alive chessie by comparison looked like a lily of the valley just picked from some cool shady dell she wore a pale green linen suit exquisitely cut to show off the fragility of her body and flat green pumps on her feet her face faintly flushed from champagne in the dunhill tent was tanned to a smooth café au lait the eyes were turned to aquamarine by the green suit and her full pouting lips were as palely pink as the wild roses dying in the hedgerows hugging luke but gazing over his shoulder at ricky she murmured how exciting youre in the final and how ironic youre playing against your father what embarras de aldertons the commentators going to get so muddled then wriggling out of lukes grasp like a sleepwalker she moved over to ricky gazing up she took in the hollowed cheeks with their suspicion of black stubble and the grim intransigent mouth which was belied by the fierce yet desperately wounded dark eyes beneath the black polo hat hello ricky she said mockingly hows our bet going still a long way to go no gold cup yet no ten goal no westchester youll have to do better than that oblivious of the photographers going crazy all round them ricky stared down at her he simply couldnt get a word out as she gently caressed sinatras silky shoulder sinatra had been known to take peoples hands off but now relaxed almost ecstatically under chessies touch four and a half years is a long time she whispered havent you missed me seeing her wanton taunting little face flawless except for the velvet smudges under the eyes and her caressing suntanned hand inching towards his thigh ricky wanted to gather her up on sinatra gallop all the way back to robinsgrove ram every bolt and never let her go again they were interrupted by luke now mounted on ophelia and looking more thunderous than the cloud now hanging above the pitch back off chessie he said roughly i dont know if dad put you up to this but it is definitely out of order perdita was less reticent fuck off you bitch she screamed what a bloody awful time to stage a comeback the reporters scribbled avidly any chance of a reconciliation mrs alderton asked the scorpion wrestling with one of dancers security men chessie gave a sob youll have to ask my exhusband she said for gods sake get on ricky snapped major ferguson who masterminded every move at the guards club the flyers were already on the field here come the undertakers sneered charles napier deliberately barging his big brown mare into spotty whom perdita had just changed on to blacks the right colour for you lot youll certainly be flying that fag he nodded at dancer at halfmast by the end of this match ricky had gone to pieces white sweating shaking violently he hardly seemed to know where he was take it easy said luke putting an arm round his shoulders thought dancer was the fag taunted ben napier didnt know you and ricky were having it off i hear you had to buy the rutshire dancer to get your handicap up to one knock it off ordered shark nelligan who was umpiring and wanted to throwin that was definitely below the belt dad said luke as he lined up beside bart if you want chessie to be a widow before the end of the match youre going about it in the right way whaddya talking about bart spat out his gum sending her out to the pony lines to screw up ricky for a second bart was roused out of his obsessive prethrowin catatonia nothing to do with me he said in outrage she must have got looped at lunchtime as the ball thumped into the forest of legs and sticks the first three pairs missed it luke and bart clashed mallets for a couple of seconds then luke got the ball out immediately whacking it up towards the enemy goal posts then following his right of way hit it again but he wasnt on his fastest pony at the touch of spurs on her desperately cutup flesh charles napiers big brown mare bounded forward like a cheetah luke could hear the thunder of her hooves on the dry ground behind him then suddenly to his left spotty electrified by a large cheering crowd was streaking down the field with perditas arms legs and whip going like a jockeys aware that charles was about to hook him luke swung ophelia to the right and cut the ball to perdita on the nearside fleetingly he felt charless knee under his but managed to stay put take your time he yelled to perdita conscious of the cheers of the crowd perdita stroked the ball upfield then out of nowhere ben napier was hurtling towards her at ninety degrees like a boulder in an avalanche oh my god thought perdita oh my god thought spotty who didnt like the look of ben napiers big bay gelding any better rolling his white eye he put on another amazing burst of acceleration whisking his brownandwhite rump forward so ben napier bumped the burning air instead then bearing perdita on as proudly as a gun dog with his masters newspaper spotty positioned her to meet the ball exactly right and flick it between the posts grinning from ear to ear and unashamedly raising her stick to the cheers of the crowd she cantered back to the halfway line patting spotty over and over again apocalypse who had received two goals on handicap were now up you doll breathed luke hugging her ricky said nothing he was plainly still suffering from shock bart just scowled arent you sorry you gave me spotty for christmas perdita taunted him euphoria however was shortlived ricky simply wasnt connecting with the ball it was as if he was wearing a pair of reading glasses to run down a steep flight of steps and such eventually was his frustration and rage and the ferocity of his rideoffs that he finally sent bart and black glitz flying five feet through the air so that even the queen in the royal box could hear the bump next moment the napiers were twirling their sticks in the air and shark nelligan had blown a foul on ricky contemptuously charles napier converted soon it became plain to everyone that ricky was out to bury bart by halftime he had given away three penalties and ben napier whom ricky was supposed to be marking had scored three goals as the crowd surged on to the field to tread in luke rode fantasma back to the pony lines in a towering rage the mare was panting desperately her bottom lip flapping her nostrils dark red her tail thrashing at her sweating dock the blood pumping visibly through her enlarged veins like some biology experiment luke had never known her so exhausted handing her to lizzie to cool down he dragged ricky aside what the fuck are you playing at he hissed ive just ridden the duck soup out of fantasma covering up for you this final is between apocalypse and the flyers not you and my father its goddam selfish to take your personal vendetta on to the field luke had sweat in his eyes dust in his throat his ribs ached from a foul hook noone had seen hed had to change ponies twice in the first two chukkas because two had gone lame and he could see his dreams going up in smoke nor could he bear to see dancer and perditas dejected faces they deserved better this match is dirtier than a coal hole said seb carlisle as he bought chessie a pimms up in the stands during the second half and you ought to be wearing a duckeggblue shirt with five stamped on the back youve contributed so much to rickys disintegration and apocalypses certain defeat oh shut up said chessie i had to talk to him with two bloody bodyguards tailing me all the time i may not get another chance this season why dont you lure them both into your bedroom suggested seb then rush out and lock the door on them oh lovely pass perdita luke alderton has certainly worked miracles with her and dancer theyre hassling the shit out of your husband and ben napier and christ look at that he waved his programme disapprovingly at charles napiers pony who was bleeding both from her mouth and her lacerated sides i have nightmares that im going to come back in another life as one of charless horses charles napier was also famous for using his elbows during rideoffs and at the throwin and he was using them with increasing ferocity in the fifth chukka when he was riding the lightning andromeda and the flyers had failed to increase their lead fed up with perdita giving him the slip as they were fighting for the ball on the boards he deliberately rammed an elbow so hard into her left breast that she gave a shriek why dont you go back to the kitchen where you belong he hissed why dont you go back to the gorilla house screamed perdita so doubled up with pain she could hardly lift her stick next minute luke had thundered up you ok baby perdita bit her lip and nodded well belt up and leave this to me at the beginning of the last chukka charles galloped towards goal as luke back on fantasma again rode him off out came charless elbows get out of my way you goddam prick bellowed charles takes a prick to know a prick said luke putting his arm through charless and such was his massive strength that he lifted him off his horse as easily as if he was pulling the plug out of the bath charles crashed to the ground man down said luke grinning foul yelled charles furiously no foul said shark and dommie carlisle the other umpire in unison both had been the recipients of charles napiers elbows far too often the sun behind the stands lit up the thundery indigo clouds the acidyellow fir trees the jadegreen statue of prince albert on his horse the yellowandwhite goal posts and the tiring ponies it was stiflingly hot and stuffy luke must be very much in love with perdita to risk a foul like that said seb to chessie no one quite knew how it happened but in the following frantic mêlée in front of the apocalypse goal charles napier took a mighty swipe at the ball and instead hit luke on the head with his stick as luke slumped in his saddle fantasma pulled up with a jerk and the pitted field came up to meet him perdita was off tero in a trice begging luke frantically to be all right beside her fantasma gazed down at her master with huge dark worried eyes nudging him impatiently in the ribs to get up then raking his shoulder gently with her hoof out cold said the doctor whod arrived with the ambulance bending over luke ouch he howled a second later as fantasma bit him jealously on the bottom bart and the napiers belted off to change ponies ill get another player said ricky at long last coming out of his coma but as he galloped towards the stands the heavens opened lightning ripped the inky clouds apart and rain coming down in torrents bounced eighteen inches off the dry ground in the stands spectators huddled under coloured umbrellas others fled for the hospitality tents or their cars the deluge almost halted the windscreen wipers of the ambulance as it ploughed off to hospital as the substitute calmly changed into a spare black shirt and borrowed lukes helmet which was too big and fell over his handsome nose a demented perdita kept demanding if luke would be ok i ope so said dancer who was looking very shaken himself without luke he felt as though his rudder had been taken away you dont look very happy dancer sneered bart im not very appy bart replied dancer weve just lost our best player were down wiv five minutes to go and its pouring with fucking rain no im not very appy bart after ten drenching minutes the rain let up and play started again it had always been arguable that fantasma was wasted on a number four player who is mostly occupied with defence with her handiness and dazzling turn of speed she was more suited to a number three the substitute was a brilliant rider everyone noticed how wonderfully fantasma went with him luke had been so busy covering up for ricky earlier the mare had had no chance to show off her paces although she now swished her tail furiously and rolled her eyes when the substitute gave her half a dozen whacks she set off towards goal like a derby winner what a horse thought the substitute as ghostly white fantasma streaked through the gloom and what smooth action he could have carried a glass of champagne without spilling it then as bart raced to cut off the ball and back it up the field fantasma swung round like a weathercock when the wind changes i want this horse decided the substitute as the gallant mare reached the ball waited while he backed it once more towards the flyers goal then instantly turned this time he scored and a minute later he had scored again then the flyers poor mexican ringer crossed dancer out of nerves his face expressionless all the joy and power in his stick ricky drove home a miraculous sixtyyard penalty making it six all as the bell went emerging from under their coloured umbrellas into the diminishing drizzle the crowd went berserk overjoyed that such a thrilling match would go to an extra chukka through dense fog luke heard voices shouts of laughter and some singing and slowly opened his eyes the room seemed to blaze with gleaming cups then he heard perditas shrill voice luke darling please come round he could feel her hand and laboriously he tried to focus finally identifying perdita and dancer drunk as skunks and brandishing a huge gilt cup we won cried perdita overjoyed what happened asked luke we went into extra time dancer took lukes other hand i tell you i was shaking like a leaf wiv you gone i had to play back and ricky and perdita and the sub was up the other end going towards goal and next moment charles napiers thundering towards me yelling leave it leave it and bart yells im not going to fuckin leave it and hits the ball straight at me thank christ it hits my pony who gives a fuckin groan and somehow i hits it back past charles and next moment the boys waving the flag up the other end fuckin ell i yelled weve won and spotty kicked the ball in crowed perdita riding back past your dad went on dancer i said you dont look very appy bart and he was so angry he bundled his wife into is helicopter and flew straight back to is new ouse at cowdray thats terrific said luke wondering why they were now disappearing in a whirling snowstorm and fantasma won best playing pony yet again said perdita laying a royalblue blanket edged with scarlet over the bed theres the most terrific party going on at the star of india in windsor the twins started a food fight and hit mrs hughie on the nose with an onion bargie victors so pissed dommies sold another of his horses back to him and sharon is comforting the mexican josé who speaks no english sitting down on fantasmas prizewinning blanket they started going through every play what did the queen say to you dancer luke asked wistfully that she was very pleased shes met me before at the royal variety performance but she was less shy this time perdita giggled she said she was sorry you were out cold and hoped youd be better soon luke had never known her so happy who was the guy who stood in for me he asked pretty good scoring two goals right away oh didnt we tell you said dancer in surprise it was your bruvver red whats he doing over here victors so furious at being beaten by your father that hes dropped poor bobby ferraro for the rest of the season and flown red over at vast expense to play for him instead next day reds name dominated the headlines auriels toyboy turns game around screamed the sun bart sees red said the scorpion with a splendid picture of bart having a shouting match with red and major ferguson the telegraph warmly praised reds polo skills he could hit a ball through the eye of a needle the times concentrated on his horsemanship and how the great grey mare fantasma rose like pegasus to the challenge not content with bringing a sparkle to perditas eyes red had seduced his beloved fantasma as well luke was ashamed how jealous he felt he loved his brother but red always spelt trouble and at the moment luke felt incapable of getting him out of any more scrapes yesterdays feeling of floating detachment had given way to sickness and a blinding headache he felt dizzy if he sat up if he lay down his bed pitched like a raft in a forceten gale any sudden movement of the head made him leap with pain the xray showed no fractures but nurses were taking his pulse and blood pressure on the hour he definitely wouldnt be fit for the royal windsor in which he was playing with kevin coley next week despite heavy sedation luke was desperately worried injury was the professionals worst nightmare just when apocalypse was coming good he had to desert them ricky looking very pale had dropped in first thing in the morning he obviously hadnt slept and stammering badly apologized for playing so hopelessly yesterday he never dreamed hed be so poleaxed by seeing chessie but that was no excuse knowing how much it must have cost the great el orgulloso to admit such a thing luke was touched no sweat he said we won anyway hows fantasma got a bang on the nearside cannon bone then seeing lukes face no shes ok we poulticed her and she was almost sound when we walked her out this morning after ricky had gone luke fretted tempted to discharge himself to check that fantasma was all right he was slightly cheered around lunchtime when an irish nurse with eyes greener than a granny smith and a white cap riding on her lustrous piledup black hair like a paper boat on stormy rapids came in to check his blood pressure why are you doing that a sudden drop might indicate bleeding in the skull her voice was like a furry bell noones blood pressure could drop with you around said luke as she checked his pulse looking at the badge on her starched apron he saw her name was rosie ogrady and couldnt remotely imagine her being a sister under the skin to mrs hughie whos perdita she asked slyly your wife a girlfriend just a friend said luke carefully why dyou ask i was on when you came in yesterday you never stopped babbling about her shes a lucky girl she added softly i had to undress you i never knew polo players were she smiled sleepily so er wellhung luke blushed beneath his redgold stubble and i was out cold jesus what a waste therell be other opportunities were not letting you out yet she handed him some blue pills and a glass of water which he had difficulty in keeping down what are they analgesic and sedatives i dont want to feel sedated said luke taking her hand perhaps he was still concussed please stay with me they both jumped as the door flew open and perdita stormed in she was wearing dark glasses which emphasized her long nose jeans and a torn grey tshirt of daisys her hair was scraped back with a mauve plastic clip she didnt look her best whats she doing she snapped as nurse ogrady melted away giving you intensive care thought shed have better things to do how are you feeling pretty good lied luke thats more than i am ive got such a bloody awful hangover and there was a fourmile tailback on the motorway with the sun pounding down on the roof of the car christ look at all your flowers ive brought you grapes and some lucozade lukeozade its a joke very funny thanks a lot said luke whod heard it often before this is a jolly nice room perdita switched on the racing on television the horses hooves seemed to be pounding through lukes skull rickys thinking of buying that grey it came fourth perdita switched it off i see you got the papers your bloody brother stole all our thunder noone even mentioned dancer or me or ricky and chessie the press were clinging to red like burrs all last night he got plastered and seb and dommie had a fight in the taj mahal because seb was winding dommie up saying decorum loved him more than dommie i had a good morning though she started eating the grapes shed brought horse and hound want to put me on the cover the daily mail want me to do a fashion feature best of all rupert campbellblack rang venturer are keen on making a documentary or it might be a series of six halfhour programmes taking me through the gold cup deauville possibly argentina and then palm beach next spring im lunching with him and bas later this week thats terrific said luke wishing he felt more enthusiastic she seemed to be slipping away from him christ he mustnt be possessive he took her hand its really great there was a hammering on the door and the twins and red burst in all wearing dark glasses hi baby boy said seb we are so ill announced red putting a hand on lukes shoulder but even reds hangover and no sleep couldnt dim his beauty luke noticed how perdita had whipped away her hand when he came in now she was surreptitiously removing the mauve plastic clip from her hair and raking it out with her fingers we brought you some booze said seb plonking three bottles of moët and one of lucozade down on lukes bedside table we didnt think youd have time to get any in howre you feeling asked dommie it was your fault you know you mustnt go round pulling charles napier off his horses if i hadnt loathed him so much id have blown a foul on you hes a bastard have you seen my bruises perdita lifted her tshirt to show ribs dappled black and blue higher clamoured dommie but weve brought you some porn mags to cheer you up luke thanks and congratulations luke turned to red who was opening a bottle i hear you played great red laughed i intend to make headlines with my mallet rather than my cock from now on as usual he was miraculously dressed in offwhite trousers a cream shirt and a yellow blazer braided with pale grey silk to outfox the young bloods in palm beach who were all now wearing pale blue blazers with green silk braiding luke winced as the champagne cork flew out blimey said dommie who was deep in a porn mag its wicked the things that girls doing to that horse horse seems to be rather enjoying it drawled red peering over dommies shoulder and handing him a glass better than being ridden by charles napier said sebbie holding out toothmugs for himself and perdita all his ponies will be queueing up for auditions when are they letting you out of here asked red sitting down on lukes bed i wont make the royal windsor on thursday said luke taking a sip of champagne and nearly throwing up dont give it a thought said red kevin already knows he left a message on my machine asking me to stand in for you until youre ok im not ok said dommie fretfully putting down the porn mag and pressing the bell beside lukes head i feel awful hows auriel asked luke the cigarette smoke clouding the room was making him feel even sicker making a movie near deauville said red she gave me a lift over here how about that stupid bitch chessie marching up to ricky just before the game didnt help said luke i wish shed stop spending dads money and i wish hed go back to work they had to close another plant last week and hes going to get a lot of flak over the pegasus thats the third crash in three months hows bibi asked luke who was watching perdita watching red frightened yet excited by him like a mare with a stallion red shrugged spending too much time covering up for dad which pisses angel off like all argies he expects her to wait on him hand and clay foot you wanted something mr alderton it was nurse ogrady answering the bell id like some fernetbrancat said dommie then taking in her charms and a large secluded pay bed for two if youve got a teabreak coming up ill get you some alkaseltzer but you ought to put those cigarettes out said nurse ogrady and turning to luke with gentle reproof and you oughtnt to be drinking hes not said red draining lukes glass christ youre goodlooking come and take my pulse grinning he seb and dommie all held out their hands like dogs paws ill go and get you some alkaseltzer said nurse ogrady backing hastily out of the room ill help you carry it said dommie belting after her talk about florence nightinthesack said seb having eaten all the grapes perdita had brought he started on his own red was opening the second bottle of moët when the door opened and daisy walked in she was looking incredibly pretty thought luke with her dark hair shiny and loose her rosy cheeks just beginning to break through the layers of cliniques basic beige and her mascara smudged under her eyes she was wearing jeans and a mans blue and white striped shirt and reeked of je reviens thats all i bloody need snarled perdita daisy blushed im sorry to barge in she faltered i just came to see how luke was how are you she handed him a bunch of roses as pink as her face they dont smell much im afraid violets doing her a levels but shes sent you a card and some poems by kingsley amis and some lucozade as a joke she plonked them down on the bed wow thats kind said luke taking her hand and kissing her cheek you are an incredibly nice lady my mother thought perdita furiously has a thumping great crush on luke what the fuck are you doing here anyway she asked daisy i went to london to see the annual exhibition of the royal society of portrait painters marvellous stuff mumbled daisy then changing the subject she turned to luke we were all so worried about you have you got a ghastly headache not nearly as bad as ours said seb putting down the porn mag and pouring daisy a glass of champagne you look stunning today mrs macleod this is my brother red said luke oh what a beauty thought daisy in wonder that staggering perfection of feature allied to that rainsoaked red setter colouring this is perditas mother added luke jesus red was shaken out of his habitual cool you kidding she must be perditas daughter strolling over to daisy he idly zipped up her jeans and removed a buttercup petal from her hair then grinning down at her he murmured i always figure the best way to see paintings is lying down as he poured her a toothmug of champagne i shouldnt said daisy whod gone absolutely scarlet im driving why dont you come to paris with us said red realizing in a trice that perdita was wildly jealous of her mother and such an invitation would irritate the hell out of her if we leave in twenty minutes we can have an hour at the louvre before it closes my fathers lent a painting to the renoir exhibition we can book in to the ritz dine at maxims and ill take you to montmartre tomorrow come on mrs macleod urged seb if we cant show you a good time noone can were coming back tomorrow lunchtime weve got a fourthirty match at cowdray seeing the two of them so brown carefree and handsome daisy suddenly thought how heavenly it would be to take off i cant leave ethel and gainsborough she stammered course you can said seb perditall look after them havent i been trying to seduce your mother for ages he added over his shoulder to an absolutely spitting perdita dommies been a long time with that nurse this must be him but instead drew walked in taking in the number of bottles and people he went straight up to lukes bed you poor sod how you feeling besieged i should think you dont want this mob here do you theyre ok luke grinned weakly ill get rid of them in a minute ive just spoken to ricky hes had another look at fantasma shell be fine if its any comfort we had five ponies lame after the second match were all going to be out of horses by the gold cup putting more grapes and a new book on polo pony management down on the bed he nodded to the others daisy whod gone as red as a peony again pretended to gaze out of the window shed popped in on luke to establish an alibi and her blood froze at the thought that perdita might have decided to go for a walk in windsor park and disturbed drew and her in the bracken drew following her removed more buttercup petals from her hair that was heavenly said daisy faintly it always is with you my love whispered drew then more loudly dyou need a lift back to rutshire no ive got the car said daisy which drew already knew oh my god howled red as chessie swanned in carrying two bottles of dom perignon a vast box of chocolates and a new translation of dantes inferno how youve got the gall to barge in here having nearly screwed lukes match yesterday good girl said seb relieving her of the bottles weve just run out of drink having nodded fairly coolly to everyone else chessie kissed luke so sorry you had a shunt angel bloody bad luck then lowering her voice has ricky been in first thing this morning said luke hell i missed him said chessie furiously how was he tired said luke lying back on his pillows the snowstorm was whirling in front of his eyes again he couldnt handle all the crosscurrents chessie departed almost immediately but noone else showed any signs of shifting your taxis arrived red announced seb whod started on lukes chocolates as auriels pink helicopter landed on the lawn outside sending patients on crutches and in wheelchairs leaping for safety as everyone crossed the room to have a look daisy noticed how green luke had gone getting an envelope out of a carrier bag she timidly handed it to him i thought you might like this opening it luke had great difficulty in not breaking down wow its terrific beautiful he said finally in a choked voice thanks a million it was a miniature of fantasma standing fetlock deep in rickys watermeadows faintly rosepink in the rising sun ears pricked lovely eyes slightly suspicious and with ash woods soaring up like organ pipes behind her it is good isnt it said drew whod already seen it in several stages trying to subdue the pride in his voice as he ran a hand up the back of daisys jeaned thigh its very good said red topping up daisys glass how much dyou want for that pony shes not for sale luke was still gazing in wonder at the painting she will be said red arrogantly everyonell be after her after yesterday they already are snapped drew who didnt like red and we ought to leave luke alone then as a couple of nurses staggered in buckling under more bunches of flowers christ youre popular just for a second reds face tightened then he turned to daisy did you say youd just been to an exhibition of the royal society of portrait painters he asked softly what did you think of auriels portrait im afraid there was so much to look at i didnt get round to it said daisy going crimson again mercifully perdita was nose to nose with seb on the other side of the room hardly surprising drawled red just above a whisper the exhibition closed yesterday nice one mrs macleod then laughing at her discomfort added whats it worth not to tell your cantankerous daughter oh please dont begged daisy she was saved by the arrival of josé the mexican brandishing a huge bunch of clashing mauve and salmonpink gladioli and by the return of dommie and nurse ogrady with more flowers and her white cap on back to front rosies coming to paris with us said dommie joyfully shes off duty in ten minutes thats great said seb you can tell us apart rosie because ive got a scar on the inside of my right knee and im the one decorum loves best he bloody doesnt howled dommie brandishing an empty bottle i very sorry josé the mexican handed luke the gladioli and accepted some champagne in a teacup i hop you very better now thanks a lot said luke trying to sound really grateful the snowstorm had become a blizzard for a second he closed his eyes hello luke ayve brought you some lucozade and some penhaligons bluebell to remaind you of rutshire it was sharon kaputnik wafting graciousness and jolie madame hello boys hello red victors absolutely delaighted youre goin to be on our team hes convinced hes got a winning formula at last not if hes part of it murmured red but sharon had turned to the mexican feigning amazement well hello hosé fancy seein you here dommie giggled weve got a hosépipe ban in rutshire you better keep your willy under wraps when you play down there josé have a look at tatler said seb handing sharon a porn mag im sure youll find yourself in it but sharon was gazing deep into josés black eyes drew was talking in an undertone to daisy seb and dommie were making plans with nurse ogrady well buy you something to wear dommie was saying i want to go to paris thought perdita furiously i want to go to maxims and the ritz and the faubourg st germain i want to deplete some mans chequebook red was getting restless we oughta go are you coming with us daisy dont be fatuous said drew sharply daisys got a family to look after and all her painting commitments let daisy answer for herself said seb dabbing penhaligons bluebell behind his ears i really cant giggled daisy she was saved this time by the arrival of matron six foot high and breathing fire a pink helicopter has just landed on the lawn seriously jeopardizing the lives of the patients she thundered i assume it belongs to one of you you suspected right lofty said red gathering up daisys roses these are nice theyll do for auriel theyre lukes protested daisy any more flowers and hell get hayfever come on you guys matron whod been mouthing ineffectually found her voice where are you taking that nurse she demanded to paris dommie handed matron two empties as he sauntered out shes off duty said seb handing her two more see you they chorused to luke where are you living he called after red with seb and dommie ill call you and ill certainly call you blowing a kiss at daisy red vanished grinning like the cheshire cat daisy was not sure who was angrier perdita matron or drew perdita disapproved of everything about red he shouldnt have stolen the job of his friend and fellow american bobby ferraro he shouldnt keep trying out horses laming them playing the hell out of them in a couple of chukkas then handing them back saying they were no good his grooms worked for him for next to nothing because he was so handsome and even worse on the field he was the soul of dishonesty endlessly manufacturing fouls and avoiding a sixty if a ball crossed the line by tapping it back and claiming it hadnt gone over the twins were wild enough but in the company of red they became impossible whooping it up all night with groupies coming out of their ears in the weeks running up to the gold cup one prank followed another the twins for example pinched victors helicopter just as he was about to fly to frankfurt for a board meeting in order to scour the countryside for a missing decorum whom they were convinced had been stolen for pitbull fighting then there was the saturday afternoon they all got drunk round the pool and set off in victors open bentley with red lolling naked between the twins and using a road map as a figleaf stopping an old lady by a tjunction they asked her to show them the way to rutminster on the map which she did until the map slipped upwards and she ran shrieking into the nearest beechwood next they passed a deaf old man on a bike and asked him the way to rutminster when the old man who was deaf didnt answer immediately red shot him with a starting pistol whereupon the old man had a miniheart attack and fell off his bike a yokel taking victors car number reported the incident to the police who needed a lot of hush money victor was absolutely furious even worse red held his birthday party in victors house victor had expected two dozen people nearly two hundred turned up and all treated red as the host decorum ate one of victors toupees mistaking it for a hamster this is a genuine surprise party red kept saying because i asked everyone when i was looped and i have no idea whos coming apocalypse boycotted the party and went to bed early perdita who longed to go felt incredibly cheated she was fed up with working long hours for a measly salary at nineteen she wasnt getting any younger and she wanted some fun it further irked her that she must be the only girl in the south of england whom red hadnt made the slightest pass at the afternoon after the party apocalypse met the tigers in the opening match of the warwickshire cup which was played at cirencester and was after the queens cup and the gold cup the most prestigious tournament of the year it was lukes first match back and he was still feeling groggy ricky laid low by a vicious bout of flu was also very weak and a lot more of their horses had fallen by the wayside in the royal windsor but as victor was the only member of the tigers team who wasnt still plastered from the night before apocalypse had no difficulty thrashing them and going on to win the entire tournament as the threeweeklong toil of gold cup matches started at the end of june at last giving ricky a chance to win the first leg of his bet with chessie he grew increasingly remote perdita had abdicated any hope of his love but it still hurt that he might be seeing chessie on the sly he had certainly hit miraculous form and so apocalypse the hottest favourites for years came to play the tigers in the finals of the gold cup the alderton flyers whod never reconciled their differences since the queens cup were playing kevin coleys doggie dins in the second match for third place the long hot summer had taken its toll with pitches burnt brown from the hosepipe ban and harder than the m a pony with four sound legs was as rare as an icicle in the tropics kinta was lame ophelia was lame so were tero willis sinatra hermia and portia of the equine stars only spotty wayne and fantasma soldiered on apocalypse were down to stickandball horses even fat nigger rickys oldest pony would have to be loaded up and taken to cowdray the day before the match ricky grew increasingly picky and bloodyminded at sunset to avoid coming to blows luke took fantasma for a gentle ride round rickys estate admiring the redgold barley and the sudden bright mauve flash of willow herb against the darkening trees he also noticed conkers on the horse chestnuts as big as golf balls and realized with a shiver that the season was nearly over after deauville hed have to leave perdita and return to florida earlier in the week having a drink with daisy hed asked her idly if she knew whether he was going up daisy had blushed and said that on the grapevine which translated meant on the pillow beside drew shed heard that all the apocalypse team were going up luke and ricky to nine dancer to two and perdita in a great leap to four this meant their aggregate would be twentyfour too high to play together any more in england he would have to declare himself in deauville he and perdita seemed to be growing further and further apart she was very abstracted he dared not think with whom inattentive he was nearly unseated as fantasma gave a shrill alarmed whinny like a skirl of bagpipes and went up on her hind legs luke saw nothing in the grassy ride to frighten her except an old disused tractor she was obviously picking up rickys prematch nerves but by the time he got back to robinsgrove her fetlock had swollen to three times its size like a vast white beachball phil bagley summoned immediately was totally flummoxed until he shaved away some of the hair saw small fang marks and diagnosed adder bite she wont die he reassured a demented luke but she certainly cant play tomorrow im terribly sorry youve lost your lethal weapon at last shes met something that bites worse than herself snarled ricky he couldnt actually blame luke for fantasma not being sound but he had to kick out at someone emerging trembling with rage from her box he saw the young girl groom whod only started that week gingerly trying to pick out one of spottys hind hooves for christs sake he roared at her youre supposed to lift the hoof with your left hand and just lay it along your thigh like this he picked up spottys foot giving ricky a reproving look for shouting spotty calmly removed his hoof from rickys thigh and placing it in the small of his back gave a brisk shove catching ricky offguard and spreadeagling him on the ground perdita made the mistake of screaming with laughter his dignity bruised more than anything else ricky picked himself up you bloody animal he raised his fist at spotty dont you touch my pony screamed perdita seizing the yard broom knock it off both of you yelled luke this is my yard and youre not fit to run it luke lowered his voice jesus man simmer down god knows where your head was in the final of the queens cup but we dont want a repeat performance tomorrow perditas got champions and international velvet out of the video shop to keep you quiet just fuck off and watch them and give us all a break for a moment luke expected ricky to land him one then he swung round and stalked into the house gazing mindlessly at international velvet ten minutes later ricky felt bitterly ashamed of himself and wished he had as nice a nature as nanette newman what a fucking awful example to set to perdita and the grooms sitting grimly through both films he was continually distracted by visions of chessie exquisite in her pale green suit taunting him that he hadnt even won the first leg of his bet he woke in tears to find himself gazing at a black leaping screen it was dark outside hed better go and apologize yet again but he found luke slumped at the kitchen table fallen asleep over the maltese cat a hardly touched ham sandwich on a plate beside him it was still impossibly hot as ricky wandered out into the yard the air was heavy with meadowsweet and the nightscented stock louisa had planted in the stable tubs this summer around the geraniums overhead the sky was crowded with stars there was the swan winging out of the milky way and pegasus soaring above the clock tower and bootes the shepherd going gently home in the west then ricky caught his breath for striding jauntily above him was the constellation hercules that must be a sign hercules had won immortality and his hearts desire by accomplishing all ten labours ricky had only three to achieve and the first leg the gold cup must surely be within his grasp tomorrow fantasma might have dropped out this evening but the kaputnik tigers after red and the twins roughriding had even more horses unsound a whicker of affection startled him out of his trance wayne as usual avid for distraction was hanging out of his box youve got a lot of work to do tomorrow ricky scratched him along his bristly mane we dont have fantasma to get us out of trouble any more youve got to outrun and ride off everyone and forget about the cowdray tea tent waynes lop ears flickered as he listened to every word if we win tomorrow went on ricky burying his face in the ponys silky yellow neck you can have every cucumber sandwich in the world then his voice becoming a sob oh wayne just help me get my wife back next morning after three months of drought except for the thunderstorm on the afternoon of the queens cup the temperature plummeted and torrential rain and vicious east winds stripped the roses of their petals and blew straw all round the yard at the last moment perdita had another screaming match with ricky and opted to go in the helicopter with dancer the drive from robinsgrove was long and dogged by roadworks at each sign pointing to polo ricky felt sicker as they passed the greying blond ruins of cowdray castle with the cows and horses grazing around the battlements he had to leap out of the car and throw up behind an oak tree down by the pony lines everyone was uptight grooms bumped into each other and cursed as tails refused to go up and bandages wouldnt go on smoothly ponies were flattening their ears and lashing out at each other at thursdays semifinal the problem had been flies now it was keeping them warm golly i wish dancer hadnt chosen black rugs every hair shows up moaned louisa i scored with red alderton last night said victors prettiest groom fucking marvellous marvellous fucking but the moment it was over he looked at his watch and said christ im dining at windsor castle in half an hour and was out of bed like a rocket which means redll be hung over today thought louisa with satisfaction what on earth was that din coming from the direction of dancers helicopter the row had blown up because a distracted perdita had not only forgotten to get the second set of apocalypse shirts out of the cleaners but far worse hadnt shut the hatch of the helicopter properly so the first set of lucky shirts which had been worn in every final this season had all fallen out and were now probably being worn by rabbits and squirrels all over the savernake forest ricky was yelling at perdita who was halfyelling halfcrying back its no big deal luke was shouting at ricky it was us won the matches not the goddam shirts apocalypse were therefore forced to play in white shirts which matched their complexions but considerably reduced their air of menace well all be pale riders said dancer trying to make a joke sobbing perdita rushed off to change in the ladies loo venturer television on their first day of making a documentary about perdita were out in force directed by cameron cook ruperts exmistress and a virago with short spiky hair and a rapacious body they had gleefully filmed the entire row now they were filming another one perdita because she wanted to compete with reds army of groupies had bought a new pair of breeches for the final oh my god can they go any tighter whooped dommie carlisle clapping his hands over his eyes as she came out of the ladies then peering through splayed fingers and youre not wearing any pants how wildly exciting go and put some on snarled ricky itll ruin the line shrieked perdita itll ruin your reputation if they split for chrissake yelled luke go back and change the gold cup had been sponsored by davidoff whod laid on a splendid lunch in their marquee drew who was umpiring and playing for kevin coley in the second match had wangled daisy a ticket hed also seen sukey into hospital that morning to have her baby ringing on the hour to see how she was as daisy ate lobster prawns and ratatouille followed by strawberries and cream and drank a great deal of pouilly fumé and admired drews handsome profile and enjoyed his left hand on her thigh as he forked up strawberries with his right she was desperately ashamed to find herself praying that sukey might die in childbirth my father was an mfh said brigadier hughie who was sitting opposite when i was a baby i was knocked out of my pram and nearly eaten by two hound puppies my father said it would have been a glorious death daisy was acutely conscious of chessie at the next table who ate nothing but drank a great deal of excellent burgundy which matched her ravishing red wool yves st laurent suit hardly addressing a word to bart she seemed wildly elated at the possibility of ricky winning the first leg of his bet within the next two hours as everyone poured out to watch the final wincing at the cold chessie wrapped a pale grey fringed shawl round her shoulders despite a plethora of gorgeous girls yearning after red she was easily the most glamorous woman in the stands what a prize for ricky to win back thought daisy down by the warmup area apocalypse looking curiously vulnerable in their white shirts were being geed up by ricky stammering and swearing he ran for the twentieth time through the game plan urging on them the need to win win win the tigers are brilliant in attack but they have no defence we must attack your job dancer is to make victor foul hes foul enough already said perdita through chattering teeth dont be fatuous snapped ricky and then luke can convert the penalty at least he will if the winds behind him all i want you to do for the first two chukkas perdita is stick to red till he loses his temper hes hellishly quick too in the lineout he scored two goals from there in the warwickshire so watch him suddenly he paused in horror what the fucks miguel obrien doing here noone could fail to recognize the hulking shoulders and the crinkly greasy mop of black hair miguel looking like a mafia hood in a belted fur coat and dark glasses was hissing instructions at victor red and the twins bart was hovering in the background i guess bart isnt too keen on you winning the gold cup said dancer hes probably just advising dad in the second match said luke lets go and bury them from the start both teams played with colossal driven intensity apocalypses greatest fear was letting the twins and red all dazzlingly aggressive players get loose knowing theyd go straight down and score but between them luke and ricky managed to hold the twins while perdita shadowed red the whole time until he was screaming with rage then suddenly at the end of the second chukka ricky hit a miraculous nearside forehand from the halfway line and the wind carried it through the goal in the next chukka victor on his favourite pony tiger lily showing profound contempt for his enemys right of way gave away two penalties which luke converted despite the wind in the third chukka after a peptalk from miguel red pulled himself together and scored twice but was countered by ricky picking up a short pass from perdita and sinking a big nearside neck shot to apocalypse at halftime youre doing great luke told his huddled teammates youre doing terrific just dont let up reds greatest buzz is to lull us into a state of false security and then pow hell zap us the later the better if were gonna win weve got to attack treading in the divots running to get warm daisy was towed straight up to drew by ethel who started singing with delight to see such a familiar friend umpiring stop sneaking ethel said drew who was shivering from the cold perditas playing brilliantly looks as though rickys going to clinch the first leg of his bet then dropping his voice i rang the hospital sukeys just had a daughter oh im so thrilled for you so am i you and i can spend the night together ill go and see her straight after our match and be with you about nine chessie who had just applied lipstick to match her red suit and who didnt seem to go blue like everyone else drifted towards ricky as he rode back on to the field for a second they stared at each other then chessie smiled good luck my darling you can do it she murmured pretending to tread in a divot then breaking off a long palegrey strand of wool from her fringed shawl she handed it quickly up to him wear it on your lance i love you ricky called after her as he rode on he was about to knot the wool round his stick then realized he would be changing it and tied it to his whip they would win now he knew it early in the fourth chukka red narrowed the gap with a penalty but a second later ricky widened it again galloping down the field with love in his heart he skedaddled like a child in a bending race round dommie then red dummied passed seb and with two magical offside forehands found the flags the stand went crazy as if chessies favour had put a spell on him he went on to score three more goals ricky francelynch has a secret weapon there explained terry hanlon the cowdray commentator and its called practice there he goes eight goals of rutshire dynamite soon to be nine if my spies are telling me right good to see you back on form ricky oh what a lovely shot but its hit the posts and luke alderton gives him back the sort of pass all players dream about and ricky slams it in apocalypse lead in the fifth chukka the flyers tried repeatedly to score but were foiled by the dogged bloodyminded courage of apocalypse on its green baize table the gold cup which had been reflecting the desperate struggle on the field seemed to be waiting to be carried home in triumph to robinsgrove surely even red couldnt score eight goals in one chukka but now apocalypse changed on to stickandball horses which were all they had left luke getting on to geoffrey the hangover horse kept up the pressure cool it you guys dont get overconfident reds scored seven goals in a chukka before now and his bloods up just keep rattling them stop them scoring above all stick to red perdita and we can do it he exhorted clamping a great hand on dancer and then on perditas back without fantasma he felt like a mercenary whos run out of ammo in enemy territory but he kept his fears to himself silently ricky mounted wayne he was seven minutes away from his first leg and he didnt dare to hope as they rode out for the last chukka their shirts were no longer white but black with mud apocalypse again already they could hear the midhurst town band warming up for the presentation four horsemen riding riding riding come on nigger said perdita clamping her legs round her fat black pony why are you so fucking slow you better rename him snowflake if he wins best playing pony said luke with a grin its being presented by some african prince oh jesus no the others followed his gaze shit whispered ricky oh my god gasped perdita in horror for the tigers were riding towards them on four of the most beautiful glossy wellmuscled thoroughbred ponies she had ever seen who the hell are they inecita cecilia leila and carmen in a word said luke bleakly i dont believe it i simply do not believe it miguel must have flown them over he cantered up to red what the fuck are you doing on those ponies red grinned white teeth flashing in a mudcaked face dad was worried we were out of horses so he lent us four of his why isnt he playing them in his own match red laughed hes so unselfish he thought our need was greater after all he really doesnt want ricky to win the gold cup and how does victor feel riding his worst enemys horses i guess he hasnt noticed and he wont care as long as he wins the sixth chukka was crucifixion on four matchless horses who had each won best playing pony in the argentine open there was no defence it was like putting threelegged bulldogs against greyhounds and from the way red and the twins were riding them it was obvious theyd tried them out several times before from the first throwin red scored goal after goal until the crowd most of whom had no idea what had happened were yelling on their feet a wideangled shot from seb thirty seconds from the end of the match had the tigers in front and now they had the wind behind them ricky was near suicide theres still time beseeched luke for christs sake settle down you guys then victor failing to control inecita barged across dancers line whoever converted would tie up the score and take the match into extra time ill take it said ricky you sure asked luke dancer opened his mouth to protest then realizing ricky needed the ultimate responsibility shut it again ricky turned and for a moment stared at chessie who pointedly held up two crossed fingers then he cantered wayne round in a perfect arc before a totally silent crowd forward went his stick then back then down it swooped like an eagle meeting the ball perfectly so it flew straight and true between the posts then at the last moment a gust of wind tossed it against the right goal post and it bounced back apocalypse lunged forward but the bell had gone perdita burst into floods of tears weve been robbed weve been bloody robbed luke cantered over and pulled her against his chest geoffrey and nigger were so exhausted they just stood still leaning against each other the twins looking very sheepish rode up to shake hands followed by an openly laughing red fuck off the lot of you said luke with his arm round perditas shoulders he rode back to the pony lines where all the apocalypse grooms were in tears and ricky was sitting in the boot of his car head in his hands absolutely stunned perdita threw her arms round him they stabbed us in the back she sobbed frantically oh poor poor ricky why dont you bugger off snapped luke to cameron cook and venturer who were still avidly filming putting a coat round perditas shoulders and leaving her with dancer and daisy whod just arrived luke went off in search of his father whom he found putting on his knee pads for the second match you sonofabitch he roared we had it in the bag and we were robbed ive always stuck up for you but by god im well and truly in the enemy camp now bart looked up as coldly angry as luke was inflamed i know how to guard my own he said softly its my marriage im fighting for youre the one who betrayed me right publicly helping ricky to win his bet what bet demanded luke i dont know anything about a bet youd better ask your friend dancer that night luke had a blazing row with dancer ive been working my ass off all summer trying to help ricky win a bet everyone seems to have known about but me dad said i was being treacherous coming over here id no idea how treacherous and that sonofabitch ricky was in on it too dancer shook his head vehemently it werent rickys fault you know how pissed off he was when i hired you he wanted to win the gold cup without any help from the aldertons an anyway your dad started it by nicking rickys wife in the first place why the fuck didnt you level with me you wouldnt have come said dancer disarmingly i knew you was too effical but i also knew you was the only guy who could sort out rickys game and perditas too for that matter i knew how you felt about her so i was doin you a favour bullshit howled luke you had no idea how i felt about her ive been bloody conned but such is the nature of polo that all the players in the gold cup drama had to meet in the cowdray park challenge cup next week when the tigers triumphed yet again luke who didnt believe in prolonging rows was speaking to his father again on a totally recovered fantasma he was also bighearted enough to set up all five goals scored by red in the international at the end of july when america beat england mostly because ricky had lost so much form luke was worried about ricky whod sunk into the deepest depression but even more so about perdita who was very distant and most uncharacteristically subdued she wasnt even excited when the whole apocalypse team swanned off to deauville for three weeks in august for the french and then the world championships dancer had put them up in the fivestar hotel normandie and as they wouldnt have to belt back to robinsgrove after every match they would have time to gamble at the casino swim in the sea and enjoy race meetings barbecues and endless parties deauville was polo at its most ritzy and glamorous luke hoped he would have a chance to get perdita on his own but he was filled with unease and so everyone crossed the channel to deauville in one of the first matches of the french championships the tigers were drawn against a local team whom they were expected to thrash polo in deauville tends to take twice as long and start twice as late the two grounds are situated inside the racecourse and accessible only between races nor can a chukka be started or a penalty taken while a race is going on and if french chic is achieved like genius by a supreme capacity for taking pains the french players certainly took even longer than red alderton to smooth down their skintight breeches and tuck in their exquisitely cut polo shirts before taking the field as usual therefore the tigers match started late victor was champing at the delay because he had to fly to geneva straight afterwards for a business meeting red was cold and wanted to go back to bed it was a raw august day with a vicious breeze coming off the sea luke was still down at the stables waiting for the vet as one of the french umpires had failed to turn up perdita was summoned down from the stands to take his place she was very nervous because her french was extremely limited and shed never umpired a match that big fortunately jesus the other umpire was highly experienced because of the continued heavy rain in the past week which had nearly washed the sponsors tent into the sea the smooth green pitch was churned up in an instant language grew worse as ponies slid all over the place and the ball hit divots and bounced awkwardly red promptly started playing dirty noone was better at pulling up in mock horror and pretending an opposition player had crossed his right of way marking him was a charming french boy who had bought perdita a drink at the hotel normandie the previous night he couldnt be a day over eighteen red rode him off so fiercely that he was almost sitting on the french boys saddle do that again said perdita sharply and ill blow a foul on you ignoring her red increased the angle perdita blew her whistle and looked at jesus who disliked red and had once been sacked by victor he nodded in agreement pointing to the sixtyyard mark perdita awarded the french side a penalty a free hit sixty yards from the goal line red promptly launched into such a storm of abuse that perdita upped the penalty to forty yards dont give me that shit yelled red bloody woman umpire jesus nodded at perdita who upped the penalty to thirty and left her jesus and red all screaming at each other although a race had just started racegoers in the stands had their binoculars firmly focused on the far more interesting row in the middle of the polo field as perdita awarded a goal to the other side red let rip you fucking bitch dont you land that number on me off screamed perdita forgetting to consult jesus youve got to be joking snarled red when you look at the video youll see it wasnt a foul when you look at the video shouted perdita youll see me sending you off off agreed jesus happily oh cmon dont be silly perdita said the twins next moment the whole side including victor on his beloved tiger lily were circling her like the tigers in little black sambo any minute theyd turn into melted butter not even when all the tigers grooms in their black jeans and orange and black striped shirts threatened to pull perdita off her pony would she give in you cant do this to your old friends pleaded dommie victors paying us two grand a win if we get knocked out now we lose a fortune i wont be able to buy rosie an engagement ring youre overreacting seb told her furiously i am not screamed perdita dommie and ben napier sent me off when i swore at the prince of wales alejandros elder son in argentina was suspended for four months for arguing count yourself bloody lucky she added to red off vamos vaten go on scram the french side took advantage of playing four against three to clinch the match soon word was sizzling round the polo community that not only had red been sent off but the mighty tigers winners of the gold cup had been knocked out in the first round the tigers stormed off to the french polo authorities who after a good deal of gallic shrugging said there was nothing they could do red was so angry he would have flown straight back to paris to join auriel but he was committed to play in a charity match with the prince of wales the following afternoon which auriel was flying down to watch that afternoon was another bitterly cold day perdita whod squandered the entire grand luke had given her to buy clothes on bikinis shorts and sundresses before she left england was glad she had pinched two cashmere jerseys which had recently found their way into daisys wardrobe her need was much greater than her mothers she couldnt think why daisy was always moaning about money if she could afford expensive clothes like these drew benedict freezing in the stands was absolutely livid when perdita rolled up wearing the dark brown cashmere polo neck hed given daisy last week but he couldnt say anything particularly as sukey was breastfeeding little charlotte under a puffa beside him he wished sukeyd do it in the hotel he was finding her presence at deauville and the crying of little charlotte increasingly irksome dommie carlisle scuttling into the stands just before the race had to forgive perdita for putting the tigers out of the cup because he wanted to show her the huge emerald engagement ring hed just bought for rosie the irish nurse lovely match her eyes said perdita relieved to be forgiven wheres luke asked dommie gone to look at his great uncles grave or something boring wheres rosie having a kip we didnt get in till six oclock this morning sebs gone to a bloodstock sale ive had a bet on this race dommie trained his binoculars on the race track i say he said lowering his voice seb and i found the spitting image of tayger lily pulling a milk cart in le havre we tidied him up and sold him to victor for as tayger lilys halfbrother hes as quiet as a ridingschool horse perfect for victor thats how i afforded rosies ring you are awful said perdita giggling youll get caught one day christ they start late here dommie moved on to the subject of the fancy dress birthday party victor was giving for sharon at the casino that night the theme was medieval and mystery rosies going as robert the bruces spider he said luke wont like that said perdita hes terrified of spiders i thought id mug an onion man and go as the lady of shallot i bet chessie and auriel and sharon will spend fortunes on their costumes here they come at last she added trying to sound detached as red led the players on to the field in the first chukka sharons handsome mexican josé had a fall and lay flat on his back in the middle of the field a second later his great blackclad whale of a wife had floundered on to the pitch shrieking and moaning and followed by six children and a nanny by the time they had reached him however josé had jumped up dusted himself down and remounted which meant the poor wife nanny and children had to flounder desperately back to avoid getting run over by red so uncool to behave like that said perdita scornfully christ reds playing badly said dommie how good dyou reckon he really is asked perdita if hes on form we win its as simple as that i loathe and detest red thought perdita but he was the only player she watched on the field in the next chukka red bore down on josé attempting to hook him and getting his ponys legs entangled with the back legs of josés bay pony red was so far out of his saddle that he couldnt save himself or his pony and crashed to the ground with both ponies on top of him there was a horrible pause as the ponies struggled to their feet hes moving hes ok said dommie hes not whispered perdita auriel whod just rolled up flanked by minders ran gracefully on to the field as though she was doing classical ballet throwing her arms round red begging him in her deep throaty tenor to be all right and crying loudly but not enough to make her mascara run oh reddie my darling oh reddie steady go giggled dommie pretending to play a violin stupid old ham we must ambulance him to hospital at once moaned auriel both venturer and the paparazzi out in force for the prince of wales were capturing the full tragic scene when like an unleashed dobermann perdita erupted on to the pitch back off you fucking geriatrics he belongs to me she screamed sending two french doctors two umpires and auriel flying with absolutely no thought for her mascara she flung her arms round red sobbing unrestrainedly please please dont die i love you so much can i have that in writing said a muffled voice leaping away perdita realized that red was quite all right and shaking with unrepentant laughter despite her frantic struggles his hand clamped over the back of her neck and he pulled her down with all the muscle in his forearm and carried on kissing her until an enraged david waterlane who was umpiring ordered him to stop fooling around and get on with the game oh dear oh dear murmured dommie to a bootfaced drew i wondered when that was going to happen it was only a matter of time shits rush in where angels fear to tread what the hell is luke going to say wriggling out of reds embrace perdita fled across the pitch with venturers film crew pounding after her hang on a second yelled cameron cook if you think youre going to reshoot that howled perdita oh no the little bridge over the race track had just closed and she wouldnt be able to get across until after the next race ignoring the shifting rainbow of jockeys silks in the distance and the announcement that they were under starters orders she scrambled over the fivefoot railing tore across the track and only just missed being trampled to death by the several apoplectic race officials now joined in the chase as well as venturer and the paparazzi but perdita was too swift for them shopkeepers raising their blinds after the long afternoon siesta paused in amazement as this fierce valkyrie with wild eyes inflamed cheeks and flying hair pounded past sending holiday makers for six running until she reached the hotel normandie with its hundreds of white balconies fretting flags and brilliantly coloured flowerbeds she had just locked herself into her room with a do not disturb sign on the door when the telephone rang hi perdita said the sun you taken auriels place fuck off perdita slammed the receiver down took it off the hook and threw herself down on her bed in utter confusion red had kissed her as though he meant it she could still feel the burning heat of his lean far from languid body and smell the heady mix of horses sweat and givenchy for men and see the thick dark eyelashes fanning the flawless cheekbones when for a terrible moment shed thought he was dead then when she had finally opened her eyes his had been already open and full of amusement and devilry at the shattering effect he was having on her the earth had moved so far shed need a pickfords van to bring it back impossibly restless she paced the room in the mirror she looked deranged and feverish tearing off her clothes she clutched her breasts fingering her nipples as hard as biro tops wondering what they would feel like to red running her hands over her waist and hips holding back her head until her whitegold hair cascaded down to caress the cleft of her bottom what the hell could she wear at the fancy dress party tonight everyone else would be so glamorous and expensively dressed draping herself with onions as the lady of shalott seemed not only tame but malodorous suddenly she had a brainwave it was certainly medieval it would infuriate auriel shock sukey enrage luke drew and ricky if he arrived in time and certainly require the kind of daring red would admire dialling room service she ordered a bottle of champagne luke feeling he needed a day on his own had gone to visit the normandy beachheads he went first to st laurentsurmer and stood by the plaque that marked the spot where the first wave of us troops had fought their way doggedly up the sandbanks below him lay omaha beach platinumblond as perditas hair the stormy grey waters of the channel the same colour as her eyes then he wandered round the beautiful american graveyard admiring the tidy white crosses and the lawns as greenly immaculate as the deauville polo fields passing the graves of two roosevelts he put a bunch of redandmauve asters on the grave of his mothers eldest brother afterwards he drove to point du hoc where his grandfather had been one of colonel rudders american rangers who had stormed its perilously steep cliffs and seized and held its german fortifications under terrible bombardment out of fortyeight fourteen had survived intact his grandfather had been killed only for his family to learn later that the rangers had attacked the wrong promontory was he like them barking up the wrong tree im alive theyre dead thought luke he had hoped that seeing the setting for so much greater a tragedy than his might diminish his heartache but tears kept embarrassingly filling his eyes facts had to be faced he loved perdita hopelessly even the brief few hours away from her today had been an agony her tantrums and indifference were better than being without her he bought a salami roll and a beer sat on the front and wrote postcards to his mother and his grandmother telling them what he had seen a big black stray dog wandered up reminding him painfully of leroy and he gave it most of his roll if leroy was in europe he might miss perdita less at least he wouldnt have to sleep alone every night he wished there was another war he could fight in or that he could run away and lose himself visiting chateaubriands house and prousts birthplace then drive to paris and on to the south of france and italy but his heartache would follow him he knew with a terrible foreboding as the french must have waited for the germans to sweep across europe that red was going to sweep perdita off her feet at any minute hed seen many many girls fall in love with red before and recover but perdita was so vulnerable because she was so passionate and uncompromising and he knew in the end it would destroy her as he walked to the edge of the cliffs the waters swirled below him it would be so easy to jump would anyone really mind christ he must get a grip on himself there were grooms to be paid horses to be fed leroy waiting patiently and probably with ebbing hope in florida and there was apocalypse to be steered to victory in the french championships he had promises to keep and miles to go before he slept returning to the normandie he felt that sick churning in the belly that was chronic these days perditas key wasnt hanging downstairs and she wouldnt answer her telephone ignoring the do not disturb notice he banged on the door you ok its luke piss off im trying to get some sleep let me in ill see you at the party how are you getting there ill make my own way for gods sake leave me alone two hours later sharon kaputniks medieval and mystery party held in one of the big rooms of the casino was well under way the clatter of roulette chips and the cries of the croupiers could be heard from the gambling tables next door rich red velvet curtains blotted out an angry grey sea huge chandeliers lit up knights kings black princes robin hoods crusaders wizards friars and abbesses shrieks of delight greeted each new costume dommie carlisle with his blond hair brushed down into a pudding basin and a card round his neck saying we thrashed the fuckers at agincourt had come as henry v seb daggers sticking out of him like a hedgehog was supposed to be thomas à becket ben napier was wildly miscast as a jester david waterlane too unimaginative to invent a costume and too mean to hire one clanked round in one of his own suits of armour flown over from rutminster park luke stripped to the waist his face and massive torso streaked with grey paint and splodges of green for lichen his hair turned metallic grey by spray had come as a gargoyle rather sexy drawled chessie but you ought to be spouting water rather than wisdom for once free of barts chaperonage she was looking sensational in clinging dampened seethrough green as queen guinevere i hardly think bart has the moral rectitude necessary for arthur giggled seb bouncing up and grabbing chessies waist from behind but bags i be lancelot my brother is so thick with that nurse ive got noone to hunt with any more sukey who had good legs broad shoulders and not much waist was looking unusually good as joan of arc can i come and burn my cakes at your stake said bas who was dressed as alfred the great juan obrien who had misunderstood the word mystery had turned up as miss marple in a pullon felt hat a beige coat and skirt and a spy glass with which he was examining chessies nipples with shrieks of restrained excitement wearing a long blue dress and a wimple like an upended icecream cornet sharon was opening her presents whats she supposed to be selfmade marion chessie asked sebbie a damsel in distress not much to be distressed about with all those presents added chessie enviously as sharon drew a diamond necklace glittering like the pleiades out of a red leather box victors already given her an ingres shes distressed said seb because perdita has pipped her to the post with red shut up said dommie filling up their glasses lukes coming and i dont like the way our patrons fratting with the enemy victor encased in a scarlet dragons costume which showed off his pot belly was talking to drew who in black tights and a white tunic with a red cross painted on the front and back had come as st george perhaps st george will wrest lady sharon from victors clutches said chessie victor very smug because his pharmaceutical empire had found a cure for scurf was slagging off bart two more plants closed this week he was saying gleefully and the families of the pegasus crash victims are suing alderton airlines for reckless homicide barts in frankfurt to effect a merger with marcos who must be the biggest aeroplane company in the world once they get a look at barts balance sheets theyll pull out hell recover said drew it seemed ridiculous discussing high finance with a dragon particularly as victors breath from gazpacho at lunchtime was as fiery as any flames you cant pour every penny into polo and stay on course gloated victor hes ripe for takeover have you seen my new pony tiger lilys halfbrother drews so fucking oily with patrons im sure hes going to pinch victor said seb grabbing an angelonhorseback and hurling it at drew drew wishing daisy were there ducked to avoid it that afternoon victor had offered him serious money three times what he was earning with david waterlane for a threeyear contract to play in palm beach and england he was very tempted david was mean and capricious and wouldnt commit himself beyond next year youd enjoy palm beach drew said sharon joining them you wouldnt have to bring your waife and kiddies if you didnt want to drew ignored the innuendo he wished he could take daisy in a minute hed make some excuse and go and ring her but as hed promised to keep an eye on perdita hed better wait until she arrived he didnt trust red an inch the bastard had just rolled up looking very pleased with himself in a floppy white silk shirt brown tights to emphasize his long legs and brown suede thigh boots who are you supposed to be doublet and pantihose chessie suddenly rigid with hostility asked him iago i thought chessie shivered inspired casting just keep away from me try and keep me near red drifted off towards the gambling tables he had just bought worth of chips and was planning to put the lot on noire deux which was perditas normal place in the apocalypse team if it came up he would make a play for her it would irritate so many people ricky luke his mother his father auriel he watched the colours merging as the wheel spun round hed always been turned on by stiff opposition hed make a play for her anyway rien ne va plus said the croupier looking at his watch for the hundredth time luke was distracted by a spectacularly goodlooking man whod just come in wearing a dark suit and was talking to cameron cook who was hovering with a film crew it had to be rupert campbellblack luke in his humility was a passionate admirer of beauty particularly in humans looking at red had always given him intense pleasure but there was something about the angles of ruperts face the long dark blue eyes the casual elegance of the body the exquisite shape of the sleek blond head and wide smooth forehead that set him apart from everyone else unlike red he was also totally unselfconscious luke felt his eyes drawn like a magnet hows it going rupert asked cameron hairy sending red off yesterday getting into a clinch with him this afternoon christ knows what shell do next the materials godgiven but the press are getting all of it she is under contract we need something exclusive im supposed to be interviewing her at dawn tomorrow ill speak to her said rupert were not standing any shit having said that admitted cameron she does look superb in the rushes and so natural particularly when shes mad what about red is he going to ditch auriel for perdita hes such a little shit cameron laughed he rather reminds me of you dont be ridiculous said rupert coldly id better go and see whats happened to her said cameron going towards the door immediately her place was taken by chessie but as she kissed rupert his face was even colder and he almost flinched away its been so long chessie flushed slightly i never see any of rickys old friends these days drew bas you billy ronnie ferguson none of you ask us to dinner any more you might have asked us to your wedding i havent even met taggie yet noone could be as divine as everyone says she is barts due tomorrow why dont you and taggie have dinner with us no thanks said rupert curtly then lowering his voice chessie darling have you no idea of the animosity you aroused when you ran out on ricky for christs sake hissed chessie you ran out on enough people not wives i didnt helen walked out on me arent you glad she did of course i never dreamed such happiness existed but youve totally fucked ricky up you never wrote to him when will died never forgave him why should i it was all his fault chessie was getting hysterical he was dead drunk having been deliberately wound up by you then you abandon him to the most ghastly prison sentence then to coming back to the loneliness of robinsgrove i was there when he came out it was crucifixion i know what it was like being on my own at penscombe you had women coming out of your ears i hadnt met taggie then rickys a onewoman man and did you know hes never worn anything but a black tie since will died not a week passes without him putting flowers on wills grave or getting daisy macleod to do it that frump said chessie sharply shes sweet said rupert and thats a typical reaction bloody bitch in the manger you want to carry on shored up by barts billions and at the same time dangle ricky on a string all this stupid business about the gold cup and winning the westchester is carving him up let him go hell never be rich enough for you youve never been poor said chessie furiously you get used to living in a gilded cage you could fly out but youre too fucking spoilt so you go on prickteasing chessie burst into tears suddenly realizing that everyone was listening to them rupert put an arm round her shoulder ha i like that said red whod just come out of the roulette room tapping the sunday mirror photographer on the shoulder he whispered get some closeups of rupert and my stepmother but even as the photographer sidled up and surreptitiously started snapping away some sixth sense made rupert turn and reach out a long arm practically garrotting the photographer he removed the film from the camera and pocketed it the photographer was livid i ad some nice pix of lady shar and pouf the magic dragon on that roll give it back he put me up to it he added sulkily nodding at red im sure said rupert you can still fuck off wiping her eyes on her flowing green sleeves chessie pulled herself together this is my stepson red she said bleakly a step in the wrong direction said rupert witheringly what were you going to do with that film he asked red brandish it in front of your father or my wife with stepchildren that evil chessie im even more amazed you stay with bart this ones more anxious to make a fast buck than a gay rabbit im staggered hes allowed himself to be prised away from auriels bank balance for a second red who was seldom lost for words was frantically thinking up a devastating reply when suddenly ruperts face lost all its animosity and contempt in the doorway moving from foot to foot with shy pleasure like an irish wolfhound stood a very tall slim girl with dark hair and huge grey eyes taggie i must go said rupert dropping a kiss on chessies cheek sorry i gave you a hard time angel i just dont want ricky screwed up any more leaving a spitting red desperate for reassurance chessie sought out luke you ok he asked yes no where the hells ricky isnt he coming i guess not chessie dancer didnt tell me about your bet with ricky id never have played for him if id known i wouldnt do that to dad i know you wouldnt said chessie softly doesnt your arm ache from holding a torch for perdita i guess ive got strong arms chessie smoothed a blob of greygreen paint on his chest youre strong everywhere has anyone ever told you quite how attractive you are i could get you over perdita luke laughed that would really complicate things but thanks for the offer i love complications sighed chessie they make everything so much more exciting the party roared on a huge amount of champagne was drunk soon the best costume would be judged and it would be time for dinner sharon having got no change out of drew was nose to nose on a window seat with josé the mexican whose whale of a wife had been left at his hotel and whose english had improved dramatically in the last month seb carlisle high as a kite now was also sitting on the window seat pretending to read horse and hound but actually translating for dommie and rosie everything sharon was saying aym not prepared to be serious hosé he mouthed to his audience aym so muddled you must gave me tame yes i would adore to live in mehico seb grinned wickedly but not all the year round the others were in hysterics rosie as robert the bruces spider was wearing a black body stocking and hood out of her blackedup face her white teeth sparkled and her green eyes gleamed i love you she told dommie softly i love you said dommie fingering the square box with the emerald which had cost every penny from the sale of tiger lilys putative halfbrother i dont know what got into you this afternoon rosie ran her hand over his chest it must have been because i was halfasleep and not expecting you that i was so relaxed being a good catholic girl i suppose ive always felt guilty about sex before marriage but i never dreamed it could be as wonderful as it was this afternoon lifting his hand she kissed all dommies fake rings i have to confess i lied to you about coming before just hoped it would get all right im so glad you missed me and couldnt keep away you were so in control and yet so sensitive and your cock but she didnt get any further dommie had pulled seb off the bench beside sharon and josé and hit him across the room you bastard he yelled you didnt go near any bloodstock sale this afternoon i bloody did too yelled back seb i bought a grey three year old you bloody didnt you went to bed with rosie and pretended to be me ouch yelled seb stubbing his toe on david waterlanes armoured foot as he scrambled to his feet im not dancing with him later dont send me up roared dommie shes the only girl ive ever loved i can understand why said seb dommie was about to hit him again when suddenly seb said kerist look at that dont change the subject bloody john thomas à becket dommie grabbed sebs cassock no really its worth a break protested seb for a second dommie swung round jesus he let go of seb a clatter of hooves was greeted with whoops of excitement laughter and shrieks of joy and horror as ducking her head to avoid the top of the door perdita rode sidesaddle into the room on spotty dressed or rather undressed as lady godiva her flowing blond hair concealed very little christ what a body said bas in wonder no wonder ricky kept it under wraps disgraceful spluttered sukey i always suspected she was a natural blonde said seb sidling away from dommie miss marple eyes on stalks stalked across the room spyglass poised i think lady godiva was a relation of mine said david waterlane the dollar has absolutely no defence against the controlled yen said victor still encased inside his dragons head i have an uncontrolled yen for that girl thought red thank you said perdita accepting a glass of champagne from a drooling waiter spotty incurably greedy buried his redandwhite nose in a large plate of sausage rolls raising his upper lip like a camel when he encountered the sausage the photographers were going berserk whatever you do keep them rolling screamed cameron cook to the venturer cameramen fighting his way through the screaming overexcited crowd drew pulled off his white tunic to display a splendidly muscular torso get off that pony perdita he said softly put her in the stocks shouted seb but luke was too quick for any of them stripped to the waist unable to give her his shirt he snatched up a primroseyellow shawl which had been left hanging over a chair and threw it round perditas shoulders take spotty back to the stables he ordered red and dragging perdita off carried her screaming kicking and struggling back to the normandie followed by a pack of reporters baying as joyfully as bloodhounds up in her room he threw her on to the bed chucked a towel at her and leant against the door not trusting himself to speak perdita had never seen him so angry it was as though the door to a blast furnace had suddenly been wrenched open paint was streaked across his chest arms and face where it had settled grimly in grooves on either side of his mouth darkened his eyelashes and smudged even blacker rings under his eyes his spiky gold hair was beginning to escape the silver spray he looked like the only miner to escape alive after some prolonged and terrible pit disaster you drink all this he roared picking up the empty bottle of moët on the dressingtable perdita nodded what the hell for are you crazy i was making a fucking statement i came as lady godiva because i cant afford a costume the only way i can compete with all those rich bitches is when im naked half of them wouldnt dare show off their bodies they need all those three thousand pound dresses to hide the bulges what about that grand i gave you last week wouldnt buy a bra top round here im fed up with being the best woman player in the world and so fucking poor its no fun gambling in the playground of the rich when you havent got a bean ive never had any help from my bloody family bullshit yelled luke daisy never stops making sacrifices for you shes a whore said perdita tonelessly you dont know what its like being illegitimate with no father to relate to the next moment luke had yanked her to her feet and swung her round to look into the mirror grabbing her face he pulled down her eyes so the bloodred sockets showed then with the other huge hand pulled her mouth upwards at the corner and squashed her cheeks together like some hideously deformed cretin howdya like to be born like that well i wasnt said perdita wriggling so frantically the shawl slid to the floor lots of people fucking were luke held her steady you on the other hand were given everything spellbinding talent charm if youd bother to use it a beautiful face a body like an angel below the hideously deformed face the flowing curves of her breasts belly and thighs showed up even more perfectly as though some wood nymph had donned a mask of chaos youre eaten up with selfpity went on luke accusingly millions of people would give their eye teeth to be illegitimate if they had your advantages youve just got the wrong values money doesnt buy happiness unless you know how to use it youll be a great polo player just give it time coated now by greyandgreen paint perdita tried to wriggle free youre supposed to be strong and silent she screamed so shut up youre not interested in living all you care about is ponies and working your ass off with you bread and onions for chrissake all onions give you is stinking breath for a second they glared at each others reflections her face was streaked with grey now her eyes glittered her breasts were high enough to rest her chin on her waist as narrow as the width of her face luke could feel the white cushion of her bottom against his cock and in the mirror he saw the soft insides of her thighs just purpled by fading bruises from a match more than a week ago luke was not a heavy drinker but he had drunk a great deal that evening ignorant of what had happened between her and red on the pitch earlier he was only aware that hed never seen anything so beautiful nor so achingly desirable dammed too long passion burst the lid off his normal selfcontrol and reticence swinging her round he pulled her into his arms i cant pretend any longer right i love you more than anything else in the world from the moment you came off that plane at buenos aires airport two years ago im sorry i chewed you out i just wanna protect you her smudged urchin face reminded him of one of those children they sent up chimneys in the old days overwhelmed with compassion and love he bent his head and kissed her just for a second perdita kissed him back arching her naked body against him abandoning herself overwhelmed by rightness letting her instincts take over then the warning bells started what the hell was she playing at it was as if her old teddy bear or ethel or spotty had jumped on her all of whom would be just as useless at giving her the riches she wanted punching herself free utterly shocked she slapped his face as hard as she could fucking hypocrite she screamed you just dont want anyone else to have me no i bloody dont well get this straight perdita snatched up the shawl with all this sentimental crap about the right values and bread and onions youd never give me the things in life i want i want security and stability and i dont think id find it living in a rathole over a stable for the rest of my life so you better piss off and stop wasting my time now she screamed as luke hesitated his lips were deathly pale his eyes haunted and staring for a moment the streaked gargoyle face looked as though it had been turned to stone then he was gone sobbing perdita collapsed on the bed her dear dear friend her bloody prudish friend her rock turned to sifting sands beneath her feet how could he pounce on her like that and spoil everything i cant bear it she sobbed dementedly into the counterpane there was a knock on the door frantically hopeful perdita looked up it was a bad dream they were still friends but it was red not luke who stood in the doorway grinning from earring to earring hi godiva he said softly peeping tom at the gate and noones gonna blind me i bet you dont know why godiva rode through the streets of coventry to save the peasants being taxed out of existence by her lousy husband from now on right every time i dont want to pay a tax bill you can strip off in front of the tax inspectors and i have to admit you are worth inspecting wheres spotty asked perdita back in his box talk about riding bareback jesus perdita was so distraught that she forgot she was still furious with red and told him about the row with luke whereupon red went through to the bathroom soaked a flannel and taking her face in his hands started to wipe away the greenandgrey smears sweetheart lukes always been dumb about money he thinks everyone can live on snowballs like himself if hed just brownnosed an iota to my father he could have inherited the earth like the rest of us not that its nearly enough lick like a child perdita dampened the flannel with her tongue so that he could remove a smear running from her left collarbone down to her breast there was just a primroseyellow silk shawl between red and gratification in her present state of shock he knew he could take her but he preferred to wait lets not lose any sleep over luke he produced wads of francs out of his floppy shirt pocket ive had a windfall at the casino lets go buy you some clothes the shopsll be shut protested perdita its only halfpast nine it seemed like midnight well just catch them they got to yves st laurent just as they were closing grace auriel and chessie had all been excellent customers over the years so the manageress was quite prepared to stay open and even produced a bottle of champagne red lounged like some sultan on a white sofa smoking a long cigar drinking very slowly and totally dominating perditas choice with that waterfall of hair and strange unicorn looks and body undulating like an oxbow river he wanted her starkly plain mostly in blacks navy blues and bottle greens with the occasional brilliant cyclamen purple or kingfisherblue everything had to fit perfectly and if it didnt it was kept back to be taken in or up perdita who always wanted everything at once grumbled like hell but she was in a state of frantic excitement and arousal red used to accompanying grace and auriel to fashion shows was an expert on line and cut he enjoyed watching perditas voluptuous pleasure as she swayed and preened in front of him he liked the way she quivered as he slowly ran his hand over her breasts or her belly testing the smoothness of the fit after an hour and a half when theyd bought almost the entire shop he told her to put on a pair of black high heels and an ivygreen taffeta dress clinging and highnecked at the front plunging to the base of her spine at the back as she came out having piled up her hair with a dark green sequinned comb given her by the manageress she found red examining the contents of some little boxes a jeweller had rushed in from next door from one he drew out a necklace and dropearrings in huge very dark sapphires thesell do come here he ordered perdita very slowly he put them round her neck and hooked them on to her ears all trace of her tears had gone now the sapphires and the ivygreen taffeta heightened her white skin and made her strange eyes so dark that they seemed all pupil youll do he said you cant give me all this said perdita i hate you red laughed with enemies like me who needs friends one must sapphire to be beautiful then when she tried to protest murmured dont spoil it he paid for the lot out of his casino winnings hed call tomorrow and tell the manageress where the rest had to be sent red had kept auriels driver waiting as they drove past the casino they could hear shrieks and yells a carrot flew out of the window followed by several chicken drumsticks next moment sharon her icecream cone flopping erupted into the street squealing followed by a furious dragon followed by seb carlisle laughing uproariously trying to hold back the dragon by its tail red took perdita to a very dark nightclub where they kept on drinking when he heard she hadnt eaten all day he ordered some utterly delectable salmon and scallop fishcakes and fed her bite by bite theyre soft inside just like you what did you think the first time you saw me that you were the handsomest man id ever seen better looking than rupert campbellblack much im not really attracted to blonds what about luke lukes more redgold red ran an idle finger down her spine making it almost impossible for her to concentrate hes going to be mad at us he wont said perdita not wanting to think about luke hes such a good loser no such thing said red brutally there are losers and idiots who pretend they enjoy it what did you think when you first saw me asked perdita red put his head on one side when was it christ its tattooed on my memory thought perdita then she said when luke brought me to el paradiso you were stick and balling oh yes i remember said red it was the only time i stick and balled in the last two years did you arrive that day oh thats right i thought you were kinda plain and needed a nose job and you should lose ten pounds and about two feet of hair bastard perdita choked on her fishcake but you had promise he patted her briskly on the back i always thought youd be a tiger in the sack better than a tayger said perdita she longed and longed for him to kiss her again but whenever he took her to dance he merely let his hands travel over her back fingering stroking caressing creeping round almost to her breasts then almost to her bottom teasing until she was leaping like a salmon with hopeless hopeless desire dawn had broken as they left the nightclub but a thick mist lay over the sea and the beach like a curtain there was a clatter as grooms rode past leading ponies through the narrow streets down for exercise on the sands the normandies only a hundred yards away lets walk red turned to auriels yawning exhausted driver who must have been waiting for six hours and said casually you can push off now ill call when i need you as they passed the metropole dommie came running out he was wearing the top half of his henry v costume above boxer shorts covered in father christmases and swinging victors forked dragons tail crisis crisis weve just been fired rosie got so fed up because we wouldnt stop fighting that she went home so we had to resort to lady shar and victor caught us dommie giggled i told him he was seeing double after all that drink and it was just seb bonking but he wouldnt believe me so its just you and victor playing together now red i wish you luck and he ran off down the street swinging his dragons tail perdita giggled they are awful red took her chin and turned her face towards him your eyes are the eyes of a woman in love he sang softly and oh how they give you away they do not protested perdita ahead loomed the normandie rising out of the mists like mount blanc with the drying bathing suits all damp again on the balconies as they mounted the steps perditas eyes somewhat hazily fell on a pair of brown boots coming down slowly slowly she looked upwards to jeans with the belt done up on a third extra notch it was luke going out to practise one look at his face told perdita of his utter crucifixion ill leave you both to it murmured red disappearing through the doors desolate but totally unable to give comfort perdita gazed at him im sorry she whispered you put me on a pedestal and i havent got a head for heights be careful said luke wearily youve fallen among those who are careless with other peoples lives an american journalist whod been at the party lurched up to him not recognizing perdita mr alderton we spoke briefly yesterday i wonder if i could have a few words now luke shrugged i suppose have you had any really serious breaks since you began playing polo luke looked at him steadily only my heart he said with a sob perdita fled into the hotel how could she have done that to luke but what had she done just been vile to him which shed often been before and gone out dancing with red reds door was open as she went inside all thoughts of luke were forgotten red was packing what are you doing as youve knocked out my team and ostensibly my mistress im not hanging around here any more hearing her gasp of horror he laughed youd better come with me the press are going to annihilate you lady godiva where to whispered perdita how about singapore i need a vacation and then we could go to thailand and perhaps to kenya and then perhaps to boston to play a few games at the myopia club but what about tero and spotty my grooms are flying my ponies home they can take yours at the same time but i cant just walk out on ricky and dancer wailed perdita im committed to play for them for the rest of the season and what about venturer omigod im supposed to meet cameron cook in the lobby at seven as if on cue the telephone rang red picked it up and held it away from his ear for ten seconds miss cook for you he told perdita with a grin she heard we came in together and she doesnt like being kept waiting oh shut up he slammed down the receiver perdita gazed out of the window the mist had rolled back and the rising sun was polishing the white horses and the glassy depths of the channel the energetic were already pounding back and forth in the hotel swimmingpool early riders were bouncing round a little ridingschool ring red crossed the room and kissed her properly for the first time are you sure youve got your priorities right ill come with you said perdita helplessly the telephone rang it was cameron cook again go screw yourself said red then cutting her off immediately started to dial out ill call orly and get us on the afternoon flight you can get on with my packing from that moment perdita was a leaf ripped untimely and whipped hither and thither by the whirlwind within quarter of an hour they were out of the back door of the hotel and flying to paris in auriels helicopter perdita was now wearing a scarlet cashmere jersey of reds over the ivygreen dress and because her feet were killing her had swapped last nights new black spike heels for flat black pumps except for her polo gear red insisted she left her other clothes behind claiming they were all gross but what about the stuff we bought last night wailed perdita theyll send it on to palm beach you wont need wool suits where were going he glanced sideways at her you wont need any clothes at all nor would he let her leave a note for luke or for ricky never explain never apologize landing in paris he had whipped her into the smartest hairdresser in the faubourg st germain and handed her over to george the boss who flexed his gold razor in glee at such a challenge i want the whole lot off and the colour changed said red then when perdita grew hysterical pack it in dyou want the press off our backs or not ill be like samson ill lose all my strength and probably you returning three hours later even red was jolted by an almost unrecognizable perdita her hair short as a schoolboys thick and darkest prussian blue as a magpies stripe clung sleek to her exquisitely shaped head emphasizing the long neck the curling mouth the long greek nose the smooth white forehead and the blueblack blazingly angry wideapart eyes and as her face looked more fierce more vulnerable more like a picasso more boyish by contrast her body looked more feminine and voluptuous omigod red prowled round her what a piece of work christ you look as sexy as hell i look like hell snarled perdita i hate it i hate it dont be silly before you were just any old blowzy blonde now you look like noone else on earth no leave it he said sharply as she frantically tried to pull some tendrils over her forehead i loathe short hair well i like it and after two years of boreiel im not taking up with another woman who spends all day clutching a blow dryer ive got better things for you to blow ill have to spend all day washing my neck and ears now stop beefing red slotted the arms of a huge pair of dark glasses behind her ears weve got a plane to catch an hour later they were in the front firstclass seats of an air france flight to singapore drinking champagne and eating caviar reds only concession to disguise was dark glasses and a dark blue baseball cap pulled down over his nose hiding most of his hair im sorry said perdita i only bitch when im rattled dont worry on my account i like rows last time i travelled first class was because you upgraded me red took her hand and kissed it youre upgraded for good now he said softly then as perditas heart lurched longing to ask what he meant he started examining her hands well have to get you a manicure in singapore you mustve been skipping out the entire apocalypse barn without a pitchfork christ look at that two english businessmen across the gangway were drooling over a doublepage coloured photograph of a naked perdita riding spotty into the casino with victor in his dragons head gazing up at her theyve airbrushed your boobs to make them twice as big said red and blackened your bush and my character hissed perdita nice tits said the nearest businessman thickly putting on his bifocals to examine them more closely lucky horse said the other bet hes enjoying it shes a raver that perdita told prince charles to eff off they say all that stimulation between their legs all day makes ladies really randy im thinking of taking up polo said his companion drawing frantically on his cigar or at least sponsoring a polo function next year crumpets fantastic perdita was about to erupt shaking with laughter red put a hand on her arm now arent you glad youve changed your hair flattering picture of victor though he should use it in his annual report spottys wall eye caught in the flash looked both alarmed and disapproving he will be ok wont he and tero too pleaded perdita taking a slug of champagne ive never been parted from them for a day since i came back from palm beach teros petrified of strangers still drunk when she had walked out on them that morning she was trying not to sober up i rang manuel while you were in the hairdressers said red hes going to fly them straight to boston well stay at the ritzcarlton youll like that perdita couldnt eat much dinner but she kept on drinking she was also incensed after the lights had been dimmed and the screen pulled down to discover the flight movie was treadmill auriels latest tour de force in which she played a stunning middleaged woman rediscovering passion and sexuality with a young boy thats good wont need a mogadon said red pushing back his chair and putting the navyblue blindfold over his eyes arent you going to watch why should i ive had the real thing goodnight sweetheart see you in the morning and immediately he fell asleep perdita was outraged it had been just the same on that long flight to argentina with ricky when shed lain writhing with desire under two blankets and ricky hadnt lain a finger on her what the hell was red playing at having not slept for two days she had been feeling drowsy and sexy now she was wide awake and however hard she tried not to watch her eyes seemed to force themselves open as with horrified fascination she watched auriel bigbosomed mature her long dark hair spilling over pillows being let down taken up tumbling over her shoulders in the shower as she murmured endearments in her throaty voice and exuded experience with a capital e fucking gorgeous tits leered the businessman across the way whose hand seemed to be revoltingly active beneath his blanket and lovely hair you cant beat a really attractive mature lady i wouldnt mind beating her said his friend perdita clutched her head god her hair was short it suddenly occurred to her that the only time shed slept on a plane was when shed been with luke three performances of carmen on the headphones a second film mercifully starring charles bronson and three meals later during which time red woke up and read an entire wilbur smith hardly pausing to speak to her perdita found herself staggering out into the stifling singapore dusk after that things became a little hazy the drive from the airport was even more terrifying than argentina with people crouching in the back of lorries wearing crash helmets over their coolie hats a hot breeze wafted a voluptuous smell of soy and frangipani little clouds turned pink by the setting sun rose like puffs of smoke from the tops of soaring skyscrapers fortunately red had booked them into the most charming hotel the legendary goodwood park amid all the modern buildings it looked like a little persilwhite castle complete with turrets plucked from the black forest and plonked down on a green hill and wrapped in a muffler of jungle greenery even more excitingly they were staying in the brunei suite normally inhabited by kings princes prime ministers and the sultan of brunei when he was in town i played for him once said red propping his polo sticks against the bedroom wall every time he changed ponies all the crowd stood up and werent allowed to sit down until the royal ass was back in a different saddle this place is incredible said perdita padding from room to room over the thick golden carpet we can have a sauna give dinner parties in the dining room and play hide and seek hyde and jekyll if you play with me said red geminis are totally schizophrenic what an incredibly comfortable bed said perdita collapsing on to the golden counterpane wish i had one as big as this at home is this what they call kingsize depends on the king said red who had poured himself a huge scotch on the rocks george vi of england was quite small henry viii bloody large edward vii even larger what dyou want to drink shall we eat out or in but perdita was asleep in the impossibly crumpled ivygreen taffeta dress she looked like some fourteenyearold schoolboy playing amanda in the house production of private lives gripped with lust red wondered why he wanted her so much because she was different or because she was lukes and he had to beat luke in everything he toyed with the idea of waking her up but as he removed her dress she didnt stir folding the counterpane round her he left her to sleep waking perdita had no idea where she was fumbling for the light switch she saw reds polo sticks had gone perhaps hed done a bunk she was just opening the french windows on to a roof garden filled with tropical plants and blazing sunlight when there was a knock on the door three gently smiling waiters had arrived bearing first breakfast of coffee orange juice scrambled eggs and croissants then a vast bunch of incredibly scented yellow orchids and finally a cardboard box tied with pink ribbon inside the box was a pair of black and grey striped silk pyjamas and a note darling perdita im playing polo back at sundown prepare yourself for a gaudy night love red looking at the drawingroom clock she saw it was and was so overwhelmed with terror that she forgot to tip the waiters by running away with red and leaving a trail of broken hearts and contracts she had totally burnt her junks what happened if she couldnt deliver the goods tonight there wasnt a woman red couldnt have how could she not be a terrible letdown and what would happen when he discovered her fearful secret skin had formed on the hot milk the scrambled eggs had congealed and the croissants cooled before she pulled herself together her legs shaved for godiva were already slightly bristly using reds razor she was shaking so much she cut herself twice anyone would think shed slaughtered a pig she had a shower and scrubbed every centimetre of her body and between her legs about twenty times then rubbed scented body lotion all over herself particularly into her calloused brillopad hands then she rubbed reds givenchy for men into her hair and slicked it back like lord snooty the silk pyjamas were incredibly seductive but too hot so she folded them on the side of her bed and instead put on a grey and white striped shirt of reds the twins and chessie had often intimated that red was bisexual if she looked like a boy perhaps he would fancy her more at seven by which time two unobtrusive maids had tidied the room and put her flowers in water a bottle of champagne arrived on ice champagne reminded her of walking out on luke so she settled for two miniature bottles of vodka and topped them up with lime juice and ice sitting out on the roof garden with a guide book of singapore she watched a pallid halfmoon grow gradually more luminous and venus quivering golden between the skyscrapers as the sun went down in a bonfire of orange red should have a shirt in that orange then because her stomach was rumbling she got a packet of peanuts from the fridge and was so nervous she cleaned her teeth between peanuts night had fallen and a slight breeze was lifting the coloured mantillas of the bougainvillaea when red returned he was still wearing boots and breeches his dark blue polo shirt was dripping his hair almost black with sweat christ its hot he threw his whip on the bed like playing in a turkish bath good game asked perdita he looked so glamorous she wanted to run into his arms but she must play it cool great i played nine chukkas there was a tropical storm after lunch but the pitch dried out half an hour later what was the standard like pretty average but there was a wild guy playing for the other side called barry bartlett just flown in from australia with halfadozen walers hes a six so we spent our time hitting the ball to each other like a wimbledon final and those walers are as tough as shit legs like iron and wonderful mouths im gonna offer for the lot did anyone recognize you sure they all did but i said we were avoiding the press so theyll keep their traps suit theyd also heard about the twins being fired the storys escalated not only were they caught in bed with sharon but also a pony howve you been fine lied perdita as she came back into the litup bedroom a slow smile spread across reds face my shirt your haircut my schoolboy said red running his hand over the slicked hair fix me a scotch on the rocks im going to have a shower he was back in five minutes just wearing a white towel slung round his hips which emphasized the satinbrown smoothness of his chest compared with luke he was willowy and elongated a greyhound beside a mastiff she didnt want to think about luke it hurt too much and made her feel too guilty and she knew if it had been him instead of red who had been about to take her to bed she wouldnt have been so terrified thank you for the orchids they were lovely desperately she tried to stem the rattle of ice theyve got lower lips like juan obrien and the pyjamas are gorgeous why didnt you wear them i thought you might not want to go to bed you thought wrong and youve put them on the wrong side he picked up the pyjamas and threw them to the left side of the bed your pal ricky francelynch may be ambidextrous enough to make women come with his left hand but i only score with my right turning away to hide her frantic blushes perdita drained her vodka its the most beautiful suite she gushed with all those grecian pillars and chandeliers and alcoves and you coming in all handsome in breeches and boots its like the cover of a barbara cartland novel good said red who was fiddling around with the mirrors on the dressing table pulling them in front of the bed to reflect any forthcoming action he looked up and smiled revelling in her embarrassment sweat was cascading down her body her pounding heart made her totally breathless rred theres something ive got to tell you oh dear sighed red sitting down in a gold satin armchair and lighting a yellow sobranie dont tell me youve got your period some guys dont mind but ive never enjoyed the flavour of the monthly then when she didnt laugh its a joke perdita gazed miserably down at her painted toenails i know i come on blasé she muttered but ive never been to bed with anyone in my life red choked on his whisky you what im a virgin youve gotta be joking he said incredulously what the hells ricky been doing all these years not me whispered perdita well luke then luke didnt because he thought i was in love with ricky anyway hes such a gentleman unlike me said red icily are you having me on i figured virgins were extinct im sorry perdita hung her head dejectedly you were expecting nights and days of sophisticated passion after auriel im going to be such an anticlimax standing there in a shirt much too big for her a tear stealing down her pale cheek like a raindrop on a magnolia petal bruises still faintly violet on her long legs she looked so unbelievably touching that reds face softened im not anti climaxes he said im rather good at giving them to people we took your lplates off when we clipped your mane come here violently trembling perdita walked forward until she was almost touching his knees take off that shirt each button seemed suddenly far too big for its buttonhole reds cocks going to be far too big for me she thought in panic hurry up he said sharply then as the shirt slid to the carpet now fold it up ill pick up your bills but not your clothes bastard said perdita as she picked up the shirt red tipped up one of the white lampshades so her body was flooded with light her hands fluttered to cover as much as they could look at me he snapped dragging her eyes upwards as if they were tenpound weights she was amazed that he was laughing and his eyes were full of affection i like being the first i can break you exactly the way i want stubbing out his cigarette he took her waist in both hands to still the trembling and pulled her down on to his knee then he kissed her with incredible gentleness his mouth cold but tasting slightly ashy from whisky and cigarettes on and on as his fingers crept up her thighs till he found the damp blond pubic hair youre sweet he murmured examining her all pink tender and glistening like the inside of a guava as he inserted a finger she jumped like a branded filly its ok darling youre tight but not that tight ill get you so sopping beforehand ill slide in like a cartridge into a twelve bore perdita had noone else to judge him by but had no doubt as he got to work she was in the hands of an expert for a start he was so detached and for another he was determined to excise the word no from her vocabulary red you cant lick me there truly you cant or there and christ almighty certainly not there shut up and enjoy it ten minutes later his tongue was circling her clitoris like an electric eel his thumb was sliding relentlessly but slowly in and out of her vagina and his middle finger was stabbing in and out of her anus and it was so excruciatingly shaming and enjoyable she found she was shrieking her head off hush my angel youll frighten the monkeys and as he promised when he finally drove his cock into her she was so sodden and slippery with desire she hardly felt anything beyond a brief excruciating pain then as he moved in and out of her his hand delicately caressed her clitoris sideways up and down round and round driving her in to a no mans land of pleasure i love you i love you she moaned i know ive never loved anyone else in my life not even luke his face over hers was almost satanic go on say it not even luke oh please please go on dyou know whos responsible for my being so good in bed he asked her as they had a very late breakfast next morning bloody auriel i suppose my mother grace said perdita in amazement she told you how to do all that no no but being a goddam intellectual snob she insisted i learn the violin and the flute and locked me into the playroom to practise little did i think as i doublestopped and doubletongued how useful it would be later i was also underwater swimming champion at school which is why i can go down for so long without taking a breath perdita giggled and spread apricot jam on a second croissant you are appallingly conceited she said kissing his shoulder and totally accurate do you think the maids will mind there being blood all over the sheets were paying them fifteen hundred dollars a night not to said red pulling her into his arms he knew exactly the spot just an inch below her nipples where her breasts were most responsive was it his expertise or her desire that made it so unbelievably pleasurable i cant think why ive done without sex for so long she said arching against him desperate for him to go on theres only one thing better than pussy in the world said red looking at his watch whats that polo go and run me a bath red and perdita had only one cataclysmic row during their first week they had been driving round the island congratulating themselves on avoiding the press for so long looking at the monkeys swaying and chattering in the trees and the brilliantly coloured birds and flowers and the hedges alight with fireflies and huge moths as big as bats perdita thought how much luke would have loved it she hoped one day they could be friends and perhaps fingers crossed he would become her brotherinlaw they stopped for dinner at pongool on the north coast and sat gazing over the straits at the lights of johore near by a boy calmly dismembered crabs for their dinner ten minutes later they were eating them god theyre delicious said perdita guiltily im getting awfully hardened i couldnt have eaten them a week ago having seen them killed like that you need toughening up youre far too emotional they ate with their fingers off banana leaves instead of plates from all directions came dollops of rice beans squid giant prawns lobster and the recently dismembered crabs christ you need a fire extinguisher to eat the chillies gasped perdita taking a huge slug of white wine no thank you she shuddered as the waiter offered her a large fishs head gourmets suck the eyeballs said red lighting a cigarette ugh said perdita its an acquired taste you mustnt be so squeamish beautiful stars said perdita dreamily she longed to stroke his thighs but hed go berserk if she spread chilli sauce all over his white trousers stars much bigger in kenya said red tipping his head back ill take you there one day perdita thought shed never been happier in her life can i have some brandy youve had enough red beckoned for the bill dont want to dull your reflexes ive got some amylnitrate and a couple of incredibly blue movies back at the hotel theyll blow your mind the moment they were back in the brunei suite however the telephone rang ok terrific come on up said red then turning to perdita go and have a shower darling ive got a surprise for you perdita was wary of reds surprises it might be the twins or even the news of the world anything for novelty but when she wandered into the drawing room ten minutes later in a pale pink silk kimono she found sitting in one of the pale armchairs one of the prettiest chinese girls she had ever seen this is doris chow said red perdita giggled and wondered if doris had a black tongue hi she said im mad about singapore have you lived here long all my life said doris doris is a teacher drawled red oh really what dyou teach sex said red softly then to perditas utter horror he put out a hand and started to caress the chinese girls neck just above her jadegreen cheongsam isnt she beautiful with the other hand he started pulling pins out of her black hair what the hell are you playing at whispered perdita shes going to give you a few lessons said red as though he was explaining fractions to a seven year old youre coming along nicely but your technique lacks finesse wild barry bartlett says doris gives head better than anyone else in singapore the next minute perdita had picked up a vase and thrown it at red you perverted bloody bastard maddeningly red caught it putting it down on the glass table in the middle of the room dont be silly he said sharply as perdita reached for an ashtray bursting into tears she fled to the bedroom i wont do it i wont dyou want to turn me into a fucking dyke dont make me please please red im sorry im not good enough ill read sex books ill watch blue movies cant you tell me where im going wrong not her most hearts would have melted not reds why are you making such a stupid fuss over something thatll turn out so nice later youd think nothing of going to hugh dawnay or peter grace to learn polo whats so different about sex a few practicals with doris and youll be almost up to auriels standards wham perdita had slapped him across the face wham he slapped her back much harder i cant red truly i cant you will if you want to stay with me if not theres a plane back to england leaving first thing in the morning after doris had gone hours later perdita cried herself to sleep on the sofa in the drawing room sometime towards dawn she woke to find red standing by the window he was smoking with an untouched glass of whisky beside him on the table in the pale light filtering through the net curtains he looked ghastly his shoulders hunched his eyeliner smudged beneath sad despairing eyes the picture of desolation red she called out forgetting the desperate humiliation through which hed put her are you ok as though he were continents away he looked at her for a second in bewilderment they met halfway across the room collapsing into each others arms im sorry his lips were against her forehead ill never put you through anything like that again ill make you happy i promise i dont know what gets into me i love you mumbled perdita who only felt passionate relief hed forgiven her i thought id lost you ive got problems said red wearily ill tell you one day tell me now they both jumped as the telephone rang you get it said red its the scorpion said perdita in panic a second later they know were here give it to me red took the receiver ok you bastards he said coolly ive only got one thing to say to you and the rest of the world right perdita and i are getting married we havent fixed a date yet but it wont be long now fuck off and leave us alone slamming down the receiver he took it off the hook and added turning to a gaping perdita that should shut them up but you didnt mean it red laughed suddenly he was all sparkle and high spirits at the novelty of the whole thing yes i did ive always been turned on by the idea of arranged marriages so i arranged this one lets go and consummate the engagement red to wed screamed worldwide headlines perdita steals auriels toyboy chukked her said the sun in a huge frontpage headline every member of the red army seemed only too happy to tell all about red in bed the press besieged the goodwood park hotel there were widespread rumours that james whitaker dressed as a monkey had tried to climb into the roof garden of the brunei suite but the tigerishly vigilant hotel staff only let in one person the most expensive jeweller in singapore from whom red bought an engagement ring for perdita containing a sapphire as big as a victoria plum after a couple more days in singapore they moved on to thailand by which time press interest had been considerably distracted by the wedding of another beautiful redhead to the duke of york in westminster abbey from thailand they went to hong kong india then on to kenya and everywhere they were pestered perdita secretly enjoyed the publicity it excited her to be the other half of a beautiful couple with packs of reporters hanging on her every expletive and her photograph in every newspaper sleek exotic and shining with love lady godivine the press had nicknamed her at last she had become a superstar conversely for the first time in her life she was forced to be unselfish like a prince red expected her to do everything mix his drinks tidy up after him ring up the singapore tailor who arrived in a quarter of an hour quivering with excitement to receive an order for twenty suits and twice as many shirts jackets and trousers and red gave the fitting of the suits the slant of a pocket the position of a button the same total concentration hed given wilbur smith on the plane or to a game of polo when hed suddenly decided to win it he had incredible stamina when they moved to india and africa she found it difficult to keep up with the endless round of nightclubs and parties and like all wildly unpunctual people he hated to be kept waiting because he wasnt used to it if perdita wasnt ready he left without her often sadistic keeping her for ages on the brink of orgasm until she was screaming for it he was in fact very like a tiger whod been reared by humans beautiful playful purring rubbing against you falling asleep in your arms but liable at any moment to turn savage and wounding but if he had a wicked temper he didnt bear grudges even after the most violent rows apart from the occasional sniping at ricky the only person he hated was chessie the moment dad dies of a coronary therell be a taxi outside alderton towers to take her to the airport best of all like a plant brought out of the winter frosts into a warm greenhouse perdita adored being rich having fistfuls of notes to buy what she liked ordering whatever she wanted to eat one evening she ate so much caviar she was sick the same tailor making suits for red plucked the most amazing silks and cottons out of the rainbow and strictly supervised by red transformed them overnight into a wildly flattering wardrobe im going to turn you into a great beauty said red taking endless photographs of her both dressed and nude within six months every girl in the world is going to want to look like you having refused to speak to any of her family or fellow polo players because she was frightened of getting an earful perdita finally rang seb carlisle to test the water and found it extremely icy christ you bitch perdita have you any idea how many people you fucked up who your sainted mother for a start let her sweat dont be a cow shes sweet and youve completely screwed up apocalypse and venturer and poor auriel actually cried in public last week and your future motherinlaw is tearing her snowwhite hair at the thought of red chucking himself away on a nobody bitch screamed perdita dancer and ricky will certainly never speak to you again i dont care ive never been so happy in my life it wont last red sheds women like cardigans in summer youre a fine one to talk pinching your brothers girlfriend dommies dyed his hair black so she wont mistake us in the future all twins look grey in the dark snarled perdita and what about both of you going to bed with sharon that was the best thing we ever did hearing victord fired us dancers hired us to play for apocalypse next year perdita felt an appalling stab of jealousy then steeled herself to ask the most difficult question of all hows luke very unallright said seb bleakly thats why everyone really hates you youve broken lukes heart ecstasy at an autumn spent playing not very serious polo in zimbabwe was tempered by the prospect of returning to palm beach in the middle of november and facing luke perdita didnt know if she was relieved or disappointed on getting back to reds house to learn that luke had taken all his ponies and leroy off to argentina wouldnt be back until after christmas and by then would be playing out of boca raton so theyd be far less likely to bump into each other any worries next morning that red might have forgotten her birthday were dispelled when he told her to look out of the window on the lawn below were three of reds grooms each holding two of the most beautiful ponies perdita had ever seen happy birthday darling said red amused at her speechlessness when you shacked up with me i told you thered be strings attached breaking the rule that one should always approach horses quietly perdita flew downstairs in her pale pink silk kimono and screaming with delight flitted from pony to pony two chestnuts a couple of barry bartletts tough little walers from singapore and a bay and a dark brown from argentina who were headshy when she tried to hug them then leaping on to one of the chestnuts perdita cantered her through the dew executing such a perfect figure of eight in and out of two orange trees that she earned herself a round of applause from the grooms thank you she screamed up at red its the most wonderful wonderful present ill ever have he must love her to spoil her like this and it meant that now with spotty and tero shed have eight ponies she gave a start of horror shed come back so late last night and been so knocked out by the splendour of reds house that she hadnt even asked after them spotty and tero are ok arent they she asked the grooms who all looked shifty when they had driven down to el paradiso she understood why spotty had dropped a lot of weight but actually looked splendidly fit and well muscled you spoilt him he was always much too fat said red in answer to perditas furious complaints spotty was sulking so much that perdita had deserted him that for the first few days he stoutly refused to acknowledge her presence even spurning polos tero was a different matter perdita found her standing alone in one of the paddocks a caricature of her former sleek self her lustreless coat hung from her jagged backbone you could have stacked plates between her ribs her twoinchlong mane and tail were sparse and motheaten her once tender glowing eyes now sunken and dull as she shivered in the burning sunlight unsteady on her legs the picture of despair but at the sound of perditas wail of horror the little mare pricked up her ears stared for a second whickered incredulously and then went as crazy with delight as her desperately weak condition would allow perdita was motionless and speechless with shame as tero staggered forward then as she frantically cuddled the pony tero proceeded to nudge her feebly in the ribs trying to comfort her what happened to her perdita screamed later at manuel reds headgroom she pine she wouldnt eat nothing eef anyone ride er she shake then bolt so we let er out no good we keep er in no good so we geeve up fucking useless idiots why didnt you ring me manuel shrugged you didnt leave a number and would she have listened wondered perdita appalled red had bewitched her she was humiliated shattered at what she had done sobbing she vowed never to leave tero again not to rest until the pony was better red thought perdita was making a most awful fuss it was only a pony even a letter and a birthday present from bart waiting when they had driven back from the barn didnt cheer her up dear perdita he had written glad youre back in time for the season ive fired the napiers and i cant play with miguel and juan any more because the sonofabitch apa have put me up to six the good news is that angels about to get us citizenship so with him you and red weve got a worldclass team to play in the states and the uk next year first date fathers and sons next month happy birthday yours bart the present was a diamond necklace well have to hock that for a start said red having ignored a mountain of fan mail final reminders and unopened bills and remarked how quiet it was for palm beach red checked his three telephones and found theyd all been cut off when he sent perdita into the kitchen to make him a cup of coffee she found the gas and electricity had been cut off too the maid when she came in announced she would give red notice unless he paid her for the last five months red gave her a wad of notes and told perdita theyd better go and tap grace mom always chews me out but she coughs up in the end and puts her hand over her mouth while shes coughing thought perdita remembering graces obsession with good behaviour i cant leave tero ive got to get back to the barn she snapped well only be gone half a day and i cant meet her with roots like this mutinously perdita examined her piebald hair the whiteblonde now growing half an inch into the jetblack looked deliberately aggressive and punk moms interested in different kinds of roots shes a godawful snob what shall i wear the crown jewels shed only be happy if i was marrying the queen of england so you might as well settle for disapproval red borrowed a company jet to fly up to new york that afternoon grace was waiting for them in her apartment overlooking a now leafless central park the sitting room was enchanting with rosered lacquered walls and paintwork sofas and chairs covered in white chintz splodged with huge dark pink roses and embroidered cushions there were dark red and pink roses in vases everywhere pictures included a fragonard and a watteau of charming lovers sitting on swings leatherbound books rose to the ceiling on either side of the mantelpiece which could hardly be seen for invitations below in the grate apple logs burned merrily nothing could have been prettier or more welcoming but grace who had an impeccable clippings service and had familiarized herself with perditas every misdemeanour from playing lady godiva to dunking enid coley and swearing at the future king of england radiated disapproval perdita felt as though shed come out of the bitter november cold and climbed into the deep freeze its perditas birthday said red kissing grace on her rigidly unyielding cheek so shes brought you a present acquired with one of reds cheques which would certainly bounce later it was a redandwhite staffordshire cow so adorable perdita could hardly dare to pack it up thank you said grace not deigning to open it how old are you perdita twenty and what did red give you red shot perdita a look of warning but it was too late six ponies sighed perdita happily theyre amazing one dark brown mare manuel says shes a bit green but shes got a tremendous amount of speed and a chestnut who evidently turns like a ballerina and a bay whos so pretty she must be clean bred and two little walers who are as tough as shit she blushed i mean awfully tough may i see your engagement ring perdita held out her hand the sapphire trembled like a great blob of ink pretty said grace red has very good taste i hope you dont play polo in it good for blacking shark nelligans eye said perdita im drafting an announcement of the engagement for the new york times said grace frostily and i need to know a little more about you perdita i gather you started as a groom i so admire people who work their way up what part of england are you from eldercombe in rutshire if this was not a place that held very happy memories for grace she didnt show it and what does your father do grace was writing in a rosepatterned notebook now perdita was beginning to sweat she detested using hamish but grace was looking at her as though she were a large dollop of french dressing that had fallen on a new silk dress hes a lawyer but now he works as a producer in hollywood rackety she could see grace thinking im flying to beverly hills next week grace went on perhaps i could meet him and your mother perdita went green my parents are divorced my mother paints and your grandparents mums fathers dead my grandmothers a lush and where did the macleods come from asked grace i know some perthshire macleods there was a title somewhere not us perdita was fed up with being interrogated grandpa was a henpecked old wimp but goodhearted granny macleod is a bitch you wouldnt need to be very tall to reach the drawer she came out of graces lips tightened her silver pen quivered she expected humility from lesser mortals which school did you go to about eight and i was chucked out of seven of them youll certainly find perditas name in the rutshire antisocial register said red who was laughing himself sick now youre engaged to red i assume youll give up playing polo professionally certainly not boasted perdita im going to play for your exhusband next season red was still laughing on the way home im sorry im sorry im sorry moaned perdita go to yale do not pass go do not collect two hundred pounds im certainly not going to collect the half million i needed from her to settle a few bills were going to have to put you to work baby three days later perdita came back from the barn at lunchtime passionately relieved after an allnight session that tero was at last eating and responding to treatment making herself a hellmans and philadelphia sandwich perdita settled down to read an interview with red in esquire magazine was he going to stop oversleeping and get to matches on time asked the interviewer i dont need an alarm clock red had replied whod want to stay asleep in the morning if they had perdita beside them perdita clutched herself with joy red really did love her accompanying the piece was an incredibly violent photograph of red riding off shark nelligan his body bent at the waist like the head of an arrow swung two feet out of the saddle hitting exactly the right pressure points as he drove shark off the line red was smiling shark was scowling lovely piece she said as red walked in and a heavenly photograph these are better said red throwing a hardbacked envelope down on the kitchen table inside were some blackandwhite prints hed taken of her in kenya and had blown up she was wearing a black polo shirt breeches and boots her face was slightly shiny and her hair hanging in damp tendrils wow i look ok said perdita in amazement perhaps you should give up polo and take up photography red ruffled her hair which was now all black again youre gonna take up modelling angel and start earning your keep i spent the morning with ferrantis dino ferranti said perdita in excitement the showjumper i had such a crush on him then seeing reds face but that was yonks ago ferrantis inc theyre a multinational said red one of their big moneyspinners is cosmetics and perfume dinos on the main board we had lunch today theyre launching a new perfume next year and thinking of calling it perdita after me asked perdita delighted after you i hope its better than auriel if it takes on theyre thinking of sponsoring a polo team dinos always wanted to play polo itll be fun playing with dad and angel this season but it might pall we should keep our options open perdita always felt dizzy with happiness when he talked in terms of their future all they want you to do went on red if they choose you is have your picture taken looking unbelievably glamorous and make a few personal appearances when they launch it in the spring and theyre talking megabucks a week later when perdita was practising cut shots into goal on spotty and totally concentrating on the job in hand red without warning brought dino ferranti and two of his brothers to watch her next day she and red lunched with the ferranti board in new york we better scotchtape your mouth said red dont call anyone an asshole ferrantis however were enchanted and promptly signed her up red said hed handle the money side dino is kind of attractive said perdita as they flew home dont be deceived hes very tough perdita looked down at the pastel houses and the yachts that dotted the hyacinthblue ocean as the plane began its descent to palm beach airport what about venturer she asked arent i under contract to them winston chalmersll get you out of that no sweat said red hum said perdita dino doesnt like rupert campbellblack by the way so hell be delighted to take venturer out said red dino once made a pass at ruperts first wife and rupert was very close to dinos wife fen before she married dino so it makes both guys edgy rupert is convinced dino slept with helen dino swears he didnt but rupert can never forgive a right back in rutshire on an october afternoon ricky having worked young ponies all day by way of light relief was hacking wayne through the eldercombe woods little chef riding pillion on the ponys plump quarters bristled at rabbits and occasionally leapt down to chase them through leaves still starched by the mornings frost a sinking sun like a dayglo grapefruit caught the shaggy silver pelts of the travellers joy and gingered the last leaves of the turkey oaks in the distance ricky could hear the mournful pa pa pa of the horn the hunt must be on their last run of the day he passed daisys cottage a few pale pink roses still clambered up the walls fuchsias drooped in tubs clashing with the scarlet nasturtiums which splayed across the path the lights were on in the sitting room and the first flickerings of a fire in the grate gainsborough perched on the wall washing his orange fur crashed fatly through the cat door at the sight of little chef ricky suddenly thought how comforting it would be to follow gainsborough in for tea crumpets and fruitcake but he didnt want to inflict his black gloom on poor daisy who was unhappy enough over perditas defection so opening the gate he turned right up the long green ride to robinsgrove bracken the colour of red aldertons hair singed the sides of the valley yellow ash wands clogged the stream and rickys muddy unrecognizable ponies whisking their burrfilled tails stood head to tail gently gnawing at each others withers as he reached the top of the hill a sycamore was systematically shedding shoals of amber leaves as if slithering out of a silk dress and in the sunfired waters of the lake the beeches rinsed their last red leaves the most beautiful autumn he could remember was coming to an end and he was no nearer winning his bet and getting chessie back he had two painful cracked ribs from the hoof of a recalcitrant pony he was worried about dancer who had a cough that wouldnt go away he missed lukes endless good humour and reassuring solidarity since he had returned to america and although he wouldnt admit it to anyone he missed perdita horribly and so did little chef and the ponies who had all responded to her passionate attentions all the fun seemed to have gone out of the yard and now he had to start welding a new team with the twins who were charming but foxily unreliable and the on dit was that bart was spending so much on ponies that next year he really would be unbeatable ricky felt like sisyphus whose boulder had not only rolled down the hill but squashed him flat as well as he rode into the yard louisa having taken the geraniums out of the tubs was planting wallflowers and forgetmenots instead he had not forgotten chessie but she had not left bart the other grooms raced round the boxes of the ponies that were still inside chucking wodges of hay into their mangers anxious to get off and dolled up for saturday night jaunts dont forget the clocks go back said louisa to ricky as she took wayne from him heaven to have an extra hours sleep or an extra hours insomnia thought ricky wearily a second later a dark blue ferrari roared up the drive scattering an appropriately red carpet of beech leaves and screeched to a halt it was bas and rupert on their way home from hunting their white breeches spattered with mud jerseys over their shirts red coats chucked in the back both were in tearing spirits ricky thought for the hundredth time how well being happily married suited rupert suddenly the grooms seemed in not nearly such a hurry to slope off after a quick whirl round the yard to look at rickys new ponies they went into the house ricky still not drinking got a bottle out of the cellar christ this is priceless said bas rubbing the dust off the label you sure you want to waste it on us why not flog it and buy a pony ricky shrugged and got two glasses out of the cupboard black dog asked bas handing ricky a corkscrew from the knife drawer then as ricky nodded he added you should have come out today the last fox would have cheered anyone up i seem to have gone off hunting you ought to be hunting for a new wife said rupert if i could guarantee getting one like yours admitted ricky and why are you looking so bloody pleased with yourself taggies having a baby said rupert triumphantly i am absolutely knocked out and ive never known anyone so delighted as she is shes adorable with children anyway shes so excited she keeps waking me up in the night as the setting sun now a blazing blood orange lit up the long scar down the side of rickys face the corkscrew came out of the bottle with only half the cork oh christ im sorry said rupert i forgot about will bloody tactless of me its all right said ricky as bas took the bottle from him im very pleased for you is taggie feeling ok wonderful said rupert its me who had the morning sickness today i got such a hangover celebrating now youre forty dyou think youll be able to cope with all those interrupted nights said bas slyly im not forty yet said rupert coldly to the left in the faded blue sky hung a slim new moon like a ballerina on her points so sweet innocent and virginal beside the blazing orange sun in the west taggie and chessie thought ricky how much happier hed be with someone like taggie hows venturer he asked as bas extracted tiny bits of cork from the two glasses of wine fantastic advertisings terrific weve flogged loads of programmes to the network and abroad cameron cook may be a bit vocal but shes bloody good at her job the only problem with ruperts new fidelity kick is that the most influential programme buyers in america are women once rupert could have screwed them into submission now he has to use his powers of persuasion and he gets frightfully bored rupert grinned tell it not in gath but i have actually been faithful to tag for a whole year and i want to get home to her he glanced at his watch but first christ this claret is good weve got a proposition to make to you were definitely going to revive the westchester in america next year we want you to act as consultant ricky went very still the colour drained from his face the plan added rupert is to transmit it in america the uk europe certainly australia and the argentine and god knows where else in october the english team would have to rest their horses after the gold cup then fly them out in september to acclimatize them youll captain the english team american sponsors are crazy about the idea chipped in bas revlon bmw cartier cadillac michelob peters cars theyll all take air time the networks mad about it too and are talking about prime time if we get the prince and princess of wales to present the cup polo doesnt work on television said ricky flatly well have to edit said rupert the plan is not to change ends until halftime shorten the pitch a little play with a yellow ball and have cameras overhead weve got to capture the excitement and the glamour and the snob element itll be like a walking tatler crossed with chariots of fire sounds hell said ricky if properly promoted went on rupert ignoring the jibe itll create as much interest as the ryder cup or even the americas cup rickys hand shook as he put two heaped spoonfuls of coffee in a mug and filled it up with cold water from the tap that wont taste very nice said bas removing the cup throwing the contents away and starting all over again we are utterly pissed off with perdita for buggering off said rupert but camerons got some incredible footage already shes a disgrace snapped ricky and should be left to stew shes still under contract said rupert who liked making money now shes living with little red riding hood shes an even hotter property camerons going to follow her in palm beach when she comes up against some really tough opposition then transmit the film as a teaser just before the westchester shell never hold red said ricky sitting down on the window seat with his cup of coffee and patting his knee for little chef to jump up barts signed up both of them to play with him and angel solis de gonzales in palm beach and england said bas now barts got chessie and perdita thought ricky savagely the whole west had turned a brilliant rippling vermilion silhouetted black against it a poplar copse looked like daisys paintbrushes neatly stacked in a jamjar after a days work the little moon had turned gold well said bas are you going to come in with us or not if chessie had really loved him reasoned ricky she would have come back by now rivers of blood had flowed under the bridge since she had left him on the other hand he could go to ten he could win the gold cup and now there was a possibility to win the westchester he was still utterly obsessed with burying bart it was worth a try all right he said but venturer putting so much money in scares the shit out of me you sure you can afford it the americans are virtually unbeatable on their own territory well that should please the americans if theyre putting up most of the money said rupert sensibly well i wouldnt waste money on perdita said ricky harshly her forms going to plummet once she starts playing with bart and red theyre both so hooked on winning theyll gee her up rather than calm her down and shell get more and more explosive great said rupert rubbing his hands tantrums fill stadiums look at nastase look at mcenroe and botham look at you said bas you were the biggest crowdpuller of all times i dont pull crowds any more said rupert gathering up his car keys i only pull tag palm beach was staggered by the change in red the ultimate party animal was in bed by midnight and up at seven and for the first time in his life really working at his polo as barns filled up with grooms and horses and patrons went on crash diets getting ready for the season proper which began in january it was noted that red and perdita were spending six or seven hours a day stick and balling concocting devilish strategies to fox the opposition and working on perditas new ponies and the whole alderton flyer string must be even more desperate to bury the opposition than his father said shark nelligan cynically just to prove the alderton flyers can manage without the obriens perdita vastly cheered that tero had made a miraculous recovery and would be able to play again later in the season was less happy when she had to spend hours being photographed for ferrantis by the exceedingly famous but equally temperamental photographer theyd employed god they ought to give the vc to models she stormed its so bloody boring and the lies last roll indeed the fucker only takes so long because hes getting a thousand dollars an hour the results of such conflict however were hauntingly beautiful everyone will be dabbing perdita on their pulse spots come february crowed red as a reward the weekend before the fathers and sons match red took perdita to stay at barts house in colorado falling over and into reds arms perdita took to skiing as enthusiastically as she had to sex the tuesday after they returned home perdita was easing her aching bones in the jacuzzi after a long day in the saddle when red walked in instantly she felt her exhaustion vanish and her stomach churning like the warm waters around her she never stopped wanting him sitting on the edge of the jacuzzi he soaked the arm of his shirt as his fingers crept downwards light and expert as a pastry cook im gonna screw you he whispered in her ear and then were going out bibi and angel are back from argentina i called bibi and said wed drop by for a drink and then all go out to dinner bibis and angels barn was grudgingly agreed by the polo community to be the most beautiful in palm beach built and perfected over the past eighteen months it consisted of a charming white regencystyle house with a grey roof a garden full of sweetscented flowers a walled swimmingpool kept permanently at f tennis courts squash courts a helicopter pad and a hundred yards away at the end of a perfect lawn a lemonandorange grove ringing stables for thirty horses beyond were paddocks stickandball fields and a complete polo pitch surrounded by gums and palm trees must have cost bibi an arm and a legacy said red as the blaring din of status quo from his car clashed and collided with phil collins pouring out of bibis and angels house a pungent mix of jasmine orange blossom and philadelphus mingled with a delicious smell of beef herbs wine and garlic perhaps were eating in after all said red i havent seen angel in two years perdita checked her reflection in the driving mirror ferrantis had taught her to make up her eyes and she was drenched in the scent which had been named after her her hair which had nearly grown back to her collar bones was streaked blond and black her face was smooth and brown as treacle toffee from skiing she was wearing a clinging elongated orange tshirt she hoped angel would think she had grown beautiful angel however opened the door in a pair of jeans and a white hot rage his bronze curls tousled his peacockblue eyes blazing she had forgotten his capacity for implacable loathing what zee fuck you doing hear he spat at them you fucking orrible beetch perdita i never want to see you again dont darken my doormat none of you and he launched into a torrent of french spanish and english telling perdita exactly what he thought of her for running out on his beloved amigo luke he was about to slam the door in their faces when red put his shoulder against it for a moment the two men pushed with all their might but not for nothing could red ride off shark nelhgan the door remained six inches open for chrissake angel there wasnt anything between perdita and luke it was totally onesided he was mad about her not her about him its true angel stammered a shaken perdita i knew luke liked me but i had no idea how much until deauville and by that time i was in love with red you take everything from heem his money his horses his time his heart i suppose hes been dumping said red there are two sides luke never dumps snarled angel he never says one word against you perdita its everyone else oh dont be an asshole angel said red in a bored voice cut out the macholatin crap lukes not complaining why should you wheres bibi working late said angel bleakly where else well let us in i want a drink perditas going to be your sisterinlaw theres enough feuding in our family as it is and weve all got to play together on thursday angel was gazing at perdita at the long dark eyes liquid with tears the trembling coralpink mouth he could see the curve of her breasts and the tuffet of her bush in that clinging orange dress he detested her but she had grown incredibly beautiful and angel was after all an argentine ok come in totally unsmiling he stood back inside were scenes of petronian debauchery in a room to the left jesus lay on the patchwork quilt of a huge double bed with a sleeping naked blonde beside him dropping cigarette ash into bibis potpourri bowl he was ringing up different parts of the world on bibis three telephones in several languages and trying to organize next seasons matches trebledating as usual said red through the french windows they could see a couple of alejandros sons and their girlfriends cavorting in the swimmingpool in the sitting room juan obrien with one hand inside the dress of a brunette who was certainly not his wife and several more of alejandros sons and their cousins were sitting round on bibis flowered chintz sofas drinking wine eating a very late lunch of boeuf provençale and watching the video of the argentine open which once again the obriens had won by a narrow margin the air was blue with cigarette smoke next minute a ravishingly pretty girl came out of the kitchen in skintight jeans a skimpy pink top to show off a midriff browner than perditas face and a long blonde plait falling through the hole in the back of her baseball cap she had an incredible air of selfimportance was wearing a badge which said is that a banana in your pocket or are you just pleased to see me and was carrying a tray of baked potatoes ees good she asked the catatonically watching men ees excellent said juan reaching out for a baked potato with the hand that had been fondling the brunette but not taking his eyes off the screen in the corner two lurcher puppies were having a tug of war with a silk cushion embroidered with the words its hard being a princess oh how adorable said perdita lets get a dog no said red sharply dogs get too dependent he was fixing a whisky and soda for himself and a vodka and tonic for perdita suddenly noticing him the blonde stopped in her tracks ay yay yay she said in wonder i am innocenta and i am usually guilty grinned red red alderton he introduced himself and this is perdita oof cried the blonde in amazement bibis brozzer you are not like er once the video was finished the argentines came back to earth shook red by the hand and embraced perdita and congratulated her on her new beauty whats the gossip said red your father is spending twice as much on orses said juan because hes not spending so much on me and miguel jesus is playing for cartier bmw and revlon all at zee same time juans now wearing a face guard on and off the field so he doesnt have to kees ees wife juan grinned and all the others screamed with laughter and helped themselves to more wine they were all so merry flip and funny that after a couple of drinks perdita recovered from the shock of angels disapproval and showed everyone her ring only angel who was smoking and not eating or drinking was still in a black mood he filled the house with argentines because he was fed up with being married to a wife who was never at home before nine then worked long into the night on reports and was taking telephone calls at five in the morning from all over the world in the three months hed just spent in argentina bibi had only flown down to join him for a couple of weekends his resentment was fuelled by his friends who all pointed out that angel was numero uno in the marriage and bibi was neglecting him argentine wives looked beautiful and after their husbands his temper had not been improved that morning by an advance issue of chief executive magazine which had just voted bibi businesswoman of the year inside was a fullpage picture of his wife showing off her long long legs and with her auburn hair spilling over the shoulders of her pinstripe suit a paragraph towards the end of the copy claimed that bibi had every designer toy in her palm beach mansion including a devastatingly handsome argentine polo player husband nice picture said red throwing the magazine down on the table i dropped by the palm beach office this afternoon two of dads secretaries were still at lunch and miss leditsky was painting her toenails and making longdistance personal calls about the long weekend she was about to take when secretaries start goofing off youre in the shit then to cheer angel up he persuaded him to play the best of three at backgammon to see which of them was going to ride glitz barts legendary black pony on which juan had scored so many goals next season things seem to be getting a bit out of hand said red about ninethirty when no bibi had turned up and he and perdita had admired all angels new ponies and a new fortythousanddollar aluminium trailer and all the other argentines were either drunk or shacked up lets go and eat and leave a note to bibi to join us later charleys crab the best fish and shellfood restaurant in wellington was much frequented by the polo community with each new arrival the waiters pinned sheets of clean white paper over the table tops so polo plays and tactics could be drawn on them hows tero asked angel relenting slightly getting better said perdita i dont have to feed everything to her by hand now and i rode her for a quarter of an hour yesterday admittedly only walking how is luke perdita was unable to resist asking although she knew it would irritate red who can tell said angel always he smile always he listen to zee moans of zee other players but last week his groom tell me he was so drunk he miss zee toll bucket three times oh god thought perdita miserably she wanted to ask more but the waiter came over for their order for chrissake dont spend all night making up your mind snapped red flustered perdita chose cajun prawns which were delicious but took the roof off her mouth as they talked polo angel noticed she knew everything about reds ponies and was passionately interested in his game she was also quite unable to keep her hands off red angel thought darkly of bibis distancing they hadnt slept together for a week because she was always so tired she arrived as they were having coffee white with anger and exhaustion ive just had to throw a dozen argies out of the house angel and only just dissuaded jaime and carmen from giving in their notice she said furiously carmen says she cant call her kitchen her own you know how hard it is to get help and why the hell was innocenta hosting the party because you werent there snarled angel someones got to earn the fucking money hissed bibi then seeing angels face regretted it im sorry darling its been a hell of a day and a night said angel pointedly looking at his watch bibi visibly pulled herself together and turned to red and perdita hi congratulations how are you distract angel for a second red whispered to perdita things bad he murmured to bibi pouring her a glass of sancerre we must get you something to eat im not hungry bibi was shaking whats up now this said bibi producing a cutting from the daily news out of her bag it was a piece about chessie flying barts private jet to paris and spending half a million on clothes for the forthcoming palm beach season not to mention buying one of the duchess of windsors favourite brooches for and a poussin at sothebys so what else is new said red coolly although his eyes were narrowed with rage and his fingers drummed on the white paper tablecloth no wonder dad wouldnt advance me any money last week shes done all that said bibi despairingly when dads had to lay off seven hundred people this week because he cant pay their wages the guys are putting her photograph on the factory walls instead of pinups so they can throw darts at it chessieantoinette said red cant someone assassinate her hardly said bibi with a hollow laugh the same piece reports her as attending a fashion show for bulletproof clothes last week red we are running out of money i know said red cant dad talk to her not when hes spending so much on ponies theyre as bad as each other i dont know whos spending the most dad chessie or angel bibi added bitterly then lowering her voice angel just adores the grand gesture he gave a friend of his a pony last week because his wife had just quit shit red shook his head what triggered off chessies recent spate of extravagance you did said bibi you know how she hates mom ringing dad but moms been in such a state about you and perdita shes been calling him a lot lately she was bad enough about me and angel angel looked round grace put a private detective on to my family he said haughtily all she found was that my side of the family were poor but not at all nonu and anyway youre her ewe lamb the light of her life said bibi bitterly to red then added to perdita i dont mean it personally its nothing to do with you momd be the same whoever red married shes positively oedipal about him and even when dad and chessie are fighting like cats chessie cant stand him having any communication with mom bibi is going to lose that goodlooking boy if shes not careful said red as they drove home hes already catting around with that blonde cook who looks as though cocks wouldnt melt in her mouth but perdita wasnt listening sick with churning fear she was thinking that if grace put a private detective on to her in no time hed find out about her being illegitimate or worse next week the aldertons won the fathers and sons match annihilating the van dorens by forty goals to five which presaged well for the coming season christmas in palm beach was extremely fraught everyone missed luke easygoing imperturbable prepared to see the funny side of practically anything he had been a genius at defusing rows red and perdita being so extravagantly in love seemed to unhinge chessie her temper was not improved on christmas day when a vast jcb wrapped in red ribbon and decorated with holly was delivered to alderton towers dear chessie to help you with your gold digging said the note inside yours never red nor was angel particularly amused when bibi gave him a green lamborghini she kept him short humiliated him by refusing to pay his gambling debts and then expected him to be grateful for a bloody car his best present in fact was a small oblong envelope from bart inside was a us passport a senator friend of barts had pulled strings this meant that at last angel could circumnavigate the ban on argentines and play in england thank you angel embraced a fatherinlaw he normally detested i am damn yanqui now youre gonna help me bury apocalypse said bart in an undertone you can play for america in the international said chessie in delight you could even play for them in the westchester if bas and rupert do really revive it in the autumn said perdita but angel was miles away thinking of pedro at the bottom of the icy south atlantic the fish would have picked his bones clean by now and angel had another bone to pick with a pokerfaced british officer at last he was going to england to take out drew benedict daisy macleod on the other hand longed and longed to be taken out by drew benedict now he was earning serious money playing polo he was spending more time abroad and daisy saw far less of him but he assured her good times lay ahead once he was financially independent of sukey daisy was also low because she blamed herself entirely for perditas defection if only she hadnt conceived perdita at jackies orgy if shed been a more forceful mother and hadnt let perdita run wild if shed told perdita the truth earlier and been able to hold on to hamish if she hadnt been distracted by falling in love with drew since perdita had run off with red she had rung her mother twice the first time from kenya to say she was deliriously happy the second to boast about the fathers and sons match and ferrantis paying her a fortune but when daisy had reproached her gently for hurting luke and walking out on venturer and apocalypse perdita had hung up and cut off all lines of communication one of the highlights for daisy therefore of a long cold winter was a surprise party for rickys thirtysecond birthday in the middle of february louisa had lured him away to look at a pony which turned out to be an absolute dog returning irritably home to robinsgrove he found a riproaring party in full swing with every light blazing drink from bass wine bar flowing and live music provided by dancer and apocalypse pounding down the valley taggie campbellblack had produced the most succulent homemade ravioli stuffed with lobster purée and braised quails served with fresh mangoes flown specially down from harrods to hide how touched he was ricky was absolutely furious but gradually he and the great gloomy house he inhabited responded almost joyously to the intrusion daisy was bitterly disappointed that drew couldnt make it and very embarrassed about her present everyone elses were so much more exciting only after several drinks did she drag seb carlisle whod been bopping with a sixfoot inflatable rubber doll hed had giftwrapped for ricky into the study alone at last whooped seb grabbing her you and i and dolly can have a threesome giggling daisy wriggled free ive done a portrait for ricky will you look at it and promise to tell me if you think hell be upset im the one whos upset you keep spurning me grumbled seb unwrapping the red crêpe paper christ that is absolutely stunning how the hell did you get such a likeness its will to a t he traced the thick flaxen hair and the dark slanting eyes with one finger he was such a gorgeous child ricky will go apeshit are you sure he wont be hurt by it au contraire hes never had any decent photographs of will chessie swiped the lot ill get him shaking daisy took a great gulp of champagne rutshire polo clubs fixture list for next year was already up on the wall ricky came in looking bootfaced he detested people invading his private sanctum i dont want presents i cant think why everyones bothered the words died on his lips as he picked up the picture ill quite understand if you want to throw it on the fire gabbled daisy ricky just gazed and gazed at it and said nothing then he shook his head in disbelief tried to speak and found he was quite unable im sorry mumbled daisy give it back to me no no its beautiful wwwonderful so like him i cant begin to tell you what it mmmmeans i had no record ive bbbeen haunted by not remembering what he looked like daisy in her delighted confusion frantically stroked little chef whod bounded in after ricky wearing a red white and blue bow glancing up she was amazed to see rickys eyes wet with tears how the hell did you do it i was leafing through those old polo books you lent me for a picture of the rutshire before the war and wills photo fell out ive got it for you at home i dont know how to bbbegin to thank you or us you mumbled daisy for letting us stay on at snow cottage later in the evening rupert took daisy aside thats a bloody good picture of will ricky is beside himself now all weve got to do is persuade victor kaputnik to invent a cure for chessie daisy found rupert so incredibly glamorous and shymaking that she always talked rubbish in his presence wonderful food she mumbled taggie is so clever they always say the way to a mans heart is through his stomach its through his heart said rupert quite sharply there was a pause then he said cameron cooks flying out to palm beach with a crew next week to film perdita in the rolex cup i hope shes not going to be bolshy you heard from her daisy shook her head miserably she doesnt answer letters and hangs up if i try and ring her i was just as impossible at her age said rupert more gently shell come round all the time daisy was aware of him watching taggie who was now rather tentatively asking people if theyd like chocolate roulade or raspberry bombe shes so beautiful sighed daisy ruperts face softened she is isnt she the nightmare is trying to stop her doing too much look he lowered his voice helen my first wife painted the nursery the most appalling jaundiceyellow its just been repainted if i manage to lure tag away for a long weekend would you be able to slap on some flowers and birds and butterflies and perhaps the odd horse and dog for a surprise when she comes back what a gorgeous idea said daisy hush shes coming said rupert ill let you know when were going and arrange for you to have a set of keys next day it snowed and ricky gave eddie a virtually new redandsilver sledge hed bought for will one year there had been no snow pointless it eating its head off in the attic its mums birthday next week confided eddie what dyou think shed like the day before daisys birthday drew arrived bearing flowers champagne a side of smoked salmon and a great deal of silk underwear later pretending shed bought it all herself as a birthday treat she couldnt resist showing the underwear to eddie and to violet whod come home for the weekend you goofed there mum said eddie disapprovingly why waste a fortune on stuff noones going to see next day they brought her breakfast in bed violet gave her a black polo neck eddie having borrowed a fiver off his mother gave her some fishnet tights around twelve violet said rickys asked us for a drink we cant said daisy weve imposed on him enough he doesnt know its my birthday does he thirtynine seemed horribly old of course he doesnt said violet happy birthday said ricky as she walked through the front door pigs hissed daisy to the grinning violet and eddie happy birthday chorused all rickys grooms and joel the farm manager after a glass of red wine incapable of keeping a secret eddie told his mother that ricky had a present for her shut your eyes he added at a nod from ricky taking her hands the children led her up flight after flight of stairs acutely aware of fishnet tights wrinkling around her ankles daisy wondered if ricky was following behind she was walking on bare boards now then she heard a door being opened and felt warmth ok you can look now said eddie she was in a large attic room with a window stretching the length of the far wall looking over the eldercombe valley to the bristol channel a low winter sun was pouring in by the window was an easel complete with canvas covered in white drawing paper on a side table were sketch pads more rolls of paper a complete set of new paints rubbers pencils brushes in a jar and a huge bowl of snowdrops the smocks from ethel so you wont get paint on your clothes any more said violet i dont understand muttered daisy rickys face was expressionless its your new studio im fffed up with you covering my cottage with paint oh gasped daisy the view the light the peace its incredible theres no excuse for you to be sidetracked now mum said violet here are the keys to the front door ricky dropped them into her hand come and go as you like but ill be in your way im out most of the time seems a shame to waste such a nice room i must be dreaming daisy wandered towards the window on the horizon was a streak of palest turquoise below a lavender sky opalblue smoke rose straight up from chimneys and bonfires the woods looked soft and fluffy like the stretched belly of a tabby kitten turning she went up to ricky and quickly kissed him on the side of his face where there was no scar ricky can be your toyboy mum said eddie it was all rickys idea said violet as they floated home an hour later hes so knocked out with wills portrait hes a good bloke said eddie were going to shoot clays this afternoon and he says i can practise driving on one of his flat fields said violet the only person not pleased with the arrangement was drew how can i possibly get in touch with you if youre up at rickys all the time a week later rupert flew into palm beach in a furious temper overdoing things taggie had nearly lost the baby james benson ruperts doctor had ordered her to rest for the next month and had flatly refused to let her travel with rupert when he was forced to fly over and sort out the ghastly row that had blown up over the documentary on perdita macleod venturer had already sunk a great deal of money in the project cameron cook and a very expensive crew were out there filming and now the mighty ferrantis had come down like a ton of bricks saying that their exclusive contract with perdita precluded her from taking part in anything else cameron cook had then waved venturers contract at ferranti and was defiantly filming perdita in an early rolex gold cup match when a posse of ferranti heavies secretly alerted by red rolled up and frightened cameron off knowing how much it took to frighten cameron whod made programmes in beirut and grenada rupert realized that the heavies must have been very heavy indeed camerons temper had not been improved by perdita turning on the crew whose presence had made her miss two easy passes and screaming at them to eff off and make their pisspot film somewhere else it was then that the lawyers moved in they had now reached a stalemate with neither side prepared to budge an inch but ferrantis were infinitely richer than venturer and had furthermore employed winston if youre innocent you dont need me chalmers floridas toughest lawyer to act for them dino ferranti the sales director who was an old enemy of ruperts and disliked him intensely was intending to take no prisoners in the ensuing battle at this stage cameron had reluctantly begged rupert to fly out it was the sort of tussle he would have relished in the old days but not since he married taggie under her gentle influence he had shed much of his aggression and he detested letting her out of his sight for a second particularly now she was having a baby they had been married fourteen months now during which time rupert had never dreamed he would suffer such extremes of happiness and misery there was the miracle of her love not just for him but for his children every day he expected some flaw in her character to be revealed some pettiness or bloodymindedness but she had not revealed even a toenail of clay there had been the unbelievable joys of initiating her sexually slowly slowly breaking down her shyness and inhibitions until he was rewarded a thousandfold by the passion and enthusiasm of her response but this wonderful happiness had a flipside rupert was absolutely terrified of losing her with his track record taggie was the one who should have been jealous but she trusted him implicitly and felt so blessed that he had married her rather than any of the legions of others that she had no right to question her exclusivity it was rupert who suffered hellpains he was jealous of every man she talked to of her prodigal importunate family who were always dropping in to borrow money and enjoy taggies cooking of people she met in the street even of his own children dogs and horses and now she was having his child and he was scared he might be jealous of that too although he made heroic attempts to curb this jealousy every so often it overwhelmed him and he found himself biting her utterly innocent head off then crucified when he saw the bewilderment in her big eyes he pulled her into his arms frantic with remorse as the months passed things had got better as taggie who originally had such a low opinion of herself she couldnt imagine anyone being miserable when denied her company gradually realized how passionately rupert loved her and that these outbursts of rage were merely expressions of his love as rupert became more sure of her the outbursts became fewer and although she still slipped the odd hundred to her family she had persuaded them to telephone before they dropped in it had helped too that rupert had installed electric gates after her mother maud had arrived unannounced after a row with declan to find rupert in the sitting room using a pastry brush to paint taggies labia with olive oil before photographing her in the nude they had not spent a night apart since they were married and now rupert had to leave her at the priory in the somewhat dubious care of maud and declan but at least it gave daisy a chance to paint flowers and animals all over the nursery walls and flying overnight he hoped he would be able to sort out ferrantis in a day and fly back that evening he checked into his favourite hotel in palm beach the charmingly oldfashioned faversham where he had been given the kennedy suite overlooking the ocean showering then changing his shirt he found a note in his suitcase from taggie darling rupert i love you dessparately and miss you pleese come home quickly i promiss not too do too much all my love taggie it was not eloise and abelard standard but to rupert it was immeasurably more precious taggie had tried so hard to conquer her dyslexia he was tempted to ring her but hoped she would be having an afternoon sleep he was unable however to resist getting out of a secret pocket in the lid of his briefcase three nude photographs hed taken of her last week one from the waist up showed off her glorious breasts the second threequarters turned away from him and smiling shyly over her shoulder displayed her narrow waist high bottom and endless legs in the third she was sitting in an arm chair with her legs apart showing a muff rupert had shaved down to a small goatee rupert felt himself go hard god she was beautiful and all his bugger venturer and ferranti he swore as the telephone went it was cameron ringing from the lobby thank christ youre here ive got a car waiting downstairs nine hours later they were still deadlocked both sides refusing to give an inch it was immaterial that ferrantis contract was for a thousand times as much money venturer had signed perdita up first but not exclusively drawled dino ferranti his beautiful blue silk shirt creased his siamese cats eyes squinting with tiredness and irritation he and rupert had exchanged very sharp words but ruperts real animosity was reserved for red alderton who in his promiscuity viciousness arrogance and total lack of repentance reminded rupert of everything he wanted to forget about his own past he was also allergic to red hair because it reminded him of his first wife and his appallingly grasping motherinlaw red absolutely terrified of losing the ferrantis were contracted to pay perdita much of which had already been spent kept butting in until rupert lost his temper just fuck off maureen ohara and curl your eyelashes he yelled you knew all about the venturer contract when you set up the ferranti deal you little pimp fucking leech youd make dracula look like a blood donor youre a fine one screamed perdita leaping to reds defence what about those memoirs talk about a cock in every porthole you could bore out the channel tunnel solo dino ferranti suppressed a smile then as red weighed in a fearful slanging match ensued and the lawyers banished both red and perdita from the building back at reds house perdita lounged on his dark blue silk counterpane drinking green devils and watching red pacing up and down ranting on and on about rupert arrogant shit who the hell does he think he is then he paused face lit up with satanic excitement ive got it i know how we can make him back off we cant breathed perdita in appalled wonder two minutes later at three oclock in the morning the lawyers decided to adjourn rupert rang taggie who was still staying at declans to say he definitely wouldnt be home next day taggie tried not to sound disappointed saying she was fine and it had frozen last night and now it was snowing and she missed him dreadfully rupert said it was a nightmare and the only person going to make any money were the lawyers and that he loved her indescribably and would ring her in the morning letting himself into his suite half an hour later rupert longed to ring her again but felt he shouldnt crowd her the quickest undresser in the world he stepped out of his clothes in the sitting room and wandered into the bathroom to clean his teeth hed have a shower when he got up he glanced wearily at his watch in about three hours time thinking it would make taggie seem nearer he decided to have another look at her photographs then panicked when he couldnt find them he was sure hed left them under his shirts checking the bedroom he froze hello rupert said perdita softly im sorry i shouted at you earlier i thought you might be lonely the sheet was drawn up to her chin but she let it fall swinging her feet off the bed you shabby little bitch whispered rupert get out of here dont be like that perditas eyes were as shiny as black olives drenched in oil and as she stood up her slender naked body seemed almost incandescent with heat and excitement you must know ive always fancied you it was like a child actress trying to play delilah how did you get in here hissed rupert easy i just told them youd asked me round the hall porter even winked at me you must have had loads of girls here in the past in the past rupert certainly had now his mind was racing if he rang security theyd be here in an instant but with his track record someone would be bound to leak it to the press the same went for the police and if anyone saw perdita leaving his suite he was also in trouble she was slowly advancing towards him get your clothes on he tried to sound calm not so fast drawled a voice and red came out of the wardrobe before rupert could stop him hed taken half a dozen photographs of both of them naked and dived for the door but rupert was too quick for him giving a great cat jump he caught red by the ankles and brought them both crashing to the ground you little shit he howled grabbing the camera next second red had tried to knee him in the balls and rupert had smashed his fist into reds face then picking him up by his shirt he smashed him to the floor again dont kill him screamed perdita while red was lurching to his feet rupert grabbed a towel and wrapped it round his waist hurling the contents of a vase of flowers on the floor he smashed the vase on a low glass table and brandished the jagged edge at red with one hand reaching for the telephone with the other dyou want me to call the police red deliberated i guess not then give me back tags pictures very slowly red removed them from his inside pocket and threw them down on the glass table very pretty you must introduce me some time shut up rupert gave such a howl that the windows rattled and the glasses rang if you ever come within a million miles of her get dressed picking up perditas pink dress he hurled it at her you cheap little blackmailing whore i wouldnt put anything past the scarlet pimp here but i thought a bit of luke or ricky might have rubbed off on you we wouldnt have gone to the press stammered perdita we just wanted you to back off still drunk from the green devils she put her legs into one of the arm holes of her dress and nearly fell over when the telephone rang rupert was ashen when he put the receiver down whats the matter whispered perdita taggie she was worried noone would feed the birds and sneaked over to penscombe and slipped on the ice declan thinks shes miscarrying ive got to go back the events of the last ten minutes might never have happened borrow one of dads jets offered red thanks said rupert all that mattered was getting home as fast as possible the truce was fleeting rupert got back to england to find taggie had not only lost the baby but nearly her life as well she would get better said james benson reassuringly who had never expected to see rupert so devastated but shed never be able to have children this seemed irrelevant to rupert at the time compared with the frantic relief that he wouldnt lose her only when she began to recover did he appreciate how shattered she was not to be able to have his children as she sobbed helplessly in his arms he looked out at a robin pecking at the bird table like a drop of blood against the snow which had already blotted out all the skid marks of her fall the same afternoon he discovered her weeping just as hopelessly in the nursery that daisy had covered so riotously with butterflies and birds and even gertrude the mongrel and his heart had blackened against perdita if he hadnt had to go to america none of this would have happened the only time he left taggies bedside the next week was to ring dino ferranti and tell him they were dropping the case and to call cameron cook home because venturer had no more interest in making a film about perdita perdita was absolutely appalled that taggie had lost the baby but secretly what upset her most was that rupert whom she had always heroworshipped had rejected her sexually and because of this she had lost points with red but she tucked it under the mattress of her mind alongside her treatment of luke and her running out on ricky and tried to forget it she had much to occupy her obsessive powerdriven the alderton flyers swept through the palm beach season unbeaten many people thought red and angel played better together than the obriens they were less powerful physically but younger and took more risks red riding the legendary glitz won most valuable player and best playing pony in every match angel getting a win from bart which helped pay his gambling debts had turned himself into a lean mean killing machine the games were fantastically violent all the other teams furious that bart had spent so much on ponies were determined to beat them in retaliation red and angel had taught perdita every dirty trick in the book she got so terrified before matches that she grew more and more histrionic while the media gleefully followed every tantrum red egged her on nocturnal sybaritic selfindulgent he could sleep anywhere and if hed gone to bed late could sleep in before a big match until lunchtime have a huge steak or a toot of cocaine for breakfast and go on and play with no nerves perdita on the other hand went crazy with stagefright in the past too luke had always listened if she had a problem with a pony or was worried about her game red wasnt interested he wanted to do all the talking then when she wanted to have her say he was off out of the room nor were matters helped by grace rolling up at every game and going into ecstasies every time red touched the ball but wincing at perditas expletives and her botched shots which made her miss the ball more than ever chessie furious at graces presence stayed at home sulking spending money and playing tinker tailor with the caviar angel sulking because bibi wasnt there or because she was there and criticizing him stepped up his flirtation with innocenta all of which went down in graces little book miraculously because luke was playing for hal peters at the royal polo club at boco raton perdita didnt bump into him few people realized quite how much luke suffered he went on buying runts off the race track and making them under the arc lights until he was so tired he fell off them he played polo with the same attack and won matches for hal peters he joked with the other players and grooms and listened to their problems he never talked about himself and appeared outwardly unchanged except for a twentyfivepound weightloss which hardly showed on his massive frame because he was unhappy he didnt see why the rest of the world should suffer alas music and reading his great loves no longer comforted him mozart and mahler were impossibly painful biography and history were bearable except that he read the same page over again but poetry tore his guts out unable to sleep tormented by visions of perdita in reds arms he slumped in front of the television but if any love story or programme about animals or children came on he found himself racked with tears and had to switch off repeatedly he chided himself with emily brontës lines that existence could be cherished strengthened and fed without the aid of joy there was certainly satisfaction in his life when he won a match or mastered a tricky pony but no joy for not only had he lost perdita but also red whom he had loved very deeply he tried not to hate his brother and late one night after a quadruple bourbon on no lunch had called up determined to make it up red alderton and perdita macleod are having a bang at the moment mocked reds voice on the recording machine and luke had hung up and got so drunk he fell off the wooden horse and it was difficult to forget perdita when every newspaper carried pictures of her and red entwined and laughing the golden couple so in lerve once the ferranti campaign started in march her fleshless diamondhard face with its streaked boys hair greek nose and passionate arrogant curling mouth was everywhere if the press couldnt get hold of her or red for a quote they invariably rang luke the two things that saved luke were fantasma and leroy who had become inseparable the ugly black mongrel slept in the beautiful grey ponys box leaping in and out of her halfdoor never being savaged or kicked by her never in return nipping her nose or her fetlocks proudly leading her out to the paddock with her rope between his snapping long white teeth both of them wandered round the yard after luke both ganging up if any invader threatened him fantasma given the chance would have clambered up the narrow stairs into his bed sensing luke was miserable leroy would rush in rattling a box of bonios to make him laugh or scrape his arm with his paw gazing up with the crescents of white beneath his big brown eyes as if to say you still have me often luke woke from bad dreams to find leroy licking away his tears he knew it was childish but since perdita had left him he couldnt bear to be parted from leroy so he only went to places that allowed dogs turning down all invitations to work abroad which would have helped him to forget going everywhere by lorry instead of flying so leroy could sit barking beside him it was the last tournament of the palm beach season with six crack teams playing each other over ten days for a huge silver cup topped with rearing silver horses on the hottest sunday of the year the alderton flyers were only leading the obriens by two goals at halftime after weeks of no rain the ground was as hard and dusty as a volcanic crater the only liquid came from the sweat which poured off pony and player and from the diet coke with which the teams slaked their parched throats huge white clouds gathering on the horizon suggested a storm to come perdita had had a lousy first half not helped by a ball on her arm in the second chukka which was now agony noone had noticed but she wasnt going to complain in case the others dismissed her as a whinging female as she cantered back to the little tent where the other flyers were taking a break she saw them standing in a huddle outside looking deadly serious except red who was sitting down wiping his face with a yellow towel while the everadoring grace massaged his shoulders bibi in a check suit had obviously just come from the office perdita hugged and gave spotty a polo before handing him over to a groom aware she was tomatored in the face and dripping like a defrosting fridge and not wanting red to see her like that or be subjected to a peptalk from grace she seized some antibruise cream from the firstaid box to rub into her arm and lay down on the unyielding ground using her hat as a pillow then she heard bart say well for chrissake dont tell perdita tell perdita what the dust made her hoarse nothing snapped red not glancing round what perdita jumped to her feet and saw that bibi was crying nothing grace had all the charm of a steamroller with brake failure we were saying youre not on your man and please centre the ball when you back it and youre tapping it too much its meant to be hit they were looking at her as if she was a lunatic that needed humouring oh piss off snarled perdita then seeing graces face im sorry mrs alderton but what mustnt i be told its luke sobbed bibi whose mascara was streaked by sweat and tears theres been a slight accident said grace coolly suddenly the rockhard ground had no substance beneath perditas feet hes ok said bart who was thinking only of his polo match he hasnt tried to kkill himself whispered perdita dont give yourself the bloody air snarled angel red whod gone very pale was lighting a black sobranie with a trembling hand bobby ferraro hit him with a ball yesterday he said broke his hand in three places bobbys new patron pip gilson had luke flown to new york theyve just operated and taken fifty chips of bone out of his hand perdita flinched then thinking she was going to black out sat down nearly missing the edge of one of the duckeggblue canvas chairs will he be able to play again too early to say said bart i must go to him said perdita desperately peeling off her gloves why werent we told yesterday luke didnt want anyone to know said red tonelessly it was bobby who felt he ought to tell us and called bibi just now the white clouds had turned a dark sullen grey alderton flyer horses that had played in the first half were being walked home rising to the canter to rest their horses the obriens were riding back on to the field luke didnt want to worry us into blowing the semifinal and were not going to move it you guys said bart slotting in his gum shield and putting on his hat then having mounted a leaping sorrel mare whose coat gleamed like cornelian he asked the groom what sort of mood she was in you cant play knowing this said perdita aghast bart adjusted his reins if hes just had a threehour op hell be out for hours one of barts grooms led up tero it was only her third match since shed recovered shes a bit edgy knows its a key match tero was already lathered up like a white poodle her eyes popping diarrhoea running down her back legs in a thin trickle im not playing said perdita sure you bloody are ordered red get on that pony for a second they glared at each other perdita dropped her eyes first luke would ave expected eet said angel dont be a dreep perdita move your ass bellowed shark nelligan who was umpiring perdita vaulted on to tero dont forget to hit not tap called grace perdita had to clench her first and second fingers not to give grace a v sign im bloody well flying up to see him immediately after the match i wouldnt said red icily if you want him to get better it was a good thing perdita was only marking the obriens new patron who had a one handicap and only that because hed bunged the apa so heavily because in the next three chukkas he went virtually unmarked perdita hardly connected with the ball and missed several easy shots at goal it was purely reds and angels flamboyant courage and barts exocet penalties that kept the flyers just ahead are you still in love with luke hissed red as they lined up for the presentation course im bloody not youre the only person im crazy about but lukes been a really good friend to me and i dont know how you could play so well after whats happened perdita hissed back its the mark of the great player to rise above adversity said red the secondrate go to pieces in a crisis hes your brother and barts son whispered perdita furiously thank you very much she smiled briefly as the president of cadillac gave her a silver ashtray in the shape of a car thank you very much sir red accepted his silver ashtray then out of the corner of his mouth never noticed blood was thicker than water in your family we must go and see him said perdita hysterically perdita said red softly he needs to be kept quiet if lukes sidelined for the summer we might be able to get our hands on fantasma and take her to england chipped in bart i dont understand any of you screamed perdita luke may have been put out of polo for ever and all you can think about is your own fucking game four days later perdita disobeyed everyones advice and cutting a ferrantis promotional lunch for all their buyers flew up to see luke she didnt tell red she was going hed been determined to punish her since theyd heard the news even insisting on her watching a video of him and auriel making love which revolted her particularly when she saw how skilled and beautiful auriel was and how she and red seemed to be enjoying themselves she needed lukes advice on how to handle red and about her fastdeteriorating game after palm beach in the nineties new york was freezing perdita hopelessly underdressed in white jeans and a black sleeveless tshirt shivered as much from nerves as the cold the hospital which had impressionist reproductions on the walls and banks of flowers and floodlit fountains on every floor was more plush than most hotels and must have been costing hal peters a fortune luke alderton said the nurse on the fourth floor reception desk excitedly third on the right i hope youll be able to get in for the flowers dancer maitland dropped by this morning and auriel kingham last night how is he snapped perdita who didnt want to hear about auriel well hes still in some discomfort bloody silly word thought perdita but hes a very brave guy i know that will he be able to play again early days said the nurse dont stay long arent you the ferranti girl but perdita had gone amazed how much her heart was hammering as she threw open the door its the prodigal she announced darling luke have you forgiven me then she dropped her parcels all over the floor for sitting on lukes bed holding his hand was an incredibly attractive girl her second almost more agonizing impression was how desperately ill luke looked his brown freckled face was tinged lurid green and darkly shadowed the bottlebrush hair dank with sweat the big generous mouth practically disappearing in the attempt not to cry out the honeycoloured eyes no longer amused and sleepy his shoulders were still huge but everywhere else the weight had dropped off he reminded perdita of a great dane whod fallen into the hands of the vivisectionists and was bewildered why it should undergo such horrific pain without an anaesthetic she wanted to rush over and hug him but there was the impediment of this girl in the wonderfully understated coralpink suit with a pale clever face and shiny dark hair and wonderful long legs her grey eyes were looking at luke with tenderness and her coraltipped fingers were gently stroking his forehead bristling with hostility perdita picked up her parcels relinquishing lukes hand the girl rose to her feet you must be perdita she said coolly i recognize you from the posters lukes told me a lot about you funny hes told me absolutely nothing about you said perdita furiously she turned to luke christ im sorry you poor thing what the hell happened bloody bobby wasnt his fault even the deep slow husky drawl was weakened it was an airshot i blocked it the blow knocked luke off his horse said the girl when he didnt get up the players formed a circle round him but i could see he wasnt moving i was shaking and shaking alejandro who was watching with me put his arm round me i sat beside luke in the ambulance crying all the way because i figured he was unconscious but in fact he was in such agony he couldnt talk then we had to wait three hours in casualty because they had to look after some people whod been in a car crash perdita looked at this cool girl whod suddenly gone as white as lukes sheets what right had she got to cry over luke and be comforted by alejandro whos she she asked luke nodding rudely in the girls direction margie bridgwater luke made no attempt at explanation his hand swathed in bandages strapped up in the air didnt seem part of him dyou want a drink vodka white wine he asked margiell get it perdita shook her head is it absolute agony luke shrugged the first night was the worst all night on the hour i was woken by a vast black lady saying roll over mr alderton and then shoving a thermometer up my ass just for a second he grinned and was the old luke again ive bought you a biography of robert lowell perdita put it on the bed the one you were always quoting about the woods being snowy dark and deep lovely dark and deep corrected margie and i have promises to keep and miles to go before i sleep thats robert frost not robert lowell then catching a warning look from luke added more gently but the new york times said the lowell biography was terrific i wouldnt know im not an intellectual spat back perdita and some freesias and a tape of crocodile dundee thanks said luke thats really neat hows spotty feeling his feet bute doesnt seem to be working give him some stuff called arkell said luke makes the blood flow and tero bloody miguel gave her such a bump last week shes lost her nerve she wont bump any more she still gets the runs twentyfour hours before a big match and wont eat for days afterwards i cant afford to let her lose weight i ought to turn her away for the summer but if i dont take her to england shell pine and so will i i love her so much she was so shocked by lukes appearance that she hardly listened to his answers it was as though big ben or westminster abbey had suddenly been bombed and to cap it all here was this bloody girl guarding him like a lioness interrupting him she said for the first time i can see how like red you are luke smiled ruefully i guess there must be some plusses about getting sidelined my brothers an adonis he added to margie ive seen pictures margie put her hand over his i like my guys more rugged red is the handsomest man in the world exploded perdita not as goodlooking as rupert campbellblack said margie wow he came to see luke this morning perdita felt sick did he mention me only to say venturer werent making a movie about you any more said luke he was over to finalize american sponsors for the westchester and youre going to play in it said margie warmly perdita clenched her fists shame they lost the baby went on margie he and taggie are going to adopt one but theyre having problems in england ruperts forty in the fall and the adoption societies dont see him as ideal father material so theyre putting feelers out in the states hes rich said perdita who didnt want to talk about rupert if youre rich you can buy anything whos playing for hal now alejandro for ten times more than luke was getting said margie bitterly the receptionist told me dancer was here said perdita he is so charming said margie he wants luke to see seth newcombe the guy who sorted out rickys hand i know snapped perdita i was at the hospital when seth operated of course luke should see him seeing luke absolutely wiped out perdita added to margie look luke and i go back a long way would you like to piss off and leave us alone for five minutes margie raised a thick dark eyebrow at luke who nodded well only five minutes ill be outside if you need me bloody cow thought perdita but she did have wonderful legs she moved round to see the framed photographs on lukes bedside table disappointed to see they were of leroy and fantasma and not of herself it was nice of you to come he said i would have come sooner the others were convinced id do more harm than good luke gazed at her steadily for a second there was exhaustion but no reproach in his eyes but he didnt contradict her lowering herself gingerly on to the bed so as not to jolt him she started pleating the white counterpane im sorry i buggered off at deauville i didnt know how you felt thats ok you all right yeah im fine now i just fell madly in love with red i couldnt help myself sure how is he doesnt know im here i hope it might make him a bit jealous hes wildly jealous of you because everyone loves you so much i guess they fancy red but they dont seem to like him but then they dont know him tell me whats the best way to hold him dont get heavy said luke then on reflection he who bends to himself a joy doth the winged life destroy i miss your poems said perdita reds almost illiterate you should be nicknamed wellread and illred why are you staring at me because ive just twigged wwhat they were interrupted by margie the martinet coming back with a doctor and a nurse who asked perdita to leave as they wanted to look at lukes hand beads of sweat were forming on his forehead at the prospect of more debilitating pain but ive only been here a few minutes stormed perdita visitations being restricted to quarter of an hour said the doctor oh for christs sake once more the doctor the nurse and margie were confronting her as though she was a dangerous lunatic all right im going perdita was fighting back the tears i hope you get better soon margie followed her out into the passage forcing her hands furiously into her trouser pocket perdita pulled out a bottle give it to luke she said morphine from barts medicine cupboard in case the pain gets too bad he needed that in august said margie when you shoved off with red smashing up his hand and probably terminating his career was a day in the country compared with what you put him through last summer as she went back into the room to grip lukes other hand as the doctor started to undo his bandages he said through gritted teeth ive just realized who perditas father is reds temper was blazing like a forest fire when perdita got home where the fuck have you been you were supposed to be at a ferranti promotional lunch i went to see luke i rang dinos secretary and said i couldnt make it bullshit youre under contract buyers flew in from all over the world to meet you dino went apeshit what in hell are you playing at how was luke anyway awful simply terrible you cant have helped ill go and see him tomorrow and you better call dino and crawl or theyll slap winston chalmers on you dino ferranti was icy with rage you step out of line once more right and youre fired and well sue you for breach of contract all in all perdita wasnt in a very chipper mood to go to a barbecue that evening particularly when red was immediately collared by a comely female feature writer in a groinlevel blue suede skirt from vanity fair the party was held in a copse near one of the polo barns coloured lights hung from the trunks of the pine trees which soared upwards like pillars blotting out the stars the still air was heavy with the smell of charcoal pine needles longmarinaded hunks of lamb pork and chickens which sizzled and spat as they turned on the barbecue rather like me thought perdita as she looked across at red working his magic on the sexy journalist hed given up his yellow blazer because all the young bloods in palm beach had slavishly copied him now he had reverted to his pale blue one braided with emerald green a lock of hair had fallen over his forehead his eyes were dreamy he looked like rupert brooke i prefer to ride mares in and out of bed he was saying theyre more competitive the girl smiled and arched her lean and hungry blue suede pelvis towards him theres no point being jealous thought perdita echoing one of reds commandments it hurts only yourself away from the fire was a large wheelbarrow stacked with drink people had brought perdita was mixing herself a green devil when angel came up you saw luke ow was he not brilliant he looked dreadful i ear alejandro is being paid a match to play for hal is crazy perdita took a slug of her green devil and choked it was nearly neat vodka he had a girl with him called margie jolly bossy but horribly attractive bibi say shes very nice perdita leant against a pine tree is it serious she looking after leroy for luke so it must be perdita experienced a jab of jealousy so bad it winded her some of the younger players had started a food fight wham was pounding round the pine trees angel ducked to avoid a flying sausage roll you pick the wrong guy he said i did not snapped perdita red and i are just like that she held up two crossed fingers so it would seem said angel glancing across at red who was dancing under a gum tree with the vanity fair reporter the same height they touched in the most interesting places you picked the wrong wife said perdita from the nearby barn the occasional stamp or snort of the ponies could be heard redandsilver heartshaped balloons tied to each box bobbed up to the roof if someone cut the string your heart would float away like one of those balloons not yet angels face was in shadow i ave promises to keep and miles to go before i sleep oh for chrissake im sick of that bloody poem the inevitable polo dogs wandered around crunching bones and being tripped over and sworn at shark nelligans white bull terrier confined to his masters truck because he tended to kill other dogs leant genially out of the window his elbow resting on the ledge being fed pieces of meat and petted by passersby mixing herself another drink perdita couldnt remember when she had last eaten she could see juan coiled round a blonde to make up his days and avoid paying tax a reluctant victor had had to leave the party and fly out of palm beach before midnight leaving sharon to chat up the latest beefcake from brazil jesus was ringing england on sharons car telephone i weel play for you sir waterloo eef you pay me veector already offer me that much money and pay my airplane fare and a ouse no i dont need to breeng my wife you save on that is bibi coming perdita asked angel shes working said angel flatly dont drink too much perdita go ome before you do anything silly come and dance with me said perdita but at that moment innocenta emerged from the lilac shadows bringing a plate piled with lamb chops potato salad and barbecue sauce which she proceeded to share with angel red was necking openly as he danced now if she hadnt been scared of his temper perdita would have hurled the greasiest pork chop she could find at the girls gyrating blue suede bottom theyre called barbecues because you queue up to receive barbs she said to noone in particular as she finished her drink hows luke shark nelligan came up to her with a plate piled disgustingly high with food he was interested because he and luke both played back and would be competing for the same place in the us team particularly for the westchester which would mean serious money i hear his careers washed up and hal peters is paying alejandro a match he went on i want to get my hands on fantasma luke wont sell and hell recover said perdita filling her glass yet again shark grinned evilly im not sure hal will myrtle his ex is taking him to the cleaners and his new bimbos making so free with his amex hes praying for it to get stolen and lukes medical bills will be even more astronomical if they call in seth newcombe but hal must be insured said perdita anxiously sure he is said shark with his mouth full but hes overstretched hes the best car man in detroit but hes so off the wall he exported a thousand peters cheetahs to the uk last week with lefthand drive but lukell be all right wont he persisted perdita hes got bart to fall back on shark gave a piece of lamb to his slavering bull terrier perdita shook her head hes too proud and hes got a pretty sharp new girlfriend added shark spitefully who said perdita fishing though it hurt her margie someone shes a lawyer she wont let him starve as perdita turned away stricken angel emerged from the gloom with innocenta looking a lot less innocent red was still talking to his journalist lots of guys wont have sex the night before a big game red was saying caressingly but i always do and the following morning although i might try less hard one more drink thought perdita and ill make a scene and separate them she didnt think shed ever been more miserable in her life hi arent you perdita macleod said a soft voice a man with whiteblond hair was smiling down at her he was wearing a cream suit a buttoneddown pale blue shirt and a blue spotted tie he appeared mercifully civilized compared with all these polo hicks thought perdita he was nicelooking rather than handsome and had very light eyes in a beige face like rickys pony sinatra who are you she asked aggressively simpson hastings if perdita had been less drunk she would have heard warning bells simpson hastings appeared to know a lot about polo and particularly about her they say youre a phenomenon beyond genius not to my face they dont said perdita sulkily its a beautiful face thats your problem if you were butch and ugly they could slag you off for being almost a man they find your sex appeal disturbing not tonight they dont ive got as much appeal here as a mink coat at an animal rights meeting where did the skill come from dyour parents ride my mothers never been on a horse in her life and hamish simpson hastings did know a flattering amount about her swaying slightly perdita clung on to the truck hamish wasnt my father is that a fact simpson hastings didnt bat a palelashed eyelid he certainly didnt look like you then with the utmost gentleness who was i dont know to hell with everyone suddenly an ancient mariner compulsion to tell all swept over her my mother went to an orgy in the sixties given by her art master he was called jackie cosgrave everyone screwed everyone particularly my sodding mother she has no idea which one was my father difficult for you murmured simpson hastings without a trace of excitement hard to know who to relate to but he must have been a very good rider back in rutshire daisy had had a long day finishing off a painting which ricky said shed never get paid for of billy and janey lloydfoxes children as the twoyearold daughter had nearly smashed up rickys house on the first sitting while janey got happily plastered daisy had worked thereafter from photographs and had just painted billys late mongrel mavis as a dog cherub up in the sky as a background shed used the particularly tranquil view from rickys balustrade of perpendicular woods and jadegreen fields dotted with ponies grazing westward towards the setting sun not wanting to disturb ricky she slipped out of robinsgrove by a side door there was an air of tremendous bustle and excitement about the yard because practice chukkas were starting at the rutshire tomorrow she paused for a second to watch the twins mike waterlane and ricky working out fiendish strategies to fox the opposition the twins back from palm beach were dazzlingly blond and brown and shouting their heads off as usual despite the high spirits however theyd been training incredibly hard together noone was going to take the gold cup away from them this year it was a spellbinding evening two grey geese and a squad of pale yellow goslings broke the turquoise surface of the lake three days of rain after a spate of warm weather had brought out the white cherries and the bluebells in a sapphire mist on either side of the ride the poplars shiny acidgreen were wafting the scent of balsam down the valley crows nesting in rickys beeches had splattered the wild garlic leaves like milk of magnesia on green hangover tongues daisy had heard the cuckoo through the open window of her studio all day she felt quite faint with happiness ricky had become such a friend recently and her painting was going wonderfully perdita was due back in three weeks and surely couldnt sustain the feud for ever and daisy was expecting drew that evening by the law of sod if ever she glammed herself up and washed her hair drew had to back down at the last moment today shed chanced it and put on a dark green jersey hed bought her and her best jeans she was in luck for there outside the cottage was drews bmw splashing through the last twenty yards of watermeadow she clambered over rickys padlocked gate raced up the path then gave a gasp of disappointment for outside the door was not drew but a glamorous if slightly grubbylooking blonde wearing rather too much eye makeup for daytime a creased denim suit and scuffed black shoes with the steel high heels escaping from the leather with her was a man carrying a camera with the leering face of a drunken vulture and snowdrifts of scurf on the shoulders of his shiny grey suit mrs macleod said the girl as though she was about to sell daisy insurance ethel for once bristled and started to growl were from the scorpion the girl went on can we have a word what about stammered daisy itd be easier inside daisy opened the front door dont you ever lock up asked the girl nothing to steal said daisy look if its about red and perdita ive got nothing to say well it is the girl dumped her bag on the kitchen table perdita told simpson hastings in florida yesterday that shed no idea who her father was oh no daisy licked her lips eyes darting from the girl to the man perditas father was killed in a car crash he never knew i was pregnant thats not what perdita told simpson interrupted the girl cosily she opened her notebook but made no notes because a tiny tape recorder was rotating in the breast pocket of her denim suit what a nice kitchen i love all the flowers perdita said you went to a party in and everyone got stoned and screwed each other and you got pregnant as a result she couldnt have said that mumbled daisy groping for the kettle switch dyou want to read the exact words the girl produced a rather crumpled newspaper proof from her bag it smelt of femme daisy was too shocked to take much in her legs wouldnt stop trembling i loathe my mother she read she must have been a tart to sleep with all those men she claims she was stoned but thats her story shes lied to me for years that my father was killed in a car crash ethel having climbed heavily on to the kitchen table was now licking the blondes face dont be disloyal ethel said daisy in a high unnatural voice but i love dogs protested the blonde dogs get on with dogs i suppose said daisy sorry that was frightfully rude i cant read any more racing upstairs to the loo she retched and retched until she thought she would bring up her hammering heart then she cleaned her teeth and wiped her face closing her eyes desperately trying to still the trembling as she returned to the kitchen the blonde said we thought wed give you a chance to put your point of view ive nothing to say oh poor violet and eddie your kids said the blonde consulting an earlier page in her notebook theyre at boarding school arent they lets all have that cup of tea daisy filled the kettle and switched on the gas but didnt light it after a couple of seconds the blonde leapt forward with her lighter dont want to blow ourselves up wed make it very worth your while you could do with a new washingup machine and a lovely conservatory out into the garden and a new car that volkswagen is on its last legs and we could help with the school fees and a really nice holiday so you could escape from all this then as daisy looked at her uncomprehendingly were talking five or six figures its a lovely car said daisy thinking that drew had given it to her it goes perfectly well perdita says a man called jackie cosgrave hosted the orgy the blonde was getting down mugs and the tea caddy is he still around no said daisy in terror i havent seen him since that winter a flash lit up the room youre awfully young to have a twentyyearold daughter leered the photographer i was only seventeen sobbed daisy please dont take pictures i dont remember anyone at the party i was so drunk but that doesnt make it any better please go away they all jumped as the kettle whistled and the telephone rang it was drew thank christ ive got you i wish youd stop working up at rickys the scorpion are here gasped daisy perditas told them about the orgy and that she hasnt a clue who her father is fucking bitch said drew absolutely appalled oh my poor darling dont say anything to them theyre in the house ill come straight over oh please then after the first blessed relief no you mustnt it isnt safe sukey the children she stopped realizing shed probably said too much ill ring ricky said drew look i love you itll be ok dont worry the flash bulbs were going like mad gainsborough crashed fatly in through the cat door then crashed out again in dismay have you got any photographs of yourself when you were seventeen asked the blonde opening a drawer get out shrieked daisy hard for perdita not having a father no wonder shes screwed up said the blonde losing some of her cosiness kinta had never been encouraged to run away before but as ricky alerted by drews telephone call picked up his whip the mare thundering down the valley crushing cowslips and cuckoo flowers jumping the bustling stream as it twisted and turned and sending up twelve feet of spray frightened even herself hearing a thud of hooves daisy glanced out of the window for a second she thought ricky was going to jump the gate the skid marks were six feet long after kinta jammed on her brakes next minute her reins had been knotted to the bars and ricky had vaulted over the gate as he came through the door his face jeans and check shirt were splashed with mud and he was so angry that at first he couldnt get any words out instinctively the blondes hand rose to lift her tousled hair and wipe away the shine beneath her eyes and on the sides of her nose ricky crossed the room and put his arms round daisy its all right pet hullo ricky said the blonde whose mouth was watering remember me she waved her hand in front of his eyes to break up his blank stare with a shudder of disgust ricky recognized the author of ruperts memoirs its you beattie he said icily i might have guessed it been cheering daisy up since she became your tenant have you mocked beattie all the world loves a landlord and all no i have bloody not snapped ricky now beat it perdita worked for you and had a crush on you under rickys ferocious glare beattie started backing towards the door she says all she wants to do is find her real father and experience some real love and understanding bullshit thundered ricky shes had a bloody sight too much love and understanding perdita is basically a good child whos fallen among thieves do i have to throw you out you wouldnt dare said beattie in excitement then screamed as ricky opened the window gathered her up and threw her out kicking and struggling into a flowerbed sorry about your wallflowers he added to daisy as two seconds later the photographer and his expensive camera followed suit you bastard yelled beattie picking herself out of a rose bush these tights are dior and new on ill get you for assault but as ricky went out of the front door in pursuit they jumped into their bmw and drove furiously away ricky turned back to daisy her eyes were huge and staring she was still shaking uncontrollably i never knew perdita hated me that much she whispered through white lips and what am i going to do about violet and eddie ricky went to the cupboard and finding an inch of vodka in a halfbottle tipped it into a glass and topped it up with orange juice get that down you then ill drive you over to tell them but its the beginning of the season youve got so much on it isnt fair you should be dragged in im in already dont imagine beattiell forget her hurt pride and her laddered tights in a hurry they didnt talk much as they drove through the emergent spring thirty miles to violets school and then another twenty miles on to eddies in her numbed state daisy wondered if ricky was working out polo plays when he met violets headmistress his coolness and detachment seemed to diffuse her disapproval she was obviously captivated by his looks violet went scarlet when daisy stumbled out with the truth then she put her arms round her mother perditas a bitch but shes so off the wall at the moment and shed probably just had a row with red you were younger than her when it happened well look after you eddies headmaster a breezy bearded homosexual couldnt look daisy in the eye but his voice became much warmer when he spoke to ricky eddie seemed outwardly unfazed perditas father might be a pop star then can i come home with you weve got a history exam tomorrow and i havent revised come home at the weekend said ricky well shoot clays ill lend you a rod and you can fish in the lake drew rang up when they got back to rickys house he was forced to be very matter of fact but daisy could tell he was worried sick ill come over and see ricky tomorrow then with an endearing stab of jealousy its a good idea for you to stay there tonight hell protect you from the press but dont fall in love with him of course i wont stammered daisy never had she missed drew more but ricky was angelic he gave her two sleeping pills left over from the ones prescribed for him when will died and had left orders despite the warmth of the evening for one of the grooms to light a fire in the spare room you said one very important thing to me about wills death he told her that night we had dinner together that id got to learn to forgive myself youve got to do the same but however angelic ricky was nothing prepared daisy for the horror of the scorpion next day gang bang thank you mum said huge frontpage headlines then beneath a ravishing tremulously tearful picture of perdita a caption please find my real dad pleads perdita everyone had mum that night inside under a headline reds raver tells all they had printed the full interview with perdita saying how much she detested her mother for cheating her out of a father even worse they had somehow got hold of a ravishing photograph of a seventeenyearold daisy with a sixties fringe long straight hair and huge eyes and superimposed it on an incredibly voluptuous naked page three body if you recognize this girl you may be perditas dad said the caption over the page under another headline caring ricky in mercy dash the copy began funloving daisy was hiding out yesterday with her landlord ace polo player ricky francelynch family motto never surrender caring ricky left his tenbedroom georgian home and galloped through his acre estate on a polo pony to stand by his lovely tenant known as el orgulloso for his snooty manner ricky once employed perdita as his groom perdita has got into bad company claims ricky daisy has been a very supportive mother poor old daisy said bas baddingham to rupert gosh she was pretty in those days taking the scorpion from him rupert examined the photographs pretty now christ beatties excelled herself this time at least it might make ricky finally get his act together where daisy is concerned didnt we used to know a creep called cosgrave asked bas used to give wild parties in the sixties everyone gave wild parties in the sixties said rupert jackie cosgrave hadnt prospered in later life teaching art bored him his waist had thickened his yellow hair turned white his white teeth yellow his mouth petulant women were no longer so keen to buy his paintings nor girl students to sleep with him oh mr cosgrave its all about you in the scorpion said the art college cleaner as she swept up charcoal paintstained rags old tubes of paint and scraps of newspaper picking up the scorpion jackie looked long and hard at daisy he remembered her and after wracking his brains he remembered the party in those days when he had beauty and could get drugs the world was his friend returning to his flat he took down his diary for and turned to february which hed been wise enough to illustrate with photographs the central heating had been turned up to tropical that night hed taken a lot of photographs and written down the names of all the people whod been at the orgy studying perditas face the answer was cut and dried picking up the telephone he rang the scorpion news desk ill tell you who perditas father is but its going to cost you rupert campbellblack was so much in love with his wife that he most uncharacteristically agreed to undergo a solo grilling on whether he was a suitable person to adopt a baby mrs paget who interviewed him had already been charmed by taggie last week in her thirties with a brood as she called it of her own mrs paget had the kindly but patronizing air of one who works for nothing for those less fortunate she reminded rupert of a more rounded prettier sukey benedict in the old days for the hell of it he would have made a pass at her but now he had no need of the divide of the gleaming mahogany table nor the chaperonage of hundreds of babies who had been successfully adopted into loving homes whose photographs gazed down from the dark red wallpaper tabitha his daughter was the only baby rupert had ever liked but he would have been happy to adopt a chimpanzee for taggies sake and was trying not to lose his temper with this earnest probing woman when you first saw mrs campbellblack was it love at first sight no lust drawled rupert then added hastily but it would have been the reaction of any man shes very pretty but i was involved with someone else at the time and you lead a full sex life full of taggie thought rupert im afraid im not prepared to discuss our sex life with anyone he said coldly the reason she cant have children has nothing to do with sex mrs paget fingered her pearls youve only been married seventeen months hardly long enough for us to place one of our very special babies with you with the pill the abortion law and girls keeping their babies children to adopt are like gold dust today and you are in a catch she brought out the expression to show she read youre forty at the end of this year which makes you too old to adopt rupert gritted his teeth i know that and we have couples whove been on our waitinglist for years you wouldnt consider an older child handicapped perhaps or coloured im sure mrs campbellblack has the necessary patience and understanding well i dont said rupert truthfully we want a baby beggars cant be choosers said mrs paget almost archly the stupid bitch is trying to rile me thought rupert if i lose my temper shell mark me down as a babybasher hardly a beggar he snapped it was all a ghastly game in his inside pocket was a cheque for a quarter of a million pounds which would buy a house in battersea for the society to house their unmarried mothers the donation would be anonymous so the press would never find out and rupert and taggie would jump the queue are you sure you personally want to adopt and it wouldnt be better for mrs campbellblack to concentrate on being a mother to your own children im sure they need a stable background plenty of stables already at penscombe said rupert idly theres no need to be flippant couples who lose a baby often try to adopt one immediately to fill the aching void but its the wrong motive works perfectly well with puppies said rupert mr campbellblack mrs pagets midnightblue cashmere bosom swelled i dont like your attitude we have to ensure youd make a suitable father your track record isnt exactly oh for christs sake ask my own children getting to his feet rupert walked over to the window outside under a colonnade of burgeoning plane trees a slim girl in jeans was pushing a pram and gabbling happy nonsense to the baby inside hed be reduced to kidnapping soon youre supposed to be a christian organization he went on isnt there something in the bible about more rejoicing in heaven over one lost sheep calm down said mrs paget thinking how frightfully attractive he was she wanted the money for the unmarried mothers house very badly the committee would regard it as a tremendous coup and had already earmarked an adorable irish baby for rupert and taggie but she felt he ought to be made to sweat a little longer i understand she went on soothingly you must be feeling very threatened it happens to lots of middleaged men who marry very young wives and worry not only about satisfying them sexually but keeping them amused a baby seems the perfect answer ruperts jaw dropped there was an imperious knock on the door im interviewing miss roach cried mrs paget i think you should see this said miss roach who looked more like a cod barging in she thrust a copy of the evening scorpion in front of mrs paget whose pale pink wildrose complexion slowly turned the dark crimson of an ena harkness as she read im afraid theres not an adoption society in the country wholl touch you now she said handing rupert the paper on the front page were two huge photographs of perdita and rupert at eighteen both in profile they were incriminatingly identical snap said the huge headline rupert was as pale as the liliesofthevalley on the table as he turned to the centre pages where jackie cosgraves statement was quoted in full there were seven men at the sidney street orgy they included rock star bob riley and his lead guitarist harry nelson actor johnny friedlander the hon basil baddingham a polo player showjumpers rupert campbellblack and billy lloydfoxe and myself at eighteen rupert was an officer in an exclusive cavalry regiment the blues and was home on leave from cyprus he was very brown and so beautiful noone could take their eyes off him being in the forces he was also the only one with short hair rupert was very much taken with daisy and being very fit made love to her most of the night we all had bets how long he could keep going the rest of us were too stoned to do very much though we all had a go at her i remember because she was so tasty jackie cosgrave had always been disgusting thought rupert irrationally like daisy two days before he couldnt read any more inside were fuzzy blownup snapshots including one of daisy and rupert both naked in one he was smiling down at her and stroking her left breast in another he was kissing her passionately and his left hand had disappeared below the cropping of the photograph there were also pictures of everyone else at the orgy and even more horrible on the next page of eddie violet marcus and tabitha with a caption youre halfbrothers and sisters now jesus exploded rupert crumpling up the paper and throwing it in the corner then turning to mrs paget and you believe this junk it seems conclusive she stammered you could be twins im going to get the highest damages in history can i use your telephone mrs paget nodded after the initial rage she told miss roach later he was terrifying in his calmness it was a good thing the helicopter knew its own way back to penscombe because rupert was totally unaware of flying it as towns motorways and the winding thames gave way to acidgreen woods emerald fields and tawny villages he churned with rage perdita was responsible for taggie losing their own child and now an adopted baby and god knows what lasting damage shed done to his children just as they were getting over the devastating revelations of his memoirs eighteen months ago he couldnt see the gravel outside his house for reporters and cameramen and took a savage pleasure in sending them scurrying for their lives as he leapt out they all swarmed back hello rupe talk about gaining a daughter said the sun shes a chip off the old block where horses are concerned said the mirror you going to teach her to showjump we heard you were trying to adopt a baby what chances of that now asked the scorpion are you going to recognize paternity asked itn as they ringed him ravenous for information there was something of the cornered maddened bull about rupert then with his phenomenal strength he shoved them out of the way and sending the scorpion and the star flying charged the front door which opened like a trap door to admit him then slammed against their frenzied hammering fists frantically taggie and rupert clung to each other she tried to smile but she was deathly pale and her eyes were redrimmed you poor poor thing its so horrible for you im so desperately sorry as he held her rupert felt comfort flowing back into his body like a transfusion after a massive loss of blood please dont leave me i can face anything as long as ive got you id never leave you said taggie appalled i love you anyway it all happened years ago long before i met you it could have been any of the other guys at the party they can make anyone look like anyone in photographs course they can what did they say at the adoption society she was trying to control her longing rupert shook his head since they married there had only been truth between them im afraid theyre not going to give us a baby but well get one from somewhere its ok weve still got tabitha and marcus and the dogs her voice faltered and perdita she was about to say ruperts ability to have children seemed so at odds with her own recently enforced infertility the reporters stepped up the hammering on the door how could perdita have done it she said in bewilderment to poor daisy as well i dont give a fuck about daisy youre the only thing i care about mrs bodkin ruperts ancient housekeeper whod seen endless dramas in her time came into the hall thank god he had miss taggie seeing them in each others arms she coughed its tabitha on the private line mr campbellblack rupert picked up the telephone i was just going to ring you darling im terribly sorry dyou want to come over yes please said tabitha your new intermediate daughter wont take all our money will she her shrill voice suddenly broke you wont love her more than me will you im bloody well going to have it out with daisy snarled rupert as he came off the telephone ten minutes later his helicopter landed on rickys front lawn and this time the press fell back scalded by the white heat of his rage he found daisy in rickys kitchen mindlessly making a shepherds pie for supper not because ricky wanted it but to give herself something to do a smell of frying onion garlic peppers and minced lamb drifted through the house ricky had pulled down the blue and white striped blinds so the hovering press couldnt see in for a second rupert and daisy stared at each other both unable not to think of the night they had spent together how could i thought rupert daisy looked utterly wretched her red eyes vanished beneath red swollen lids as though theyd been stung by ants her face blotchy from crying an old grey sweater of rickys couldnt disguise the weight that had dropped off her oh rupert im so sorry all daisy could think of was how incredible that such an attractive man should once have screwed her all those years ago so you fucking should be rupert hurled his fury like acid in her face why the hell didnt you have an abortion i didnt have the money you cant prove perditas my child bas has got black eyes just like hers she could have inherited her riding skills from him or billy bob riley was almost an albino im not going to say shes yours whispered daisy i just said i was drunk and cant remember anyone there its so awful you and taggie have been so sweet to me perditas completely fucked up taggies chances of having or adopting a baby and what about the effect on tab and marcus god im going to sue her into the next world ill ruin her if it kills me daisy started to cry and throw whole carrots into the frantically spitting onions and mince its burning lovie ricky crossed the room and turned off the gas lets leave it and have a drink as daisy collapsed on to a kitchen chair with her face in her hands the twins bounded in hello daddy said dommie grinning at rupert orgy porgy pudding and pie kissed the girls and made them pregnant said seb christ im starving grabbing a spoon he started eating the mince out of the frying pan what i feel most sorry for you about rupert is having that frightful little shit red alderton as a soninlaw its not funny shouted rupert well its not daisys fault shouted back ricky getting a bottle out of the cupboard splashing whisky into four glasses and giving one to daisy i dont want a drink said rupert all the more for me said dommie tipping ruperts share into his glass are these for wayne and kinta he picked the whole carrots out of the frying pan i said its not daisys fault repeated ricky icily bloody is said rupert fucking hippie bringing up her fucking children by dr spock rules letting them run wild and everything hang out if she hadnt spoilt perdita rotten none of this would have happened balls yelled ricky perdita just happens to have inherited your sodding awful nature who tried to bail you out of prison and appealed against your conviction demanded rupert in outrage below the belt said seb so was ruperts dick giggled dommie you shouldnt go round screwing girls when theyre stoned this isnt getting anyone anywhere said ricky are you going to admit paternity or not like hell i am id rather father a mamba with red geeing her up she may easily take you to court said seb let her said rupert flatly after what shes done to my children and taggie twice ill bury her ruperts children were not the only ones affected violet was devastated particularly when her boyfriends parents suddenly withdrew a longstanding invitation to spend a weekend at their house at eddies prep school the rest of his form trooped down to the kitchen and read the cooks copy of the scorpion common entrance common entrance chanted blairharrison the most evil boy in the class your mother seems to have a communal entrance and eddie had hit blairharrison across the classroom breaking two of his flawless front teeth one of dancers minders had brought eddie back to robinsgrove where he had fished and shot clays and apparently happily watched television but after midnight long after daisy had been knocked out by one of rickys pills ricky found eddie sobbing his heart out how could mum let all those blokes stick it in her it wasnt her fault said ricky someone got her drunk and drugged her eddie clenched his fists im going to kill perdita youre not the only one said ricky grimly he wanted nothing more than to concentrate on his polo his house had been besieged by press for fortyeight hours and when he went to the rutshire to play practice chukkas the following day they were ten deep round the clubhouse waiting for him for once the expletives were worse off the field than on the twins losing their tempers had started hitting balls at the reporters ankles and the police had been called miss lodsworth had for once been on apocalypses side and had driven the times cameraman off with her shooting stick decorum the bull terrier had bitten both the scorpion and the guardian ironically ricky had become the hero of the press the cameraman with beattie johnson had taken a photograph of ricky throwing beattie out of the window and sold it to the sun whod put it on their front page over in palm beach perdita was on the rack electric gates and rottweilers kept out the press but not the feelings of utter horror at what shed unearthed talk about pandoras boxing ring still smarting with rejection that rupert had turned her down so summarily on finding her in his bed she had been plagued since then by embarrassingly erotic dreams about him but now the scalding hot lava of humiliation was pouring over her as she realized shed tried to bed her own father red the unpredictable however was absolutely delighted any novelty and strangeness excited him what a good thing you didnt get him into bed in florida he said gleefully hed probably have negated the pill and impregnated you dont be disgusting screamed perdita if it hadnt been for you id never have tried to pull him that night if you hadnt been getting off with that girl from vanity fair id never have got pissed and spilled the beans to simpson hastings it was a further source of irritation that noone believed she hadnt taken a massive payoff from the scorpion red caught the short back ends of her hair yanking her head back his eyes blazing with desire ruperts megabucks just think what we can screw him for we cant prove hes my father havent you ever heard of genetic engineering i wonder if my mother will feel differently now she knows youve got some good blood letting go of her hair he began to stroke the back of her neck it was hopeless he just had to touch her to make her dripping be nice to me red i need you so badly dont leave me red pushed her back on to the press clippings which littered his dark blue triple bed and with one practised hand undid the top button of her jeans im not quitting baby youre just getting interesting afterwards having plugged her between the legs with a handful of scrumpled press clippings red fell asleep feeling hopelessly twitchy and in need of comfort perdita rang luke at the hospital only to learn that he had discharged himself that afternoon so deep was her selfpreoccupation that she didnt even question the utter insanity of such an action and promptly telephoned him at his barn oh luke ive done such a terrible thing i guess you have said luke and hung up then turning back to margie that was perdita i cant handle her at the moment fantasma and leroy delirious to have him home had followed him into the tack room after the first ecstatic welcome both seemed to sense how excruciatingly painful his hand was and just wanted to be near him as quietly as possible leroy sat on his feet to stop him ever going away again fantasma rested her pink nose on his good shoulder blowing adoringly down his neck on the tackroom wall was a photograph of her racing round the paddock without saddle or bridle as white and as swift and as beautiful as summer lightning luke took a slug of the quadruple brandy margie had just given him i gotta sell her he said he had learnt that afternoon that hal peters had been voted off his own board and gone spectacularly bellyup not only had he not paid lukes salary since january or for the last halfdozen horses luke had bought for him but far far worse he had let lukes medical insurance lapse so there would be massive hospital bills to be paid that was why despite doctors and sobbing nurses practically restraining him with a straitjacket luke had walked out of hospital that afternoon youve got to sue implored margie ill defend you for free luke shook his head he hasnt got any money to pay me then go to your father hes in enough shit as it is said luke wearily you bloody stubborn taurean stormed margie lend him fantasma lend him all your ponies if hes that anxious to smash ricky this summer hell pay anything theres no way i could ever pay my medical bills and pay him back his hand was agonizingly painful and he was slowly coming to terms with the fact that he might never play polo again the only honourable way he could pay his debts and see the grooms right was to sell the ponies at the end of april eightyfive suitcases fiftyfive polo ponies sixteen grooms a mountain of tack and polo sticks and a fleet of maids and secretaries were flown in a special alderton jumbo over to england a week later when everything had been unpacked and made ready for them in barts ravishing sussex house chessie bart red perdita and angel flew over in barts new private jet the alderton quicksilver specially designed to dispel rumours that alderton airways were going bellyup it crossed the atlantic in three hours and was as gleamingly silver as its name bart was hoping to raise the money in europe to market it next year inside the quicksilver the atmosphere was as highly charged as usual red failing to hide his dislike of his stepmother had taken perdita into one of the back bedrooms chessie drank a whole bottle of champagne because grace only drank water on flights and because she was still furious with ricky for giving such public sanctuary to perditas frumpy mother bart put aside the balance sheets he ought to be digesting before his meeting with european electronics tomorrow and read a computer printout on his ponies perdita having stuffed her face with caviar was now lying postmultiorgasmic in reds arms and thinking this really was the life she and red had just returned from four magic days in hawaii where his sexual inventiveness had overwhelmed her on the rupert front things had gone unnaturally quiet with the press switching their attention to a royal scandal and the lawyers locked behind closed doors was rupert going to sue was perdita going to push for recognition and a massive settlement it was a war of nerves she was apprehensive about her reception in england sooner or later shed have to bump into ricky her mother and probably rupert but she felt insulated by reds love if she was going to be the new mrs alderton what did it matter if she was née campbellblack angel sat by himself gazing bleakly out of the window at a dazzling dreamtopping of cloud three hours was too short a time to adjust to entering loathsome british territory awaiting him would be a posse of apoplectic colonels and brigadiers utterly incensed that bart had pulled a fast one and circumnavigated the ban angel had also suffered a lot of flak from the other argentine players particularly alejandro juan and miguel who spoke enviously of the lack of pressure in england the hospitality the beautiful available girls the freezingcold swimmingpools theyd been chucked into by firebreathing fathers and the utterly revolting food you avent died until you ave eenglish cabbage said alejandro well send you a food parcel every week and a suitcase full of condoms sighed juan how can i pull girls angel had grumbled when my fatherinlaw wants me in bed by ten every night and if grace comes over i might as well be gelded but all this was irrelevant when angels sole reason for going to england was revenge his temper was not improved by the latest edition of international polo where among the glamorous photographs of massive silver cups grooved muscular arms flashing teeth beneath ebony moustaches and ponies with glueddown ears and rolling eyes was a fourpage feature on drew benedict the text was printed in four languages so angel was able to read in french italian spanish and english that drew hero of the falklands was the rock on which both the kaputnik tigers and the british team were built there were photographs of him outside his beautiful house flanked by a horseylooking wife and two expressionless wellbehaved children and in his library with a jack russell on his knee shivering with hatred angel examined the handsome belligerent unsmiling face a boxer crossed with a labrador even the comparative shortness of drews legs didnt comfort him angels grandmother who lived in the plaza had always claimed that men with short legs were brilliant in bed getting out a pentel angel drew in a moustache and some shirley temple curls but the blue eyes were still cool and appraising so angel made one of them squint then cursed himself for his childishness anyway how could he concentrate on his mission of vengeance when his marriage was in injury time the publicity handout was that bibi was staying in america to mind the shop while bart took virtually three months off and that she would fly over on the quicksilver at weekends in fact angel was doubtful if shed turn up at all the row had started innocently enough left on his own so much angel had run up more gambling debts aware that their anniversary was coming up strapped for cash he had taken a modelling job so he could buy her a present with his own money bibi growing increasingly suspicious had followed him seen him arrive at a house kiss a beautiful model who had arrived at the same time and go inside with her instead of following him where she would have found cameras lights and silver umbrellas bibi had gone home in floods confronted angel had blurted out the truth after a blazing row refusing to believe him bibi had stormed round to the agency who confirmed angels story mortified bibi had flown home early from the office in an alderton helicopter which was an anniversary present for him as she walked into the house with her arms full of flowers however angel had walked out of the bedroom with a towel wrapped round his waist a second later he was followed by innocenta in bibis silk dressing gown whats that scrubber got to offer that i havent bibi screamed later shes got time said angel with chilling accuracy in the cold war that ensued angel and bibi had lain as far apart as possible on the cliff edges of their double bed longing for the other to weaken and stretch out a hand and a stonyfaced monosyllabic bibi had come home from the office each night and ostentatiously cooked angels dinner bibi only say seven word to me this week angel had grumbled to red as they boarded the plane dinner dinner dinner dinner dinner dinner dinner why doesnt she dispense with all the chitchat said red grinning and buy a gong as he flipped sullenly through international polo angel noticed that all the girls were far more beautiful than bibi why the hell did he feel so miserable three weeks later daisy macleod travelling up to paddington by train took the same photograph of drew out of her bag because of the press hanging around she hadnt seen him since the scorpion revelations and now they were meeting at sukeys house off kensington church street daisy was incredibly twitchy because violet was also in london on a school trip visiting the impressionists at the tate and because eddie had rung up from school that morning first the bad news mum i failed common entrance but now the good news every single other boy in the school passed daisy was overwhelmed with love for his philosophical stoicism but she knew he was desperately low and felt even worse because she was sure hed only ploughed the exam because of the scorpion as the train got in at eleventhirty and she wasnt meeting drew until twelve fortyfive she had time to kill shed cleaned her teeth on the train carefully not swallowing the nondrinking water and then again in the ladies at paddington and again in harrods where shed also covered herself in je reviens from the scent counter still with time to kill she hung around a secondhand book shop near drews house and bought him a book called the art of lunging then went to an offlicence and bought him a bottle of moët in return for all the bottles hed given her the man behind the counter almost asphyxiated by wafts of je reviens and colgate asked with a leer if daisyd like it readychilled how lovely daisy blushed i didnt know you could buy it like that we sell a lot said the man admiring daisys bosom in her applegreen tshirt people like to take a bottle in the park it was still only twelveforty sweating with nerves daisy went into a supermarket and checked her face by the dogfood counter glancing up she saw herself on the monitor she supposed it was one way of getting on television and bought a box of bonios for ethel turning into drews street grateful for the shade of the plane trees daisy walked down the road until she came to number fifteen drews blue bmw wasnt outside across the road a pretty girl holding an estate agents handout stared at daisy intently perhaps she was sukeys sister walking to the end of the road daisy turned round and walked back steeling herself ignoring the girl still waiting opposite daisy marched up the path pausing to powder her nose but before she could ring the door bell the door had opened and a voice said you look fine and drew had pulled her in to the hall he was wearing a red and white striped shirt which brought out the red of his complexion he looked less glamorous than his photograph and as he kissed her he tasted of fish just for a second daisy wondered why shed wasted so many sleepless nights on him following him into the kitchen she saw the remains of a smoked salmon sandwich and a halfdrunk glass of champagne im always far too excited to eat anything before he arrives she thought as she handed him a carrier bag bonios thats very kind said drew looking inside oh help ive given you the wrong bag said daisy shoving the bookshop and offlicence bags at him thats sweet thank you said drew filling a glass for her from the bottle already opened and taking another bite of his sandwich do you want anything to eat daisy shook her head poor baby im sorry youve had such a bloody time but you look great you must have lost ten pounds but not off your tits thank god daisy went to the window and gazed at sukeys back garden which was a rather uncharacteristic riot of roses honeysuckle and jasmine how lovely she sighed sukey is clever at some things said drew running a hand up her backbone and unhooking her bra as his hands gathered up her breasts and she collapsed against him she could hear the sound of typing next door and a faint hum of traffic lets go to bed said drew it was lovely you won yesterday said daisy and scored most of the goals as he followed her upstairs drews hands slid slowly up her legs and between her thighs these are the only goal posts i want to get between on the chest of drawers in his dressing room were an engagement photograph of a mistily glamorous sukey in pearls and a strapless dress silverbacked brushes penhaligons english fern and a panama with a household division ribbon thrown over an armchair were a dinner jacket a crumpled evening shirt a black tie and a pile of kaputnik tiger shirts all the detritus of drews other life pulling off her tshirt bra and pants but leaving her trailing turquoise skirt he pushed her back on the narrow single bed and burying his face in her breasts murmured you are so comfortable mrs macleod im sure someone comes along and plumps up your body like sukeys cushions every halfhour soon his tongue was wandering lazily through the heather of her pubic hair to find the cairn of her clitoris come inside me please said daisy worried that she was too tense to come and that he might be bored dont be silly mumbled drew ive waited five weeks for this you can wait five minutes longer oh that tongue daisy squirmed in ecstasy at last the waves were slowly lapping against the shore then they were inside her seeping and sweeping over her she was a minipacific she gave a gasp moaned and floated away on a lilo of pleasure oh thank you thank you i love you i love you i cant help it now its my turn said drew i wont be able to last long that was bliss he said as he rolled off her but next time cut your fingernails im sorry said daisy humbly im not its always magic with you my love ive got you a present i bought it for easter but your bloody daughter and the scorpion got in the way daisy opened the red leather box and gave a gasp on the white satin lay a brooch with a topaz centre ringed by diamond petals its a daisy cried daisy ecstatically its the loveliest thing ive ever seen where did you find it i had it made drew kissed her shoulder as an expression of my great fondness and regard for you you will notice there are nine petals so if you ever play loves me loves me not with it itll always come out loves me but you shouldnt gabbled daisy i mean its too much it isnt real said drew of course it is i dont like fake jewels or fake orgasms we are going to get ourselves organized and im going to see a lot more of you in the future daisy had first bath and watched him having the second one are you coming to guards on thursday he asked the kaputnik tigers were meeting the flyers in the semifinal of the queens cup i dont know said daisy id love to watch you and perdita but rupertll probably be there her voice trailed away have you seen her no said drew gosh he washed well really scrubbing his neck arms and legs and between his toes getting rid of every trace of her before he saw sukey weak with love fingering her brooch which shed pinned to her tshirt she longed to touch his cock and make him come again but i gather shes not playing very well drew went on im told bart gees her up and red and angel are far too selfish to give her any passes angels supposed to be terribly good said daisy bloody prima donna evidently said drew manages to keep his absolute loathing of the brits just within legal bounds i wrote to her said daisy only last week she hasnt answered you mustnt said drew rearing out of the bath and grabbing a towel you must back off let her come to you thats what ricky says drew looked up sharply youre seeing too much of ricky only to listen hes far too preoccupied with bumping into chessie and burying bart are you going anywhere nice she asked as she watched drew brushing dog hairs off his dinner jacket it was so hard to draw a fine balance between probing and sympathetic interest lady sharons giving one of her little dinner parties you should see their new house in eaton square what a pity you didnt get the commission to paint all victors and sharons ancestors greatgreatgreat auntie tracey who came over with the vaykings and huge tayger heads shot by victors greatgrandfather in india which were bought at phillips last week on every wall and ill have to sit on sharons right lucky sharon said daisy wistfully unlucky me said drew then suddenly businesslike you go out first darling we dont want anyone seeing us together daisy had no intention of going to the semifinal between the flyers and the tigers she had urgent commissions to finish and had even refused a lift to the guards club with ricky and the twins who wanted to watch the teams one of which theyd be playing in sundays final but suddenly a longing to see drew and perdita overwhelmed her and she found herself driving her ancient volkswagen so fast up the m that it overheated she had purposely not changed out of her torn jeans and old blue denim shirt and wore dark glasses and her hair tied back in the hope that noone would recognize the scorpion trollop also to discourage herself from going anywhere near the pony lines she couldnt bear drew to see her looking so scruffy but again such was the magnet of her longing that ten minutes before throwin she found herself passing the hospitality tents going up for sundays final and there were the tigers grooms in their blackandorange shirts frantically tacking up ponies and screwing studs into their shoes then daisys heart stopped for there was drew looking almost willowy beside the hulking shark nelligan but towering over fat little victor and the brazilian ringer they all had their heads together as drew in his soft voice urged them on to annihilate the flyers and oh god there was ricky shed specifically told him she didnt want to come to the match moving past splendidly glossy ponies who nervous before a game were stamping their feet and flattening their ears at one another daisy came to even more splendid and glossier ponies and it seemed as though the sky had been pulled down so many grooms were tearing round in pale blue flyers tshirts there was bart leaning against an iron rail yelling into his telephone because he was having trouble getting through to johannesburg while a groom did up his kneepads there was red smoking a black sobranie being gazed at by groupies heavens he was beautiful but daisy didnt like the way he was idly chatting up a leggy blonde who was clutching a king charles spaniel puppy whose ears were as red as his hair by deduction the other player in the skyblue shirt must be angel he was thinner than daisy expected and with his weary haunted heavylidded eyes hollowed cheeks damp tendrilled hair and elegance reminded her of mantegnas john the baptist his hand shook as he lit one cigarette from another and although it was a chill windy day and unlike bart and red he wasnt wearing a jersey under his shirt he was absolutely pouring with sweat the poor boy obviously suffered from appalling prematch nerves daisy who was shaking as much as angel couldnt see perdita anywhere but suddenly she heard a joyful rumbling whicker and felt a gentle nudge in her back jumping round she discovered little tero whom shed so often plied with toast and marmite when shed wintered in rickys field unbelievably touched to be remembered daisy hugged the equally enchanted pony the flyers groom who was giving teros oystergrey coat a last polish looked up in amazement thats really weird shes headshy with everyone but perdita im perditas mother stammered daisy the girls mouth formed a perfect o then there was a frantic clicking of cameras a surging forward of the crowd and an even deeper whicker of joy from tero for christs sake said a familiar voice furiously reds been chatting up that blonde all lunch is he deliberately trying to screw up my game those bandages are too tight do them again and why the hell have you put spotty in a pelham i told you he went better in a barry gag jesus cant you concentrate for five minutes can we have a word perdita said the sun ingratiatingly no you fucking cant and certainly not before a match daisys first impression was how like rupert perdita had become the haughty deadpan face with its short streaked hair betrayed none of her rage and panic only the quivering tension of her slender boyish body gave her away knowing how nervous she was daisys one thought was to comfort her darling i just wanted to wish you luck perdita swung round her face ashen her eyes glittering like tourmalines her animosity as blasting as nerve gas luck is the last thing youve ever brought me just fuck off perdita reproved the groom shocked you keep out of it whats she done but screw up my life back off she spat at daisy dont come crawling under my feet youll get stamped on stumbling away tears pouring under her dark glasses daisy was nearly run over by shark nelligans groom taking a pony down to the pitch ricky whod been only halflistening to bobby ferraro and ronnie ferguson because he was looking all the time for chessie suddenly saw daisy backing away from perdita as though shed had acid thrown in her face and turned to seb and dommie whod just come back from ringing their bookmaker look after daisy both of you take her up in the stands and buy her a bloody big drink perditas just put the boot in in a trice the twins had caught up with her daisee daisee give me your answer do sang seb putting an arm round daisys shoulders im half crazy all for the love of you sang dommie putting an arm round her waist i havent got a handkerchief sobbed daisy diving into the mens changing room seb came out with a roll of blue andrex here you are he said pulling out at least eight feet and handing it to daisy were going to forcefeed you vodka and orange dont worry about that poxy daughter of yours said dommie after the number of times shes kicked you in the teeth you ought to buy a gum shield shes only in a bait because reds playing her up now weve all got to cheer for the tigers because theyll be so much easier to beat in the final than the flyers the stands were unusually packed for a weekday because so many people had turned up to see the argentine who had broken the ban and who was alleged to be the handsomest latin to invade british soil since juan obrien had cut such a swath through everyones wives before the falklands war you cannot imagine the bliss said seb hardly lowering his voice as they sat down of not playing for victor any more rickys a tartar he doesnt regard bonking and bopping all night as keeping fit but you dont have to brownnose him all the time and have you seen drews new lamborghini i bet thats a reward for services rendered from lady sharlady although drews already got some lady i wish i knew who it was giggling dommie pointed a frantic finger at two rows in front where sukey wearing a khaki shirt canvas jodhpurs and a pith helmet had just sat down she looks as though shes been shooting tayger he whispered to a twitching daisy cant you see her resting a wellshod foot on drews back next moment daisy felt even worse for bas had come into the stand with rupert and taggie all in dark glasses they totally ignored the photographers who were going berserk rupert was wearing a panama over his nose and holding taggie who was looking very pale and thin tightly by the hand daisy hadnt seen him since the awful row when ricky had thrown him out here they come said seb as the players cantered on to the field have you ever seen ponies like the flyers bart must have bred every single one from derby winners on both sides but daisy was watching drew who as he rode past was still issuing lastminute instructions to the brazilian ringer she hoped the back of sukeys very clean white neck wouldnt be scorched by her longing red who was now hitting a ball around near the stands very pointedly blew a kiss at the leggy blonde with the king charles spaniel puppy whos she asked daisy a slag said seb dommie and i had her last week why are you two so addicted to threesomes drawled a voice because sebs too lazy to get girls for himself said dommie hello mrs alderton as chessie minxy as ever in white jeans and a navyblue cashmere jersey but wearing a fraction too much rouge to hide her pallor sat down beside him dommie kissed her on both cheeks thank god your ex is only umpiring he went on so you cant put a hex on his game we were only just saying how beautifully your husbands mounted his team costs him enough chessie helped herself to dommies drink oh theres ricky she added wistfully you have to admit hes the bestconstructed man in polo look at the way those broad shoulders narrow into the hips and at the length of his thighs christ hes gorgeous as if drawn by her desire ricky glanced up and glanced hastily away well have to throw a bucket of water over you in a minute said seb then lowering his voice do look sukes necks gone bright pink with disapproval silly bitch said chessie barts livid jesus was the first umpire he objected to because hed once sacked him then they offered him charles and ben napier and bart objected again because hed sacked them too then they came up with ricky and bart said my wife sacked him so hes not going to be impartial after that ronnie ferguson stuck his toes in thank god ricky hated doing it said dommie he loathes coming within a million miles of your husband but he reckoned the best way hed size up the opposition was to umpire the match im sure weve met said chessie knowing perfectly well who daisy was and that rickyd been protecting her god knows why thought chessie daisy struck her as being extremely plain this is daisy perditas mother said seb ah said chessie perdita wouldnt be my favourite person if i were you shes none of our favourite person said dommie no dont cry sweetheart and unrolling another eight feet of blue andrex he proceeded to wipe daisys eyes dommies madly in love announced seb do we know her asked chessie mildly interested its a he and a pony said dommie excitedly no i know horses bore you rigid chessie but this ones something else hes a little australian waler with legs like crowbars i saw him at a gymkhana last summer and he was so competitive he galloped ahead in the sack race and brought the sack back every time in his teeth his owners wouldnt part with him then but this summer he started napping badly so they let me have him for meat money he is so brilliant and so clever and so gutsy like fantasma hell take anything on and hes got two white stripes on his withers so ive called him corporal oh belt up dom said seb go and get us all another drink down below them on the field angel couldnt stop shaking he could hardly hold the reins let alone manage his whip and stick hed spent an hour at the nearest catholic church that morning but how can one ask for absolution for a murder one is about to commit on the other hand as bibi still wouldnt return his calls his marriage was obviously over so what did it matter if he spent the next twentyfive years in some british gaol the guards club with its rainsoaked banks of azaleas fields stretching out like eternal billiard tables and revolting english exarmy officers in blazers barking instructions into walkietalkies made him feel sick noone knew that there was a sprinkling of malvinas earth in the bottom of his polo boots and no one had noticed the silhouette of the malvinas stamped on the front of his pale blue helmet a plane flew over and he wished he was on it but there was the loathsome captain benedict unconcernedly tapping a ball around a few yards away instantly angel was back in the malvinas with drew lounging behind a table with a borrowed sheepskin coat round his shoulders against the punishing cold drinking one cup of coffee after another and not offering anything to angel who was standing on his agonizingly smashedup knee trying not to sob with pain as one question relentlessly followed another in drews strongly accented but fluent spanish at that moment in angels terrifying reverie his dark bay mare maria took advantage of his inattention to give a colossal buck which sent angel flying through the air theres angel solis de gonzales exfighter pilot showing us how well he can fly without a plane mocked terry hanlon polos joker from the commentary box the crowd roared with laughter angel ground his teeth red who had caught maria brought her back to him as angel replaced his hat drew noticed the malvinas silhouette stamped on the front taking in the wild haunted eyes the deathly pallor the stubble and the damp bronze curls escaping from beneath the rim he knew hed seen angel before somewhere and was assailed by a feeling of menace two by two like animals going into the ark the teams lined up victor beside perdita the brazilian beside angel drew beside the leaping dancing red and hulking shark beside a constantly shouting bart ricky hurled the ball in with unaccustomed viciousness as planned beforehand angel and perdita rode their opposing players off the line to let the ball pound through to red who whacked it towards the boards scorched after it then stroked a beautiful forehand round to perdita who had galloped upfield towards the centre caught off guard and making gallant attempts to catch up with her drew felt as if a truck had hit him as he was ferociously bumped by angel who then thundered upfield so that when perdita out of nerves totally missed a long shot at goal he was able to charge up behind her pick up the ball and with a beautiful nearside forehand pass to a racingdown red who effortlessly stroked it between the posts oh christ said seb in awe if those two are going to be the pivot of the flyers team theyll be bloody hard to beat on sunday come on tigers sock it to them victor took a swipe and missed the ball behind the stands the sun which had had difficulty getting through like bart at last pierced the grey curtain of cloud spotlighting the drama on the field rupert put his panama on taggies head ruperts alleged daughter has hardly touched the ball at all murmured dommie to chessie shark was meant to be marking perdita but as noone gave her any passes he left her and went to drews aid but although he and drew were both incredibly powerful defensive players they couldnt contain red and angel red red red gonzales gonzales gonzales he hadnt time for solis seemed to be the only words on terry hanlons lips then angel jumped the boards at midoff and hit a nearside backshot of forty yards placing the ball just in front of the opposition posts before shark or drew could get there red had whistled down like a bullet and in it went the crowd were in ecstasy bursting over and over again into roars of applause at first drew thought he was imagining things as his opposing number two angel was meant to mark him so initially he dismissed the hurtling kamikaze bumps as latin exhuberance then a pelham bit was jabbed into his kidneys a ponys head swung into his shoulder so hard that even the pony shook its head for twenty seconds elbows rammed his ribs and riding up beside him angel got his knee underneath drews leg and tried to tip him out of the saddle finally the ball came out in drews direction and he had a lovely open sweep to goal in front of him as he swung his stick back he was hooked perilously low angels stick catching his ponys legs and nearly bringing her down what the fuck are you playing at you bloody wop yelled drew ricky blew his whistle and having awarded a thirty to the tigers took angel aside youre pushing your luck pack it in drew took the penalty deliberately spending as long as possible to get his breath back his ribs were agony forward went his stick then back then whistling down like jove releasing his thunderbolt slap between the posts well done cried daisy in delight drew looked straight at angel well he said coolly it was a mistake thirty seconds later angel rode him off at ninety degrees sending his pony flying as drew turned in fury he was suddenly terrified there was the icy madness of the killer in angels eyes in the third chukka drew was riding malteser his fastest but most explosively excitable pony it usually took half a chukka to calm her down red was loose again giving malteser her head drew galloped over to mark him but on his way shark backed the ball somewhat wildly up towards him attempting to stop it drew leant right out of his saddle hearing a pounding of hooves behind him and feeling angels knee under his he crashed to the ground oh no screamed daisy caught off her guard sukey leapt to her feet that argentine is trying to kill my husband she called out in a trembling voice oh god thought daisy feeling an icy hand squeezing her heart if angel was a falklands pilot perhaps he was taking drew out for being on the other side numb with horror she watched ricky then bart then red remonstrating with angel as drew climbed groggily on to his pony to take the penalty as he hit the ball angel bounded forward and blocked the shot then as the ball bounced awkwardly in the air miraculously hit it again twenty yards upfield and was galloping furiously in pursuit drew carried down by the impetus of taking the penalty swung round to ride angel off together they raced for the ball angel riding minerva barts fastest pony after glitz pulled ahead dyou remember me handsome capitán he said smiling evilly round at drew ow many planes ave you got ow many pilots when is zee next attack planned and where eef you wish to play polo again you better answer my questions drew let out a sigh so it is you you fucking dago the next moment angel had pulled over towards drew and his wickedlooking spur had caught the cheek strap of drews bridle narrowly missing maltesers terrified rolling eye and ripped it apart a second later his stick crashed into drews jaw and drew slumped to the ground like a felled pine but his foot was caught in the stirrup picking up her masters sense of panic malteser dragged him for twenty yards before shark caught up with her and yanked her to a halt as the ambulance screamed on ricky rode furiously up to angel off you bastard dont you send him off shouted bart hes my best player fucking biased umpiring off bellowed bobby ferraro the second umpire in agreement in the stands bas had put an arm round a shaking sobbing sukeys shoulders its ok old duck hes tough hell be ok oh no no no moaned daisy gazing in agony and horror at a lifeless drew there was a crack and looking down she saw she had broken her dark glasses she had already nearly bitten her lower lip through trying not to cry out as she watched drew being lifted unconscious into the ambulance she gave a shuddering wail glancing round dommie suddenly realized everything so youre the one he whispered then pulling her into his arms hang on to me for christs sake dont blow it sweetheart hell be all right dommie was utterly angelic shes upset about perdita he told everyone blandly as he hustled a sobbing daisy out of the stands little bitch bit her head off just before the match and when daisy sobbed even louder in protest dommie told her to shut up perditas committed enough crimes against humanity for it not to matter if one of thems blamed on her unfairly although it was only halftime he insisted on driving daisys rickety old volkswagen faster than it had ever been driven back to rutshire im not letting you near ricky in this condition hed be bound to winkle it out of you and you know how pompous he is about extramarital frolics although this was plainly more than a frolic the awful thing said daisy numbly was that sukey was so upset i really did think it was a marriage of convenience convenient for drew move over granny said dommie honking furiously as he overtook some sunday afternoon drivers admiring the rutshire countryside at twenty mph no wonder he was so ratty when red and i tried to take you to paris last summer hes been so kind to me since hamish left not difficult id be kind to you and unlike him ive got weekends christmas and easter free dommie put his arm round her shoulders hes a lucky sod not if he dies sobbed daisy course he wont without a car telephone he was unable to ring the hospital for news until they got home and even then the intensive care ward would only tell him drew had been admitted but its his father speaking dommie put on a gruff military voice but all he could glean was that drew had not yet regained consciousness dommie and daisy were stuck into the vodka and dommie was trying to distract her by telling her more stories about his new pony corporal when the telephone rang daisy jumped out of her skin perhaps it was news of drew then she thought how bloody silly she was only the mistress who had to grin and bear it why should anyone tell her anything fighting back the tears she grabbed the receiver it was ricky you ok he asked brusquely sorry about perdita she always gets uptight before a game no bloody excuse have you heard anything about drew still out cold but he hasnt broken anything when he had told her all he knew ricky asked daisy if shed like him to come over you shouldnt be on your own dommies here there was a pause be careful said ricky hospital says drews in a stable condition daisy told dommie as she put down the receiver fatuous expression youd think he was sleeping on wood shavings dommie filled up their glasses needs a muzzle too to stop him babbling on about you in his delirium ricky said the only thing hes calling out for is malteser said daisy sadly eventually she managed to persuade a reluctant dommie that she was really happier on her own youve been so kind but i just want to slink into my lair and lick my wounds id lick much more exciting parts of you grumbled dommie as he borrowed her car to drive home only after shed finished the vodka and sobbed it all out in tears did daisy rashly ring the hospital its very late are you a relation enquired the night sister yes im drews greataunt araminta said daisy i just want to know hes ok twenty seconds later she nearly dropped the receiver if thats the scorpion or anyone else pretending to be drews father who incidentally died five years ago sukeys normally brisk nononsense voice was cracked with strain you can sugar off hanging up daisy slumped wailing over the kitchen table nothing not the secret trysts nor the ecstatic lovemaking nor the vats of scent and moët not the diamond brooches cashmere jerseys and the slithering slinky satin underwear made up for not being able to sit beside drews bed holding his hand and willing him back to consciousness the inquiry was held the following afternoon in an upstairs room at the naval and military club in piccadilly stewards from the british polo association including david waterlane charles napier brigadier hughie and brigadier canford from cowdray made up the committee evidence was given by the umpires bobby ferraro and ricky looking particularly bleak in a dark suit and his habitual black tie and from the third man the bpa had tried to get a signed statement from drew but confined to hospital with severe concussion and a cracked jaw he could remember nothing the ramblings of brigadier hughie whod had two glasses of port at luncheon and who could see parallels for everything in singapore and india were mercifully cut short by david waterlane who was not drinking because it was the polo season and who wanted to go to a strip club victor kaputnik had been furious that drew his star player had been taken out but his fury had been considerably assuaged when with ben napier standing in for drew the tigers had smashed the flyers down to three men after angel had been sent off by which put them in the final to upstage bart whod only brought four lawyers victor rolled up with five whereupon bart promptly sent out for two more like a takeaway angel sullen and shellshocked from being bawled out by an enraged bart and an even more hysterically angry red had been ordered by barts principal lawyer winston chalmers whod flown through the night on concorde at vast expense to keep his pretty trap shut all you gotta do said winston is to say youre very sorry and admit it was a terrible mistake the only meestake was not to keel him snarled angel dyou want to be sidelined for ten years angel shrugged sulkily well shut up then and for chrissake take him to jermyn street red get him a tie and a haircut winston chalmers was a fine lawyer angel solis de gonzales he told the stewards comes from one of the oldest families in the argentine and was one of the most distinguished pilots in the falklands war all players get strung up before a match particularly a semifinal suddenly by extraordinary coincidence he sees on the opposite side a british officer who interrogated him in the falklands a volatile hotblooded latin he sees red and hits him no piped up angel i did not heet red i saw drew and heet him pack it in muttered winston chalmers savagely i come to eengland to avenge my brother pedro we in argentina honour the family your brother was a fine player asked brigadier hughie easing a sliver of cutlet en gelée out of his teeth excellent he make red alderton look like veector kaputnik the committee tried not to laugh i must tell zee truth continued angel i know drew benedict was polo player i know everytheenk about im e torture me in falklands what we want to know asked david waterlane is whether the whole thing was premeditated i no understand did you plan it beforehand angel glanced out on to the dusty plane trees of green park people were lounging in emeraldgreen deck chairs girls were stretched out in bikinis he felt a great wave of shame as he said no i did not everyone left the room except the stewards and the discussion became very acrimonious weve got to suspend him for a year and send him home said brigadier canford from cowdray who wanted to continue the ban solis de gonzaless behaviour is utterly indicative of what will happen if we get the argentines back if he comes up against rutminster hall in the next few weeks he could easily take out the prince of wales david waterlane however who hadnt won a major cup nor lost a wife since miguel and juan played for him came down heavily in support of angel chap hasnt displayed a trace of aggression in any other game played against brits in palm beach plays in the same team as perdita shes a brit drews an isolated case gave him a hard time in the falklands had a rush of blood to the head suspend him for a week with a fine i remember a chappie in india began brigadier hughie furious with another player for walking off with his wife about to kill him when a wild pig wounded by some guns ran across the pitch so we all gave chase oh shut up hughie snapped david waterlane i know for a fact that if you ban gonzales bart for one will pull out of the gold cup altogether and go back to america we dont want that said brigadier canford going pale bart had promised to pour a vast amount of money into the club which hed just joined but hadnt signed the cheque yet brigadier canford had visions of being landed with a bill for new showers a new bar and ladies loos with a tampax machine when i was in singapore interrupted brigadier hughie chappie got so miffed at being beaten he hijacked the opposition ponies and syces on the train home oh shut up hughie said brigadier canford angel waited outside in the smoking room forgetting its similarity to the jockey club in buenos aires he thought how odiously british were the thick red carpet the ornate plaster ceiling the heavy dark furniture the members silently reading the times and the sporting life he hadnt eaten since yesterday morning and he felt exhausted miserable and desperately ashamed of himself for having lied to the stewards glancing up he thought he was hallucinating for there hovering in the doorway with the club porter was bibi looking adorably fragile and worried i just came from the airport whats happening theyre still talking said angel joyously crossing the room he was about to take her in his arms when she said coldly what in hell were you doing trying to murder drew benedict angel could lie to the inquiry but not to bibi drew benedict is complete sheet who torture me in malvinas now his jaw is cracked he wont find it so easy to interrogate people they were out in the passage now both shaking with animosity and longing how long have you planned this for ever said angel i had to avenge pedro bibi went to the window and gazed past the swooning union jack over the windowbox of red geraniums at the lovers in the park my life is over she thought angel gazing at her long beautiful legs her tousled red hair and her hunched padded shoulders in the petrolblue suit thought hed never needed or wanted her so badly so you didnt marry me for my money whispered bibi turning on him you did it to get american nationality and your revenge on poor drew what other reason could there be hissed angel he didnt mean it but he was fed up with being lectured and shouted at and was aware of newspapers being lowered in the smoking room next door i want a divorce winstons over here so he can handle it right away said bibi and sobbing hysterically she fled down the stairs out into the traffic of piccadilly angel was about to run after her when a voice said mr solis de gonzales will you come in please he felt no better when brigadier hughie told him that this time hed get away with a fortnights suspension and a fine and you can fucking well pay it roared bart you only got off because i threatened to pull out of the gold cup perdita was in turmoil there was no doubt red was playing her up it was as if spurred on by the media attention showered on angel he wanted to establish himself as the chief headturner the one the girls flocked round the most he was also furious with perdita for playing so badly in the semifinal of the queens cup since then he had hardly touched her and perdita deaf dumb and blind with love didnt know how to play it she should have backed off and flirted with other men instead she made scenes then overwhelmed with remorse crawled back again with morale plummeting the polo ball at hurlingham the following week didnt help matters bart furious theyd been beaten by the tigers whod in turn been smashed by apocalypse in the final insisted that all the flyers turned up it was a foul night with torrential rain drumming a million irritable fingers on the roof of the marquee flattening the blue hydrangeas and preventing anyone stealing off into the romantically shadowed garden glades perdita who had a black eye a tooth knocked out and a swollen purple lip from playing in the royal windsor and had to play in an allladies match at the royal berkshire the following day longed to back down if you hadnt made me cut my hair off she stormed at red i could at least have trailed it over my face now i just look hideous red by contrast always looked his most desirable in a dinner jacket he had no truck with white tuxedos or coloured ties shirts or cummerbunds just black and white perfected after ten fittings and setting off his beechleaf colouring bart having annexed a table for six promptly disappeared to telephone red who was in a strange detached mood took advantage of his fathers absence to bitch up chessie who was looking heartbreaking in prussianblue strapless taffeta with white roses dyed prussian blue in her hair angel whose mood was anything but detached was attaching himself to every blonde he could find aware that she had lost him but unable to tear herself away bibi was near to suicide looking round at all the smooth brown backs the shining manes the jewelled litup happily chatting faces she gave a sob i must be the only ugly woman in polo perdita who couldnt get drunk because of the allladies match next day took another slug of perrier that makes two of us she said gloomily but youll be beautiful when the bruises go said bibi despairingly realizing she should have contradicted bibis earlier remark perdita said quickly but youre terrificlooking idly red turned bibis profile to face him i dont know why you dont have a nose job then youd be fine then shed look just like you you mean snapped chessie if you had a heart job youd be fine yes id love to come and dance she added grabbing dommie carlisle who was sidling past im on my way to the gents protested dommie well you wont find any at this table said chessie she was undoubtedly the most beautiful woman in the room eyes followed her men pressed their cheeks against their partners so they could gaze undetected as she passed the prussianblue taffeta seemed part of her body like a fishs tail the roses in her greenygold hair gave her the look of some naiad red flanked by two girls miserably aware of not feeling beautiful watched chessie lazily whats bitten her he asked bibi dads been calling mom about me and angel rickys been talking to dancer and rupert all evening and hasnt asked her to dance take your pick said bibi any news of luke asked red good said bibi cheering up for a second the last ops been a total success and hes talking about starting a green pony clinic in palm beach you know how he could always sort out anything difficult didnt work with perdita drawled red dont be bitchy said bibi oh christ through a gap in the dancers she could see angel bopping with jesuss baby sister whose sense of rhythm was as good as his all her seventeenyearold peanutbuttercoloured body seemed to be bouncing out of her gold dress seeing his worst enemys wife miserably neglected drew benedict felt it was not only a duty but a pleasure to rescue her may i have this dance bibi looked up with a start oh my god drew how are you ok talkings a bit painful but ive never been into yattering im so sorry about last week thank you for the flowers they were from all of us stammered bibi angel should never have i guess he was provoked get up said drew gently and well provoke him some more then as bibi slid into his arms has anyone ever told you youve got the most beautiful body in polo prettier than maltesers much said drew wow perdita turned to red that could cause some problems looking round in midgyration angel saw bibi laughing up at drew with a growl he broke away from jesuss sister dommie returning with chessie and sizing up the situation blocked angels path by shoving chessie into his arms dance with your stepmotherinlaw angel i truly must go and have a slash red and perdita were left alone she wanted to dance so desperately but she was damned if she was going to beg are you coming to the ladies match tomorrow no said red filling up his glass please come i go to every match in which hes playing she thought i dont want to auriels playing you are totally irrational snapped red youd raise hell if i came saying it was because i wanted to see her if i dont come youll complain im neglecting you im sorry said perdita humbly christ talk of the devil hi red said auriel ive just come from the airport victor and sharon persuaded me to drop by she was looking stunning and in her starkly simple black linen suit amidst all the bare shoulders and ball dresses curiously seductive her perfect ankles were not remotely swollen from the flight shall we have a dance for old times sake she added to red old is the operative word snarled perdita dont be bitchy perdita said auriel under the circumstances i would have thought you could afford to be generous sitting alone at the table perdita was suddenly aware that people didnt like her any more the twins who never bore grudges and whod been buying drinks for victor whod sacked them only last year were avoiding her ricky had cut her dead just now bas had nodded unsmiling and walked passed her erstwhile great mate dancer couldnt wait to get away from her and now red was dancing with auriel smiling affectionately down at her holding her tiny waist as though it were the stem of a glass of priceless brandy he was about to drink i must not make a scene i must not make a scene she told herself in the looking glass she could see her black eye coming through the makeup she looked like a battered fiancée she was saved by a roll of drums and the bandleader announcing that as the rain had stopped the fireworks would take place after all but as everyone surged outside her isolation seemed even more apparent kicking off her high heels she soothed her aching feet in the drenched grass nor did she care that her long white dress trailed along the ground snagging on twigs and rose thorns living with red had accustomed her to throwing clothes out after one wearing if she didnt like them roman candles in silver pink and yellow were lighting up the night spluttering like me thought perdita she hoped there werent any dogs loose in the nearby streets who might be frightened by the bangs for a second after the brilliant light it seemed almost dark in the dripping garden then almost immediately the big catherine wheels came alive slowly at first then faster and faster accelerating into fiery revolving chrysanthemums like an affair taking off like her and red oh god it hurt to think of that first night in deauville miserably she watched the catherine wheels burn out until they were only dim red glows on their posts rockets were now going up in swift succession with a whistling hiss as though they were vying to touch the stars then erupting into a cascade of rival stars one went sideways and lodged in the heart of a huge oak trunk writhing and jumping abortively thats even more like me thought perdita did everything have to burn out as rosered and royalblue flares exploded into the sky to the smell of sulphur and brimstone was added an overpowering waft of diorissimo glancing right perdita gasped as she saw ricky and chessie under a huge livid yellow catalpa gazing at each other like souls in hell frantically perdita looked for bart he was coming towards her clutching his telephone seen chessie he asked curtly we gotta go oh look isnt that beautiful desperate to distract him perdita pointed to the word polo written in red white and blue shimmering and erupting against the russet night thats neat said bart chessie was dancing said perdita ill go find her said bart plunging back into the house the display was ending in a massive explosion of coloured stars war must sound like this thought perdita chessie and ricky had gone but in the shade of a large magnolia perdita imagined she caught a glimpse of sharon and david waterlane for a second she thought that little victor was rooted to the spot with wonder at the fireworks until she realized that his highheeled boots were plugged into the wet lawn to her left stood bibi her face round with excitement her lips parted suddenly pretty fascinated envious perdita watched drews fingers sliding down the inside of bibis arm pausing to brush her breast with his knuckles then sliding his fingers into hers as the garden went dark again he must be doing it deliberately to wind angel up queuing for her coat five minutes later perdita listened to a rapturous sukey dyou know we made fifteen thousand on the auction i was terrified that lovely zandra rhodes dress wouldnt reach its reserve but dancer maitland bought it so sweet then lowering her voice to mrs hughie she confided hes fritefly nice for a queer probably going to wear it himself said chessie bart whod sold his london house to realize capital was flying straight back to new york with bibi to mastermind some takeover before the gold cup red because he couldnt be bothered to drive back to barts house in sussex had booked himself and perdita into the savoy chessie had also booked a room there and to reds absolute fury came along to their suite for a drink i do not want to listen to her bitching all night about my father he said going off to bed and slamming the door behind him so poor perdita had to sit up until dawn listening to chessie sobbing her heart out i cant stand it any more i know he loves me but hes so appallingly uncompromising says ive got to leave bart or nothing it seemed unfair too that perdita had to leave red in bed but she was determined to have her tooth capped before she drove down to meet auriel outside london had recovered its youth the rain had washed the dust off the plane trees and heightened the reticulated giraffepatterning of their long lanky trunks bronze workmen were stripping off in the sunshine as perdita came out of the dentist however a cloud blacker than her bruised eye hung over the west ringing the royal berkshire she discovered the match had been cancelled bliss thought perdita she could go back to the savoy for a jolly lunch with red she hadnt had a day off for ages it was lovely to be in london the girls looked so pretty in their summer dresses people were drinking outside pubs the flower shops were a riot of colour stopping off at harvie hudson perdita bought their latest shirt lilac and pale blue stripes as a present for red if it clashed with his hair she could always wear it maids were clearing away breakfast as she got back to the savoy a do not disturb sign hung on the door of their room red would sleep all day given the opportunity thought perdita fondly as she let herself in very quietly then she heard voices he must be watching television im back she barged into the bedroom the match was cancelled and ive bought you the most divine shirt the words shrivelled on her lips for lying in bed one light gold the other darker gold were chessie and red chessie was lying on her belly red was kissing her shoulders caressing her bottom with one hand the other was buried in her pubic hair for a moment they all stared at each other perdita was so shocked she could only think how beautiful they looked in that huge bed reflected in the mirrored fronts of the cupboards which lined the left side of the room then she screamed and was about to run out of the door when quick as a lurcher on a hare red had seized her youre not going anywhere he shoved her into the bathroom and slammed the door clinging on to the gold handle for grim death as perdita tugged screamed and pummelled against the other side which gave chessie the chance to put on her pale blue dress and make a bolt for it releasing her red expected a monumental scene curious what shed throw at him first but she stumbled out as grey and subdued as a released hostage why she whispered why her i dont understand red never blushed it didnt go with red hair slowly deliberately his hands totally steady he put a yellow sobranie between his faintly smiling lips i wanted to prove what a little tramp she was but she spent most of last night telling me how much she loved ricky perhaps she does reds lighter flared perhaps she wanted to put you off the scent did she actually mention rickys name shes such a bitch shes been trying to get me into bed for years she may have been uptight because id been dancing with auriel straightening a magazine that had been knocked crooked he moved towards the fridge dyou want a drink perdita shook her head but you must have planned it deliberately knowing id be away i know red banged the steel icetray on the top of the fridge i wish to hell theyd use plastic i was kinda curious what shed be like i guess one occasionally likes variety its as simple as that like a lift whose cable has broken perdita sat down suddenly on the sofa was this the first time red paused a fraction too long sure she called me this morning are you going to tell your father red laughed and emptied the whisky over his ice not yet i dont want to be disinherited how can you do that to him you bastard hissed perdita it was her sole outburst of reproof on the contrary said red mockingly unlike you i was regularly conceived drifting towards her he examined her new tooth thats better dyou want to stay with me frantic he was going to chuck her perdita nodded well you better keep your trap shut for a change no blathering to simpson hastings this time if you tell anyone in fact you and i are over understand yes of course and since you interrupted what id started with chessie id quite like to finish it as he pulled her towards him his cock jabbed her stomach beneath the feline languor she could sense his frenzied excitement never had he made love to her more passionately and when the manager rang up asking them to check out he booked in for another night perdita told noone about red and chessie except tero into whose sympathetic grey shoulder she sobbed endlessly trying to make sense out of what had happened did red really loathe chessie had he just pulled her to prove he could and that chessie was a whore or was it for the novelty of something as utterly verboten as a cream bun in a health farm even more confusingly a couple of days after shed stumbled on them she had a letter from chessie dear perdita sorry about thursday morning but please dont blame me id never have gone to bed with red if he hadnt pestered me ever since i married bart thats why hes always been so poisonous to me so that i finally gave in because i was flattered i suppose and because i was so miserable about ricky im sorry youre hurt but if you hadnt come back youd never have found out yours redfaced and redhanded chessie even when shed shattered someones life chessie couldnt avoid being flip either she or red was lying but perdita couldnt imagine red pestering anyone she knew she should pack her bags but where could she go tero and spotty could hardly live in a bedsit and would red give her custody of the six ponies and all the jewels and clothes hed given her she hadnt saved a penny relying on the wads of dollars and pound notes hed thrust so freely into her eager hands what terrified her most was the total loss of pride and willpower she loved him too much to walk out however much he humiliated her as electrodes of jealousy wracked her body she realized for the first time how much luke must have suffered perditas game disintegrated if red and angel hadnt continued so majestically together the flyers would have never reached the final of the gold cup after a very tough draw in which they beat the tigers in extra time apocalypse also reached the final ricky tried to sleep on the eve of the match but kept listening for the banging of hooves against the stable walls which would tell him one of his horses had cast itself or was down with colic when he did drop off he found he was playing the whole world in his dreams at three he got up and wandered round the house it was unbearably hot and stuffy with distant thunder grumbling round the rutshire hills little chef whod trailed his restless master all day and tried to bring a smile to his lips by rushing in with a clothes brush or lying on his back sneezing with his paws over his eyes followed yawning and blinking the thunder was getting nearer on the drawingroom table lay the endlessly rescribbled and crossedout lists of tomorrows playing order he had spent hours working out which horses would go best in which chukka so one always had a balance of speed and manoeuvrability heavy rain would change all that he was also in a dilemma about wayne who as an old horse didnt go well in very hot weather and whod got crafty recently and fed up with ricky making him do sharp turns at a gallop had started falling over deliberately nor was he entirely reliable in rideoffs seeing a bump coming hed hesitate and take ricky out of it young horses loved to bump old horses like wayne tended to cheat on you like young wives thought ricky bitterly which brought him back to chessie if he won tomorrow what then it was the first rung reached but if chessie came back would he ever trust her again he wished luke were here dancer was frozen with panic unable to eat even the twins were subdued like puppies removed too early from their mother so ricky himself had to be the stabilizer the smell of meadowsweet drifted hot and soapy from the lake at the bottom of the moonlit valley like a low low star ricky saw daisys light on he glanced at her painting of will which had brought him such bittersweet pleasure suddenly the temptation to dump was too much if he werent playing wayne tomorrow he could ride him down to see daisy hullo daisy answered the telephone on the first ring her voice tremulous with excitement its ricky there was a pause how are you said daisy trying to keep the desperate disappointment out of her voice cant sleep its so light outside can i come over the same moonlight that flooded the eldercombe valley silvered chessies naked body as she lay in the great green silk fourposter listening to the crunch of the security guards on the gravel outside beside her bart churned with demoniacal sexual excitement challenges were his fix and this was the greatest challenge hed ever faced alderton airlines was about to merge with euroelectronics determined to merge with a splurge bart was flying in both his own and the german boards who would enjoy a splendid lunch in a duckeggblue tent before watching the flyers retain the gold cup bibi had been so incensed by such extravagance that shed refused to come we cant pay wages or suppliers dad we can after weve closed the deal said bart helmut wallstein the chairman of euroelectronics owned race horses and would recognize quality when he saw barts ponies he longed to screw chessie to release the tension but he always avoided sex before a key match he needed the builtup pressure to zap the other side hearing her reach out for a glass of water he said remember that red suit you wore at last years gold cup it brought us luck will you wear it again on one condition chessie wriggled up to him that you fuck me stupid now in contrast to its cool silver moonlit appearance her sweating body gave off a whitehot heat i mustnt said bart regretfully tomorrow night ill bang you insensible real men screw their wives and win matches taunted chessie climbing on top of him and taking his cock between her lips with access to this mumbled bart as the oily silken warmth tickled his face i must be the luckiest guy in the world id kill to keep you you know that the thunderstorm broke in the west around breakfast time and reached cowdray by midday with lightning unzipping a purplyblack sky and deafening claps of thunder unnerving the ponies the storm passed on but driving rain birched the faces of the two teams as they cantered a lap of honour and bounced off a pitch which after weeks of sunshine was now dangerously slick and greasy on top and as hard as red aldertons heart underneath but rain had never stopped play at cowdray the scarlet ribbons on the hats of the band playing four horsemen riding riding riding the umbrellas of the spectators and the duckeggblue shirts of the flyers provided the only colourful notes and theyll be black with mud by treadingin time said dommie through chattering teeth and well all be black and blue before its over wayne loathed rain and his long yellow ears never left his ewe neck as ricky rode him in the parade but when he was untacked and realized he wouldnt be playing he put his ugly head down hunched his shoulders and ignoring everyone sulked in the corner angel who hated rain even more than wayne was near suicide bibi hadnt come over for the match and the icy west wind whistling across the pitch felt to him as if it was coming directly from her in new york perdita felt even worse than angel ricky had cut her dead again so had dancer and rupert had just come into the stands yesterday shed begged red to stick and ball with her in a faint attempt to capture her lost form he had rolled up an hour late you got me out of bed ok he had snapped whatja want me to tell you then at the team meeting in the pony lines bart had had such a row with red and angel whod both refused to lunch in the alderton tent with all the krauts that nothing was discussed at all bart in turn was enraged because chessie had turned up late for lunch wearing a brown suede jacket and gauchos tucked into black boots and clinched with a big black leather belt and making all the other women whod expected a heatwave look silly in their flimsy dresses you promised youd wear your red suit hissed bart i tried it on said chessie lightly but the skirt was last years length bart was a powerful and consistent player but chessies feverish sexual demands last night and again this morning had sapped him and with all the krauts and his own board to entertain at lunch he didnt have a chance to distance himself hed also mislaid his lucky belt and had turned the house and the barn upside down looking for it grace would have found it he thought darkly and hosted this lunch and made every kraut and his wife feel special why was he blowing his entire livelihood on this exquisite irresponsible malicious child perdita watched chessie whod now topped the whole outfit with a black sombrero saunter up the gangway of the stands swinging her hips like gary cooper in high noon god i hate her she thought three players bart red and ricky are all obsessed with her angel wouldnt say no and the twins have probably had her in duplicate which only leaves me and dancer immune no wonder shes looking so chipper huddled under their coloured umbrellas the crowd chattered in an incredible number of languages sharon kaputnik whod been lunching in the davidoff tent it was noticed by the press was sharing her roselined parasol with david waterlane because sir victor having been knocked out by apocalypse refused to come to the match so unsportin said sharon rolling her blue eyes ay wouldnt refuse to come because id been beaten ill bet you wouldnt murmured chessie who seeing the front rows occupied by helmut and gisela wallstein and the rest of the euroelectronics board deliberately sat down between rupert and sukey benedict in the row behind davidoff waterlane is obviously about to havidoff with lady shar she said in a stage whisper i do hope dancers wearing waterproof mascara in this rain oh stop looking so bootfaced rupert havent you forgiven me yet but rupert had turned his back and was gazing moodily at the huge green field with its eggyolk goal posts and flags and its panorama of rolling greenandgold cornfields beneath glowing blackandgrey clouds the grooves made in the cornfields by the drillers were not much deeper than the lines on either side of rickys mouth as he gave lastminute instructions to his team dont go into a daze dancer for christs sake concentrate and if youre going to change ponies dommie ask first last time it cost us a goal i thought it was a penalty so i buzzed off said dommie mounting his pony christ my reins are starting to slip already were the better side so we attack bart ordered the flyers as they rode grimly on to the pitch solis de gonzales and red alderton have dominated every headline this summer said william loyd of the telegraph frantically trying to make his biro work on a wet page nice to get francelynch into a headline francelynched is the only headline youre likely to get said jnp watson of the times case of too many late nights im afraid seb dommie and dancer were evidently playing poker till three in the morning last night better than boozing said william loyd giving up and resorting to pencil is bart going to keep his best pony for the last chukka he asked chessie all my husbands ponies are best said chessie tonelessly it was raining even harder now but nothing doused the loathing between the two teams which seemed to singe the clouds above and set the drenched cornfields on fire drew was waiting to throwin as they lined up i dont want any aggro he said crisply anyone who swears or argues with the umpire will be sent off except any argentines he added with a glint who will be shot only bart grabbing angels shirt stopped him flying through the air and landing on drew pack it in im paying you to bury the opposition not the umpire in the first chukka angel and red tried to play at their usual breakneck speed but it was as if someone had spilt turkey fat all over the kitchen floor and after both had overturned their ponies and angel had nearly been trampled to death by a furiously galloping seb they slowed down the flyers were infinitely superior in pony power but for once they couldnt take advantage of their fleet light thoroughbred horses the much slower ground played havoc with their timing and the rain not only aquapunctured their faces drastically reducing visibility but made reins gloves and sticks incredibly slippery and almost impossible to hold accustomed to such conditions and on much heavier ponies apocalypse started winning the rideoffs and having endlessly practised lofting the ball over a sea of mud were therefore unfazed when the whole field became black with skidmarks and divots apocalypse had also learnt one vital lesson from luke they had practised played almost slept together all summer and knew each others ponies backwards they wanted not individual glory but for the team to win the twins normally attacking players were marking the hell out of angel and red driving them crackers there were plenty of spats angel thundering down the boards was being threatened by ricky get out of my way you fucker he howled puniatero forro eenglish preek then seeing drew out of the corner of his eye added with excessive politeness excuse me meester francelynch my line i theenk and clouted the ball straight between kintas legs up went rickys stick foul he yelled at drew dangerous stick work he crossed me protested angel he pulled up on the ball shouted ricky if kintas got any legs left its no thanks to him drew reluctant to be accused of bias turned to shark nelligan the other umpire apocalypse foul said shark thank you mr nelligan said angel making a vsign on his mudspattered thigh but only lifting it an inch in rickys direction he found the flags without difficulty high time the argies came back said david waterlane returning the pressure of sharons leg in the third chukka the score stuck at to the flyers as ponies and players all plastered with mud groped desperately for a foothold trying to gain the ascendancy as the usual thunderous dry rattle of hooves was replaced by the dull relentless thud of a murderers cudgel then by some miracle dancer whod been marked by bart got the ball and here comes dancer said terry hanlon the cowdray commentator heading for goal riding riding riding famine justice pestilence and whoops oh dear he didnt connect with that offside forehand and the ball went wide got the mud to hide your blushes stick to singing in future dancer the stands giggled as dancer hung his head bart picked up the ball and backed it to red who missed it completely then spinning round picked it up and came triumphantly down the field dummying past seb then ricky then dommie whipping and whipping glitz into a breakneck gallop until the crowd started grumbling with disapproval and here comes red alderton said terry hanlon dropping his voice an octave whos lived more nights than days look at him opening up his shoulders for the big one and its a goal ladies and gentlemen and seahorses to the flyers back in the pony lines grooms had the thankless task of getting the mud off and drying utterly exhausted ponies in torrential rain the apocalypse grooms in their black bomber jackets had experienced such conditions and were far more cheerful than the flyers argentines who hated rain as much as angel wayne utterly unplacated by four ounces of barley sugar and a bucket of water still sulking with his head down suddenly heard his old friend and last years teammate spotty yelling out for tero who was still on the field and started calling back like a lunatic ducking out of his headcollar whickering with delight he bustled off to join spotty across a sea of mud and started kissing and nuzzling him all over get that fucking dog off the pitch roared bart as his weary pony nearly tripped over little chef racing out to welcome ricky as the players came off at halftime apocalypse had contained the flyers very well and bart not best pleased went off to shout at his team we should be at least five goals up by now well done said ricky quietly to dancer and the twins weve rattled them now weve got to get some goals hearing tea for two over the tannoy wayne bustled off towards the tea tent drew tweed cap resting on his eyelashes riding round on his drenched pony as the crowd swarmed back to the stands after treading in thought how amazing it was that the field which five minutes ago had been a black sea of holes and divots was now a smooth sweep of emerald green again like my marriage he thought wryly and for a second scoured the stands for daisy hoping she might have turned up hed promised to ring her during the week but hed been too busy to get over to eldercombe and he hated hearing the disappointment in her voice hed try and get her this evening although he could hardly cheer her up with the news that perdita was playing well perdita was equally conscious she wasnt pulling her weight bart had yelled at her so continually she hardly heard him then in the fourth chukka angel gave her a pass and there was only forty yards between her and goal perdita was so surprised she hesitated but tero putting on an amazing turn of speed took her upfield placing her beside the ball so she was able to judge the first shot beautifully now the ball was waiting for her ten feet in front of the goal oh please god god blocked his ears and she hit a divot instead of the ball frantically she tugged at the sodden reins and willing tero turned on her hocks at full gallop thats a good pony thought red but as the little mare floundered to stay upright she slipped and came down with perdita beneath her the crowd gave a gasp of horror and agreed it was not a girls game tero rolled off in a trice seeing perdita was moving red belted off to change ponies when he returned perdita was screaming at bart i cant go on ive got to change my breeches glancing down red saw blood mingling with the mud all the trauma over chessie had made the curse so late perditad forgotten all about it theres only ninety seconds to go shouted bart everyonell notice if you play in a mans game you play by mens rules howled red get back on that pony pull your shirt outside angel put an arm round perditas shoulder feeling her shaking with sobs no one can see zee blood for zee mud he said comfortingly your daughter seems to be getting rather a lot of earache from my husband said chessie slyly to rupert as the clock started again rupert gazed stonily ahead holding taggies hand so tightly that she winced mr alderton is a very forceful captain said gisela wallstein who was bitterly cold and couldnt understand what was going on at all oh bart always shouts when hes near the stands said chessie lightly the team dont take any notice but the crowd think what a big macho guy helmut wallstein looked round at chessie speculatively i have not often seen such beautiful horses subsidized by alderton airlines said chessie with a shrug sukey paused in the menus she was writing out for two dinner parties next week if drew were just umpiring she felt it was all right only to keep half an eye on the game how can you be so unsupportive chessie she murmured vot is the name of that bay mare hes riding now asked helmut i havent a clue you should be able to recognize barts ponies reproved sukey thats marina a criolla pony from argentina she told helmut chessie turned smiling to sukey do remind me to take your husband to bed when i get a moment sukey went magenta but her reply was drowned by terry hanlon telling them that the head had broken off rickys stick in the desperate mêlée in the apocalypse goal mouth and ricky francelynch is managing to do an amazing amount of damage with his stick alone but its looking very dangerous for apocalypse is it going to be no seb carlisles taken the ball upfield swinging round ricky thundered towards the boards where his sticks were leaning against the fence their handles fretting in the wind fiftyone he bellowed to louisa but for once chessie was too quick bounding down the gangway she snatched the right stick and handed it to ricky for a second their eyes met good luck darling youre doing brilliantly she called out quite audibly and mrs alderton is giving her exhusband stick announced terry hanlon drily exwives generally do i expect she was asking for more dosh the crowd despite being drenched giggled mr and mrs wallstein exchanged surprised glances is it customary in england you support the other side only if your names oswald mosley snapped rupert conditions were worsening the rain coming down in a steady torrent the wind growing more vicious ricky had found kintas strength in the third chukka a twoedged sword she was powerful enough to play two even three chukkas but in these conditions she was a liability because she wouldnt stop ricky couldnt afford any more penalties if kinta cannoned into other ponies or barged across their right of way as he rode back to the pony lines at the end of the fourth chukka he shouted to louisa to tack up wayne for the last chukka this was the kind of weather when you needed old friends oh my god muttered louisa as she handed his new dark brown pony corporal over to dommie waynes sunk a bucket of water had half a ton of barley sugar and ive just retrieved him from the flyers pony lines with chocolate cake all over his whiskers trying to mount spotty should i tell ricky leave it said dommie if he gives ricky confidence thats what matters he looked down at louisas plump freckled mudspattered face her hair clung to her head like a mermaid will you sleep with me if we win louisas smile suddenly lit up the cowdray gloom i thought youd never ask yes please and if we lose so i dont shoot myself yes please said louisa the mud in fact had been too thick for any of the crowd to notice the blood but still numb with embarrassment and misery and shaken by the fall perdita felt even more conspicuous riding back on to the field in snowwhite breeches youve got two chukkas left to redeem yourself said bart bullyingly you dont want to be the reason we lost the cup the flyers had a good fifth chukka dominating the play and pushing the score up to then apocalypse caught fire and seb and ricky both scored in the closing minutes and the stands went wild as the players rode out for the last chukka it was noticed that red had taken off the white sweater he wore under his blue polo shirt for the first time this season thats ominous said ricky get your fingers out apocalypse after two minutes of frantic barging and bumpsadaisy red took matters into his own hands giving dommie and seb the slip and glitz his head he raced off upfield thats it thought ricky dully thatll be theres only dancer anywhere near him god had let dancer down last time so this time he concentrated on red who was messing around in front of goal insolently positioning himself so he could score the clinching goal but as he lifted his stick he found himself nearly pulled off his horse dancer had hooked him with pressure it is better said helmut wallstein he had all zee time in the world and he relaxed well hooked dancer you read the play hollered dommie grinning out of his round ruffian blackamore face as he raced corporal down to bring the ball back to ricky perdita who was out of position and should have been marking dancer raced back towards the apocalypse goal but as all the players converged on ricky trying to help or hinder him a pony kicked a divot up in perditas eyes totally blinding her so she crashed across rickys right of way up went every apocalypse stick foul screamed the twins ricky on wayne took the penalty pale rider pale horse said william loyd and his name was death to the flyers hopes murmured chessie the wind which had been rickys enemy all day had moved slightly to the south slowly he cantered a circle that would have won a dressage prize the picture of control his gait as smooth as his yellow face was ugly wayne floated proudly towards the ball there was a ripple of muscle the piston arm hurtled down again ricky aimed deliberately to the left and nudged back by the wind the ball sailed high above the leaping flyers sticks slap between the posts the crowd who could hardly see through the rain waited on tenterhooks then seeing the waving yellow flag bellowed their delight the penalty is mightier than the sword cried chessie clapping ecstatically there were two and a half minutes to go the score was and dommie mishitting clouted the ball towards the flyers goalmouth but to noone in particular ahead of everyone red scorched after it flogging glitz like a jockey at tattenham corner glitz however was fed up with the weather and too many hidings he was used to cheering crowds under a palm beach sun as he shook off the opposition like a dog a towel out of the corner of his beautiful eye he saw wayne hurtling down to ride him off wayne was very ugly and his pale face was fearsome red turned his heel into glitzs sodden right flank to turn him left he had heard that wayne was spooked about bumping and anticipated no contest the next minute glitz had ducked out and ricky had taken the line you fucking son of a bitch screamed red to glitz but it was too late i misjudged you you old bugger im sorry said ricky in amazement as wayne pulled away from the tiring glitz the buttercupyellow posts rose out of the gloom to his left master of the cut shot ricky sliced the ball but scuppered by nerves he misjudged and hit the post oh groaned the crowd bart hit in a minute and a half to go seb blocked the shot and passed to dommie who tapped it in screaming with frustration as again it hit the post the afternoon of the woodwork said terry hanlon sympathetically but an instant later ricky had thundered in and slapped in a tennis shot in the air chessies scream of joy was not the only one six all a minute to go suddenly the rain stopped every tree and flat cap dripped water cascaded down spectators necks as other spectators lowered their umbrellas the gold cup on its green baize table was carried out and glittered like the holy grail in a lone shaft of sunlight as the ball flashed frantically from goalmouth to goalmouth and bart crashed round like a maddened rottweiler bumping into everyone the crowd were on their feet yelling their heads off now they were down the flyers end and seb dommie ricky and dancer were all taking desperate swipes at the ball until it was buried trodden deep into the ground with everyone frantically looking for it until the whistle went after a lot of shouting the ball was dug out and thrown in where it had been buried twenty yards in front of goal this is very dangerous for the flyers warned terry hanlon the fat is in the fire the chips are in the pan get it out screamed red as the frantically thrashing sticks hit ponies and players legs indiscriminately in a churning whirlpool of mud then godgiven the ball rolled out on perditas side at last she had a chance to redeem herself and get the ball back upfield throwing herself forward her fingers in her slippery glove lost control of her stick which totally mishit the ball oh no please god no she screamed in horror as the ball slowly trickled between her own goal posts for a second the goal judge seemed as stunned as she was then slowly up went the flag once again barts anguished howl of rage was drowned by the sound of the bell and it was all over and ricky was shaking hands with everyone and thanking shark and drew who abandoning any attempt at impartiality put his arm round rickys shoulders yelling fucking fucking marvellous dancer was crying openly you did it you bleedin did it he shouted at the twins you bleeding did it shouted back seb you hooked red when he would have scored the winning goal didnt he dommie but dommie was streaking up the field as fast as tired little corporal could carry him and was next seen locked in an ecstatic louisas arms little chef darting through equine and human legs as the crowd spilled overjoyed on to the pitch took a flying leap on to rickys saddle frantically licking away the tears of joy that striped his masters blackened face we won cheffie ricky babbled to him incoherently we fucking did it cheffie mishearing him a maddened bart stopped in his tracks you may have won the cup you asshole but you wont get her shes fucking mine bewildered for an instant ricky realized that in the joy of winning hed forgotten all about chessie as he rode off the field shaking hands with everyone louisa extricating herself from dommies embrace ran up to him oh its so lovely waynes won best playing pony seb shaking up a magnum of champagne made everyone even wetter than they were already terry hanlon had to exert all his vocal skills to get things on course for the presentation put your cigarettes out before you come up he chided the teams well have the bad boys first as seb sauntered up he turned grinning to the jostling reporters and cameramen and made a very pointed vsign too many late nights indeed goodnaturedly they cheered and whooped rickys face was impassive as he accepted the huge glittering cup from lord cowdray but later when it was filled with champagne he grimly raised it to chessie who was making no attempt to contain her delight bart couldnt make a scene because of the germans but the moment hed seen them into one of his helicopters he unleashed his fury on perdita it was entirely her fault for fouling and scoring an own goal at the end comes of playing with a fucking broad of all the fucking stupid things to do he yelled to the edification of the entire pony lines red was even more lethally nasty until angel put an arm round the hysterically sobbing perdita eet could appen to anybody he protested eef you hadnt got hooked because you were messing around in front of goal theyd never ave caught up shut up screamed red and for christs sake stop blubbing perdita it wasnt her fault shouted angel piss off said bart i dont pay you to have opinions he found chessie talking to lord cowdray stuck into her third glass of champagne and looking radiant were leaving he snapped how very unsporting said chessie i wanted to watch the second match well you cant two more teams were doing a lap of honour before playing off for third place as perdita raced towards barts helicopter blinded by tears she ran slap into a man stalking in the other direction cant you look where youre fucking going she screamed then gasped and shrank away for it was rupert for a second they gazed at each other assessing the damage im sorry sobbed perdita i didnt mean to screw up your life im sorry taggie cant have babies and im sorry i played so badly i cant do anything right any more when i dumped about mum i didnt know i was your child id never have hurt you deliberately ive just lost the mmatch for them redll never talk to me again please let me come and explain please help me hysterically she clung to him im not fucking social security said rupert his eyes suddenly as cold as an eskimos graveyard and theres no way youre my child no campbellblack could ever ride as badly as you just did as the rain came down again mingling with her tears and running nose perdita gave a wail and stumbled away from him as she clambered into the helicopter chessie was saying happily oh look bart ive just found your lucky belt under the seat back at robinsgrove next morning ricky still high on euphoria was the only member of apocalypse not laid waste by a hangover clutching their heads groaning some of them still drunk the grooms leant against the tired ponies as they walked them out for ricky to inspect wayne had an inflamed tendon and had been ordered a few days box rest the others except for a few cuts and bruises were miraculously free from injury so ricky ordered them to be turned out for fortyeight hours leaning on the gate he fondly watched them revelling in the sunshine walking pokerlegged at first then realizing they were free breaking into a canter crinkly tails flying and charging down the valley to roll and cool their bruised legs in the stream which raced and hurled itself against the rocks after yesterdays deluge although his ash trees were still a feathery bluegreen without a trace of yellow ricky could see the slow beginnings of autumn the toasting of the beeches the gilding of the poplars the occasional tree garlanded by acidgreen travellers joy the barley beyond the stables slowly losing its green flecks but for once the prospect of winter didnt depress him the telephone had rung all morning patrons suddenly wondering if there was any chance he could play for them next year friends to congratulate newspapers wanting quotes one would have thought the powers of darkness had fallen the morning papers were equally ecstatic flyers francelynched said the times which was a slight exaggeration when they had only been beaten by an own goal flyers bomb said the telegraph the tabloids concentrated on dancers delight and perditas anguish with variations on ruperts rejected daughter auriels toyboy barts fury all reporting the grisly details of the shouting match afterwards looking at the boweddown heads of the barley still dripping with raindrops ricky was reminded of perdita yesterday sobbing bitterly ashamed and desolate he had talked to daisy earlier that morning and persuaded her not to weaken looks as though reds on the way out thank god let her come back in her own time returning to the yard ricky went into waynes box to find him lying down asleep but as he sat down in the straw wayne opened a baleful blackringed eye whickered and accepting several barley sugars listened attentively as his master took him through every stroke of the chukka in which he had seen off the great glitz we won my brave wayne we won ricky told him exultantly the telephone was ringing again remembering the grooms had the day off ricky sprinted into the kitchen hello rick said the scorpion congrats on beating your exwifes hubby your ex seemed over the moon any chance of a reconciliation fffuck off said ricky the telephone rang again immediately ricky snatched it up fffuck off hello hello it was brigadier hughie thought you might like to know that its rumoured that youre going up to ten replacing the receiver ricky took it off the hook and picking up the cup already covered in a thousand ecstatic fingerprints held it up to the light we won cheffie we won little chef thumped his curly tail and sniffed appreciatively at the chicken his master was cooking for him as a celebratory treat neither had eaten much yesterday then he gave a strangled croak all he could manage after barking himself hoarse yesterday and shot off into the yard still hugging the cup ricky wandered into the hall holding it up for the photographs of his grandfather uncles and father to see i did it you old bbbuggers you look like one of the wise men bearing gold melchior was it ricky almost dropped the cup for there in the kitchen doorway stood chessie as i was ripped untimely from yesterdays celebration she drawled i thought id come and congratulate you personally i see you havent painted anything except the stables since i left wandering back into the kitchen she noticed that the shelves from which shed swiped all her recipe books were piled high with old copies of horse and hound and polo magazine the spice shelves were down to salt pepper and mixed herbs she could smell that there was no tarragon in the chicken ricky was cooking a calendar for the year shed walked out still hung on the wall probably because it bore a photograph of a whippet who looked like millicent the washing machine black inside with apocalypse shirts quivered on pause she turned to ricky who was still holding the cup and staring at her arent you pleased to see me i dont know all he knew was that the sun had gone in and the cup had lost its glitter chessie was wearing a clinging black jump suit sawn off at the knees with a tshirt top clinched in with yesterdays leather belt she appeared to be wearing no makeup at all but in fact had spent twenty minutes smudging blueblack shadow and a subtle blending of green and beige base to make herself look tired frail and wildly desirable ricky felt himself churning got a hangover she asked i dont drink i thought you might have made an exception it is the first rung i know said ricky flatly the slav face was impassive above the high cheekbones his eyes were as dark as the rainsoaked cedars in the churchyard everyones saying youll go to ten at the end of the season all you have to do is win the westchester her voice was mocking can i have a look round sauntering to the window showing off the slightness of her figure she caught sight of wayne who having decided to get up was now leaning nosily out of his box to see what his master was up to is that mattie how clever of me to remember names thought chessie mattie was put down if you remember the day you first slept with bart chessie didnt hesitate oh yes how stupid of me putting the cup down he followed her into the hall youve let the moth get at that tapestry and look at the damp she said reprovingly this place needs a womans touch pity i cant touch bart for a million to do it up rickys cards were still up from his birthday in february along with an easter egg violet had given him for letting her drive in his fields absentmindedly he started breaking it up and giving pieces to little chef what dyou want he said bleakly to talk she looked him straight in the eyes to find out if you still want me dont be bloody silly her eyes moved to his mouth and back to his eyes again glancing at him under her lashes then smiling slowly in a way that had always destroyed him shall we go to bed she whispered whos up there the twins and dancer all with assorted partners christ the twins are such gossips theyd fax bart in dusseldorf with the news in two minutes fretfully chessie crossed the room noticing a lalique bowl and a rockingham dalmatian from her side of the family if she were coming back to stay there was no need to take them the dust was awful didnt ricky have a char any more then a shaft of sunlight suddenly illuminated wills portrait oh my god thats beautiful taking it off the wall she examined it more closely its stunning so like him oh christ he was sweet for the first time there was genuine emotion in her voice as she longingly caressed the blond hair and the round roguish face it was his birthday last week i know yet again ricky felt the whole buckling weight of responsibility for wills death im sorry i was a good mother wasnt i of course lied ricky god its a brilliant likeness she looked down at the portrait again let me have it i cant chessies face hardened you owe it to me i know ricky had gone yellow almost parsnipcoloured but it was a present who painted it perhaps he could do a copy for me its a her daisy macleod perditas mother ah chessie put the painting down on the piano as though it had suddenly dropped ten thousand pounds in value ive met her very blowzy the habituée of orgies a bicycle made for six in fact shes sweet said ricky coldly chessies eyebrows vanished beneath her fringe how did she get such a good likeness she found a photograph tucked in an old polo book chessie went to the drinks tray wiped the dust out of the inside of a glass with her sleeve and sloshed in a lot of vodka and very little tonic did daisy daisy do all those drawings of the horses in the kitchen yes making herself very much at home said chessie downing half her drink shut up said ricky losing his temper you know its only you i love well hold me then reeling with desire his heart pounding like a cannon ricky breathed in the diorissimo shed sprayed in her hair noticed the sweat beading the faint down of blonde hairs on her upper lip like a man returning to a once familiar house who halfremembers where the light switches are he fumbled for one of her hardened nipples then stretched his hand over the wonderful springiness surrounding it oh my dddarling next moment they both jumped out of their quivering skins as the door burst open and in barged eddie macleod oh there you are ricky sorry to bother you but we couldnt get through on the telephone ethel had five puppies at five oclock this morning three black and two brindle all with curly tails so mum thinks little chef must be the father not decorum would you like to come and see them and can i get mums sketch book from her studio ethels such a good mother shes licked them all clean and shes awfully proud we buried the afterbirth and whos that said chessie when ricky finally managed to evict eddie perditas brother and mum daisy daisy has a studio here the attic room said ricky evenly noone was using it and she uses your library too making herself very much at home ricky glared at chessie its my house stop being a bitch i thought ethel was the bitch are you going to be godfather to those puppies chessie looked through the window at the housemartins catching insects and at the stable cat pretending to sleep on the warm gravel waiting for birds to swoop down and attack the peas and raspberries noone had had time to pick i just wondered she said softly if you were sucking up to daisy as a prospective motherinlaw dont be fatuous exploded ricky he had forgotten chessies relentless nitpicking jealousy daisy needed somewhere to paint snow cottage is minute it must have been like playing polo on a tennis court im sorry examining her reflection in the queens cup which having been won only six weeks ago was still quite shiny chessie licked her finger wiped away a smudge of mascara and smiled the adorable child again why dont we go out for a discreet lunch we could go to laperitif i havent been there since we split up i cant cant mondays your day off ricky gritted his teeth ive got to take violet out to lunch and whos violet chessies fingers were drumming on the top of the piano daisys daughter she passed her driving test first go last week and i said id take her out to lunch cancel it ordered chessie i promised her boyfriend chucked her after all that stuff in the scorpion shes been terribly low jesus screamed chessie surely us getting it together is more important daisy was very good to me said ricky carefully when i was stupid with misery over losing you she listened shes a friend we can have dinner this evening ill have got rid of dancer and the twins by then his face was as deadpan as ever but there was no denying the longing and conciliation in his voice chessie however was miffed i cant barts only gone to dusseldorf for the day hes coming back tonight and we cant rock the bart shut up im the one who makes jokes round here ricky felt an appalling weariness lets get one thing clear i love you only you but ive survived without you for six years christ knows how and im not prepared for halfmeasures youve got to leave bbbart and come back for good how do i know its for my own good it wasnt before we need to get to know each other again seeing that rickyd left the telephone off she slammed it back on its hook as she charged out of the house then drove off in such a cloud of dust that the stable cat jumped up from the gravel and wayne ducked back inside his box slumped in despair against the wall ricky reached out to answer the telephone it was violet whispering ecstatically oh ricky julians just turned up he says hes so sorry about everything dyou mind terribly if we have lunch another day washing up last nights supper and todays breakfast in cold water because violet had pinched all the hot daisy thought gloomily of the mountain of clothes to be ironed and the childrens trunks which she still hadnt tackled and which festered in their rooms full of dirty clothes and probably in eddies case ancient tuck she felt absolutely wiped out because shed been up all night acting as ethels midwife but she knew shed perk up in an instant just as violet had if drew rang he hadnt been in touch for weeks she was jolted with hope as the doorbell went shaking her hair loose from its elastic band she opened the door and was astounded to see chessie hi that wicked sleepy smile was as menacing as it was irresistible i loathe droppersin myself but i didnt have your telephone number conscious of her bloodstained shirt her straining jeans and her shiny face daisy said come in after chessied showed absolutely no interest in the puppies and daisyd opened her last bottle of wine which she was saving for drew they went into the garden taking up opposite ends of a peeling bench which daisy was always meaning to paint ive come for two reasons three really said chessie i want to thank you for looking after ricky he says youve been wonderful really daisy perked up wonderful i dont think hes ever had a platonic woman friend before daisy unperked you must have got so bored with him banging on and on about me went on chessie daisy got up and broke off a columbine that was bending double a pale blue delphinium rickys not boring he loves you but he never bangs on does about polo chessie pulled off a piece of paint anyway i feel i owe you ive got very fond of perdita over the years she said untruthfully oh god said daisy miserably i feel so awful you shouldnt it wasnt your fault how is she pretty low particularly after losing us the match yesterday needs her mum actually but too proud to admit it im going to talk to her tonight and see if i can bring you two together thats terribly kind said daisy perhaps shed misjudged chessie itd be wonderful and you can do one thing for me in return drawled chessie shell have stripped that bench in a minute thought daisy ive just seen your painting of will continued chessie its stunning one day i want you to do me a copy but what i really want is its barts fiftieth birthday next week and hes pretty disgruntled about it particularly after yesterday could you possibly paint me in the nude as a surprise for him no thought daisy in horror its terribly sweet of you she said out loud im really honoured but ive got about four commissions ive simply got to finish oh please itd be such fun im in such a muddle i feel i need someone like you to talk to in the end chessie offered her so much money that daisy couldnt refuse daisy had never disliked a commission so much day after day she was taunted by chessies naked beauty as chessie babbled on as relentlessly as the frogsmore about how she and ricky loved each other and how perhaps the portrait would end up as second wedding present for him and how bart was so old and how she didnt want to end up looking after him when he was old and crotchety and boy hed be crotchety daisy got lower and lower particularly when ricky dropped in to see ethels puppies and found chessie in residence on daisys saxeblue sofa with her body as warm and brown and tempting as new bread from the oven she had made no attempt to get dressed and ricky shooting daisy a murderous look as though it was all her fault had stormed out by contrast little chef popped down twice a day to kiss lick and clean ethels eyes ears and nose to examine his offspring with obvious delight and then to curl up for an hour on the priceless clothes chessie dropped so casually on the floor daisy wished drew were as attentive he still hadnt rung all the telephone calls that week were for chessie usually when she wasnt there say ive just left whatever time bart rings insisted chessie or to explain one day when she wasnt going to turn up at daisys at all just tell him youve reached a really tricky bit and i cant come to the telephone but i send him a huge kiss and ill be home around seven shes seeing ricky thought daisy and was amazed how desolate she felt having now spent some time in chessies company she was now utterly convinced she would only make ricky miserable if they got together again ashamed of disliking her so much daisy also totally sabotaged any artistic integrity by making chessie even more beautiful than she was and giving her face a soft wistful sweetness it certainly didnt possess chessie was enchanted and left on the saturday afternoon giving daisy a huge hug and a fat cheque which would at least pay for eddies school fees next year violets trip round the world and a new dress for daisy but what was the point of that if drew never rang again in a furious urge to work off her depression she painted chessie again with a glittering rhinestone for a face and a viciously cruel angular body totally cased in a chainmail of selfabsorption it was one of the only surrealistic paintings shed ever done and a much truer likeness exhausted she took ethel for a quick walk venus was rising to the left as ethel splashed through the brilliant green watercress and forgetmenots which clogged rickys stream i move the sweet forgetmenots that grow for happy lovers thought daisy despairingly a vast black cloud massed threateningly along the horizon like a tidal wave about to engulf her what worse things could happen in her life but as she wandered home through the buddleiascented evening she saw a darkgreen mini draw up outside her front door with a jerk not more press then she froze worse than press sukey benedict had got out and was waving like a restrained goal judge i was in the area and thought id pop in and say hellair what a darling cottage and how charming youve made the garden this was untrue the lawn like a hayfield towered higher than the flower beds which were a holidaylet to weeds even worse the coat rack had collapsed in the hall so sukey and daisy had to mountaineer over a hillock of barbours and bomber jackets into the kitchen where two days washingup jammed the sink im sorry muttered daisy ive been finishing a painting if sukey insisted on seeing round she thought nervously she might unearth the nude of drew in the potting shed would you like a drink sukey hesitated im driving id love a cup of tea daisy desperate for vodka had to winkle two cups out of the sink and wash them in the upstairs bathroom but sukey didnt seem to notice anything she sat down at the kitchen table playing with one of the yellow roses in a blue vase which promptly collapsed in a shower of petals shed always worn her trousers loose to deemphasize her bottom but now they were so loose they were almost hipsters and too loose to contain her striped shirt which was done up on the wrong buttons a long lock of mousey hair escaped from a most inappropriate alice band of red velvet dotted with seed pearls it was like seeing mrs thatcher with a punk rocker hairstyle chewing gum thought daisy despite the muggy warmth of the day sukey was shivering uncontrollably thank you so much as she took the cup and saucer it was difficult to tell where daisys rattle ended and hers began there was a dreadful silence im not very good at confiding in people sukey looked down at her big rubberglovecherished hands daddy was in the foreign office and we never talked about feelings i came to you daisy because you always seem such a sweet person its about drew actually the room darkened daisy knew the tidal wave was going to drown her never admit to anything drew had always insisted but she was such a dreadful liar i knew drew married me for my money sukey was busy dismembering another yellow rose hes so fritefly attractive it couldnt be for any other reason then when daisy murmured in protest ive been awfully happy really even though hes always had other women drew the solid the utterly dependable thought daisy aghast she felt like the conjurors blondehaired assistant who hears sawing and realizes shes got into the wrong box are you sure oh one knows hes away so much claiming to stay at his club when i later discovered it was closed down for the summer meetings he said hed been to then finding apologies for his absence in the minutes a month later beautiful girls seeking me out at parties then being particularly nice out of relief that i wasnt pretty girl grooms suddenly getting cheeky daisy could definitely feel the teeth of the magicians saw grazing her side now didnt you mind she asked in a strangled voice of course i love him the worst bit was one au pair very pretty who left in a hurry to work as a chalet girl drew must have met up with her again when he was playing snow polo last christmas afterwards she wrote and gave me all the details of all the other girls hed slept with he got eight valentines this year how many times had drew sworn she was the only other woman hed ever slept with since hed been married how horrible she moaned suddenly nauseated by a waft of cat food bending down to pick up the plate she saw it was crawling with maggots gagging she threw it in the bin suddenly she remembered sukey shaking and shaking the tears pouring down her face when angel had knocked drew off malteser in the queens cup did you confront him she whispered he denied it said sukey sadly said the girl was a bit potty and obsessive and he adored me and the children and would never leave us i know its vulgar to talk about it sukey was frenziedly pleating the tablecloth but he still makes love to me three or four times a week i never say no to him and drew had sworn that once the children were born they had had a manage blanc the tidal wave had passed over leaving an aeroplane trail across a vermilion sky like a newly stitched scar seeing skin had formed on sukeys tea daisy snatched it away lets have a drink im afraid theres only vodka she added diet coke and ice i could cope with casual flings said sukey but this time i think hes really serious about someone i was doing his vat this afternoon hes gone to america for a couple of days to fix up playing in the us open and some other tour before the westchester i know its utterly despicable but i went through his amex and his cheque stubs hes been spending a fortune on flowers and hotel bills and restaurants this month and theres a bill back in may for a diamond and topaz brooch for five thousand pounds thats my daisy brooch thought daisy appalled perhaps it was for you she said quickly im capricorn like drew said sukey tonelessly daisy suddenly felt bitterly ashamed and utterly suicidal at the same time one doesnt mean to be mean continued sukey ive got a private income but its always been a bit of a struggle to make ends meet polos awfully expensive and the childrenll be starting school soon i never minded going without things but when i find all his earnings being blued on other women and im paying for his ponies and everything else even his subscription to boodles it makes one a bit bitter the magicians saw was definitely deep in daisys flesh now tearing away bone and muscle who is she bibi alderton drew hid some letters under his mattress they werent that passionate just passionately grateful for drew being so kind to her and theres been a lot of dropped telephone calls and he keeps urging me to go out and walk the dogs and although he claims noones rung the telephone reeks of his aftershave when i get home i had that with hamish said daisy she shivered too at how often shed breathed in the tangy lemony smell on drews beautiful strong brown neck and jaw and felt faint with longing its awfully easy to imagine these things she added helplessly sukey shook her head i was staying with mummy last week drewd been invited to dinner with rupert and taggie you know what a wonderful cook she is drew described every course when i got back unfortunately i met taggie in sainsburys the day drewd left for america and she said she was so sorry drewd only stayed for a quick drink and she hoped the pony with colic was ok well i checked with the grooms very casually they said none of the horses had been sick its so revolting one gets just like miss marple theres this ghastly sick exultation in the detective work then when you stumble on the truth its the gates of hell but i always felt drew wouldnt leave me she raised streaming eyes to daisy because he needs my money to play polo but bibi alderton could buy me out a hundred times over putting her face in her hands she burst into tears rushing round the table daisy put her arms round her please please dont cry hes a bastard hes not worth it why youre crying too said sukey as she dried her eyes a couple of minutes later youre so kind daisy you really mind for me dont you i shouldnt have dumped on you all this must remind you of your own marriage breaking up so much what dyou think i ought to do i love him so so much id sit tight said daisy then thought what a stupid expression shed been tight for days after hamish left her from what i gather angel and bibi are still very snarled up about each other angels gorgeous but hes been playing bibi up dreadfully because shes such a workaholic and she probably wants to make him jealous and drews probably only flirting with bibi because he wants to get his own back on angel for jabbing pelhams into his kidneys and trying to break his jaw itd be so lovely if you were right said sukey have another drink daisy felt a ghastly sick masochistic craving for more detail no i must go sukey got to her feet rubbing her eyes like a child she had no mascara to smear our nannys got a first date with our local bobby so romantic hes awfully goodlooking with lovely blue eyes rather like drews her voice broke again i love him so much daisy with sukey gone daisy wandered distraught into the garden the sweet tobacco scent of buddleia was cloying almost overpowering now she knew she would hate the smell for ever as a reminder of paradise lost the owls were hooting from the woods she had never seen that much of drew because of the children and because hed been away so much but it had been such a heavenly affair and with his apparent utter integrity and strength he had restored her faith in men in anguish she realized that dreaming about him and looking forward to seeing him again had been the one thing that had made her life bearable how stupid not to realize that if a mans capable of being unfaithful to his wife hes bound to be unfaithful to you as she sobbed in the darkness there was noone to hear her except the hooting owls and the swooping bats if anyone was more miserable than daisy that night it was perdita wandering barefoot two hundred miles away through an infinitely more beautiful sussex garden where totally weedless herbaceous borders towered above shaven lawns and stone nymphs blanched by the moonlight frolicked at the end of rides battlemented with yews floodlighting cast a golden glow on the splendid georgian house bart had acquired as his english base chessie and bart inhabited the heart of the house angel without bibi smouldered in the west wing perdita and red appropriately waged cold war in the east wing feeling mossy stone steps cool beneath her feet perdita could see into barts and chessies jadegreen drawing room where the chippendale table acquired specially to display the gold cup had on barts insistence been left bare to remind and punish perdita reds definition of a great player was one who raised his game when the chips were down lukes slightly different was someone who could pick himself off the floor and rise above mistakes that had brought a whole team down but perdita wasnt given the chance because bart had dropped her from the team after the gold cup and without her the flyers had already notched up two dazzling victories in the cowdray challenge cup she was suffering a total loss of confidence she was still reeling from ruperts total rejection and now at the time of year when patrons were making up their teams for next year the telephone only rang for red and angel for the first time people were whispering that she was committing that deadliest sin in polo playing below her handicap even worse she couldnt stop crying which drove red crazy when he was awake the moment his head hit the pillow he fell asleep leaving perdita to toss and turn tormented by visions of him and chessie but not daring to crossquestion him crawling with frustration praying that forgetting the impasse he would reach out for her when he was halfasleep but he didnt they hadnt made love since the marathon at the savoy by day he was frantically busy playing for bart making up his mind whether to play in saratoga deauville hawaii or sotogrande in august and revving up for the cartier international on sunday special tension had been added to this occasion because the first match of the afternoon between england and america would be a trial for the westchester an american team consisting of red the newly naturalized angel bobby ferraro and bart standing in for shark whod been sidelined by a shoulder injury were to play ricky drew and the repulsive napiers which was the squad england planned to field in the westchester in october as the americans wouldnt have unlimited access to ponies as they would in a home match and they werent fielding their first team it would bode ill for the westchester venturer and the sponsors if england didnt walk it bart red and angel thirsting to avenge their defeat in the gold cup were determined to rattle the brits perdita had earlier returned from london where shed been seeing a specialist about a sprained wrist to find the house empty except for servants chessie was out somewhere at least she couldnt be with red as hed gone with angel and bart to a dinner and team meeting she could no longer read or listen to records or even concentrate on television red having rendered her utterly deficient in resources anticipating a long wait she had poured herself a second vodka and tonic and wandered off into the garden she was wearing the silk pyjamas red had given her in singapore the stars littered the sky like confetti oh god would red ever marry her now but to her amazement he was home in tearing spirits just before ten hi baby he held out his arms perdita bolted into them frantically covering his face with kisses before finding his mouth ive been so unhappy she wailed when he finally let her go i thought youd never forgive me i love you i love you good red patted her cheek and ill love you back if youll stop throwing wobblies you know how scenes bore me fix me a drink sweetheart ive been on diet coke all evening to impress brad dillon brad dillon the american team manager formerly a brigadier in the us marines a hero both in korea and vietnam was despite his macho exterior a strict teetotaller and expected similar temperance from his team how was the team meeting joyously perdita kissed the whisky bottle before splashing it into a glass acrimonious dads flown in juan obrien to advise the team he had a row with angel the brits are in a panic they dont want angel at number three in case he murders drew benedict at number two so there was talk of him playing number two and me going to number one christ the humiliation i threatened to quit so im playing three and angel one the brits have been absolute dickheads and lent us some seriously good ponies americans would never do that its crazy like giving the viet cong a lot of bs ive been trying them out all afternoon he halfemptied his glass in one gulp thats better for a second he appraised perditas back view as she poured herself a third vodka youre losing too much weight moving forward feeling for her breasts he nuzzled the back of her neck perdita felt her stomach curling and missed the glass with the vodka bottle wiping it off the polished table with her sleeve your game may be off murmured red into her hair but youre ace at making ponies what dyou mean heres the good news brad dillon and juan want me to play tero tomorrow afternoon tero utterly outraged perdita tried to swing round but unwilling to meet her eyes red held on to her shes hardly had a man on her back since argentina you know how fucked up she was when i went off to singapore shell be terrified terofied mocked red she went like a dream i played a chukka on her this afternoon juan reckons shell do two chukkas we saw a video of the gold cup this afternoon he went on trying to railroad her into submission juan said i dont mark closely enough so im not going to let you out of my sight in future his hand slid down to her groin lets go to bed dont get off the subject and dont softsoap me stormed perdita youre not riding tero ive spent nearly a year getting her confidence back im not letting you fuck her up just for one match dont be so unbritish teased red who was fast losing his conciliatory manner i am not letting you ride her in the parade let alone a single chukka letting her go he reached for his drink then picked up her left hand and examined the huge sapphire after all ive done for you he said softly and you deny me seven or at most fifteen minutes when im playing for my country teros different stammered perdita you bet she is with me on her back shes a good pony you bastard yelled perdita drink fuelling her aggression then jumped at the baying of barts rottweilers oh fucking hell chessies back look what ive got for your fathers big five o said chessie sauntering into the room pulling the portrait out of its wrapping paper she propped it up on a green and white striped sofa red whistled talk about a glow job you look angelic but kinda overdressed why didnt you take off my fathers wedding ring while you were about it oh shut up said chessie but not unamiably perditas hostility however could have frozen bread straight from the oven my mother painted that she hissed thats our sittingroom sofa needs reupholstering like your mother said chessie my cheque should help its a bloody conspiracy how did you get on to her i bet she wrote smarming to you whats she been saying about me chessie looked at her meditatively she misses you she said i thought she was rather a nice old thing quite charming really good at charming snakes like you ay yay yay chessies eyes widened whats got into her she said turning to red obviously not you or she wouldnt be so badtempered red wants to ride tero in the international my pony she added scornfully when chessie looked blank thats great said chessie people fall over themselves to lend ponies for the international youll sell her for three times as much afterwards particularly with red on her back and just think the whole world will be watching her the whole polo world or rather of them gathered at the guards club next day for the cartier international the ritziest event in the polo calendar the blustery weather seemed to be reflecting the tensions of the two teams clouds raced across the sky as a warm but frenzied southwest wind whipped off panamas murdered hairstyles stripped the petals from the red roses clambering up the clubhouse and fretted the fleet of hospitality tents that lined the pitch like yachts in a regatta all morning so their employers could get plastered chauffeurs driving everything from minis to rollers edged into the parking lot where picnickers consumed vast quantities of quiche smoked salmon and chicken drumsticks and drank pimms out of paper cups only the jadegreen statue of prince albert on his splendid charger gazed bleakly northwards away from such manic guzzling and later from the play as if he were blocking some distant shot angel escaped into one of the lavatories in the players changing rooms so noone could muddle him with more advice he was outraged that guards club officials themselves outraged that the yanks had put him in their team had insisted on frisking him on arrival he was livid he was playing number one what chance would he have of scoring with the ground drying unevenly and the wind whisking the ball in every direction his heart blackened in hatred against drew the enemy whom he now suspected of cuckolding him how could he not kill him he was about to play for a country belonging to a wife who had deserted him against a country he loathed he had spent last night painting a white banner with the words the falklands belong to argentina which he had smuggled in with the tack and intended to brandish during the presentation perdita even more miserable and isolated huddled in the stands next to the royal box she wore dark glasses to hide her reddened eyes and the fact that there was no sun in the sky or in her life after rowing with red all night terrified of losing him shed let him ride tero now hed banished her from the pony lines you screwed my sleep i dont want you hanging around dispensing gratuitous advice the wind was taking everyones skirts over their heads girls with good legs seemed less embarrassed reflected perdita she tipped angels sombrero further over her nose for there arriving with bas were rupert and taggie taggie seemed to have solved the force ten problem by wearing a sandcoloured suit with shorts instead of a skirt showing off her long beautiful legs over her shoulders was thrown a huge crimson cashmere shawl from her ears hung long silver earrings both birthday presents from rupert he could give her everything in the world except a baby with her dark hair lifting and her bright crimson lips as smooth as a tulip she looked absolutely gorgeous as usual rupert never took his arm off her shoulders from the moment they sat down perditas heart twisted with envy and loneliness would he never recognize her now the celebrities whod come to be looked at vying to take their seats later than each other were streaming out of the cartier tent replete with champagne lobster chicken supreme and peaches poached in sancerre as they looked for their seats they flashed allembracing smiles at their public ive just seen a beegee go by boomed miss lodsworth as ringo starr passed by her seat up the gangway looked like a monkey to me said mrs hughie who are the monkeys asked brigadier hughie those chimps who have tea on television no no a dance band said mrs hughie you remember the monkeys when the children were young we had a monkey in borneo said brigadier hughie dear little chap had to leave him behind when i was posted to malaya expect its prime minister now muttered rupert a ripple of excitement went through the crowd as juan obrien walked into the stands in a blazer of glory hailing acquaintances hooarn hooarn cried lady sharon welcome welcome or rather bienvenida back to inglesias are you going to be allowed to play next year daves mad about the idea several members of the guards club turned purple and started muttering about bluff cove rapping out commands on his walkietalkie covering a field as flawless and as expectant as a newly laid carpet strode major ferguson the buttons on his blazer gleamed brighter even than the brass instruments of the band of the irish guards in their bloodred tunics suddenly the photographers abandoned the celebrities and shot off to concentrate on the prince and princess of wales whod just arrived and were shaking hands in the royal box only a couple of wagtails looking for worms took no notice on came the skewbald drum horse and his life guards rider in his gold coat followed by the american team the stars and stripes streaming out behind them angel his face still as a gold coin sulked because hed just been sharply ordered to put out his cigarette big bobby ferraro on a walleyed sorrel his hat on the back of his head had his mouth open at all the pomp bart was in a state of ecstasy at achieving two ambitions to ride for his country and meet the princess of wales red aware of the crowds adulation was the only one grinning broadly and hes riding tero thought perdita in fury how dare he tero looked petrified her pewter coat lathering up like a washing machine primed with too much daz big eyes darting ears disappeared against her pretty head as red held her in an iron grip nor did perdita know that four grooms as well as angel bart and bobby had had to hold her in the pony lines to enable red to get on her back the british team followed ricky very pale drew very red from hangover and jet lag the napiers very ugly and saturnine at the clash of cymbals in god save the queen the drum horse took off only red sawing savagely at her mouth stopped tero following suit up in his glass box the commentator terry hanlon failed to make the bootfaced english team laugh by pulling faces at them then thanked cartier for sponsoring the coronation cup as each member of the teams cantered forward to take a bow red got five times as many screams of excitement as all the others i should never have let him ride tero thought perdita bitterly not even terry hanlon thanking sir david waterlane sir victor kaputnik kevin coley and perdita macleod for lending ponies to the americans could placate her the first chukka went straight into polo history because at the end of it the americans were up with six of the goals scored by red the contemptuous smile hardly leaving his face it was as though hed already seen a video of the match and knew exactly where the ball was going he and tero achieving one of those miraculous fusions between rider and pony that happens once in a lifetime fear had given wings to teros oiled hooves as she streaked after the ball a blue greyhound chasing an arctic hare but at the same time her stopping and turning were so automatic her positioning near the ball so exact that she seemed hardly to need a rider on her back except as a scoring machine perdita was torn between pride and utter humiliation particularly as the crowd seethed with speculation around her juan brought that grey over no he didnt bart brought it for from jesuss brother shes worth it said bas christ look at that acceleration isnt that perditas pony asked taggie couldnt be said bas dismissively she was never that good it is said rupert just needed a decent rider on her back while america settled into a smooth rhythm england were in total disarray a quartet of prima donnas each used to captaining his own side totally deficient in team spirit marking badly never in position ricky in despair was resorting to his old tricks doing too much and exhausting his ponies drew was just tired the napiers barged about bullies in china shops bellowing with frustration by halftime the score was and the crowd were reading their programmes as the americans rode back to the pony lines their knees bumped the brits rode apart four thunderclouds symbolizing their alienation a square of pitch in front of the royal box where the presentation would later be made was temporarily roped off so the crowd could close in and gaze at the prince and princess of wales babies in prams were wheeled over from the opposite stand two jack russells a pug and a cairn in a green scarf were held aloft by their owners to have a good look after halftime the english steadied red riding tero again stepped up his game and in his enthusiasm had three fouls blown on him he redeemed himself by galloping across goal and blocking the penalties with a couple of amazing tennis volleys and finally with teros head just below the eyes bastard screamed perdita as in anguish she watched tero shaking her head frantically back and forth but her protests were drowned by the roar of the crowd as angel picked up the ball and took it upfield riding drew off with unnecessary violence thatll teach you to seduce my wife he hissed fucking gigolo howled drew wondering whether angels elbow had broken his rib david waterlane who was umpiring gave england another penalty and what can red alderton do this time said terry hanlon once more red flew out blocking the shot with teros shoulders and bringing perdita screaming to her feet rupert and bas were almost as upset with england putting up such a pathetic performance their collossal investment in the westchester was looking increasingly precarious come on england youre playing like assholes yelled rupert get your fucking fingers out ben and charles napier are supposed to be nine said bas but when they play together theyre about four theyre not putting their backs into it because you dont get paid for an international god hes handsome said a beauty behind perdita as red scored again a lovely sweeping shot under teros neck if hes really chucked perdita macleod could you introduce me perdita gazed across the field to where a shining shingle of parked cars seemed to stretch to infinity i want to die she thought hell will be as welcoming as a log fire on a cold day compared with this and now red and charles napier were hurtling towards the boards inside which the ball was nestling red must bring tero down careful red for gods sake she screamed but the next second tero had hopped over the boards at full gallop and somehow straining every tendon had turned right in midair positioning red perfectly for an offside forehand enabling him to scoop the ball out and blast it to safety the crowd gave a sigh of ecstasy as the bell went for the end of the fourth chukka teros part in the match was over passionately relieved shoving protesting onlookers out of the way perdita raced down to the pony lines by which time red and glitz were back on the field she found tero heaving and gasping for breath as shed only seen ponies doing in the sweltering heat of palm beach with fourinch weals from reds whip dividing the sweat on her nearside flanks and quarters oh my poor baby moaned perdita what has that bastard done to you and you played so brilliantly ill murder him when i catch him but although apparently sound the little mare seemed utterly shellshocked not even responding to her mistress when she covered her with kisses perhaps it was total exhaustion perdita helped dry her off give her a polish and put on a couple of rugs she might win best playing pony she told barts groom manuel before going back to the stands for the last chukka where america still leading were beginning to get complacent red trying to block another shot leapt out before ricky had hit the penalty and a free goal was awarded to england ricky then scored two goals and angel missed an easy one furious with himself he swung his ponys head round inadvertently straight into drews face drew who was far more jet lagged than he had realized conscious of playing like a geriatric and fed up with angel histrionically twirling his stick above his head at every real contrived or imagined foul lost his temper you fucking greaseball he howled it was a meestake howled back angel the gold st christopher glittering in the damp bronze curls on his chest i teach you to race after my wife he hissed lifting his stick bad luck for her getting tied up with a gigolo snapped drew also raising his stick pack it in said david waterlane riding between them or ill send you both off tempers getting up on the field explained terry hanlon polos been called a game for gangsters played by gentlemen or a game for gentlemen played by gangsters they say you need a cool head and hot blood to play it and david waterlanes made the decision penalty to england while ricky converted the penalty red belted off to change ponies looking eastwards perdita noticed that the frantic activity in the pony lines had subsided and most of the grooms were lined up behind the scoreboard holding spare ponies and cheering on their respective sides then she stiffened it couldnt be snatching brigadier hughies binoculars and nearly strangling him she saw that red was actually galloping back on tero riding her for the third time which was against the rules crashing along the row of protesting spectators she tore down the steps sending a returning b a robertson flying red you cant please not she screamed from the second step shes exhausted youll kill her but once again as red thundered past her protests were drowned by the ecstatic screams from the crowd to the americans with four minutes to go at last england were in with a faint chance the crowd catching fire began to roar frantic with worry perdita watched only red tero was so game and willing shed give him her last ounce red picked up his whip suddenly the field seemed to stretch from one end of the world to the other as he galloped up and down hooking and fencing with his stick frantic to gain position two minutes to go taking advantage of a loose ball ricky scored again come on england shouted rupert in exultation you can do it at the throwin drew got it out and passed it to ricky who took off on kinta towards the posts whipped by red somehow tero caught up with them and grimly red closed in to ride ricky off tero like the good pony she was dropped her shoulder and shoved but kinta was almost twice the size and strength of her and she took the weight of the bump flying through the air and nearly going down on her foreend as brigadier hughies binoculars shook in perditas frantically trembling hands teros head seemed to be all white with lather her huge panicstricken eyes rolled as red yanked her round with all his strength to pick up the ball which bart had backed upfield bastard stop him screamed perdita from the steps but her cries were taken by the wind sit down yelled the crowd oblivious hands to her face she watched demented as red whipped tero almost the length of the field his spurs glinting in the sunshine as they stabbed at the little mares sides like the needle of a sewing machine at the last moment he passed to angel angel in turn waited until drew was almost on him before flicking the ball back to red who as tero strained herself for a final gallant effort leaned right out of the saddle stroking the ball between the posts almost as an afterthought on the bell the cheers ringing out politely for an american victory turned to cries of horror as like some ghastly danse macabre tero appeared to lose all coordination and red and she were both down rolling over and over red jumped to his feet somehow lurching drunkenly tero staggered up but she was heaving shuddering and careering round totally disconnected with all four legs sticking out straight christ shes broken something said dommie in horror heart attack snapped rupert in an instant ricky and drew had thrown their horses reins to the napiers and were running towards her followed by david waterlane jesus the other umpire and angel reaching her first ricky gently pushed tero to the ground where she quivered convulsively and went still frozen with horror perdita at last found her feet and ran down the steps jumping over the white fence dropping brigadier hughies binoculars angels sombrero and her bag out of which spilled her passport diary and all her makeup with the wind in her screaming mouth hair ribbing her blanched face she raced down the pitch past the stands past horrified faces in the royal box hurtling towards the little group outstripping the vets van bringing the screens pummelling ricky and drew out of the way lemme get at her falling to her knees and gathering up the ponys head which suddenly seemed as heavy as lead she cradled it in her lap tero darling for christs sake youre going to be ok youre just winded she sobbed but teros onceloving eyes were staring and glassy tero tero please please tears ripping her apart perdita dropped her head down on the ponys youve got to be all right youre all ive got i love you im afraid shes had it desperately trying to keep his voice steady ricky put a hand on perditas head she had loved tero as he had loved mattie hovering in the background holding the others ponies bobby ferraro and shark instinctively removed their helmets in respect and sympathy red seemed quite unmoved but angel was less reticent as the crowd stunned and silent watched the screens going round he crouched down beside perdita taking her in his arms pulling her head on to his shoulder crying himself he gabbled half in spanish she die playing best game of er life people will always remember her she cant be dead perdita pleaded with the vet make her better the vet shook his head cant im afraid absolutely tragic wonderful pony perdita went absolutely still for a second she watched the blood from reds spurs seeping down teros damp speckled flank staining the emerald grass cmon perdita said red in a shaken voice holding out his hand its only a pony could have happened at any time he added defensively angel had to hold on to perdita to stop her clawing reds face murderer she hissed through white lips you made me let you ride her you flogged her to death oh pack it in baby said red not unkindly its you im going to pack in sobbed perdita hysterically and im not a baby any more and not your baby ever again ive grown up in the last five minutes she had become so thin the huge sapphire slid off her finger easily flying through the air the departing bluebird of her happiness it crashed into reds chest let her go shes outlived her usefulness growled bart as leaping to her feet perdita fled past the battlements of shocked faces many of them in tears desperately looking for a way out she paused in front of the royal box he killed her she screamed did you see red kill her security guards and officials moved forward solicitously but taggie campbellblack was too quick for them stepping over the little white fence she ran forward tugging off her crimson shawl wrapping it round perdita im so sorry she was such a sweet pony you poor darling please dont cry youre coming home with us who what perdita gazed at taggie not registering rupert and i are taking you home explained taggie putting her arms round perditas shoulder but the next minute rupert had joined them rage that england had blown the match and venturer possibly millions bracketed with an almost pathological loathing of perdita made him totally irrational leave her fucking alone he yelled at taggie shell bite you like a rabid dog you dont owe her anything taggie went very white but stood her ground yes we do she pleaded look whats happened to her she needs you rupert ill take her said ricky pushing his way through the fastgathering photographers taking perdita from taggie he turned to rupert when are you going to stop being so pigheaded and recognize your own child it was part of the meticulous guards club organization that within seconds the afternoon was on course again ricky caused a few raised eyebrows and several accusations of bad sportsmanship when he missed the presentation this was probably just as well because a jubilant bart making thumbsup signs to chessie in the stands gloated so obscenely to the hovering press predicting that america would annihilate england in the westchester the object of all this conflict the coronation cup with its crownshaped lid gold writhing serpent handles and patterning of laurel leaves and strange faces rose serenely from its green baize table what a huge pot boomed miss lodsworth not hughies that cup silently the british team lined up longfaced eyes cast down utterly gloomy a total contrast to the laughing overjoyed americans out came princess diana in a silk dress that seemed woven from light blue and dark blue delphinium petals her high heels sinking into the grass up went bart to get the cup which was so heavy that the chairman of cartier had to help the princess hand it to him bart had to wipe away a tear as the band played the stars and stripes bobby ferraro was so overwhelmed to meet the princess that he seized her hands and kissed them to the delighted screams of the crowd angel followed red his falklands banner was tucked inside his shirt but he was so appalled by reds callousness to perdita and that red could now joke and smile so devastatingly down at the princess that he forgot to bring it out angel had planned so many gestures of revenge but all the loathing he felt towards the british seemed to evaporate when he went up to get his clock in its red velvet box and gazed into the kind blue eyes of the future queen of england and saw the red roses in her faintly flushed cheeks her detective fingered his gun whaddid she say to you whispered bart furiously when angel finally floated back to the lineup she say she very sorry my brozzer was keeled in malvinas said angel she ear he was jolly good player like er usband and argentine pilots was very brave and her brotherinlaw had flown elicopters in the malvinas and how worried his mother was about heem and she knew how much i must mees pedro and angel added casually you can stuff your bloody job but bart wasnt listening shut up he snapped im going to be photographed with the princess there was some booing when angel won the pegasus award a soaring golden horse for the player of the match but deafening cheers when posthumously tero won best playing pony keep it for perdita said red when his groom collected the huge dark maroon rug itll cheer her up when she cools down they were outside the bar surrounded by an admiring crowd when bart asked angel who was edging the top off a magnum of champagne with his thumbs what hed been about to say i say you can stuff your bloody awful job said angel politely you dont treat players or ponies nice enough and you haff as you say outleeve the usefulness and he aimed the spurting fountain of champagne straight into barts absolutely furious brickred face back at snow cottage daisy was still numb with misery over sukeys revelations she was glad ricky was at the international if hed seen her reddened eyes he might have got the truth out of her in the afternoon she tried to pull herself together and clean the house she even forced herself to go into perditas bedroom the scarlet walls were bare since perditad pulled down all rickys photographs a bluebottle crashed exhausted against the window pane perhaps she ought to take a lodger a nice girl student from the agricultural college to keep her company on the long lone evenings ahead she mustnt start crying again there was enough damp in the cottage it was a while before she heard the telephone crashing downstairs to get to it in time she still prayed it might be drew but it was taggie campbellblack her soft growling voice was unmistakable and she was stammering badly im sorry to bother you but tero had a heart attack in the international and died oh god darling little tero and poor poor perdita whispered daisy aghast shes broken it off with red rickys bringing her home to you we would have brought her but rupert wasnt very keen i do hope taggie was desperate to be fair and not disloyal to rupert of course i understand im so sorry its so kind of you to ring utterly desolate daisy collapsed on to a kitchen chair in the middle of the table was a blue jug filled with meadowsweet nothing would ever grace a meadow more sweetly than tero remembering the time the little pony had tiptoed into the kitchen during christmas dinner and the delighted little nudges tero used to give her in the back to ask for toast and marmite daisy burst into tears but after a few minutes she was forced to pull herself together perdita was coming home she must get ready in panic and trepidation she scurried round hoovering frantically finding hot waterbottles making up perditas bed with clean sheets and all violets blankets and putting the jug full of meadowsweet on her bedside table there was ethel barking and the sound of a car drawing up steeling herself for perditas force ten rage daisy came slowly downstairs but all her fears vanished as a thin grey ghost with anguished funeralblack eyes ran through the door and collapsed sobbing hysterically into her arms oh mummy mummy howll i ever survive without tero relief turned to horror as daisy felt how thin she was following her in still in breeches boots and his dark blue england shirt came ricky who put a reassuring hand to daisys cheek shell be ok give her a stiff drink im going to ring the doctor in the sitting room perdita collapsed on the sofa whatll happen to her now she asked wildly shell go straight to heaven of course no pony was gooder mumbled daisy but thats no good for her perditas sobs redoubled the only heaven for tero was where i was james benson the smooth private gp from cheltenham whod been ruperts and rickys doctor for years was just going out to drinks but couldnt resist a chance to look at ruperts supposedly illegitimate daughter and her mother as well and arrived in his mercedes she certainly had the campbellblack bone structure rather too near the surface at the moment shes seriously underweight and in shock he told daisy and ricky as he came downstairs ive given her a shot and something to make her sleep but i think we should keep her heavily sedated slowly reducing the dose over the next few days i should keep these locked up he added as he handed daisy antidepressants and sleeping pills one cant be too careful then noticing daisys own pallor and reddened eyes are you going to be all right i dont think you should be alone ill look after her said ricky ill just nip home and check the horses he said when james benson had gone and have a shower i must smell like a ramblers crotch daisy flushed you dont have to come back ill be fine dont be silly dont do anything ill bring a takeaway and some drink im honestly not hungry dont be even sillier you cant have two skeletons in one house then more gently seeing daisys face quivering as she bent over the sink its all right lovie the worsts over shes home it has been said that the real crime passionnel occurs when the other woman finds out about the other woman but daisy didnt hate bibi alderton or any of drews alleged legions of girlfriends she just felt terribly sad she was also worried sick about perdita she had dreaded a return of the old perdita denuding her wardrobe and the fridge pinching all the hot water and drowning the church bells at eldercombe with her tantrums and her record player but this new perdita who had no desire to eat or dress up or wash her hair or play music worried her far more she wasnt even interested in ethels puppies and just sat gazing at old photographs daisy had kept of tero watching the august sunlight drying the dew on the cobwebs and listening to the urgent bustle of the frogsmore under the house lucky frogsmore to be so sure where it was going perdita had no idea her eyes flickered with hope each time the telephone rang but it was never red only endless press and television people and all her temporary enemies dancer david waterlane bas brigadier and mrs hughie even miss lodsworth all of whom suddenly after teros death had become friends again the twins sent a congratulations card from deauville with the words good reddance inside chessie wrote a carefully worded note asking perdita to tell ricky to do better in the westchester than the international sharon kaputnik sent huge mauve chrysanthemums taggie hearing perdita wasnt eating arrived with the most delicious smoked salmon quiche drew wrote to her from sotogrande feeling awful daisy sneaked in when perdita was asleep to see if she were mentioned in the letter and felt even worse that she was not realizing perditas utter despair daisy reproached her with nothing ricky had no such reticence ten days after teros death he had an extremely humiliating lunch with rupert and bas in the venturer boardroom fuelled by château lafitte they had told him exactly what they thought of his performance in the international and that england had better bloody well get their act together before the westchester seeking gentle comfort ricky dropped in on daisy on the way home ive just seen a rabbit in your vegetable patch he told her must have been on a suicide mission said daisy ricky smiled the crows feet light up his eyes like rays of the sun thought daisy in an attempt to snap out of her depression she had bought some very expensive paper and having spread it out on the hayfield of a lawn was trying to cut it into pieces but even when she secured it with two books it kept rolling up ill hold it said ricky taking the other end noticing a tawnyorange butterfly landing on the michaelmas daisies he added look a painted lady im a painting notquitealady sighed daisy the next minute ethel emerged from the stream and followed by her puppies bounced across the paper leaving black footmarks everywhere oh ethel you stupid idiot screeched daisy then as ricky shoved ethel out of the way im sorry darling good dog i didnt mean to shout at you i can paint on the other side amused ricky watched her cutting with the scissors her hair was piled on top of her head with a green ribbon but escaping tendrils softened her sweating face she was wearing red denim shorts secured with a safety pin and a purple and white striped bikini top quite inadequate to contain her big golden breasts which also shining with sweat were flopping all over the place she was so busy cutting her pink tongue clenched between her teeth that she bumped straight into ricky oh im sorry she blushed scarlet im not complaining for christs sake it was perdita at the side door hysterical with rage theres a note here that bibi rang why the fuck didnt you wake me you knew i wanted news of red how can you be so fucking stupid thats enough getting to his feet ricky seized her by a chunk of her greasy lifeless hair and leading her into the sitting room shut the door and pushed her down on the sofa its about time the pussyfooting stopped he said grimly perdita opened her mouth to scream her tongue so white her teeth looked yellow by comparison shut up went on ricky have you no idea how many people youve screwed up in the last year i didnt know simpson hastings was a journalist you could have denied what he wrote instead of slagging daisy off to the other papers you never bothered to apologize afterwards daisy is one of the sweetest kindest most gentle are you after her then no i am bloody not i just know how different my life would have been if id had a mother like her for a moment he bleakly remembered childhood at robinsgrove alone in a huge cold house with herbert an inconsolable widower either silent or shouting have you ever thought what effect it had on violet and eddie all their school chums nudging and giggling no wonder eddie ploughed common entrance hed have ploughed it anyway hes so thick stammered perdita fight seeping out of her like air out of a punctured tyre rubbish and look how you fucked up rupert and taggie its not surprising rupert loathes you trying to frame him in bed after hed only been married for a year to the one true thing in his life if you hadnt screwed up venturer hed have been in england and never have let taggie slip on the ice and miscarry and if you hadnt dumped about the orgy the adoption societies would never have pulled the plug on them perdita gasped i never knew about that taggies been lovely to me thats because shes got a sweet forgiving nature unlike you you vengeful bitch go away he snapped seeing daisys worried bright pink face appearing at the window dont kick her when shes down pleaded daisy i havent finished said ricky shutting the window on her im sorry whispered perdita who was now haggard and shaking i didnt realize how awful id been and walking out on apocalypse just as we were getting the team together and thats nothing to what you did to luke short of making a wooden cross and banging the nails into his hands and feet i dont want to talk about luke she was suddenly hysterical well i do did you realize that when hal peters went bankrupt he left luke with all his medical bills and the bills for the yard so he had to sell all his horses even fantasma the tears held back since the night she came home spilled over oh no he loved her as much as i loved tero far more said ricky bleakly hed never have buggered off to singapore without seeing she was ok wheres she gone alejandros oh christ hes such a bastard to horses why didnt anyone tell me they didnt think youd be interested outside they could hear the protests of the mower as daisy forced it through the hayfield then the manic rattle as it tried to swallow one of ethels shredded bones did red know about luke course he did you must know what a shit he is youd think he was even more of one thought perdita dully if youd caught him in bed with chessie i hate him so much for what he did to tero she whispered but i cant help still wanting him its horrible like being in love with a husband whos battered your child to death how can i ever get over him work said ricky going towards the door i want you up at the yard by seven oclock tomorrow im not up to it said perdita in panic dont be so bloody wet dyou think redll send spotty back i asked the twins to ask him he must be so miserable missing tero and me ill see what i can do said ricky privately thinking red was unlikely to relinquish a pony as good as spotty with the westchester coming up ring chessie will you asked perdita with a sudden explosion of hostility you expect me to get over red you didnt get over her were not talking about me said ricky outside blinking in the lowangled sunshine daisy was washing her car she was straddled panting over the bonnet trying to clean the far side of the front window her left breast had escaped from her bikini moving to the right so as not to embarrass her ricky took the cloth from her shove over ill do it the following week brought no news from either red or drew perdita was getting frantic about spotty when at twilight one warm evening angel suddenly rolled up in a new aston martin with a pig trailer rattling behind out of which towered an outraged and decidedly carsick spotty i keednap heem said angel to an ecstatic perdita who instantly revived after a gruelling twelvehour stint at rickys barts in new york red in sotogrande spotty was being flown back to the states for the westchester tomorrow so i steal heem he not very pleased spotty however was so thrilled to see perdita that he jumped out of the trailer while he was still tied up nearly strangling himself having thanked angel incoherently perdita leapt on spottys redandwhite back and roared him off up the ride to show ricky ees better angel asked daisy better now shes seen you shes been desperately down she can only go up now red is a preek said angel the only time daisy had seen angel hed been trying to murder drew in the queens cup scowling under his bright blue hat with expletives pouring from his pouting lips and she had thought him the devil incarnate but this soulful young man with the snake hips the tumbled curls and the beautiful carved face waving a bottle of dom perignon and a huge bunch of régale lilies picked from barts garden utterly disarmed her for you he said perdita have enough presents you really shouldnt mumbled daisy i reech now said angel simply as he opened the bottle he explained that he was going to play for victor kaputnik for three times as much as drewd been getting and victor enraged at not winning any of the major cups in england had asked angel to find him twenty horses i shall make ten thousand dollars on each horse will you have to ride sharon as well asked daisy holding out a glass as the cork flew out no she about to leave veector for david waterlane so i have not to be service station daisy giggled is veector furious not at all e find new bumbo ees easy when youre reech and is drew upset hes been sacked it was like putting a bare foot on broken glass was he actually sacked e was said angel with satisfaction slimy bastard ill drink to that said daisy raising her glass shall we go into the garden outside it was all blue and misty with the ravages of the last ten days heatwave softened by the halflight and the snowwhite flowers of the bindweed hanging luminous theyre supposed to stay open all night if theres a moon said

was angry i play the pitch so many other women but it deednt work and now shes aving an affair with drew benedict oooh wailed daisy then at angels look of surprise im just so sorry for you first e torture me in the falklands then e torture me in eengland and now in america smarmy eenglish deekhead angel filled up their glasses he is isnt he agreed daisy why dont you ring her it would be weakness on the contrary it would be very brave urged daisy thinking that if the smarmy english dickhead rang her now she would swim straight across the atlantic to see him i bet shes as miserable as you she went on it wasnt because she wanted to break up bibi and drew but because she couldnt imagine anyone loving bibi more than this stormy troubled boy they finished the champagne and started on daisys muscadet angel not a heavy drinker couldnt manage to dial bibis number in florida so daisy who wasnt much soberer had to do it for him and finally handed him over to bibis filipino maid angel launched into a raging torrent of spanish he was sober when he came off the telephone all the bounce and bubble had gone out of him bibi as gone into the ospital for an operation carmen wont say what for so i sack her he tried red in sotogrande and grace in connecticut they were both out he was damned if he was going to ring bart the hospital would say nothing except that mrs solis de gonzales had been admitted at least she keep my name i know eet ees abortion he had to count on his fingers three times to work it out could be my child could be drews his face blackened thrusting a fistful of tenners into daisys hands to pay for the telephone calls he was out of the house in an instant storming off to heathrow to catch the next plane to palm beach sadly tearfully daisy was finishing off the muscadet and wishing someone had ever loved her as much as that when the telephone rang alas it was not drew but sharon kaputnik ayve just seen a fraightfully good paintin of chessie alderton in the noddy dave were together now wants a portrait of me to grace the long gallery ay wonder if youd oblaige daisy angel took a taxi from miami airport his only luggage was his polo sticks which he left as security for the driver as he bounded out of the moving car and dived through a door marked emergency into the hospital the receptionist who was used to the histrionics and antics of south american polo players had never seen one so fired up as angel there were flames coming out of his hair the glass petition nearly melted she told her friend that evening then i had to explain to him that mrs gonzales had gone down to the theatre sister passolini had just stopped by to say hi when this fruitcake falls on her grabs her by the throat threatening strangulation if she doesnt take him to the theatre right away i buzzed a guard but this argy koed him and ran off before we could stop him loose in the hospital angel had raced past rest rooms and elevators and started throwing open doors in the first room he found a lot of fat women gazing at a nurse who was drawing a large carrot on the blackboard you cant go in there screeched sister passolini who rather taken by angel had caught up with him thats overeaters anonymous or in there she added in horror as angel discovered a lot of sheepishlooking men gazing at another blackboard on which a male nurse with a beard was drawing an even bigger carrot thats the impotency support group you wont find your wife in there nor in freedom from smoking next door and beyond that are all the consultation rooms try the next floor straight on to the end of the passage she whispered you better beat it the heavy brigade has just arrived chased by two more security guards angel sprinted up the stairs past a sign saying please be quiet theatre in use to left and right he was faced with rows of pale grey doors seeing a blonde nurse passing by with a syringe in a kidneyshaped bowl angel grabbed her my wife bibi gonzales he panted please she is somewhere in here wasnt she bibi alderton asked the blonde nurse right shes in there first left after the swing doors but theyre operating you cant go in when the two guards tried to restrain him angel fobbed them off with fifty dollars each and started breaking up equipment a trolley loaded with instruments went flying a kidney machine crashed to the floor a cupboard full of medicines was wrenched off the wall and went flying through the window angel was just kicking over an xray machine when a man in a green overall wearing a mask and rubber gloves backed out through the swing doors crunching on the glass what the hells going on im about to operate angel leapt on him grabbing him by his gown shoving him against the wall you not going to abort my child he hissed dont be ridiculous squawked the surgeon i dont do terminations angels mad eyes were suddenly vast with fear ees more serious she ave cancer oh my poor bibi for goodness sake cool it said the blonde nurse in amusement then ignoring the frantic signals of the surgeon mrs gonzales is only having a nose job if shed hoped to placate angel she was quite wrong even more incensed he stormed into the theatre where bibi pale as her white nightgown like a corpse in a morgue lay on the operating table surrounded by people in masks woosy from her premed she was not too far gone to whip off the disfiguringly ugly bathcap what zee fuck howled angel then stopped in his tracks what ave you done to your beautiful air for spilling over the white pillow instead of the thick shaggy dark red curls was a long sleek totally straight blonde bob ees thees what drew benedict like said angel furiously he may prefer blondes but e is no gentleman bibi burst into tears i love you so much i figured if i had long blonde hair and a tiny nose like all the other polo wives you might love me too angel gave a groan i loff you as you are then running a finger down her nose she is the theeng i like most about you you are most beautiful girl i haff known you geeve me the duck bumps i haff nevair been more meeserable in my life when you ran away i theenk i die and seizing her hands he covered them with kisses and then he kissed her lips there wasnt a dry eye above the masks except for those of the plastic surgeon who was incensed at losing such a rich customer and who had been intending to remodel bibis entire body over the next few years i weel keel drew benedict said angel as he paused for breath oh please dont protested bibi it was hopeless with him i thought about you the whole time and how much i loved you i urt you so bad moaned angel i was jealous of your work i ate being a kept boy you wont be much longer said bibi if dad goes bellyup i wont be an heiress any more you wont be anyway after paying for all the equipment rudolph valentinos just smashed up said the plastic surgeon nastily and he was even crosser when angel just swept bibi up and carried her out to the stillwaiting taxi banging on the door of the impotency support group yelling keep eet up two three four as he went by heeding rickys advice perdita buried herself in work standing in for his grooms when they took holidays before the westchester playing in lowand mediumgoal matches but she was still desperately pale thin and unnaturally subdued nor did the situation improve when violet and eddie returned from staying with schoolfriends not prepared to be as forgiving as daisy and stepping warily round their perfidious sister soon they were at each others throats all three thinking they had exclusive rights to the television the bathroom and violet and perdita the use of daisys rickety volkswagen matters grew worse when violet got straight as in her four a levels was rewarded with money to buy a car by a delighted biddy macleod and violets schoolfriends rang the whole time comparing results and having endless discussions as to what they were going to do in their year out eddie blissfully unaware that ricky had pulled strings with the muscular energy of a bell ringer to get him into bagley hall a nearby coed was halfterrified halfexcited at the prospect of boarding with girls in september he had now reached adolescence loving and cooperative one moment moody withdrawn and resentful the next there were compensations suddenly the small boy who daisyd had to threaten within an inch of his life to pick up a toothbrush was cleaning his teeth three times a day and bathing and washing his hair more often than violet and perdita when he wasnt counting his spots and perfecting a sexy pout in the mirror he poured over penthouse and the fplan diet soon envelopes addressed to bodybuilding firms were lying around in the hall to add to daisys problems the puppies were crapping everywhere and chewing up everything and sharon kaputnik had to be painted not wanting to trouble ricky or subject him to constant sexual harassment by painting sharon in his attic daisy used the sitting room at snow cottage this meant that every afternoon sharon rose like page three incarnate from a sofa lined with jaffacake crumbs chewed crayon and puppy fur surrounded by a sea of coke tins beer cans mugs kickedoff shoes and overflowing ashtrays while being eyed by eddie as he pretended to watch programmes on reupholstering and reruns of falcon crest nor was daisy any longer buoyed up by the prospect of seeing drew again when the holidays were over she found her thoughts turning more and more to ricky and how awful it would be when he finally went back to chessie hed taken to dropping in late in the evening often bringing a takeaway and was so wonderful at separating and shutting up the children if youd ever umpired the napiers bart alderton and the obriens in the same match you wouldnt have any problems unfortunately one cant send ones children off for arguing sighed daisy by the middle of august everyone was revving up for the westchester or westchessieter as daisy called it to herself the english team had been confirmed ricky as captain drew and the napiers the same as the international with the twins as reserve not an exciting team but a solid one ricky detested the napiers but they were both nines and under pressure from the bpa he couldnt see any way not to select them he found the prospect deeply depressing particularly as the very few practice matches they were able to organize were incredibly acrimonious rupert who had highhandedly appointed himself unofficial team manager because venturers stake was so vast and because although i dont know that much about polo i know all about winning was all too ready to put his showjumping boot in and tell the players exactly where they were going wrong the ponies were due to fly out to california in midseptember to acclimatize them for the match which would begin the first week in october with an eye to the extra buck however the napiers and drew had defiantly flown their horses out the third week in august to play in oakbrook and in the us open this as ricky furiously pointed out was the last way to rest them before the westchester a week later ricky got a telephone call from charles napier his voice had the oily ingratiating timbre of a reporter about to ask a husband what he feels about his wife shoving off ben and i want to level with you ricky frankly we were fucked by the international five of our best horses were screwed up not to mention bens cracked collarbone and my broken finger so said ricky curtly thats bad enough but the westchesters a different ball game in what way it involves four people on either ssside trying to hit the ball through each others goal posts seems remarkably similar to me charles wasnt to be deflected therell be three matches three times as gruelling and much tougher opposition it might help said ricky acidly if you rested your horses instead of carting them all over america if you want the bloody truth charles dropped any attempt at amiability ben drew and i are totally pissed off with putting ourselves and our ponies on the line for the honour of our country only women and horses work for nothing were professionals you could have fooled me dont be so bloody sarky were going on strike none of us will play unless we get thirty grand each and a share of the tv action ricky sighed knowing there was absolutely no way venturer or the big british and us sponsors could pull out at this stage the napiers and drew feeling they could easily afford the extra cash were plainly determined to force his hand you still with me ricky i was temporarily speechless have you bastards no idea of the honour of playing in the wwwestchester have you no sense of history just to bring back some stupid pot your ancestors couldnt manage to hang on to ten losses on the trot wasnt it well we dont want to make it eleven look ricky was trying not to lose his temper ill try and get you ten grand each but not a cent more venturer cant afford it surely rupert could take out a mortgage on his fifty house let me talk to drew said ricky grimly there was another long pause ricky could almost hear the sweat bubbling on the palm of charless great red meaty hand as he clapped it over the receiver after an age drew came on youve spent nearly thirty grand on this telephone call already snapped ricky i thought you were supposed to be a friend of mine i am i also have a living to make bullshit youre just fucking greedy you wouldnt expect to be paid for the olympics i would if i were likely to screw up my best horses then ben napier seized the telephone thirty grand or no deal he said roughly and thatll only replace a couple of ponies ok said ricky im dropping the lot of you you cant said ben outraged weve flown our ponies over specially to play in the open go screw yourselves the bpa will go apeshit good said ricky and hung up he didnt think hed ever been so angry in his life he was unprepared for the storm which broke over his head venturer and the bpa went into shock horror to a man and called an emergency meeting in london the next day what the hell are you playing at howled rupert they cant have any television rights but we could easily have raised another ninety thousand pounds thats peanuts we could even stretch to one hundred and fifty thousand its immaterial said ricky wearily i was always worried about this team there were too many chiefs and not an indian in sight i could never have made it gel remember in karachi we had an indian chappie brilliant player but hopeless if you gave him any responsibility mumbled brigadier hughie perhaps youd feel happier if charles was captain ricky i dont take orders from gorillas said ricky if you dont let me pick my own team ill drop out david waterlane who had a bad back from an excess of sharonshagging hit the roof dont be bloody silly who the hell did you have in mind seb and dommie ludicrously inexperienced snapped david throwing his cigar butt at the halfopen window and missing and far too erratic mike waterlane added ricky with the faintest smile mike said david dumbfounded dyou think hes up to it easily said ricky ive played all summer with the three of them and scowling round the room defying anyone to challenge him im going to take perdita macleod as reserve leaving the meeting in uproar ricky drove to rutshire polo club where the last match of the season always an elegiac occasion was taking place it had been raining as he arrived the drying boards were shimmering in the sinking sun which was also warming the feathering willowherb the huge domed trees round the pitches were echoed by the greyblue clouds of a constable sky as a red tractor chugged back and forth weighed down by bales of straw perdita her hair now shoulderlength and in a net was watching the second match with dommie and mike waterlane who had a silver cup under his arm little chef bounced ahead to greet his friend decorum the bull terrier who grinned down at him triangular eyes genial tail going like a vivace metronome as he pirouetted on stiff poker legs how did you do asked ricky buried them said dommie thank christ for that corporal won best playing pony were thinking of promoting him crowed dommie seb lay stretched out on the bonnet of his porsche his head on the windscreen his newly washed hair flopping he had changed into white jeans and a pale blue bomber jacket and had a glass of whisky in one hand and his portable telephone in the other he opened a bloodshot eye and grinned at ricky ciao sweetheart ill meet you at annabels around ten ill book hi whereve you been he asked ricky as he switched off the telephone reselecting the team for the westchester whos in it ricky told them yippee yelled dommie chucking a ball twenty feet in the air good lord i must ring daddy said mike waterlane going as scarlet as the virginia creeper now smothering the clubhouse perdita turning to stone always became most angry when she was frightened i wont go i cant believe it im not up to it whose bloody stupid idea was it to select me mine said ricky calmly but ill have to play against red stop overreacting said seb youre only reserve were much too tough to get injured not unless you get a few early nights said ricky removing sebs whisky and emptying it on to the grass annabels is going to miss you seb to the shock horror of venturer and the bpa were added next day the furious protests of the british and american sponsors and the american polo association who all felt ricky was making a total mockery of the westchester the thirtyfivegoal english team had struggled in the international how did ricky imagine he could field a bunch of babies with a team aggregate of twentysix against the might of the americans in their own country the media were equally outraged cannon fodder said a huge headline in the daily express how can david without a sling beat goliath armed with an exocet itll be annihilation frantic preparations ensued in the next week good horses about to be turned away had to be wheedled out of other owners and flown over to america for mike and perdita in case she had to play longingly she thought of the six ponies red had given her hed probably be riding them against england at least she still had spotty but he was in a frightful temper as was wayne announcing that they were both much too fat and that argentines won matches because their horses carried no spare flesh rupert had put both ponies on a rigorous diet much to rickys irritation rupert was in fact supervising the diets of all the ponies he also insisted that all the team took the equivalent of a marines assault course to get fit but even he couldnt make ricky go out jogging hell thought perdita a day later as she gritted her teeth to stop herself crying is being coached by rupert campbellblack god he was sarcastic as he rode up and down blue eyes narrowed whip tapping his boots not missing a trick the nervegas hostility in no way abated the drawling commentary more bitchy than ever i see rickys given you a second chance had been his first bleak words to her i certainly wouldnt for two chukkas each time anyone missed a ball or a stab at goal it was greeted with sighs of oh dear a perdita pass again after shouting at her every time she picked up her stick he called her over stylistically youre not bad he said softly youve got most of the shots perdita looked up in amazed relief a compliment at last its a pity rupert raised his voice youre so fucking useless at selecting which shot and when perdita went crimson two minutes later he was yelling for christs sake hook him perdita as seb scorched towards goal then as seb scored whats the point of hooking air why the fuck didnt you catch up with him i was twenty yards behind when he started off stammered perdita then you catch up with him youre very deceptive youre even slower than you look then after shed let seb through a third time come here perdita oh god how she dreaded that soft bitchy upperclass ring this is a pony rupert touched spottys neck with his whip rather an unattractive one admittedly these are his legs these are your legs youre supposed to use them to make him carry you upfield as fast as possible this is a whip for a second he banged his whip against hers like a fencer starting a duel i want you to use it i want your ponies collapsing when they come off the field for a second perdita watched a gull drifting across the khaki woods the argentine word for gull was tero like tero collapsed she screamed suddenly exploding like a pressure cooker if need be but they wont collapse if you get them fit enough that pony is still too fat he is not and hes not ugly shut up said rupert coldly if you were as quick on the field as you are with your temper we might get somewhere perdita burst into tears oh dear sighed rupert ive always believed a womans place was in the home or on her back or regrettably in the shops but not on the polo field rickys got sprinklers to water this pitch he doesnt need you dommie who had a softer heart than seb leapt to perditas defence ive known you all my life rupert and ive always liked you but i never realized you could be quite such a shit well now you know sunshine snapped rupert the trouble was that rupert was right he had a marvellous eye miraculous anticipation and saw exactly where they were making mistakes every time he picked up a polo stick it looked right every time he got on the most refractory pony it came together noone was spared he made ricky cut down drastically on his bad habits all those accumulated short cuts which great players resort to gradually ricky straightened his swing found he was hitting the ball twice as far and learnt to use his team again feeling a slight chill in the air as the evenings drew in daisy brought crumpets bramble jelly and a large fruitcake from the village shop to cheer herself up she tried to count all the nice things about winter but only got as far as roaring fires and being able to cover ones spare tyres with huge jerseys then she remembered what a bore it was sweeping out the ashes in the morning she was utterly fed up with the constantly ringing telephone the press were on the whole time trying to get perditas reaction to being picked for the westchester to seeing red again and to being coached by rupert who still wouldnt admit paternity perdita and violet had had a frightful row that morning because perdita had pinched violets car without asking smashing a sidelight and leaving hay and sweetpapers all over the floor eddies thumping great crush on sharon showed no sign of abating and he was not at all pleased to be joined by violets friends from the school rugger team wandering round in boxer shorts showing off portugaltanned bodies i could eat them alaive at that age said sharon in retaliation eddie had borrowed a tenner off daisy to buy stationery for school and instead came back with a bottle of crème de menthe for sharon which he insisted on serving her frappé and sitting chatting to her all afternoon so she never sat still we didnt have girls at my prep school he was now telling her as we didnt really need them but weve got fifty per cent at bagley hall which is ok as itd be awful if there werent enough to go round oh look theres mrs thatcher on the telly what a smart blue costume said sharon she always looks well turnedout doesnt she i admire her said eddie reflectively but i wouldnt like her as a mother i suppose thats something thought daisy mixing white with burnt umber to get the colour of sharons nipples in the corner two puppies were now having a tug of war with a pinkandblack scarf have some more crème de menthe said eddie ay shall be tiddly said sharon with a giggle as he filled her glass eddie darling do rescue that scarf said daisy im sure its perditas i dont care said eddie stonily i hate my sister he added to sharon hows she getting on being coached by rupert campbellblack theres an attractive man eddies face fell hes depressingly sexist he said disparagingly not that i blame him for rubbishing my sister i would if she wasnt so strong there was a bang on the door a bark from ethel and in came ricky christ he said taking in the chaos ricky said sharon excitedly come in dont be shay although i love shay men come and tell us what you think of daisys portrait stepping over several chewing puppies ricky looked at the painting its very good he said in surprise extremely good rubens crossed with renoir then looking at daisys exhausted face come on sharon daisys done enough for one day sharon leant forward giving ricky the benefit of her cleavage to look at her diamond watch heavens taime does flay can i borrow your bathroom daisy goodness me swaying as she got up she deliberately clutched on to rickys arm i really do feel a bit tiddly having toasted some crumpets and put them with the fruitcake and the tea things on a tray daisy suggested that they went in the garden as it was the tidiest place youre sweet ricky took the tray from her but i honestly dont want anything to eat have you had a ghastly week pretty standard said daisy i really must paint that bench before winter next minute violet erupted into the garden in an uncharacteristically bad temper fucking hell mum youve shrunk my olivegreen jersey oh hi ricky she grabbed a crumpet she was followed by eddie in an even worse mood i was cleaning out my fish tank and perditas emptied her ashtray into it im leaving home he snatched up two crumpets a second later perdita put her head out of her bedroom window sharon fucking kaputniks locked herself in the bathroom and ive got to go out i dont want to hear said ricky firmly go inside all of you and tidy up the kitchen and then the sitting room ive never seen such a tip and its all your junk go on bugger off ay ay sir said eddie pinching another crumpet oh thank you sighed daisy youre so wonderful blushing ricky said hed found homes for two of the puppies and hed take one himself oh how lovely that only leaves one perhaps we could keep it rubbing buttery fingers on her jeans daisy started to sew nametapes on eddies school socks ricky watched her it was a beautiful evening the sun was setting behind the wood arrows of migrating birds flown in from the sea to scavenge in the newly ploughed fields were following a hyacinthblueandcrimson air balloon drifting across the softest pinkflecked sky in the garden red berries glowed on the honeysuckle and sapphire spears of delphiniums pink japanese anemones and pale roses crowded the flowerbeds not as vigorous as at their first flowering but sweeter is eddie being a pain too asked ricky not really adolescence is so awful almost as bad as being in ones late thirties thought daisy sadly his uniforms being a bit of a bore in the old days i just went and bought it and the only problem was money now hes worse than beau brummel about the relative tightness and length of his trousers looking up from her nametapes daisy giggled and having witnessed the rejection of every slipon shoe in rutminster i know exactly how prince charming must have despaired at the thought of finding the owner of the glass slipper she broke off the thread and picked up a pair of rugger shorts ill take him to london tomorrow said ricky cutting himself a piece of fruitcake ive got to pick up the england shirts from harrods ill get him some trousers and some shoes oh no itd be such a bore for you said daisy id like his company you know how i loathe london lucky eddie thought daisy perditas not the only one whos lost too much weight around here said ricky handing daisy the last crumpet daisy shook her head a handsome husband and a thousand a year said a voice ayll have it and ricky and daisy were enveloped in a cloud of chanel number as sharon stretched out a braceleted hand to help herself pressing her splendid breasts against rickys shoulders as she did so youd certainly make the handsomest husband in the world ricky do drop in on us sometime shes definitely having an affair with david waterlane said ricky after shed gone he always buys chanel number for all his mistresses she says shes going to marry him said daisy in the darkening trees the pigeons were fluttering and cooing iceberg roses and white phlox grew more luminous nightscented stock replaced chanel number its so beautiful here said daisy who was getting cold but didnt want to break the magic of the moment hows perdita getting on with rupert not brilliantly said ricky carefully not wanting to hurt daisy ruperts so desperately protective of taggie he cant really bring himself to forgive her even though taggie has but hes getting results hes sharpened up her game two hundred per cent thats mine he added quickly as one of ethels puppies tottered out speckled as a seal eyes frowsty with sleep patrician except for one ear pointing up and an irredeemably curly tail he picked the puppy up hes just like little chef watching him gently stroking the pinkandspeckled belly daisy was appalled to find herself longing to swap places with the puppy she must get a grip on herself hows the westchester going ricky sighed i feel as though the entire contents of your septic tank has been tipped over my head the bpa and the apa have both written me threatening letters and ring constantly the american sponsors are collectively threatening to sue the prince rang up and said hughie had actually had the cheek to ring him and advise him not to fly over to present the cup as it would be so embarrassing for him to witness a bloodbath fortunately the prince told hughie to get stuffed and that if hes said hell go to something he always goes cartier asprey tiffany and dunhill have all written complaining i wrote back saying i would not be dictated to by a bunch of watchmakers in mayfair quite right said daisy indignantly oh ye of little faith she also noticed that he hardly stammered at all now when he talked to her the moon was rising huge and pink bats and swallows dived owls hooted the sky had darkened to lilac in the west what ricky hadnt told daisy about was the brief bitter note chessie had sent him i thought you wanted me back if you insist on playing with schoolboys i was obviously wrong realizing daisy was shivering he had just taken his coat off and put it round her shoulders when eddie appeared in the doorway wiping imaginary sweat from his forehead weve tidied the whole house mum weve even made ethels basket good boy said ricky can i have a beer later said ricky if you come into rutminster with me well get an indian it was the eve of the teams departure having finally got eddie off to school and finished sharons portrait daisy sent perdita up to london with money to buy some clothes for america perdita whose selfconfidence seemed to have been finally smashed by rupert was in turmoil because she might have to play and would certainly be seeing red again having made heroic attempts to cheer perdita up daisy was overwhelmed with despair tomorrow ricky was off to america and inevitably out of her life i must not hate chessie she told herself sternly i am very lucky my children and i are not dying of hunger in ethiopia my entire family havent been wiped out in an earthquake or a volcano and this is the first time ive had access to my own bathroom in nine weeks god i look awful the only answer in case ricky dropped in that evening was to wash her hair and have a bath she had just emerged pink and je reviensscented with legs and armpits shaved and was combing out her wet hair when she heard ethel barking and a hammering on the front door wrapping herself in a big darkgreen towel she ran downstairs and her heart failed for there beachboyblond and absolutely blackbrown stood drew darling daisy he put the inevitable bottle of moët on the kitchen table youve no idea how ive missed you daisy just stared at him shed dreamt of this moment for so long and shed planned to be distant and icily disapproving because hed forced rickys hand over the westchester but it was hard to be cool when you were hot and lobsterpink from the bath and drew looked so handsome and was in such high spirits inevitably the conversation turned in moments to polo boy am i glad to be out of the westchester he said tearing the gold paper off the cork it is going to be a ghastly embarrassment to the english theyre having great trouble selling tickets americans love american victories but they like a decent tussle first rickys playing said daisy defensively maybe but itll be like canute trying to stop the tide and not even bothering to put on gumboots the twins are wildly erratic and hopeless in defence which is all theyll have to do mikes a dolt he paused dyou think rickyll ever speak to me again as he went automatically to the right cupboard to get down two glasses daisy noticed he had us open printed on the back of his bomber jacket if he wins he might said daisy reprovingly hes had so much flak recently just because hes got this idée fixe about getting chessie back talk about exappeal daisy didnt laugh hows sukey really well ive got a new american patron for palm beach next year which means megabucks is he nice better than victor christ im relieved to be shot of him at the pop of the champagne cork ethel started barking and all the puppies woke up and started wandering round the kitchen are any of the children at home asked drew casually as he filled the glasses then glancing through into the sitting room gave a start as he caught sight of sharons finished portrait still on daisys easel christ thats good i thought it was the old bat for a second you really are getting better and better reluctant to be won over daisy followed drew into the sitting room for a better look and had great difficulty stopping him drawing a moustache on sharon well at least let me draw a tiara on her bush shes going hammer and hot tongs for david waterlane at the moment he kept ringing for her said daisy at first i thought it was you using a false name she shivered and shut the window i must go and get dressed why bother drew refilled her glass id forgotten how beautiful you are evidently said daisy unable to keep the acid out of her voice was sharon amazing in bed drew shrugged i wouldnt know you know my heart belongs to you my true love hath my heart and i have about one twentieth of his said daisy and buoyed up by champagne told him about sukeys visit thats a pack of lies said drew gazing into her eyes with that unshiftingly honest look that convinced daisy he wasnt telling the truth i promise you i can only assume she got wind of us and decided to spin a story like that to put the boot in sukey isnt that subtle or conniving said daisy she was absolutely devastated and so touchingly grateful that id listened to her i felt an absolute bitch honestly dont begged drew starting to laugh and as for that ludicrous fantasy about bibi alderton that consisted of one lunch at the four seasons in new york christ the foods good bibi started crying about angel i put my arm round her to comfort her and unfortunately we were seen by sukeys most indiscreet chum who leapt for the telephone the only woman ive ever adored since i was married probably ever is you what about all those valentines i cant help it if people send me valentines i bet red alderton gets them by the sack catch he threw the halffull bottle at her stretching out both hands daisy fumblingly caught it spilling champagne all over her breasts the dark green towel slid to the floor god youre pretty drew moved forward youre the one who should be on page three daisy didnt believe a word drew had said about bibi but she was so suicidal over ricky and drew looked so handsome and it felt so nice having the champagne licked off her breasts and it was such a relief for a change being caught bathed and shaven and with clean hair that they ended up in bed having supervised the packing of everything for the horses having started packing for himself trying to avoid little chefs reproachful gaze and suddenly feeling like a small boy about to go back to prep school ricky decided to drop in on daisy ethel didnt even bark because she knew him so well finding drews car outside and a threequarters empty bottle of moët on the kitchen table and two of ethels puppies joyfully demolishing one of drews shoes ricky drove off in a fury an hour later drew rolled up asking if he could borrow a pair of shoes talk about being caught on the hop he said hopping after ricky into the kitchen ricky slammed the kitchen door and shut the window so that the grooms who had been amazed by the foulness of his temper for the last hour couldnt listen in how long have you been screwing daisy i dont see what the hell its got to do with you said drew calmly i am her landlord shes at least six years older than you she can do what she likes dick dont call me that howled ricky daisy had a bloody awful marriage shes just getting over it and getting her career together the lllast thing she needs is some holeinthecorner affair which could easily end in a mmmessy divorce she needs a proper relationship relationships that pass in the night sighed drew dont be fucking frivolous with someone whos free to look after her like you i suppose ive always thought you had the hots for her i have not said ricky coldly oh we all know your heart belongs irrevocably to chessie so stop snarling like a guard dog in the manger and give me a drink little chef whined querulously unnerved by the shouting a new moon the colour of unsalted butter was untangling itself from the racingfox weathercock over the stables furiously clashing decanters ricky asked how long it had been going on nearly three years three years said ricky utterly aghast how often dyou see her whenever i can get away from sukey and daisys bloody children arent hanging around murdering each other no ice please youre a disgrace roared ricky no not you boy he added gently stooping to stroke little chef who was shivering with terror its absolutely no business of yours protested drew i only happen to be captaining the westchester team thank christ i dropped you i would now if i hadnt in which daisys daughter may well have to play perditas impossibly near the edge at the moment shes never been able to accept daisys sexuality if she finds out about you two shell go through the roof the leaking roof corrected drew you should really fix that before winter comes particularly in the bedroom talk about raindrops falling on ones cock stop taking the piss yelled ricky you ought to pack her in it cant lead anywhere its not meant to i cant divorce sukey that dog must be the father of ethels puppies it just gives daisy and me an enormous he lingered over the word mockingly amount of pleasure and youve completely drowned that whisky christ its worse getting a drink here than the bar at the club what happens if sukey finds out she wont if you lend me a pair of shoes i hope they cripple you snarled ricky he was insane with rage but he decided not to say anything to daisy who somehow managed not to cry when she and little chef bade him and perdita goodbye and good luck the following morning just as they were leaving perdita ran back and hugged her mother tightly i love you mum im sorry ive been such a bitch but as the car crunched away over the conkers and acorns that littered the drive daisy didnt think shed ever been more unhappy i wish we could climb into his suitcase and go too she said to a drooping desolate little chef you could nip chessies perfect ankles for me five minutes after theyd gone a truck rolled up and out jumped one of rickys gardeners mr francelynch said you were nearly out of logs so ive brought you another load then daisy really did go upstairs and cry if only it were ricky not his logs keeping her warm please god she prayed im sorry to be so indecisive i know i asked you to get me over drew and you did now could you please get me over ricky from the moment she landed in california perdita had felt like a patient waiting for the morphine to wear off and the serious unbearable pain to take over in england she had been numb with shock now the certainty that red would swan in at any moment had reduced her to crawling churning heppedup bowelopening panic she found herself leaving halfdrunk cups of coffee and glasses of perrier everywhere starting sentences forgetting what she was going to say asking questions and not being able to take in the answer putting on deodorant twice or not at all fussing around trying on a hundred tshirts before she went out jumping out of her skin everytime she saw a redheaded man or a red ferrari in fact she had a threeweek wait because the prickteasing american polo association refused to announce the team until the eve of the first match their ponies had arrived however and were evidence that bart had snapped up every best playing pony in north and south america never had a us team been better mounted the english were pleased to find their own ponies in excellent spirits after their rest under ruperts supervision they had been slowly put to work and were now fully acclimatized to the dry desert heat which soared into the nineties in the afternoon with the grooms watching like hawks for dehydration they had also adjusted to different hay grain and water perdita had to hand it to rupert never had england taken the field with a fitter team of ponies all the ponies were stabled at eldorado polo club where the westchester was being staged it was a friendly homely place with palms orange groves and a little wooden clubhouse where noone minded you putting your boots on the table the polo on the other hand was so good that members jetted in at weekends from calgary and new york and movie stars drove down in their hordes from la surrounded by mountains the club was set in an oasis of green polo grounds hewn out of the desert the american team were booked into la quinta hotel which had a golf course and tennis courts fifteen miles drive from the polo ground rupert insisting on a strict policy of nonfraternization and particularly not wanting chessie to wind up ricky was determined to keep the teams apart and had rented a condominium on the quinta estate but well away from the hotel a little pinkroofed whitewalled house it was called the villa victoria which they all hoped would be symbolic reached through lush avenues of brilliantly coloured hibiscus and bougainvillaea it had a jacuzzi a swimmingpool a garden filled with stephanotis orange and lemon trees and overlooked a beautifully landscaped golf course interspersed with palm trees and lakes which was caressed all day with sprinklers to perdita it was beautiful but as totally unreal as a hollywood set there was plenty to do though the fresh dry desert air and the mountains were very invigorating and encouraged them to get up at six to jog play tennis and work the ponies the twins played endless golf with ricky and mike waterlane to sharpen up their concentration and help them relax rupert was frantically dealing with sponsors and television networks taggie kept herself amused cooking for everyone the wonderfully friendly californians invited them to dinner parties and barbecues and all rickys old moviestar pupils whom hed coached in palm springs the first winter after hed come out of prison rang up and invited them to parties in beverly hills and took them on trips to disneyland and round hollywood the twins were in their element mike waterlane on the other hand who got frightfully excited by all the beautiful girls and then didnt know what to do with them wasnt sleeping and was getting increasingly terrified about the first match ricky too was becoming increasingly edgy usually he went into himself twentyfour hours before a game twentyone days to wait was much too long it all boiled up in a blazing row in which he tried to persuade rupert to be less bloody to perdita taggie when rupert eventually came spitting to bed had more effect shes so desperate for your approval rupert and trying so hard to behave and be brave about red if you could just be a bit gentler with her so rupert had stopped bitching at perdita and merely ignored her the media of course were everywhere the freedom of the press extended even to the manger each time perdita put a foot outside the door or ventured down to the stables a notebook a camera or a microphone would be stuck into her face how was she getting on with rupert what did she feel about seeing red how much more weight was she going to lose was she quite sure she wasnt anorexic on the eve of the first match she took refuge in spottys box the ponies were restless and excited knowing something was up after their long long wait poor spotty so loved showing off to the crowd but as perdita was only reserve he probably wouldnt get a chance to play at all rupert had flown to new york for the day and perdita was surreptitiously sneaking him a packet of polos when a car drove up in a cloud of dust terrified it might be rupert whod smell peppermint and catch spotty crunching perdita shot out of his box only to find ricky looking bootfaced the americans have announced their team what is it croaked perdita feeling as if the cloud of dust had blown straight down her throat ben angel red said ricky oh thank god thought perdita ill see him again but theyve dropped shark and put luke in instead went on ricky if luke had been tuning up all the american ponies he was thinking bleakly theyd be unbeatable tomorrow oh how wonderful perdita was overjoyed how wonderful for luke a pungent waft of sweet scent from the nearby orange grove reminded her poignantly of that day at barts barn when luke had first introduced her to red how comforting if he were there tomorrow to hold her hand when she saw red again another perfect afternoon followed next day with a gentianblue sky arched over a field of bouncy jadegreen bermuda grass as the crowd poured into eldorado polo club from all over the world perdita had never seen more ravishing sunkissed blondes in shorts and sundresses or more handsome healthylooking men here was polo at its most relaxed and friendly yet beyond the mountains which ringed the oasis like wrinkled sleeping elephants lay the desert where coyotes and rattlesnakes lurked where dust devils swirled round the creosote bushes and jacob trees held up their strange spiky branches like hands praying for an american victory in the pony lines rupert was winding up his final peptalk all that matters is marking youve got to unnerve them early on then turning to perdita who was sweating in breeches boots and her dark blue england shirt dont think youve got the afternoon off duckie your job is to watch your eyes out assessing every american pony and player and i dont just mean red alderton perdita went scarlet talk of the devil said seb ouch he yelled as perdita clutched his arm for a second she thought she was going to black out for there getting out of a brandnew dark blue lamborghini to a chorus of female shrieking was red wearing the pale amethyst american shirt which went so perfectly with his conkerred hair and his smooth brown face immediately like cats on raw liver the press fell on him whaaddya chances red pretty good drawled red then catching sight of the english team he started to laugh i guess the brits arent exactly weighed down by the responsibility of false expectations seeing as how theyre fielding a hasbeen and three new caps including mike waterlane whos about as thick as a clydesdales dick i say thats a bit steep said mike going brickred dont rise snapped rupert thats what he wants but red was still wandering smiling towards them as malicious as he was seductive i cannot imagine theres ever been an english side quite so unfancied by the bookies he told the battling frenzied swarm of reporters was it necessary to underplay your hand quite so obviously ricky and hi rupert another flash of white teeth beneath the coldly calculating foxbrown eyes im surprised youre not wearing your paternity suit i hope youve got a hot line to the bpa because reinforcements are sure going to be needed motionless the english team watched him the press were writing avidly adoring every moment shoved by television and radio reporters desperate to get their mikes within earshot any message for perdita yelled the sun oh there you are perdita darling reds voice softened i couldnt see you for assholes youre looking good your new daddy must certainly have pulled every string to get you on the team stung and humiliated perdita stumbled away frantically rubbing away the tears ive nothing to say she howled to the swarm of reporters leave me alone then suddenly ahead of her she saw a big blond man with blacksmiths shoulders and lean cowboy hips moving down the american pony lines checking tack and bandages joking with the grooms outwardly utterly relaxed keeping his fears to himself luke called out perdita desperately swinging round catching sight of her tearful anguished face he was beside her in an instant his sheer size made the reporters back off im really sorry about tero were his first words it blew me away when red told me she had remembered him slumped with pain greenfaced pouring with sweat now his hair was bleached the colour of faded bracken and freckles merged in his suntanned face pale amethyst wasnt the best colour for him but he looked great and perdita thought once again what a lovely open generous face he had im sorry about fantasma she stammered have you heard how she is just for a second the pain flickered in his eyes shes fine he said firmly winning a lot of matches for alejandro luke yelled bart impatiently for chrissake stop yakking come and take a look at this fetlock i gotta go said luke good luck whispered perdita the press surged forwards how was red any chance of a reconciliation perdita had behaved well for too long why dont all you bastards fuck off she screamed she was further jolted when she climbed up into the packed stands to the seat taggie had kept for her and found herself knocked backwards by a huge juddering black rubber bullet it was leroy whod slipped his lead and bashing his tail back and forth like a hooked salmon was frantically licking her face oh darling she moaned clutching his wonderfully solid body then on his forehead she breathed in a scent sharp sophisticated with musky overtones which unsettled her far more than the waft of orange blossom had yesterday she got a sudden vision of luke in hospital doubled up with pain leroy youre incorrigible said a cool voice if youre going to assault the opposition youll have to stay in the truck perdita found herself looking up into the lean oliveskinned face of margie bridgwater the beautiful girl whod been sitting on lukes bed in hospital she was wearing white jeans loafers and a red shirt and the brilliant sunshine bounced joyfully off her blueblack hair hi perdita she said drily congratulations on making the team thanks muttered perdita collapsing beside taggie yes congratulations perdita called chessie and bibi who were sitting above margie both looking thoroughly overexcited i do hope you win added chessie in a muchtooaudible whisper im knocked out lukes been picked she added to margie about bloody time whats luke doing now asked bobby ferraros wife running a green pony clinic in florida said margie proudly hes managed to pay off all his debts that sonofabitch hal peters has run away to chile so he cant be extradited id have helped luke out if id known said chessie but hes so proud he never told anyone until it was too late where are you staying luke hates hotels because they wont take leroy said margie stroking leroys panting shiny head so weve rented a condo hes so lovely luke said chessie why dyou think im with him said margie looking down perdita found her nails had drawn blood in the palm of one hand how dare they discuss luke as if he was a new biography they were all enjoying oh look said taggie as a burst of band music echoed round the mountains here come the teams the first match as red and the entire polo world had predicted was a massacre from the moment bob hope threw in the ball from the back of a cadillac ricky knew it would be a tough game and that he as the most dangerous player in the english team would take the punishment for six chukkas it seemed the americans took positive pleasure in harassing the hell out of him particularly violent whenever he got the chance was red who seemed less interested in scoring which he should have been doing from the number two position than in paralysing ricky time and again ricky found himself forced off the ball crushed between the explosive unpredictable angel and the sleek viciously smiling red who jabbed his elbows into rickys ribs as though he intended to puncture his heart on the rare occasions ricky did get through like a gundog finally escaping the shackles of a bramble thicket there was luke solid as the rockies backing ball after ball such an incredibly long way that they invariably fell ten yards in front of goal beside the one american player that was loose and when the english got rattled and started fouling he hit four glorious penalties from the sixtyyard line luke whose horses had all been sold to pay his debts was riding barts ponies which as ricky suspected he had been tuning up for days with all the skill of a ferrari mechanic because of his height and endless legs he still gave the air of a father riding a seaside donkey to amuse his children but his hands were so light and so supple was his thirteenstone bulk that he managed to shift it like a contortionist for the first time he had the chance to show the world how brilliantly he could ride when given topclass horses apart from fantasma his own ponies had only been good because hed trained them so well but his air of calm was deceptive a despairing dommie who was supposed to be marking him and who had hardly touched the ball at all saw luke setting off upfield yet again unable to catch him because he was riding one of barts fastest ponies an exquisitely pretty little bay thoroughbred mare dommie panicked and ran corporal into lukes mare broadside there was a sickening thud as the mare hit the ground and lay still leaping to his feet luke seized a horrified dommie by his dark blue shirt and pulled him down off a quailing corporal you goddamm asshole he roared lifting his huge fist luke for chrissake dont hit him howled red galloping up then as the bay mare scrambled to her feet ponys only winded for a second the fist trembled in the air you goddam asshole said luke more gently then seeing how terrified dommie was looking he started to laugh and let him go whereupon juan obrien awarded a free goal to the americans rupert put his head in his hands unlike luke to flip his lid said chessie to bibi must be more strung up than he looks but bibi was cocooned in happiness she was expecting a baby by easily the most dashing man on the field who between blowing kisses in her direction was making seb carlisles life a misery by scoring all the goals the most miserable man on the field however was mike waterlane whod spent the last twentyfour hours on the loo whose mallet had developed an allergy to the ball and who like a policeman on point duty had waved every american player through with ricky pegged like gulliver the young english team lost direction and ran out the losers poor ricky plunged into another nightmarish week as the clamour of his detractors intensified colossal recriminations followed from the sponsors and the two polo associations ricky by his bloodyminded obstinacy had sabotaged the westchester the press carved him up baying for the return of drew and the napiers to prevent the second match being a complete joke drew was quoted as saying he would make himself available but that it would be rather like joining the titanic in midvoyage which didnt improve rickys temper rupert stood by him staunchly in public but in private the rows were awful and shook the white walls of the villa victoria if the americans won the second match the third would be cancelled which meant venturer would lose a fortune in television rights and sponsorship money worse still david waterlane insisted on flying over to sort things out he arrived around midnight on the eve of the second match and was even more incensed to discover that mike had been out since lunchtime with the twins perdita whod valiantly tried to keep everyones spirits up during the week had retreated to her room to avoid the brickbats shed been unable to concentrate even on dick francis since shed arrived but flipping through the paperbacks shed scooped up at random before she left she discovered an old poetry anthology of lukes outside the delicious spicy smell of taggies paella had been overwhelmed by the sweet voluptuous scent of orange blossom and stephanotis a shooting star careered across the indigo sky croaking treefrogs harmonized sexily with bob marley throbbing and pounding out of the outside speakers perdita started flipping through the anthology it fell open at emerson give all to love obey thy heart read perdita tis a brave master let it have scope follow it utterly she had difficulty reading the last verse because she was crying and because luke had written the word perdita in the margin though thou loved her as thyself as a self of purer clay though her parting dims the day stealing grace from all alive heartily know when halfgods go the gods arrive red had been a halfgod she thought bitterly and hed gone and shed been a halfgod and left luke that was why he was now with margie bridgwater who was as clever as she was good and beautiful and perdita absolutely loathed her guts outside raised voices were definitely winning over bob marley and the treefrogs perdita creeping to the window noticed ruperts cigar glowing redly as he increasingly drew on it trying to keep his temper his other hand holding a glass of brandy rested on taggies shoulder she was shelling peas for tomorrow nights dinner which would either be a celebration or the wake to end all wakes no one was taking any notice of sharon who rippling the oily pale turquoise surface of the pool dogpaddled up and down in the nude piledup hair held firmly above the water diamond earrings upstaging the huge stars do come in and have a dip boys the waters laike satin aym sure it will cool you down but david was yelling at ricky i want to know where the hell mike is hes not even in bed by midnight on the night he looked at his watch or rather the day of the most important match of his life if id been in charge this would never have happened he was interrupted by the sound of a minimoke roaring up the dust track pouring out dire straits followed by raucous laughter and slamming doors there is a green hill far away without a city wall sang seb carlisle in a light tenor as he pushed his way through the crimson mane of bougainvillaea where our dear lord was crucified who died to save us all joined in dommie in harmony for hes a jolly good fellow brayed mike coming in on an even lower register for hes a jolly good fellow for hes a jolly the singing tailed off as the trio encountered a solid phalanx of disapproval lined up round the pool where have you been thundered david waterlane hello david said seb brushing his blond hair out of his eyes we thought there was no point mike worrying all evening about you flying over and tomorrows match so we took him for a jaunt a seriously good jaunt said mike swaying towards the swimmingpool and only being saved from falling in by dommie catching hold of his shirt mikes normally slickedback hair flopped all over his forehead and he was wearing an outsize tshirt on which was printed the words frans friendly fornicating facilities we took him to a brothel in nevada said seb who was wearing a tshirt which said have a good lay pretty sophisticated customers landing all the time on the airstrip he went on dommies tshirt said support your local hooker we bought ones for you and perdita he beamed at ricky you ok darling he shouted up to perdita who was by now nearly falling out of the window with laughter rupert threw his cigar into the swimmingpool only just missing sharons nose you took mike to a knocking shop and got him drunk he said softly hes not drunk he smoked a joint on the way home said seb taking the cigarette from mike and inhaling deeply you should try this place rupert theyve got an orgy room with blue shagpile leading up to the waterbed and a jacuzzi with red lights under the water and we saw some brilliant blue movies much better for mikes morale than that frightfully depressing video of him letting everyone through in the first match we nearly tried the dominance dungeon added dommie we thought how much chessie would have enjoyed it whoops sorry he added giggling as rickys face tightened with rage seriously nice girls said mike collapsing on to a sunlounger really seriously friendly hes had mona lily and annie explained seb severally and together and hes so tired and relaxed hell sleep like a baby for the first time since hes been out here are you crazy hissed david youve probably caught aids its ok daddy said mike cheerfully i used a condominium glancing at rupert perdita saw that he had his head in his hands again trying to disguise the fact that he was quite hysterical with laughter the second match was quite different in losing his virginity mike seemed to have shed his terrible nerves as well primed by rupert with a vast slug of brandy when his father wasnt looking he played with unshakeable authority sledgehammering the ball upfield tigerish on any loose balls and twice pounding down like a panzer division to score splendid goals time and again the us team took the ball right down the field but the english wouldnt let them score realizing luke was the most dangerous player on the field seb and dommie weighed in like the two musketeers duelling with their sticks hooking bumping and stabbing the ball away from him playing a stoically defensive game with luke pegged red and angels lifesupport machine was cut off and they were unable to score ricky on the other hand hit form with a knockout punch elusive as the scarlet pimpernel swift as a lurcher always there to whisk the ball away when mike or the twins made a frantic lastditch clear he played the game of his life the crowd reluctant to witness a second bloodbath had halved but now over and over again broke into spontaneous cheers umpires juan and jesus were so often distracted by rickys virtuosity that they missed fouls on other parts of the field at halftime the english were leading and as word flew round the californian coast that a tussle was in process spectators started screeching in in their limos and helicopters swooped down out of the sky like gulls on a newly ploughed field the temperature had also rocketed huge brownbottomed clouds like dusty meringues gathered menacingly on the horizon beneath a royalblue sky tinged with purple but the english players and ponies under ruperts fitness regime were standing up well perdita envied the bikinis and sundresses all round her as once again she sweated in the stands in her england gear in the fifth chukka the english steeled themselves for reds and glitzs legendary bombardment but due to rickys sticking to red like chewing gum to a dogs fur it never materialized bart was gnashing his beautifully capped teeth on the sideline come on england screamed chessie well i am english she added defiantly to a shocked bibi terry hanlon flown specially over from cowdray to do the commentary was so petrified of flying that hed practically had to be doped before he would get on to the plane but so encouraged was he by his countrys gutsy performance that he quite forgot his jet lag and the ball goes out of play sorry granny he added as red in a fury of frustration hit a ball straight into the stands if you watch the ball youll never get hit by it hitin to england and there goes ricky francelynch on his way to ten goals did you see the way he just stroked the ball under the nose of red alderton and took it away sending a lovely lofted pass to dommie carlisle what a chance but here comes luke alderton he went on steady as the rockies thundering down to ride dommie off but dommie flicks the ball back to his captain who powers it between the posts thats to england then waiting for the cheers to subside you cant fight the entire english side on your own luke with a wry grin luke lifted his stick in the direction of the commentary box in the closing seconds of the chukka however the ball was once more bouncing towards the seemingly insatiable american goalmouth frantic to clear bobby ferraro opened his shoulders and let fly valiantly dommie hurled little corporal forward to block the shot as if fired by a cannon it smacked dommie just below his kneepad as the bell went oh shit shit shit he screamed slumping over his saddle to a man the crowd winced as the players gathered round and the ambulance roared up dommie had gone greener than the inside of an avocado pear im sorry dommie im real real sorry said a horrified bobby ferraro my fault for riding into it mumbled dommie fortunately he was near the pony lines and refusing any help from the ambulance managed to ride corporal off the field i dont like the look of that said the paramedic give me a bucket of novocaine gasped dommie trying not to scream with pain as ricky seb and a demented louisa lifted him down from corporal ill be ok in a minute you cant go back into that hellhole said louisa aghast rupert agreed and sprinting along the edge of the boards yelled up to perdita in the stands to get her kneepads on the only person in fact who was happy when dommie insisted on playing on was bart slapping a clenched fist into his other palm he moved round the american team now we can zap them ride into the little bastards knee as often as possible force him to retire and we can get the girl in dont be so fucking unsporting dad said luke in outrage you could put the guy out of the game for good safe journey my darling louisas voice broke as dommie rode back on to the field to deafening applause dommie was as brave as his own bull terrier but the blow had smashed his left knee and the pain was clearly unhinging him as red and angel unleashed a fusillade of shots the crowd who had no idea quite how badly dommie was hurt kept up a continuous roar of encouragement as the score drew level dommie battered by the inevitable rough and tumble grew greener and greener ricky was torn he ought to protect dommie but aware that the westchester was fast slipping out of his grasp the only answer was to forget him and plunge into the fray thirty seconds later with a glorious cut shot he put england ahead now it was a question of staying there despite the punishing heat perdita shivered encased in an icecold sweat padded and gloved with her stick resting against the white fence below the stands she expected any moment to have to leap on to dommies beautiful fickle pony bardot who was known to be as tricky as she was fast i must read the play she kept telling herself grimly as poor dommie came down the field it was like watching a bird trying to fly with two broken wings but slowly as she forced herself to concentrate she became aware that luke unlike the rest of the us team was contradicting barts orders and as the man who should have been marking dommie and despite the undeniable advantage it would have given him was deliberately not riding dommie off on the side of his damaged knee there dommie had the ball again and luke who could have bumped him into the stands laboriously rode round to hook him on the other side glancing at perdita taggie noticed that tears were pouring down her face gently she put her hand over perditas lukes the one isnt he perdita nodded i guess he always has been she muttered but ive only just realized it and now its too late as the teams lined up jostling and shoving for the throwin dommies agony was so blinding he thought hed faint pain was in the mind he must push himself through the pain barrier and go into mental overdrive bardot his chestnut mare fond of batting her long eyelashes and giving a colossal buck when chastised was for once behaving impeccably and carrying her master as smoothly as a rollsroyce when mike menaced by angel and red hit the ball upfield ahead of him bardot swung round to follow it alas red didnt have any of his brothers scruples seeing dommie pounding towards goal looking for an offside drive red cannoned into his smashed knee with his ponys right shoulder howling with pain dommie had to cling on to bardots neck to stay on you fucker hysterical with rage seb rode straight at red slicing the ball away from him towards goal but luke was too quick for seb riding him once more off the ball he turned the play with a staggering sixtyyard backshot with ten seconds on the clock everyone collided in a cloud of dust in front of the british goal the americans frantic to whack it home so the game could go to a seventh chukka looking for his backhand in a tangle of threshing sticks ricky kept his cool as he cleared for england saving the game on the bell everyone crashed over the line sending a goal post flying in the process and all ending up in a great heap you ok dommie yelled seb in anguish through the dust fine said dommie whod dismounted im just hanging on to my horse the only problem said seb as the dust cleared is that its my horse youre hanging on to then wheres corporal said dommie looking round puzzled corporal was in the last chukka explained seb and he played so well hes been promoted to sergeant dommie giggled but as he let go of sebs pony he collapsed on to the ground like a rag doll i think ive fucked my knee dont worry said seb shakily youll love hospital the foods terrific i could murder a tbone said dommie and passed out with dommie critically ill in a palm springs hospital with concussion and a splintered knee perdita would have to play in the final match the bpa were singularly unamused and dispatched brigadier hughie prematurely to la quinta to drum some sense into the wayward english squad storming into the villa victoria at twilight the following evening sweating in a creased wool pinstriped suit he found them totally euphoric having learnt that the operation had been successful and dommie would be playing again in a few months they now felt able to celebrate yesterdays victory properly hughies jaundiced view of ruperts playboy attitude and rickys deviant captaincy were further exacerbated when he found everyone plastered on harvey wallbangers singing rugger songs and resting their aching bones in the swirling waters of the jacuzzi this is worse than an orgy spluttered hughie over the deafening blast of dancers latest lp and sharon kaputnik ought to put on a bathing dress he added as he took rupert and ricky into the house do them good to unwind said rupert theyve got four days to sober up not how wed have done it in singapore chuntered hughie ducking as a pineapple came flying through the french windows anyway its time you chaps came to your senses you had a damn good win yesterday but dont push your luck the napiers are playing in argentina and quite prepared to fly up here if we pay their expenses and give them ten grand each and drewd be an even better bet hes cooling his heels in rutshire ricky who unlike everyone else was entirely sober had had an agonizing twentyfour hours worrying about dommie the thought of drew in rutshire cooling his heels and no doubt warming his hands on daisys welcoming body did nothing to improve his temper im captaining this team hughie so bugger off you really prefer a slip of a girl to a fit very experienced ninegoal man yes said rupert evenly ive always been heterosexual what what dont be flippant exploded hughie you cant put in a girl against those thugs those thugs might back off a little because she is a girl went on rupert reasonably now really do bugger off hughie and play scrabble or have a hot tub with mrs hughie i bet they didnt have those in singapore rupert in fact was reeling with relief assured of a third match venturer were likely to make a killing the british and american sponsors were delighted perdita was going to play such a beautiful tempestuous controversial figure would certainly pull in the crowds next day rupert flew to new york and after five hours closeted with chief executives and vice presidents managed to persuade nbs to cancel coverage of an ice hockey match and to transmit the match live instead of recording it for a later date in england people could watch it if they got up at four oclock in the morning or see an edited version the following evening rupert was considerably aided by the press who pointed out the piquancy of perdita having to play against her exlover and who all showed closeups of her crying in the stands as she watched the match still in love wrote the scorpion in delight ruperts wife comforts griefstricken perdita as she sobs for red the rat bart on the other hand was in a towering rage that the americans had lost the second match always on the hunt for a scapegoat he blamed it entirely on luke for not riding dommie off red went even further the morning after the match he rang brad dillon the american team manager can i speak to you in utter confidence i guess so my brother lukes been crazy about perdita macleod for years i thought he was shacked up with margie bridgwater maybe he is but hell still have to mark perdita on sunday and if hes too much of a wimp to ride off dommie carlisle hell never carve up perdita why dont you bring back shark hes never had a scruple in his life this is your own brother were talking about said brad disapprovingly luke is a very fine player sure he is and i just adore him but hes too soft sort of guy who reads poetry in the evening mused brad dillon could be youre right red i asked luke to stick and ball with me in greenwich early one morning a few weeks ago he wasnt in the lobby at eightthirty so i went upstairs and banged on his bedroom door can you beat it red he was still in bed drinking a bourbon and even worse reading a book what did i tell you said red in triumph hes got a bad attitude brad dillon had no difficulty persuading the other selectors gentlemen im afraid this is no time for gentlemen sharks our man at lunchtime the apa issued a press release that luke would be dropped for the final game it was the night before the match mike waterlane having spent the afternoon in his prospective stepmothers arms while his father played golf slept like a hound puppy after his first days hunting seb on the other hand had had a very bad four days demented when dommie was injured he had cried his eyes out when the hospital assured him his brother was out of danger always the confident assertive twin whod pinched dommies girls and bossed him about for twentysix years he now found himself totally lost both on and off the field how many times before big games had he woken dommie up to chat and bolster his own confidence now feeling horribly alone he tried to concentrate on james herriot lucky lucky rupert to have taggie in bed with him he wished suddenly he was lying in daisy macleods arms pillowed on her soft breasts hed definitely ring her when he got home nor could ricky get to sleep he wished he could go down to the stables and discuss tactics for tomorrows match with wayne but security triggered off by tremendous press interest and the princes impending arrival was incredibly tight and he didnt want to wake the ponies at last the westchester was within his grasp under the eye of two security guards the cup had been on display in the clubhouse yesterday huge silver and ungainly with its jugeared handles and horses rearing out of the side in his gloomier moments he had to admit that even if england did their best tomorrow it wouldnt be enough to beat the americans perdita was simply not as good as dommie and without dommie seb would be not even half as good as usual but miracles happen in moments of true inspiration sides could reach heights never achieved before it was up to him as captain to instil into them the belief that they could and if by the thousand to one chance they did win what then he still hadnt got to ten he had seen chessie at a distance over the last few days shining more brightly than ever before silencing rooms and dividing crowds by her beauty then this evening a florists van had delivered a single red rose in a cellophane box darling ricky said the card carry this red rose of england next to your heart tomorrow good luck and my love goes with you chessie the rose was now languishing in a tooth mug its head drooping in the heat nor did it smell he felt the inevitable sick churning he mustnt let nerves get to him he had to calm the others switching on the television he found a weatherman saying that the hurricane that was ravaging florida tugging up trees by the roots ripping off roofs like milk bottle tops was relentlessly moving towards england it gave ricky the excuse to pick up the telephone dddaisy its ricky sorry to wake you yes im fine perditas fine too a bit uptight but thats to be expected well theyre not screaming at each other rrruperts trying to be patient hows little chef when daisy said he was eating at last rump steak and chocolate ricky laughed and said hed reimburse her look he went on i rang to say theres a bloody great hurricane on its way to you i dont want you to walk through the woods theres a lot of dead trees in there that might get blown down perdita couldnt sleep either frantic excitement that she was going to be the first woman ever to play for england and even better play against luke had been utterly doused when she heard hed been dropped how could the bastards do that when hed played so impeccably in the first two matches on the chair shed already laid out her newly washed darkblue england shirt and white breeches along with her lucky belt lucky socks lucky pants and lucky bra which taggie had mended for her and which had broken once before when shed been playing with luke and hed called out tack time and stopped the game fiddling with his curb chain until shed managed to fix it oh god why did everything come back to luke she must rise above her misery she fingered the red rose of england on her shirt winning tomorrow must be her only thought no novel could distract her so she turned again to lukes poetry book emerson made her cry she certainly hadnt given all to love only to the pursuit of fame and riches and there was robert frost but i have promises to keep and miles to go before i sleep would she ever sleep peacefully again without luke despairingly she turned back to shakespeare in peace theres nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility but when the blast of war blows in our ears then imitate the action of a tiger that was luke to a t she remembered him declaiming those lines on the way to the queens cup again she could hardly read on the games afoot follow your spirit and upon this charge cry god for harry england and st george if she learnt it by heart it might send her to sleep she jumped at a knock on the door it was rupert carrying two whiskys perhaps i better check red alderton isnt lurking in the wardrobe he said with a faint smile as he sat down on her bed for a second they gazed at each other as if into a mirror looking for likenesses we be of one blood ye and i thought perdita you look about twelve said rupert perdita blew her nose noisily on a kleenex you dont have to be nice to me just because youre going to drop me im going to do no such thing taggies just given me the first bollocking ever told me to come and say im sorry actually i was sorry anyway ive behaved like a shit i deserved it said perdita in a choked voice i deserved everything ive behaved horribly since the day i was born and now im paying for it your ponies dont think so said rupert gently they absolutely adore you and so would everyone else if you gave them a chance ive been so awful to mum and you and taggie and worst of all to luke how could those dickheads drop him lucky for us they have said rupert sharks a killer but hes nowhere near lukes class theres noone else who can do the things luke can do under pressure it makes me so mad good said rupert now listen to me the americans dropped luke because hes too much of a gent to take you out your sole task tomorrow is to show the world how stupid they were without luke well bury them look at this roared ricky storming into ruperts bedroom the next morning and thrusting the daily news under his nose you might bloody knock grumbled rupert hastily drawing the duvet over taggies voluptuous naked body when francesca alderton left her husband ricky francelynch captain of england six years ago he read and ran off with airline billionaire bart alderton she taunted her former spouse with a challenge that she would only come back to him on certain conditions if he won the british gold cup which he did earlier this year went to ten the highest rating for a polo player which hes tipped to do later this year and won back the westchester cup for britain will he achieve this second rung at eldorado polo club this afternoon red alderton must feel he is riding with the responsibility of his fathers marriage and happiness in his pocket rupert looked up great stuff he said blandly and at the worst itll ensure that everyone in england and america will tune in to see the result of your marriage think of the viewing figures who leaked it thundered ricky rupert shrugged how would i know his eyes didnt quite meet rickys you had any breakfast you really should eat something today of all days dont get off the subject said ricky furiously whats that piece going to do to chessie shell love it said rupert soothingly you know how she laps up publicity and ill tell you something else the new york overeighties polo club have invested in a television set for the first time in their history so they can watch the match stop taking the piss exploded ricky then turning to taggie if you dont want to be a widow you better keep your husband out of my way despite ruperts air of insouciance however he was worried he might have gone too far at the team meeting beforehand ricky seemed totally out to lunch his eyes staring his face dishcloth grey the lines round his mouth and between his eyebrows so heavy they looked as though they had been etched with a dagger he seemed to be taking nothing in as rupert harangued them go to the man force every play make every play a hard one dont let anyone set up to hit the ball stop them gaining possession the americans are so hot every goal you scorell be a victory each time you stop shark backing the ball youre worth nine goals perdita the temperature had soared and it was intensified down at the polo ground by more than five hundred of the worlds press whod invaded the club in search of a story everywhere cinecameras whirled tapes rotated notebooks filled up with superlatives and speculation looking up at the mountains as they drove to the game perdita had an uneasy feeling that the wrinkled sleeping elephants would wake up and stampede the pitch and that the day would end in terrible disaster the press fell on the british team as they got out of their car but ricky walked through the lot of them like trying to interview a rock face wrote a girl from the mail on sunday petulantly i hope el orgulloso comes before a fall an old man on a stick tottered towards him ricky francelynch your father lent me a pony for the westchester damn fine player hardest man i ever had to mark is he still leaving him in midsentence ricky walked on down to the pony lines where the horses were tied up in the shade of straw palisades im sorry perdita apologized to the old man he gets funny before a big game i know hed love to hear about his father afterwards hollywood was out in force once again perdita thought shed never seen so many beautiful girls it must be all that orange juice but still the brightest star in the firmament was chessie she was wearing a scarlet dress and scarlet shoes but over her slender brown arm she carried a fringed black silk shawl if im in mourning at the end of the game she told the frantically scribbling reporters with an equivocal smirk ill put on the black shawl the match kicked off with an amazing show of hollywood glitz pale mauve and dark blue balloons the colours of the team were let off in their thousands blueandmauve hotair balloons floated overhead giving great snorts and making any dog that had been brave enough to face the heatwave bristle and cower helicopters trailed good luck messages vintage cars circled the field bearing celebrities pop stars bands and cheerleaders flashing more flawless golden limbs entertained the happy excited crowd ferrantis whod done an aboutturn handed out free bottles of perdita in the stands revlon countered with red carrier bags containing bottles of shampoo and conditioner the americans were wayout favourites but the odds were shortening on the brits as the american team led the parade on to the field following the glittering gold instruments of the band gazing at the lounging willowy elegance of reds back catching frequent glimpses of his perfect profile as he flashed smile after lazy smile at the swooning girls in the crowd perdita could only marvel that hed once had the power to hurt her so much then as they drew up in front of the hastily runup royal box where the prince slightly pink in a lightweight suit stood smiling down at them she noticed the size of shark nelligans shoulders his brawny arms and his walrus torso rolling over his leather belt and shivered soon hed be waiting for her like his namesake in a still lagoon for the first time in her career she was terrified not just that shed let down her country but that she might also be killed if only it were luke she couldnt see him or leroy anywhere in the crowd noone by contrast was happier in the parade than spotty incensed to watch his friends wayne and kinta going off to the earlier matches he now had a chance to show off revelling in the laughter and cheers of the crowd whod been told by terry hanlon he was an allamerican pony he flashed his long brown legs beneath his white rump rolled his white eyes at the band and deliberately let off a volley of the loudest farts to embarrass his mistress as she circled in front of the prince after her name was called tero would never have done that to me thought perdita with a stab of anguish frank sinatra and dancer were to have sung their individual national anthems but dancers plane had been diverted with engine trouble to the disappointment of the english team so frank sinatra sung them both which brought a tingle to everyones spine shit alejandros umpiring said seb hes bound to favour angel im going to be sick said mike in a faint voice well be sick in your hat said seb briskly we dont want slippery patches on the grass still under the careful eyes of the security guards the westchester gleamed on its red tablecloth the television cameras were rolling a semicircle of cameramen hovered on the edge of the stands solely monitoring chessies behaviour back at the pony lines perdita glanced at ricky he looked really ill was he that worried about losing chessie what a tragedy that dancer hadnt arrived in time to cheer him up good luck you chaps said brigadier hughie good luck chorused louisa and the grooms they had worked so hard and once their precious charges were on the field they could only pray just rattle them in the first chukka said rupert then adding to perdita as she changed off spotty on to one of david waterlanes ponies a grey mare called demelza sharks wildly overweight hes going to feel the heat it was only as they lined up for paul newman to throw in the first ball from the back of a cadillac that ricky realized hed forgotten to bring chessies red rose not even a petal in the bottom of his boot come on you guys screamed perdita suddenly excited imitate the action of a tiger the next minute the ball a special bright yellow one to show up on television crashed into the shifting blockade of ponies and riders and the final of the fourteenth westchester cup was off in fact the americans played such a dazzlingly aggressive game in the first half that lukes absence wasnt obvious and by halftime they were leading taking no prisoners shark nelligan rode perdita off with such violence that all the breath was knocked out of her body when she got near the ball his long beefy arms hooked her stick and every time she tried to stop him clearing he somehow barged the quarters of one of his huge horses into her seb and mike pressed the battle without letup doing their best to stem the american advance but rickys game was definitely off he had no aggression his passes didnt connect or went straight to the opposition and the few stabs he made at goal went wide what the fuck are you playing at yelled rupert as he came off at halftime you select a bunch of kids who are playing like gods youre meant to lead them over the top and youre being about as uplifting as a fiveyearold jock strap the temperature was still rising male hands applied oil to vulnerable female shoulders the crowd was enjoying the sunshine but had lost bounce and were even doing the spot the ball competitions in their programmes the bars were doing a roaring trade the press wilted in the heat their cameras had become very heavy theyd come all this way and there was no story red and perdita were showing no sign of falling into each others arms and chessie looked stunned rather than stunning at such an english setback all the animation had drained out of her face and she refused to talk even to bibi who was reeling with joy because angel had scored three of the goals even the arrival of dancer in joan collinss private plane didnt rouse the cameramen megastars were two a dime today fighting his way to the pony lines dancer found the english mounting their ponies for the fourth chukka to fink ive been stuck in an alderton sardine tin for the last fifteen hours just for your sake ricky only to find youre nilfour down get yer fucking finger out then seeing how ill ricky looked its no big deal sweetheart if you lose and chessie loves you shell come back anyway ricky stared at him bleakly you think so course she will shes looking pretty cheesed off now heres somefink to cheer you up added dancer it was a photograph of little chef in a polo hat and dark glasses ricky laughed and turned it over where daisy had written good luck and love from everyone at snow cottage when did you see her yesterday said dancer move your ass reeky yelled alejandro everyones waiting shoving little chefs photograph into his breeches pocket ricky vaulted on to kinta and galloped back on to the field at the beginning of the fourth chukka a machiavellian red pulled up on the ball convincing alejandro that seb had crossed him up went the american sticks alejandro awarded a penalty from the sixtyyard line which shark converted gloriously the rest of the side crowded round him their patting hands sinking into his fleshy back fivenil good thing we dropped luke muttered bart to brad dillon sharks playing great he felt happier than ever before in his life reds speciality the fifth chukka was coming up ricky and the brits would be utterly humiliated and his beautiful chessie would stay with him earlier hed seen grace hanging round the pony lines giving red advice she was still a handsome woman but in the harsh californian light she looked sixty for the millionth time despite everything bart was glad hed left her for chessie whom he adored and understood shed be utterly miserable going back to the unimaginative inhibited ricky who was playing like a nought with any luck he might be put down it was a joke he could ever be considered a ten as play started again and they lined up for the throwin a bored voice in the crowd called out oh come on england perdita turned in fury were doing our best you fucker she screamed you try playing against this ape the crowd shouted with laughter in the ensuing mêlée shark swung his ponys head into perditas ribs once too often you bastard she yelled then to herself help me god we cant let them win so easily and from the spacious royalblue firmament on high the almighty seemed to answer by suddenly putting wings on her back and on her ponys heels cry god for charlie england and st george she screamed to the others and cannoning off shark then into red then stopping short then wheeling away under their horses tails she careered off and put a beautifully angled cutshot from twenty yards into goal the crowd roared thats better pleaded terry hanlon come on you brits in the crowd give the boys and the girl a chance they need you thirty seconds later perdita came pounding down again whacking it to seb then racing ahead picking up the ball again and sinking a big nearside neck shot come on ricky she yelled as she rode back to the centre we cant do it on our own every time red and shark tried to ride her off now she was too quick for them and they found they were bumping the breeze slowly the english and particularly ricky steadied and they ended the fourth chukka only down well done fucking marvellous said an ecstatic rupert fantastic play perdita keep it up all of you your job in the next chukka seb is to mark red mindless stop him letting off any fireworks the fifth chukka was uneven mike rather than let red score fouled deliberately in the american goalmouth so that shark had to go back to the sixtyyard line to take the penalty overcome by nerves he hit wide luke wouldnt have missed that perdita taunted him goaded and desperate to make his mark on polo history shark was determined to score from the number four position and kept trying to bulldoze the british defence leaving his own back door wide open and enabling perdita and seb to score twice more corporals now been promoted to warrant officer two whooped seb triumphantly patting dommies little brown pony as they cantered back for the throwin a second later the play was down near the english goal and an utterly rattled shark mishit so the ball ricocheted off the boards over the back line you stay there fatty ill be back in a minute yelled perdita at shark as she belted off to take up her position as mike hit in the crowd howled with laughter wash your mouth out with soap perdita said terry hanlon but isnt she playing well catching the other side off guard mike powered the ball to ricky who keeping moving to lure angel away broke off to the right to receive the ball then before angel could blink backed it to a hovering seb who swinging corporal round scored yet again corporals an rsm now whooped seb sixall to england on the bell the whole crowd were on their feet yelling their heads off as the teams went into the last chukka and the americans steadied and rallied england england england chanted the galvanized british contingent now they were into a frantic mêlée in front of the american goal angel somehow managed to clear and ricky sent the fleetfooted wayne after the ball as he could hear red thundering down on him the only answer was to back it turning round in his saddle a miracle of cool ricky took a lightning look at the posts then picking the lefthand one as a target keeping his body steady and wayne moving leant over to the left until his head was level with waynes gallant pounding heart and raked the ball over the antheap of players slap between the posts as the flag went up the crowd gave a collective sigh of horror and ecstasy overheard by everyone chessie uttered a shriek of joy and raised a clenched fist in a black power salute oh ricky darling what a wonderful wonderful goal she screamed ecstatically the cameramen went berserk they had a picture at last the english were also ahead at last but with three minutes to go they could feel their ponies wilting spotty was panting like an obscene telephone caller and his brown patch foamed under his breastplate like an overflowing washing machine red and angel had taken the opportunity when the last goal was scored to change ponies the english problem was to stop either of them getting the ball next minute mike gave his side a breathing space by clouting the ball firmly into the stands unsporting but necessary said seb as the players lined up youre learning mike in the closing seconds a perfect eightyyard drive from red took the ball down to the english end where it was centred by bobby ferraro one after another yelling with frustration angel bobby shark and a furiously gallopingup red tried to hammer the ball between the posts as mike cleared for england through a thick curtain of dust a great groan went up from the stands for once again shark had left the american posts unattended taking the ball up the boards with two mighty driving passes kicking up a halo of dust as he went ricky could feel wayne struggling to stay ahead and red on a new pony gaining on him just in time he jumped the boards and did a forehand cutshot to seb who hearing angels pony behind him and seeing five seconds left on the clock took a frantic swipe at goal realizing it was going wide perdita catapulted forward for the offside forehand bloody hell she screamed as the ball hit a divot and bounced awkwardly to the left rupert had permanently taunted her that she had no nearside cut shots shed show him dimly she was aware of the great roar of the crowd chorusing spotty spotty spotty triumphant in his moment of glory revelling in the circus blood which was now pumping on overtime through his veins spotty noticed the ball had shifted jamming on his brakes he pirouetted like nureyev on his conkerbrown legs sixty degrees to the left thrusting perdita within reach of the ball but at the same time wrapping her in a cloud of dust she couldnt see what she was doing but trusting spotty and her instincts she leant perilously out to the left and with a flick of her wrist like a tennis backhand stroked the ball where she prayed the posts might be then she dropped her reins and clapped her hands over her eyes unable to watch as the dust cleared slowly opening her fingers she saw the miracle of the flag going up then frenziedly joyful waving the bellow of the crowd was so deafening that noone heard the final horn it had been such a wonderful match that the sporting marvellously goodnatured crowd could forgive a british victory and poured on to the pitch to honour all the eight heroes perditas throat was so dry that she couldnt whoop for joy instead she hurled her stick high into the blue and people rushed forward to catch it desperate to get the first quote a scorpion reporter had pinched one of barts ponies and thundered up the field to thrust a tape recorder under perditas nose what with the frantic panting of spotty and perditas delirious croaking the reply was pretty inaudible well done perdeeta it was angel reaching out to shake hands and hug her next minute shark was beside her looking like his namesake deprived of a nice fat human then suddenly his ugly face split into a great grin and he clamped a vast sweaty arm round her shoulders well done honey ive gotta admit you outplayed us i never thought id say that to a slip of a girl who gave you the slip bouncing through the crowds like a dog through a barley field seb hugged perdita and pumped sharks hand jolly big of shark he added in an undertone evidently bart offered him a quarter of a million bucks if they won christ said perdita in awe as spotty nearly disappeared beneath a wave of patting hands refusing to shake hands with anyone his face a death mask red galloped past her well played called out perdita amazed that she suddenly felt so sorry for him he turned unsmiling fat lot of good it did me you did great back off you fuckers he snarled at the advancing photographers then seriously endangering their nikons and their lives he galloped straight through the lot of them it seemed ages before perdita could wade through the surging ocean of wellwishers back to the pony lines on the way she lost her hat and her whip and very nearly her shirt looking up she noticed rupert fighting his way towards her seeing the expression of blazing triumph on his face she glanced wistfully round to see at whom it was directed but there were only swooning excited cheering crowds slowly it dawned that he was looking just at her an instant later hed dragged her off spotty into his arms im all hot and sweaty she stammered well done my darling oh christ im proud of you as she looked up bewildered he put a hand on her soaked head and pulled it against his chest he could feel the frantic pounding of her heart come on rupe shouted the sun as the press closed in you must recognize perdita as your daughter now rupert grinned round at them course i do only a campbellblack could have played that well he looked down at perdita its all right lovie theres no need to cry youre mine now ill take care of you then to make her laugh wed better not hang around or the scorpionll accuse you of parentmolesting as the teams lined up even the normally impassive ricky was hard put to hide his elation they said we hadnt a foxs chance in a hunt kennel he stammered to the greymushroom field of microphones but we did it the boys and perdita played so well i just had to follow them round thats not to say the americans didnt play brilliantly but in the end we played better dyou think all the flak you got from everyone in the last month sharpened up your game asked the sunday times ricky smiled briefly no i was always good oh isnt he macho sighed the girl from the mail on sunday talk about a cliff face turning into an avalanche on the field what are you doing this evening the westchester cup had been described by a former player as a singularly hideous trophy but nothing had ever looked more beautiful to the english team as ricky walked up to deafening cheers to accept it from prince charles who was obviously as delighted as he was amazed by the result well done ricky absolutely marvellous it was hard to curtsy with any grace in boots and breeches but when perdita still redeyed from dust and her rapprochement with rupert approached the prince he bent forward and kissed her cheek and when he pinned a little ruby brooch in the shape of a rose on her dark blue jersey the crowd roared their approval to perditas amazement spotty won best playing pony he was so delighted to be stuffed so full of polos and the centre of attention that he forgot to fart there was a brief pause as the most valuable player was announced must be red whispered perdita to seb by general consensus of opinion said brad dillon rustling his papers because his utter stability held the american team together and because he refused to ride off a seriously injured player in the true tradition of sportmanship the award for the most valuable player of the series goes to luke alderton an amazed hush was followed by the most deafening storm of cheering of the day and it continued long after luke in a pair of torn jeans and an old blue denim shirt had fought his way up to collect the beautiful rearing silver pony overwhelmed with longing and pride perdita wanted to rush forward and hug him but the whooping yodelling ecstatic crowd divided them and the next moment she found herself being swept off by ricky to ring daisy before the press conference only chessie the ultimate upstager having ostentatiously flung off her black silk shawl managed to pummel her way past a clicking frenzy of cameramen and security guards and fling her arms round rickys neck in ecstasy you won my darling you won dont you realize what that means as the photographers swung into action frantic to capture the moment perdita turned away horrorstruck and found herself looking straight at bart and red it was your fucking fault bart was hissing at red you forced them to drop luke red greyer beneath his suntan than ever ricky had been was looking utterly desolate after the match there was a celebration dinner at the quinta hotel organized by the american polo association and the cockahoop sponsors everyone is expected to get plastered rupert told the england team but there seems to be a general consensus of opinion that the men will wear ties and you will all behave well at least for the duration of dinner that means no eloping before the queen he added in an undertone to ricky when they met up in the lobby rupert looked disapprovingly at rickys black tie at least you might have left that off after winning the westchester you cant wallow in misery for ever then seeing taggies face no im sorry youve won the westchester you can do what you bloody well like perdita in a black backless dress which matched her bruises and the dark circles under her eyes had a feeling of total unreality the euphoria of winning and of rupert at last accepting her was fast receding she was worried about ricky who seemed unbelievably twitchy and couldnt get plastered like everyone else but all she could think about was whether or not luke would turn up a louring glowering bart arrived with chessie who was looking thoroughly overexcited and more minxy than ever in a gold tunic exactly matching her suntan and with a golden rose in her hair well thank you perdita she murmured as she passed you certainly contributed to an english victory this afternoon but before perdita could answer there was a burst of cheering as red walked in with the american team he had totally regained his composure and was laughing and joking he was wearing a pink blazer edged with purple because the entire polo youth of america seemed now to have gone back to wearing pale blue blazers braided with emerald green there was even more noisy rejoicing when mike and seb rolled up already plastered with lily and annie from the nevada brothel and a blissful louisa wheeling a rather pale dommie with his knee in plaster around in a large shopping trolley which theyd pinched from a local hypermarket havent you got any dope for ricky whispered perdita as she hugged dommie he needs something to cheer him up hes just won the fucking westchester said seb some people are never satisfied sharon is giggled dommie shes just seduced brigadier hughie and weve promoted corporal to general so hell be sharons next target added seb chucking a cauliflower floret at bobby ferraro shes going to lose david waterlane at this rate said louisa i think her sights are set somewhat higher than a baronet murmured seb she was last heard remarking how naice his hayness looked in his offwhaite suit oh come on perdita cheer up we won taggie realizing that perditas spirits were at rock bottom took her aside its so heavenly ruperts accepted you at last hes so pleased he cant wait to get you up on all his ponies i promise hell be a marvellous father once hes on someones side its one hundred and fifty per cent you do love him said perdita wistfully oh more than anything i still wake up sweating in the middle of the night and have to reach out and touch him to prove it isnt all a dream how can you be so nice asked perdita shaking her head you ought to give lessons after that perdita got no peace everyone wanted to congratulate her and take her through every stroke of the game until seb came up grinning wickedly youve drawn the short straw sweetheart he said youve got to sit on hughies right talk about the price of fame and watch out now hes in bimbo limbo he may start touching you up joining them ricky pushed a loose tendril of hair behind perditas ear you ok of course i just wish mummy was here so do i said seb feelingly ricky frowned oh fuck off then as seb sloped off grinning ricky added look will you give daisy a message when you get home but perdita never heard what he was going to say because as dinner was announced luke walked in with margie bridgwater who was looking staggering in clinging crimson slit up the sides to show an eternity of long brown leg i must behave i must behave perdita told herself through gritted teeth as she fought her way down to her seat at the top table she had to pass luke and almost wrenched her stomach muscles pulling them in so she neednt touch him well done he said slowly i knew you had megastar quality but i never figured you were that good you pulled them together you won that game oh that deep slow husky voice perdita wanted to collapse into his arms but margie was hovering smiling but tense you taught me everything i know stammered perdita wed never have won if they hadnt dropped you for a second they gazed at each other both holloweyed neither able to smile buck up perdita said brigadier hughie putting two sweating hands on her bruised arms im starving too nervous to get any lunch some joker to make matters worse had also put her next to red the twins very drunk now started bombarding them with rolls yelling kiss and make up kiss and make up then as sharon swept in somewhat flushed with a bootfaced david waterlane they started singing for shes a jolly good fellater for shes a jolly good fellater shut up you two said rupert grinning he was trying to listen to the head of revlon who was forecasting the worst share slide in us history dollars sagging interest rates are soaring he lowered his voice ive sold all my capital stock and gone liquid im much more worried about this hurricane reaching england said rupert christ knows how many trees ill have down he glanced at his watch half past ten in the morning in england seeing taggie was safely sitting down near bibi and angel he nipped out to ring his stockbroker red and perdita had a perfectly polite conversation as they both failed to touch their pale pink lobster mousse but there was no longer a flicker of empathy between them here is a man who used to have me screaming and begging for more thought perdita as he experimented on my body with all the detachment of a behavioural scientist testing a cageful of rats it was like visiting a garden which had seemed vast and mysterious when one was a child but which now had shrunk to insignificance mercifully luke was at a different table all she could see was his broad back and his redgold hair starting to stick upwards despite being slicked down with water far too often margies laughing aquiline profile turned towards him each time she put a crimsonnailed hand on his arm perdita felt redhot pokers stabbing her gut bottles rose green and empty from the table courses came and went a cake with scarlet icing in the shape of the red rose of england was cut by ricky and passed down the tables and thrown about the westchester cup brimming with champagne was passed round and round and each valiant victor and brave loser toasted perdita had no idea what she or red talked about or what hughie told her about singapore until brad dillon handsome in a sandcoloured suit rose to propose the toast of the winners to a bombardment of flying grapes weve skunked you in twelve out of fourteen of the series so i guess we can be generous at this moment in time he said expansively but were coming over to get it back next year weve only loaned it you i wish spotty could come in and eat bread dipped in salt like the maltese cat thought perdita as brigadier hughie who could never miss an opportunity to yak lurched to his feet a piece of cake hit him on the shoulder and the brigadiers blocked the shot shouted seb as the cake was followed by a carrot a piece of celery and an after eight which fell out of its paper shut up you chaps said hughie ive got a surprise announcement to make the japs have invaded singapore shouted rupert everyone howled with laughter a surprise announcement hughie ploughed on by mutual agreement of the british and american polo associations i should like to announce that ricky francelynch has finally been put up to ten the first british player since the war to achieve that honour an amazed and delighted storm of cheering followed people were thumping ricky on the back and yelling speech speech hes made it thought perdita dully the final rung how was chessie taking the news but looking across the room she went cold chessies chair was empty back in eldercombe daisy unable to sleep stayed up all night putting the finishing touches on a painting of mrs hughies burmese cats before watching the second half of the match live at five oclock in the morning venturer must be delirious it was truly gripping television and daisy was thrilled perdita played so brilliantly and didnt seem unduly fazed about red she also experienced passionate relief when perdita rang to say rupert had at last forgiven her and admitted paternity and how lovely hed been but all this bounty made daisy even more bitterly ashamed that she should feel so suicidal at a british victory throughout the match her eyes had constantly been drawn to ricky who despite his suntan looked incredibly grim and gaunt she ought to be pleased for him and managed to congratulate perdita very convincingly when she rang up but when perdita said talk to ricky daisy couldnt face it and had hung up and taken the telephone off the hook outside the sun was rising and in the hall mirror she saw wiping away the tears that shed streaked burnt sienna all over her face having let the dogs out she retired to bed pulling the duvet over her head and falling into a miserable halfsleep after lunch she took the dogs out for a walk she noticed next years sticky buds the same marsred as polo boots pushing their way through the ragged orange leaves of the horse chestnuts she passed a burdock bush so mildewed brown and shrivelled among all the ravishing autumnal oranges and golds it left a cluster of burrs on her coat shivering she thought how it symbolized a desperately clinging defeated abandoned woman oh please dont let me get like that she prayed a huge red sun was dropping behind the woods as she crossed rickys watermeadows the dogs were sniffing frantically beside the gate and there was a strong smell of fox it must have just killed a baby rabbit soft grey fur littered the grass daisy started to cry again back in the house she put the telephone back on the hook immediately the daily star rang hi daisy great about perdita you must be a very proud mum i am great about rupert accepting paternity its lovely but i dont want to talk about it i wont have any mouth left if i keep shooting it off slamming down the receiver daisy took it off the hook again she tried and failed to paint and then at eight oclock took a large vodka and tonic into the sitting room to watch a recording of the match it was the real thing this time all six chukkas and luke winning the mvp award his freckles were exactly like the puppies thought daisy hed be lovely to paint and then she saw chessie hurtling into rickys arms and feeling as though someone had dropped a tombstone on her from a great height turned off the television all hope gone shed never never known misery like it outside the wind was rising so she shut the windows in the kitchen the puppies were chewing up a dark red book called the nude in painting on the table was a thankyou letter violet had started to the mother of her boyfriend i had a really good time read daisy its lovely to get away from rutshire mums so depressed at the moment and i hoped i was putting on a brave face thought daisy wondering if red indians put on brave faces when they got up in the morning she started to cry again the only answer was to get drunk sobbing unceasingly she finished the vodka bottle and then passed out she woke to find herself on the drawingroom sofa with the dogs crammed into two armchairs gazing at her reproachfully outside the niagara falls seemed to have been diverted under the house whimpering she opened the curtains and shrieked as a laser beam of light pierced her eyes there had obviously been a terrific storm in the night you could have gone whitewater rafting on the frogsmore as it hurtled past branches littered the lawn she could see several trees down in rickys woods and the track to eldercombe was full of puddles turned the colour of strong tea by the disturbed earth incapable of anything else daisy carried on crying as the telephone was off the hook a succession of reporters were reduced to rolling up at the house to discuss perditas great triumph unable to face them daisy took refuge in the potting shed here she discovered the nude shed done of drew three years ago and brought it into the kitchen determined to burn it at lunchtime when the whole valley was steaming and a primroseyellow sun had come through the mist like a halo searching for a saint a car drew up outside it was violet delighted perdita had won but more interested in the weekend shed just spent in the lakes with her new boyfriend how dyou tell youre in love mum dyou go weak at the knees when he kisses you i dont know said violet perplexed because im always lying down are you all right mum you look awful i think im getting gastric flu muttered daisy oh poor you go to bed whys the telephone off the hook asked violet putting it back immediately it rang itll be for me violet snatched it up then in disappointment as she handed daisy the receiver its for you where the hell have you been howled ricky oh out and about daisy tried desperately to sound bright its terrific you won you sound as though youre just next door i am next door said ricky brusquely weve got to talk ill be with you in five minutes violet picked up her car keys im just popping down to the village shop for some cigarettes dyou want anything but daisy had bolted upstairs cleaning her teeth until they bled scraping the olivegreen moss off her tongue however many vats of eyedrops she poured into her eyes they still glowed like carbuncles remaining determinedly piggy and swollen sailors could climb the rigging of wrinkles under her eyes and when she tried desperately to rub them away they wouldnt shift frantically she slapped green foundation over her redveined cheeks but she still looked like a ghoul so she rubbed it off which made her cheeks glow brighter than ever suddenly she remembered the mess in the kitchen and clutching her pounding skull stumbled downstairs and started throwing things into the washingup machine the puppies were now calmly eviscerating a cushion scattering feathers all over the hall oh oh oh wailed daisy it was all hopeless slumping down at the kitchen table she started to cry again ethel shambled over and put a muddy speckled paw on her knee jumping up little chef tried to lick away her tears but they flowed even faster then through the shaggy curtain of clematis and honeysuckle she saw rickys car draw up and despite everything felt her stomach disappear as she watched him get out he looked shadowed under the eyes and terribly grim next minute she winced as little chef dug his claws into her jeaned thighs and shot off through the door screaming with joy to welcome him oh please pleaded daisy clutching her head as ethel let out her great bassbaritone bark and the puppies took up a yapping chorus ricky looked even grimmer as he came through the door with little chef wriggling ecstatically under one arm then he caught sight of daisy and stopped short jesus whats up with you hangover muttered daisy i feel dreadful shouldnt drink so much serves you right ive been under a lot of strain dyou want a cup of coffee no i want you to come outside taking her hand ricky dragged her protesting out on to the lawn where everything dripped and sparkled in the sunlight i know the gardens a mess groaned daisy as the twofoot grass drenched her jeans lend me a combine harvester and ill make you enough hay to see even wayne through the winter i promise ill tidy up everything including myself i know its awkward with chessie coming back but we wont get in your way then seeing the unrelentingly bleak expression on his face just let us stay till christmas no i wwwant you out of here tttonight daisys lip started to tremble but youre supposed to give us a months notice ive changed the lease ricky removed a burr from her hair with a desperately shaking hand theres a new clause which says you cant stay here any longer if your landlord falls in love with you but daisy wasnt listening weve got nowhere to go roughly ricky turned her round to face the sun examining her deathly pallor the hectically reddened cheeks the swollen eyes spilling over with tears im totally repulsive she sobbed but when she tried to jerk her head away his hands closed on either side of her face like a clamp look at me with infinite reluctance daisy raised her eyes even jet lag couldnt ruin his bone structure or the length of his dark eyelashes its not fair you should be so beautiful she mumbled helplessly and weve got nowhere to go what about rrrrobinsgrove stammered ricky you can bring perdita and violet and eddie and ethel and the puppies even that incccontinent cat if you like i love you he said desperately will you marry me me marry you mumbled daisy incredulously his face was suddenly so unbelievably softened that she had to drop her eyes hastily fearing some cosmic practical joke oh please ricky spoke to the top of her head i couldnt understand why i was so badtempered in america i couldnt sleep i mean even less than usual then i realized i was missing you hopelessly all the time i had to fight the tttemptation to ring you and beg you to come over he smiled slightly i searched everywhere for daisies but the lawns are so perfect over there they dont have any the rosiness of her cheeks spread to the whole of daisys face but she simply couldnt get any words out to save her trouble ricky bent his head and kissed her first very shyly and tentatively then when she responded with alacrity very hard indeed by the end of which daisys knees had literally given way for the first time in her life and as she couldnt speak or stand up they collapsed on to the old garden bench she still hadnt got round to painting but what about chessie she mumbled finally buggered off with red what when the night of the westchester she vanished in the middle of dinner i went back to the house wed rented i couldnt face any more celebrating didnt feel there was anything to celebrate half an hour later rupert rolled up with a letter to me that red had had delivered to the restaurant he said he was desperately sorry but hed been hopelessly in love with chessie ever since shed become his stepmother but had been fighting it because he hadnt wanted to screw up his father it all falls into place why he was so irredeemably bloody to her always why he was so frantic to beat us he was far more terrified shed come back to me than bart was then she hurled herself on me after the match and it finished him off completely so he finally thought sod bart declared himself and they ran off goodness said daisy in awe just like that well not entirely ricky shrugged theyve obviously been sidling round each other for ages perdita admitted she caught them in bed after the polo ball oh the poor little duck said daisy appalled why didnt she tell anyone she promised red she wouldnt is she absolutely devastated no at least not about him daisy darling can we talk about us poor you said daisy in horror you must have been ecstatic giddy with relief id psyched myself out for so long obsessed with proving we could win the westchester obsessed with getting chessie back because i felt so guilty about will i knew she was miserable with bart and id driven her into his arms in the first place suddenly i was free i felt a great burden falling off my back like one of victors ponies at the end of a chukka daisy giggled i got the first plane back ricky went on getting more and more panicky because i couldnt get you on the telephone did you know theres been a hurricane londons out of action the stock exchange has stopped trading fifteen million trees have been blown down thats nothing to losing you said daisy simply when i saw chessie leaping on you and looking so beautiful i was so unhappy i just got drunk i was worried youd see that admitted ricky and i was worried drew was in rutshire festering because we hadnt asked him to play drew stammered daisy going even pinker drew said ricky acidly and told her about finding the puppies eating drews shoe the day before he left jesus i was jealous oh how awful im so sorry ill forgive you if you never never sleep with him again ricky cut short her frantic apologies with another kiss then he drew her head against his chest stroking her hair its strange he said slowly i feel so safe when youre in my arms but all i want to do is to make you feel safe youve always reminded me of a stray bitch chucked out for getting in pup who although she looked after all her puppies in the wild really well needed a loving master and a home oh i did sighed daisy its also a dreadful confession said ricky but its the first time in my life ive loved something more than polo my nerve failed me at the beginning of that third match i didnt want to win because subconsciously i didnt want chessie back snuggling her face happily into his chest daisy suddenly saw pink spots before her eyes could it be her hangover then she blinked again and putting her hand up realized they were real pink silk spots on a blue background youve left off your black tie she said in amazement ricky glanced down for a second he too had difficulty speaking i dont have to wear it any more the mournings over wonderingly daisy put her hand up and touched the scar on his face for a second he flinched then his hand closed over hers darling darling daisy are you quite sure you dont mind being a double parent again suddenly he looked so vulnerable that daisy put her arms round his neck and kissed him they were so engrossed they didnt hear the dogs barking or pause for breath until violet appeared in the doorway hi mum im back christ bugger off ordered ricky were busy okeydoke said violet but two minutes later she put her head round the door with a faint smirk sorry to interrupt you two love birds but its drew on the telephone for you mum rickys eyes narrowed it is bloody not he howled loping back into the house temporarily blinded after the sunlight he snatched the receiver from violet drew you can fuck off and if you ever come within a million miles of daisy ill smash your head in and break your bloody jaw pity angel didnt do it properly the first time and he crashed the receiver back on the hook violet whistled wowee macho man dont you get lippy with me miss snapped ricky im going to be your new stepfather for a second they glared at each other then violet giggled i had guessed look im really really pleased mum adores you so much shes been madly in love with you for yonks ricky blushed and was about to return to daisy in the garden when he knocked over the nude of drew which had been leaning inward against the kitchen table my god he exploded i quite agree said violet that is definitely one for the log basket a very subdued perdita returned from palm springs she was delighted despite daisys apprehension that her mother and ricky were getting married but their almost incandescent happiness only emphasized her utter desolation the telephone rang constantly with patrons suddenly finding a hole in next years team for a fivegoal player but she accepted nothing she just thought about luke and cursed herself for not having had the courage to tell him how much she loved him but surely if hed felt anything he would have come forward perhaps he did love that cool stylish lawyer with the warm eyes daisy was spending most of her time up at robinsgrove which gave perdita the chance endlessly to watch videos of the westchester and marvel at lukes unselfishness and his sheer bloodyminded tenacity ricky and daisy had wanted a quiet wedding at rutminster register office but as usual the carnival took over and every polo player in the land except drew whod been banned by ricky seemed to have rolled up with polo sticks to form a guard of honour outside eldercombe church daisy wore a dark green velvet suit with a pillbox hat which kept sliding off her newly washed piledup hair she looked so radiant no one noticed the ladder in her tights nor the inch of red silk petticoat hanging beneath her hem nor the mud on her heels from taking the puppies out in the garden before she left rupert who on the chairman of revlons advice had gone liquid before the stock exchange crash which occurred a few days after the final of the westchester insisted on throwing a party for them afterwards eddie euphoric to be out of school and at the prospect of endless fishing and shooting ahead confided to perdita in a lull in the service that taggie and rupert were planning a surprise party for her twentyfirst birthday next week and he hoped to wrangle another day off school but this did little to raise perditas spirits then to crown it they sang dear lord and father of mankind during the signing of the register when they came to the bit about the still small voice of calm speaking through the earthquake wind and fire perdita was so sharply reminded of luke that she fled out of a side door rupert found her oblivious of the icy wind and a lurking circle of press sobbing pitifully against a yew tree and hustled her into his car i didnt mean to screw up mums wedding she choked but i cant bear it rupert got a hip flask out of the dashboard i brought this to steady rickys nerves forgot he didnt drink have a great slug warm you up look i know how ghastly these things are he put a hand on her heaving shoulders appalled by the jagged edges of collarbone and shoulderblade i never really understood unhappiness until i thought i wouldnt end up with tag lukes like taggie sobbed perdita theyre both seriously good people and prodigals like you and me are far too insecure to find happiness with any other kind of person you turned luke down once told him never to come near you again youll have to make the first move putting a hand in his inside pocket he drew out a coutts cheque book and a fountain pen its your birthday next week were both scorpios i know eddie said you might be giving me a party its really kind but i couldnt sure said rupert but you cant stop being twentyone ive been meaning to settle some money on you rickys always said the thing that you craved most was financial security this should be a start in his big blue scrawl he wrote her a cheque for over in florida luke was slowly going out of his mind with misery seeing perdita at palm springs had made everything a million times worse he had finally levelled with margie telling her it could never work out now he wanted to slink into his lair and die but with red disappearing with chessie and angel shoved off with bibi to play in the argentine open there was noone to cope with the herculean task of comforting a maddened desperately humiliated bart for not only had bart lost his wife but his fortune as well in his obsession with polo he had neglected his business and totally failed to anticipate the stock market collapse black monday had cost him over a billion and chopped the value of alderton airlines by ninetyfive per cent bart had also borrowed heavily to take over oil and property companies gold mines theatres and big department stores now these had to be sold off for virtually nothing most of them to a gloating victor when the wall street merchant banker withdrew a loan which bart desperately needed to help lower his enormous interest charges at other banks he had also had to sell his five houses and put el paradiso on the market bart was very unpopular so no friends came forward to bail him out particularly in the polo world ponies he had spent on were now being sold off for a fifth of the price he had enough to live on and would no doubt claw his way back one day but he couldnt support a polo team the only good thing that had come out of the whole sorry business reflected luke was that his father and he had at last become friends one friday afternoon at the end of november luke was down at el paradiso trying to forget perdita for one second by concentrating on breaking one of barts young thoroughbreds which theyd managed to salvage from the wreckage a slender dark brown filly with one white sock and a white star who turned both ways automatically she was such a natural she reminded luke of fantasma when hed ridden her back from the river after her first maddened buckingandbolting spree in argentina he wondered as he wondered every day how she was and prayed alejandros grooms hadnt broken her glorious cantankerous tempestuous spirit a warm breeze shook the for sale sign hanging forlornly outside the barn and sent a waft of orange blossom towards him oh perdita he thought hopelessly to him she truly was the lost one now he was roused from his black musings by a groom telling him that angel was ringing from buenos aires in a complete panic alejandro the captain of the mendozas team for which angel was playing in the argentine open had broken his leg in the semifinal its the final on sunday begged angel alejandro say you only back in zee world who can stand in for heem i have no horses said luke in despair alejandros got my best one eef you come and play the open alejandro say you can buy back fantasma he say she never go as well for him but the blissful prospect of getting fantasma back apart the moment luke agreed to play he regretted it he knew it was every polo players dream to play in the open and no american had ever reached the final but he didnt feel up to it there was no way the mendozas team which consisted of angel and alejandros two sons patricio and lorenzo could win without alejandro particularly when they were pitted against the might of juan and miguel obrien and their cousins kevin and seamus all tengoal players whod beaten them five years running the two teams detested each other and there had been endless squabbles over officials and umpires being bribed and both teams threatening to pull out fans would turn up on sunday to see them tear each other apart noone ever shook hands at the end of the game besides luke didnt want to go to argentina it reminded him far too poignantly of perdita making matters worse bart insisted on coming too to lend support which was the last thing luke needed as bart unused to being poor would make a fuss about travelling economy and not staying in fivestar hotels they had great difficulty landing at buenos aires because there had been a coup and the airport was on strike although the whole town was skyblue with jacaranda blossom soldiers with cigarettes hanging out of their handsome mouths were everywhere armoured cars patrolled the streets barts wallet was promptly nicked and when he stormed into the police station an officer with his boots up on the desk told him there was a coup on and noone had time to bother about stolen goods the taxis were also on strike and noone was there to meet them luke was wearily hiring a car to drive out to alejandros estancia when angel rolled up black under the eyes already in a frightful stew about sunday and not at all pleased to see his bossy fatherinlaw whom he disliked intensely as angel negotiated the lunatic traffic out of buenos aires using his horn at red lights rather than his brakes he deliberately excluded bart by gabbling incessantly in spanish to luke who felt burdened by added responsibility as he realized how crucial sundays match was for angel having deeply offended his family his fellow players and his country by taking american citizenship angel felt he would only be taken back into the fold again if he played well in the open at general piran all was pain every eucalyptus leaf every speck of brown dust the pampas stretching like his love to infinity reminded luke of perdita claudia and all the children hugged him the grooms gauchos and their wives rushed forward to pump his hand even raimundo whom hed hit across the café after hed tried to back tero by tying her to angels car seemed delighted to see him why had señor gracias stayed away so long they demanded and where was perdida the little lost one but luke was only interested in seeing fantasma rounding the orange grove he saw her before she saw him flattening her ears pawing at the floor she was furiously trying to gnaw wood off her halfdoor through her muzzle at least they hadnt broken her spirit at the sound of his voice fantasma looked up incredulously stared for a second whickered like an earthquake then once again soared over her halfdoor like a lark in flight charging up to luke she began rubbing her head against his chest nuzzling his pockets as though hed never been away ripping off her muzzle stroking and hugging her luke ran his hands down her legs still as familiar to him as the pattern on his own bedroom curtains thank christ she was ok his hands trembled so much he could hardly undo the packet of polos hed bought her at the airport and in the middle he had to get out a handkerchief to blow his nose and wipe his eyes having crunched up every polo fantasma wouldnt let him out of her sight jumping fences and grazing close by when he lunched under the trees with the family then insanely shrilly jealous when he tried out other ponies for the match the next day alejandro who was in a lot of pain was very badtempered and yelling instructions from his wheelchair only succeeded in unnerving the rest of the team for too many years he had manipulated patricio and lorenzo like puppets how would they take orders from luke luke and bart stayed the night with bibi and angel who were restoring a romantic ruin near by with a beautiful deserted garden but as the match approached angel got more and more nervous and ratty ending up in having such a row with bibi that she flatly refused to come and watch him match day dawned true to form fantasma started lashing out with both back legs the moment she saw the polo basket containing all the tack going into the lorry on the day of last years final the grooms of the wily obriens had reached the palermo ground three hours early to bag the better stalls on the shadier side of the pitch this year they were outfoxed by raimundo and the mendoza grooms who arrived four hours early to annex the cooler stalls this so incensed the obriens that they started sneering that the mendozas must be very pushed to include two damned americanos in their team soon both sides were hissing like montagues and capulets and only luke shoving his large shoulders between rival grooms stopped a fight breaking out oblivious of all this angel sat on an upturned bucket with his head in his hands not bothering to check his horses or even warm up shell show up said luke resisting the temptation to shake angel dont be so goddam histrionic ten minutes before the parade both captains were giving last minute peptalks the mendozas had speed and the courage of lions but the obriens were technically superior and hit the ball harder and more accurately the only way to beat them urged luke as he pulled on his lucky gloves which were mostly hole now is to stop them opening up and press them all over the field which means sticking like leeches the obriens who like perdita had been watching videos of the westchester realized they must obstruct luke as much as possible and divert his fusillade of deadly passes away from his young team dont hang on to the ball ordered miguel swinging his mallet round and round to loosen up his massive shoulders and dont let the mendozas see what youre doing despite being surrounded by the skyscrapers of buenos aires few grounds are more beautiful or dramatic than the number one field at palermo with its forest of white flagpoles lush tropical trees green hedges lined with pink roses and huge stands rising like cliff faces to a whitehot sky on either side of a sagegreen ground two minutes before the parade bibi crept into her seat beside bart she was almost deafened by the obrien supporters with their emeraldgreen parasols and the mendoza fans with their primroseyellow flags and banners encouraging their teams on with a cacophony of trumpet and drum bart whod bought a new panama for the occasion was outraged because he was too far from luke to bombard him with lastminute instructions all around him were beautiful laughing girls unfazed by the heatwave their shining hair cascading on to slim walnutbrown shoulders perhaps there was life after chessie after all bibi was more aware to the right of a rampart of angels relations who clearly recognized but studiously ignored her only marginally more hostile was mrs juan sitting bully in person whose huge bulk occupied three chairs instead of one here they come said bibi in a choked voice oh come on angel come on luke come on the mendozas the heat which had been stifling as the vast crowd began to file through the turnstiles was now like a cauldron of boiling oil with people all fanning themselves with programmes the two stands were like vast swarms of white butterflies despite his air of smiling imperturbability lukes primrose shirt was drenched with sweat and his hands were propped on his saddle to conceal their trembling as he rode quietly out on alejandros most beautiful liverchestnut mare beside him rode lorenzo patricio and angel curls flowing out underneath their helmets long limbs supple as liquorice sticks faces white as flagposts at midfield waited the obriens four immensely strong proud men in the prime of life hell bent on a sixth victory who would take no prisoners everyone had been looking forward to the band who had guarded the president for nearly years but they had been banned from the ground because of the coup so a lone trumpeter played the argentine national anthem instead the tantivy of horn and trumpet and the tumbrilbeat of drums intensified we are going to be keeled said angel through clattering teeth and bibi avent even come and say goodbye to me oh god of battles steel my soldiers hearts possess them not with fear muttered luke to himself but out loud with a confidence he didnt feel he said bullshit well bury them now he play bettair said patricio nudging lorenzo and looking upwards following his gaze angel was stunned to see a little plane chugging across the sky trailing a message good luck angel i love you bibi the crowd burst into a collective roar of laughter angel went crimson but he was grinning like a pools winner now he would play like a king he could hardly wait for the longthighed umpire in his brightblue shirt to chuck the ball in luke found the palermo open quite different to any other tournament not only because eight chukkas were played instead of the usual six but also because the pace was twice as fast the bumps three times as violent and the ponies four times as superior there was no razzmatazz no cheer leaders no balloons no commentary because everyone in the madly excited crowd knew what was going on and made whistling sounds every time a foul occurred often anticipating the umpire all you could hear between the great roars of encouragement and the din of trumpet and drum was the clatter of incessantly galloping hooves the snorting of the ponies the desperate shouts of the players and the blindmans tap tap tap of their sticks by any standard the first chukka was played on fast forward to boost morale and rattle the obriens alejandro had mounted his sons and angel on his best ponies exploding on to the field shiny as conkers shot from their husks they outraced the obrien ponies with ease by the bell the mendozas were ahead by a staggering three of the goals scored by angel the obriens gameplan emerged as they settled down in the second chukka seamus obrien spent his time either sneakily inserting himself between luke and the mendozas posts or luring luke away from the goalmouth so that miguel and juan could unleash their thunderbolts from the midfield which would find the flags immediately or be tipped through by a returning seamus playing with pulverizing attack changing direction all the time by the end of the third chukka the obriens were leading and had plunged the volatile mendozas into despair keep your shirts on guys youre doing great luke reassured them as he mounted fantasma the only grey in the match for the fourth chukka as usual her beauty brought gasps of delight from the crowd and once again luke felt humbled by the combination of courage competitiveness steel intelligence and boundless energy she always inspired him somehow he must try and settle his own side but almost certainly it was going to be as juan hurtled towards goal on his fastest mare the legendary gatto and like a matador revelled in plunging another pic into the desperately injured mendoza bull well show them muttered luke and next moment fantasma had streaked like a shooting star after juan coming in from the right luke waited until her grey shoulder was level with gattos gleaming dark brown quarters he could also feel miguel behind him breathing down his neck like a hairdryer on high coolly he leant forward hooked juans stick out of the way and then with a lightning flick backed the ball instantly fantasma swivelled round so bypassing an astounded miguel luke was able to hit the forehand straight to angel who was waiting on the boards gathering up the ball like a lost lover angel dribbled it round tossed and hit it in the air twice in a contemptuous piece of clowning then took it upfield passing to lorenzo who galloped off and scored the crowd erupted in delight at such dazzling play overjoyed bibi hugged bart even angels rampart of relations were looking less supercilious a lone trumpeter up in the gods struck up the stars and stripes luke grinned and waved his stick two beautiful argentine girls behind bibi consulted their programmes and agreed the blond americano was muy atractivo my brother bibi told them proudly in the fifth chukka the mendozas rode their fast ponies again and closed the score to but not for nothing did the blood of irish kings run through the veins of the obriens refusing to be rattled they fought back furiously stampeding the score to having played their trump card to so little effect the mendozas started to panic even worse a second later miguel pulled up dead on the line bringing down luke on the beautiful liverchestnut just behind him luke winded staggered to his feet the chestnut stayed put and had to be shot channelling his fury into a superhuman effort against the opposition luke hit the ensuing penalty through the posts and into the road and a lorry full of soldiers who thinking it was part of the coup reached for their guns in the sixth chukka the obriens were awarded a penalty four which luke knocked out of the air to angel who again took it upfield with three almost languorously contemptuous offside forehands and then scored with an exquisite nearside cut shot the crowd boiled over and angels relations were all shaking bart and bibi by the hand angels bay mare had a lot to do with that goal thought luke darkly but noone told her so in fact none of those gallant ponies had been patted once in the whole match except by him the heat was awful and even the umpires ponies were white with sweat he must concentrate he was exhausted after a long flight unused to playing eight chukkas unacclimatized to such punishing heat and the hand smashed earlier in the year was giving him hell suddenly the cliffs of yelling faces on either side seemed to be closing in on him and for a terrifying moment he thought he was going to black out respite came horribly one of miguels ponies racing angels to the boards tripped and overturning broke her back with a delay of ten minutes before her body was taken away luke managed to recover in the shade then in the next chukka one of alejandros most gallant mares broke a leg doing a lightning turn and also had to be shot patricio who had made the mare himself was in floods of tears the crowd moaned in sympathy again rage at such senseless waste fuelled lukes blastfurnace as miguel hurtled towards him blotting out the sun bringing the ball down for a certain goal luke coolly charged him buffalo for buffalo and passing him legitimately on the offside whisked the ball to angel who passed just in time to patricio who scored twelve all proclaimed the seagreen scoreboard in vast white letters the crowd had nearly yelled themselves hoarse and resorted more and more to their instruments two rival supporters overcome by emotion started a punchup primroseyellow flags and banners emeraldgreen parasols swooned in the heat it was the last chukka the obriens legendary temper was roused it was time for goliath to despatch david but by sheer persistence the mendozas each clamped on his opposing player like jack russells managed to keep the score level until in the last ten seconds seamus crossed luke up went the mendozas sticks twirling in triumph and there was a sharp exchange between the obriens and one of the longthighed umpires whod been looking at his watch at the time until the third man came out of the bar and confirmed it was a foul grimly the obriens lined up behind their goal the mendoza supporters now most of the crowd bellowed without ceasing and in the bars below the great stadium started opening bottles of champagne lorenzo patricio and angel exchanged surreptitious but delighted grins the grooms of the mendozas rubbed their calloused hands in glee señor gracias never missed a penalty the open was going to change hands at last the stadium went quiet as slowly luke circled a lone figure on an incandescently white horse under the burning sun turning fantasma towards goal he suddenly panicked his hand might not hold up and he should have given the penalty to angel for a second his concentration flickered to a man the mendoza supporters groaned as luke mishit and the ball went wide as the last bell went overwhelmed by shame luke slumped in the saddle resting his tired head on fantasmas bristling grey neck he ought to fall on his polo mallet then realizing the match wasnt over with titanic effort he pulled himself together and cantered back to the pony lines sorry you guys he called to the rest of the team who were on the verge of tears sorry he shouted to the deadpan masks of the grooms i thought you never miss a penalty snarled a furious alejandro why are you bloody well smiling to stop myself crying said luke only fantasma seemed to be on his side now flattening her ears and striking out at alejandro she nudged luke sympathetically in the ribs as he dismounted then tried to make him laugh by knocking his hat off waiting to go into a ninth chukka luke took a swig of sevenup and soaked an entire towel wiping off the sweat alejandro wanted him to ride another flashy beautiful chestnut called zou zou whod been rested for three chukkas but knowing fantasma best luke opted to ride her a third time which is allowed in argentina briefly he put his arms round her neck echoing sir jacob astleys prayer at the battle of edgehill oh fantasma thou knowest how busy i must be this day if i forget thee do not thou forget me fantasma who was dying to get back into the action nipped lukes polo shirt in acquiescence three hundred chukkas with him were better than one with alejandro come on you guys shouted luke as they rode back on to the field i know i goofed but weve got to hold on we can do it the young mendozas and angel whod all played their hearts out were now running on pure adrenalin the shadows were lengthening a slight breeze swirled pale blue jacaranda petals across the pitch but the sun seemed even hotter it was sudden death now all that mattered was somehow to get the ball between the obriens posts the mendozas had youth on their side and with kamikaze courage the three young boys tried to score again and again until kevin obrien at back got fed up and cleared from his own goal it was a monumental hit the ball making a huge arc through the air hurtling towards luke who was waiting just beyond the halfway line luke had left his back door open and he knew that fantasma despite her gallant gutsy heart had completely run out of steam there was no way she could turn gallop and keep up with miguel and juan nor shake the pair of them off and take the ball back down to the obriens goal the ball was still hurtling towards him he was dimly aware of the screaming excited blur of the crowd of the leaping mallets of juan and miguel trying to halt the ball as it flew over their heads now bearing down on him bringing death in the afternoon to the mendozas hopes pounded juan and miguel ready to whip the ball away from him and together take it down the field and blast it into goal despite her utter exhaustion fantasma never took her eyes off the ball trembling with anticipation shifting from foot to foot she was determined to position luke perfectly for the shot dropping his reins on her sodden steelgrey neck grasping his mallet in two huge hands luke took a mighty swipe as the ball passed him at eyelevel it was a complete cowboy shot but perfectly met there was a tremendous crack like an elephants tusk breaking as he connected the crowd gave a great shout of amazement as the ball took off back again as though carried by the slight breeze and the indrawn breath of everyone in the ground it flew like a white gull towards the posts the great shout of amazement had become a greater one of ecstasy and encouragement had it gone far enough kevin obrien bucketed back but he was so busy looking up in the air and whipping his pony that he didnt give himself enough time to get in position swiping at the ball as it thudded to the pavementhard ground he missed and the next second it had somehow bounced to the right and sidled in through the posts with agonizing slowness as though the goaljudge couldnt believe his eyes the red flag suddenly went into a frantic jive of joy for a few seconds there was utter silence as it dawned on the vast crowd that the titans had at long last been toppled the sixyear wait was over then followed a mighty explosion of cheering that must have been heard by the foals at general piran and just as if the huge stands had leant forward to see better the fans fell as though toppled on to the field fantasmas breath was coming in sobbing gasps her nostrils flared red as trafficlights her pale coat was black with sweat like cobras her veins writhed with her heaving body gracias gracias croaked luke collapsing on her neck again next moment juan and miguel were pumping him by the hand and he had been pulled off fantasma and was being carried shoulderhigh round the stadium americano americano shrieked the crowd in ecstasy over and over again they knew luke had stepped into the boots of the mighty alejandro at the last moment and they wanted to salute his courage because he had turned the game around and never stopped fighting americano americano roared the crowd as with his widest grin luke went up to collect the great gold cup with the soaring eagle on its lid and they roared on and on refusing to let him go glancing up at the stands luke saw that bart was yelling his head off tears of joy coursing down his cheeks another great cheer went up for angel olive skin tinged with colour peacockblue eyes bloodshot bronze curls clinging damply to his forehead all his cousins were shouting crying and congratulating each other he knew now that hed been taken back into the fold as angel brandished his own gold trophy he smiled across at bibi who was crying as much as bart and he thought how lovely she looked with her mascara running and her long nose red luke ruffled his hair i guess god looked after his angel today luke won the best player award fantasma won the two best playing pony prizes and was only just restrained from kicking the president of the argentine polo association when he put the white blanket of honour on her even whiter back she had never looked more beautiful thought luke shimmying round in her new white rug ears pricked to hear the cheers dark eyes searching restlessly for luke terrified to let him out of her sight for a second soon she would be his again determined to clinch the deal at once leaving the others swigging champagne and signing autographs luke set off to find alejandro postmortems were already going on in the bars in every language under the sun the buenos aires herald stopped luke for his views on the match we should remember the horses he said suddenly sombre they played their hearts out in this heat and three of them died it was the worst ive ever known he found alejandro ecstatic tearful and already drunk well done amigo i taught you well and now you can sell me my horse back suddenly alejandro looked shifty she play well i decide i cannot part with er friendsheep ees friendsheep but business ees business ill give you one hundred and fifty thousand bucks said luke in desperation its all i can raise but alejandro refused to budge he had put nothing in writing if you hadnt broken your leg id beat you to a pulp you greasy doublecrossing son of a bitch shouted luke storming off luke was so distraught that he nearly boycotted the massive celebrations afterwards but he felt it was unfair to his own team who had played so well and to the obriens who had defended so gallantly everyone wanted to discuss his last goal which seemed to grow in length and splendour by the glass he was almost more bruised by people clapping him on the back than by the game he tried to get plastered but it didnt work and after a few hours he drove back to angels and bibis house arriving at dawn he found a primroseyellow banner across the drive to welcome him and bitterly remembered how he had covered up perdita with a shawl the same colour when shed ridden naked into the casino he longed to drive over to alejandros to tell fantasma in private how brilliantly and bravely she had played but having raised her hopes once he couldnt bear to raise them again not if he was no longer going to be able to take her back to palm beach all the next day it poured with rain and angels cousins still tight from the night before swarmed through the house and the telephone rang with congratulations and offers for luke and angel to play next season anywhere in the world by six oclock the rain had cleared and luke desperate to be on his own went out for a ride with leroy who had had a boring day confined to barracks it was a beautiful evening with the turquoise sky reflected in the huge puddles and the acidyellow and green sweep of the pampas only interrupted by the occasional windmill or grey fringe of gum trees stretching to infinity luke wished he could ride off the edge of the world every bone in his body ached but not nearly so much as his heart tonight the cousins were giving a celebration for him and angel but what was the point without perdita even the loss of fantasma was nothing by comparison he wondered if there had been a moment in the last three years when he hadnt longed for her or if there would ever be in his life again even yesterdays success had already turned to ashes in his mouth he had so wanted to go to her after she broke up with red and again on the night of the westchester when red had bolted with chessie shed looked so desolate that evening in her black dress hed longed to help her pick up the pieces but he knew it would be wrong his love was so strong hed never be able to control it and shed feel claustrophobic she could never marry anyone she didnt love or survive in captivity like chessie had for so long down by the river into which fantasma had once galloped he dismounted and sat on the bank letting his horse graze and leroy charge off after hares he watched a flock of white birds winging slowly homewards turning pink in the setting sun in three weeks it would be christmas and suddenly the pain became unbearable as he remembered that first christmas in palm beach with perdita when he still had hope luke had always had brilliant eyesight but his eyes were so misted over that at first he couldnt identify the cloud of brown dust on the horizon then as he got to his feet he heard hoof beats and realized it was a pony and rider going ludicrously fast he couldnt identify the colour of the horse because they were against the sun now they were flashing through a blue puddle now disappearing behind a field of alfalfa faster and faster as they curved round towards him down the rough track he realized the rider was bareback and guiding the pony in just a headcollar luke recognized the pony first rosepink in the sunset as she had been in that sunrise after he had saved her life she was covering the ground at breakneck speed with that beautiful low inimitably smooth action he had a moment of outrage that anyone should ride her so dangerously fast after such a gruelling match yesterday a split second later he recognized the rider no he was hallucinating noone rode so aggressively so gracefully or in such a hurry to get to goal it must be a mirage perdita was only wearing a khaki shirt and shorts her face was caked with dust her features set her whole body trembling as she tugged fantasma to a halt in front of him luke who had a lump as big as a polo ball in his throat couldnt speak neither could she they just gazed and gazed at each other fantasma however had no such reserve whickering with delight she shot forward nudging and licking and nuzzling her old master all over searching his pockets for polos still unable to get a word out luke put his arms round her lovely head breathing in the smell of her sweat fighting back the tears you didnt ride all the way he mumbled stupidly only from the airfield you didnt steal her no i bought her but alejandro said she wasnt for sale every argie has his price rupert gave me some money she added by way of explanation it seemed the only way of spending it but that was your security said luke appalled perdita shook her head violently its for us youre my security youre the only person ive ever felt secure with in my life tears were pouring down her face now streaking the brown dust frantically she wiped her eyes and nose with both hands like a child streaking the dust sideways as well i love you she sobbed if you love that revoltingly beautiful lawyer and dont love me any more i shall quite understand but once you said you did and i hoped you still might ricky thought that perhaps and rupert too we might try again oh christ she gave a wail and put her hands over her face im such a cow next moment luke had pulled her off fantasma and into his arms and was kissing her harder than hed ever hit a sixtyyard penalty i dont believe it he groaned i simply dont believe it i was sure it was still red i havent loved him for ages not ever really i always felt as though i was wearing boots on the wrong feet i loved all the money and the trappings then i realized they didnt mean anything with you its truly bread and onions i guess it is said luke ruefully i havent got a cent bullshit said perdita now youve won the open everyone wants you including me i only came back because youve become such a star luke grinned double bullshit you bought fantasma before the match thats why alejandro wasnt looking nearly as guilty as he should have done yesterday youre right gasped perdita when at long last he stopped kissing her i wanted something to cheer you up in case you lost luke took both her hands in his and kissed them gracias he said shakily the only thing better in the world you could have given me is yourself exactly on cue leroy bounced up with a mudcaked nose and threw himself on perdita for an outraged second fantasma flattened her ears and stamped her foot then recognizing her old friend she once more whickered in delight as leroy barked ecstatically and licked her pink nose luke turned back to perdita i love you more than anything else in the world more than leroy and fantasma dont push your luck dont push my luke said perdita reaching up to kiss him again ill have to change my name she gave a sigh of happiness im not the lost one any more youll have to change your name anyway said luke slowly with a trembling hand he tugged out the bit of fantasmas mane that was left long on the whithers to stop the saddle rubbing and wound it round perditas weddingring finger i cant go down on one knee because of my cartilage for once the deep florida drawl was coming out in a rush but dyou figure you could possibly love me enough to he didnt need to go on with an instinct that knew that neither perdita nor luke would take any notice of her for some time fantasma gently started to eat the grass the end
