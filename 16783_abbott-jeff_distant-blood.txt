jeff abbott distant blood happy families are all alike every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way leo tolstoy anna karenina accidents will occur in the bestregulated families charles dickens david copperfield mortal fear is knowing youve been poisoned i sagged against the fine oak paneling agony vying with numbness for control of my body my heart raced with the knowledge that it was pounding its last rhythm like the beat of a runners shoes against the road as he surges toward the finish line toward blessed rest bile rose in my throat and i swallowed trying to steady my breathing i slid down to the floor dizziness and nausea washing across my body like an obscene tide i tried to cry for help and my throat felt dead raising one leaden arm i managed to focus my vision on the blurred figures in the room and blinking saw murder done before my eyes step back with me two months my name is jordan poteet and im the library director for the small texas town of mirabeau this sometimes quiet hamlet lies on a crook of the colorado river in the rolling countryside between houston and austin mostly the houses are tidy the flower beds edged with a draftsmans precision the street loud with the laughter of playing children but dont be fooled by mirabeaus tranquillity ive been back home for a little over a year and the past months have shocked me to the core of my being ive seen death and suffering and loyalty and love the likes of which id never known but finally my life had mellowed into a fairly easy rideeasy despite dealing with my mothers increasingly severe alzheimers and the unnerving fact that the man i forever thought was my father wasnt and just when i thought id sailed into relative calmness ordering my life into a semblance of normalcy my biological father bob don goertz upset my boat by issuing the invitation from hell my girlfriend candace tully did not react in the way id hoped of course youre going candace said brushing my hair out of my eyes we sat on the backporch swing sipping wine and watching the evening slide into purples and oranges as the sun set brilliantly against the hills the loblolly pines were etched in darkness as light fled below the horizon i am not going to this stupid reunion all those people are bob dons family not mine i gulped at my wine i can be as stubborn as a government mule when i set my mind to it and i could feel my brain encasing in concrete recalcitrance jordan i think you could show bob don some consideration i hate it when candace is entirely reasonable especially when im trying my darnedest to be difficult i know i dont want to hurt his feelings but going to his family reunion id feel like a total freak youre his son jordan hes proud of you he wants you in his life and he wants his family to know you thats not unusual no the unusual part is i didnt know he was my father for the first thirtyodd years of my life i stood and paced out to the yard the house with my family relocated out to the horse farm wed recently acquired had taken on an air of abandonment and desolation the garden usually thick with tomatoes and other vegetables lay barren empty wire circles and wooden stakes stood in forlorn disuse flower beds denuded of blossoms looked fashioned of lunar soil bereft of life i missed the gentle swish of the broom while my mother her mind rotted with alzheimers moved back and forth across the porch caught in an empty repetition that was only broken by taking the broom from her hands i missed my sisters gentle nagging and teasing as she attempted daily to dictate the course of my life i missed my nephew marks energy and sarcasm his reliance on me that i never appreciated until hed moved out of the house my family was only a few miles away but it felt as though theyd voyaged to the other side of the planet theres nothing that we can do to change how you found out about your parentage candace reminded me grinding away in reasonable mode the goertzes are your family as well i have a family thank you kindly i said i feel no burning need for a bunch of new relatives lord knows the ones i have are trouble enough if i want to shimmy up unexplored branches of my family tree ill call a genealogist and ask for the bastard discount rate candace came up behind me and tapped me firmly on the shoulder i turned to face her god she was everything i had ever wanted with her kind smile logical mind thick chestnutcolored hair and intelligent lakeblue eyes she was nearly too petite for a tall fellow like me but strength radiated out of her and id always been drawn to it like metal to magnet she stood on tiptoe put her hands on my shouldersher signal for a kiss i leaned down and pressed my lips to hers when the tender embrace broke she cupped my face in her hands and gently pecked at my closed eyelids her palms felt warm and soft against my face jordan she breathed softly these people are part of you they will want to know about you and you will want to know about them even if you dont believe that right now go meet them otherwise youre always going to wonder if you dont and bob don i know its important to bob don but as much as hes done for me i still find it hard to think of him as my father i mean to say it aloud to see him in my daddys place hes not trying to replace your father candace whispered her breath soft against my chest im sure we made quite a gossipmongering sight for the neighbors locked in this long cuddle not that i cared talking to her holding her this way felt far more intimate than our ardent lovemaking had id been scared of the deepening closeness between us but id resolved not to let fear turn me away from candace he could never replace my dad i answered resting my chin in her softsmelling hair he doesnt want to but he wants to be a father to you hes not trying to be a clone of your daddy that raised you dont you see the difference hon no ive just been fitted for my emotional blinders i leaned back and smiled down into her face im just being stubborn its my specialty yet i still love you she punched me in the shoulder you know bob dons wanted to claim you as his own son for years give him the chance jordy he didnt have a choice in not acknowledging you yes he did i thought bitterly but i kept this most selfish musing to myself candace continued he did everything that he thought was best for you he let you grow up in a healthy loving home he could have made you a pawn used you against your own parents he never would have been hurtful give him this please thinkthink of what you might lose if you dont try hes your biological father he matters the things i let you talk me into she nestled close to me and i felt her face smile against my chest its just cause i love you will you go with me dont leave me alone with the goertzes i dont know how delighted the rest of his family will be with the new bastard son of course so its settled yes i nodded smiling she kissed me again with fervor and ran her fingernail deliciously along the bare skin of my arm then lets go upstairs she took my hand and we retired to my bedroom i lost myself in her in the warm tangle of her arms in the delectable slide of skin against skin the soft wonder of her lips against mine an island your uncle lives on an island i lowered my fork replete with a goodly chunk of my sisters chickenfried steak back to my plate it aint a big one jordan but its all his bob don goertz beamed witii pride uncle mutts done real well for himself he gave me the seed money for my car lots uncle mutt his christian names emmett but when me and my brother and my sister were little we couldnt say emmett we said emmutt it got shortened to mutt do you have an uncle jeff to go along with this uncle mutt bob don guffawed god youre funny son i could recite the magna carta and hed think it was amusing i dont like it a bit when he starts edging the pedestal over for me to climb up on naw no uncle jeff but theyre all just gonna love you jordan i can tell already im sure i was more than willing to let the assembled goertzes devise their own opinions about me i certainly planned on forming my own judgments regarding them and how didexcuse meuncle mutt acquire this island won it in a poker game i managed to keep hold of my fork but barely out of the corner of my eye i saw my big sister arlene hovering pretending to wipe down a table id had a grueling day running the mirabeau public library and id offered to take bob don to lunch of course i picked the sitaspell the downtown cafe coowned by my sister and candace to be seen dining elsewhere in mirabeau would have been to invite retribution the likes of which i cannot imagine of course sister isnt exactly kindminded toward bob don he would forever be the man who nearly ended our parents marriage if i told her i was accompanying bob don to visit his uncle whod won offshore real estate while gambling shed have a conniption fit i hope i wont be expected to play poker wim him i dont believe i could ante up oh uncle mutt doesnt gamble much anymore says hes older and wiser plus its harder for him to hold his cards since his middle fingers got shot off bob don popped a potato pancake into his mouth and chewed with a grin shot off during a poker game i asked faintly oh no that was over a woman a fellow caught uncle mutt in bed with his wife bob don seemed amused at this family trait oh and his exwife i swallowed my fooduntasted the rough edge of the fried meat left a burning trail down my throat i coughed and gulped water uncle mutt was in bed with this mans wife and exwifeat the same time yeah uncle mutts always had what youd call a fair amount of energy i always figured i got my initiative from him i sincerely hope youre referring to selling cars bob don and not bedding women i prefer not to dwell overmuch on the sex life that my mother and bob don shared oh yeah he quickly tucked into his greenbean casserole it was what sister termed the fancy kind made with fried onions and mushroom soup he never wanted to talk about his relationship with my mother either except the neverending litany of how he had loved her i wondered if he still did and as for bob dons wife gretchenwell her husbands emotional investment in my mother couldnt be comforting and just how old is uncle mutt now considering bob don was in his fifties uncle mutt could hardly still be giving new meaning to simultaneous orgasm oh hes around seventy still got a lot of gumption course hes not the oldest member of the family thatd be uncle jake older brother to uncle mutt no hes uncle mutts uncle sort of you see uncle mutts daddy thomas goertzhe was my granddaddy he had two wives the first was named mildred and she was my grandmother uncle jakes her bachelor brother and hes nearly a hundred now anyway jake always lived with papaw tommy and his family mama mildred had two children with papaw tommy then she died in the flu epidemic in papaw tommy remarriedwe called his second wife mama claudiaand she was mother to uncle mutt and aunt lolly aunt lolly i felt the need for a scorecard and resisted the urge to jot notes down on a napkin uncle mutts younger sister her real names louisa but we all call her lolly shes widowed so she takes care of uncle jake he picked at his food suddenly ill at ease aunt lollys sweet but shes gettin nuttier than a pecan tree i dont think shell be able to take care of uncle jake too much longer buti counted on my fingers retracing the convoluted goertz family treejakes not really lollys kin right hes the brother of her fathers first wife right yep but uncle jake was forever part of the family even after his sister died bob don appeared horrified at the suggestion uncle jake be turned out from the hearth simply because his sister had been dead for nearly eighty years and then theres the twins philip and tomexcept they dont look alike aint that a kickerand then your aunt sass and your cousin aubrey i held up my hand please no more ill chart the tree when i meet the clan if the goertz family history was as twisty as it sounded id need the services of a genealogist whose hobby was contortionism i smiled at bob don im sure theyre all fine folks he snorted well i guess i love em but im particularly partial to uncle mutt hes my favorite aside from you i smiled i could see now just how much this reunion meant to bob don he was proud of being my father and wanted to share his happiness with his loved ones i couldnt help but wonderwould i have invited him to a family reunion of my mothers kin i wasnt exactly trumpeting from the rooftops that my surname should be by all rights a little further up the alphabet he took more pride in me than i did in himafter all hed known i belonged to him since the day i was born hed had thirty years to get used to the notion i had barely a year its still not enough time but shame at the thought that i was treating bob don unkindly colored my face as long as uncle mutt doesnt challenge me to cards ill be fine he wont probably of course its a bit hard to foretell exactly what uncle mutts going to do the further misadventures of bob dons kinsman were delayed by the arrival of my sister setting big bowls of banana pudding crowned with vanilla wafers on the table if youve never had this its gods own treat i dont think wed ordered dessert quite yet i smiled sister favored me with a wry scowl on the house she plopped a third bowl down and scooted into the booth next to bob don gretchen says that yall are heading out to afamily reunion soon sister never took the news of my paternity very well i believe shes grateful to bob don for his many kindnesses to us but his new position in my life rankles her you dont like to regard your adored little brother as a constant reminder of your own mamas unfaithfulness id become a symbol of my mothers imperfections well yes arlene i have asked jordan to come with me to my family reunion in july id really like for him to know his goertz relations sister smiled a smile that said he already has a family thank you kindly fortunately bob don lacks a berlitz book for sisters various eyebrow raises and gleaming stares so he plunged on in happy ignorance im just so pleased that hes decided to come cause everyones gonna be thrilled to meet him sister i started but she didnt let me finish i just dont know if julys a good time for jordan to be away from the horse farm she said airily why has mark forgotten how to shovel manure let me be the first to say how minimal my contributions to the horse farm are i modernized the software i did most of the hiring although most of the folks working there stayed on when my nephew inherited the farm from an old family friend i told mark he could not spend any of the large amounts of money bequeathed to him that part i particularly enjoyed mark is fourteen and i love telling him no uncles rights you know i imagine sister that the farm will not slip into a crack in the earth if im gone for a few days sister framed her lips in a familiar combative stance when her eyes widened and i saw candace gesturing to her from the kitchen just a sec she muttered to me and retreated to the roiling steam to consult with her partner that girl is just never going to cotton to me bob don twirled his spoon in the creamy pudding disappointment curdled his normally kind features into a frown sure she will if i can get along with gretchen you can get along with my sister i tapped my finger against the back of his hand i dont touch bob don often and no i dont know why and he brightened with a smile well son im glad to hear you and gretchen are mending fences yes its been much easier since we cleared the minefields away i stuck a spoonful of pudding and cookie into my mouth not really wanting to discuss bob dons wife gretchen id made as much peace as possible with that woman all for bob dons sake he had the easier reconciliation to make after all sister wasnt a crazily mean bitch tidying up my discord with gretchen required the patience of a saint which i fortunately have usually okay occasionally at least during leap years sister returned to the table toying with her blonde ponytail and smiling like the grin had been pasted on with fancy glue she sat down next to bob don and squeezed his arm in affection i tried not to choke on my pudding i think this reunion idea is just wonderful sister purred bob don of course you should get jordan to go far be it from me to suggest otherwise and jordy its just absolutely necessary that you bond with your goertz kinfolk after all theyre your people too are yall nipping cooking sherry back there i craned my neck for a better view into the kitchen candace ducked out of sight presumably to go flour a chicken for frying i suspected my buttd been dusted as well i narrowed my gaze at sister who replied with a cherubic smile the last angel to sport that grin was lucifer immediately before he took the down elevator jordy your hypersuspicious mind is certainly one of your least attractive assets sister sniffed she patted bob dons arm i know that ive not always beenentirely kind to you bob don im sorry im gonna work on that he patted her arm back and gave her his warm smile i appreciate that arlene after all were all family now and its so important for us to keep that truth foremost in our minds sister concurred she sounded like a united nations ambassador working the floor i believe ive had enough sugar for today i said clunking my spoon in my scrapedclean pudding bowl id hoped for a summit between sister and bob don but this smacked of backdoor diplomacy so when do you leave sister asked brightly not soon enough for you apparently i teased would you like to go pack my bags for me one just cant ignore opportunities like this jordy sister said then coughed with a sidelong glance at bob don i meana chance to meet your longlost family or a chance to escape from your currently existing relatives i parried sister has never advocated sudden mood swings i of course relegated her attempt at detente with bob don to consideration of my longwounded feelings more fool i the first letter arrived in early june it lay nestled like a snake in high grass among the inevitable bills a long funny letter from my college roommate now living in nashville and a menshealth magazine brimming with advice i gleefully ignore i thought at first it was just a card of some sort noting only the corpus christi postmark and wondering who the hell did i know down on the coast i sat at the kitchen table still laughing from my friends letter and pulled the card out of the envelope i dropped it immediately when i saw the blood a dried x of crimson gore splattered the front obscuring a cartoon cats knowing leer the envelope fell nervelessly from my hands my stomach churned i gulped a couple of long steadying breaths then retrieved a pair of scissors from the kitchen drawer using them i pried the card openthe paper resisted for a moment because the blood gummed the edges closed redness lined the missive like the dark signature of the devil i saw first the preprinted salutation on the card thinking only of you a scarlet spatter scored the wish on the other side of the card letters cut from a magazine spelled out a cheerless message stay away bastard youre not wanted dont make me prove it i sat for a long while breathing through my mouth reading the hateful words again cursive dainty letters formed the prove and they looked incongruous in the hurtful context bile rose in my throat along with a hard burning anger i balled my hand into a fist stay away bastard the phone rang jarring me out of my reverie i scooped the receiver up with a shaking hand hello my own voice sounded dank and rheumy as if id just surfaced from some deep darkness hey son how you bob dons voice revved along probably fresh from having closed a sweet deal on a fine preowned vehicle hadnt talked to you in a couple of days and i missed you whats up i swallowed hard during his flurry of words my heart pounded in my chest and when i spoke my voice cracked on my first assurance that i was well doing fine how are you he regaled me with a funny story about one of his salesmen that normally would have had me laughing companionably instead i forced a weak titter he asked about mama and i answered id been out to the horse farm and she was well the dance of words meaningless to me at the moment continued until i could stand it no more bob don let me ask you a question did you tell the rest of your family about my coming to this reunion next month oh sure son i werent hardly gonna surprise them with you and make everybody uncomfortable i told uncle mutt i was bringing you and my sister sass and im sure theyve informed the rest of the folks youre big news to the goertzes everybodys real eager to meet you i see i stared at the bloodsmirched card someone had not taken the news of my arrival kindly thats all right isnt it bob don sounded concerned son yes of course it is i just wondered well im so looking forward to the reunion i cant wait to show off my boy pleasure and pride laced his voice and i smiled despite myself i glanced back on the obscenity on the kitchen table im looking forward to meeting them bob don we made small talk for a while and he invited candace and me to dinner the following friday night i hung up the phone and turned back toward the table i resisted the urge to destroy the card i got my camera snapped a couple of pictures of the perverse mail and carefully slid the card into a plastic baggie telling bob don would upset him no end and i felt furious at the idea of being warned off the reunion by someone so cowardly they veiled their hate in blood and anonymous threats i stored the card carefully in an antique wooden box in my room loath to eye it again i stared down at the shut box and imagined the evil on the other side made the carved lid tremble ever so slightly i wondered who might hate me so sight unseen two weeks later rich hickory smoke perfumed the air as bob don flipped steaks on his backyard grill gretchen had flown on her broom to brenham to visit her aunt and candace was having dinner with her folks we were bacheloring dinner together but i had scant appetite for bloodrare steak and a loaded buttery baked potato fluffed with salt and pepper my secret admirer had mailed me good wishes again the second bit of correspondence was more direct in its threat he or she had opted for another massmarket greeting card the kind that women buy for other women on birthdays dripping with sexual innuendo a handsome blond fellow leaned against a column bare belly rippling with muscle jeans faded and strategically torn vanilla frosting was lightly smeared across his welldefined chest and gut and his puckered lips held a small lit candle the inside preprinted message said have your cake and eat it too happy birthday the outward message though was of greater interest the mans visage had been carefully sliced in an x with a razor and inside my wellwisher had pasted in stolen script this is your face if you dare to show it stay away from our family cold chilled my bones i could never be handsome enough to be a model but the fellow on the card was lanky a thickhaired blond and greeneyedlike me i couldnt imagine that the hatemailer had gotten lucky in choosing a countenance and coloring like my own and the vandalism on the card had been minutely done careful to preserve some semblance of the models face this person knew what i looked like thickness coated my throat my glance had gone to my windows my door were they watching me now did they know my face or was it a lucky guess based on bob dons own looks i checked again for the postmarkthis time it was beaumont much further up the long curving texas coast from corpus christi so my admirer traveled or had an accomplice i sealed the second harassing missive in another baggie and stored it with the first and spent a long sleepless night listening to candaces soft breathing in the darkness i hadnt told a soul now watching bob don cheerfully grill dinner the soft voice of the rangers baseball announcer chronicling a home game the chirp of crickets in the trees the hate felt far away i sipped at my shiner bock and listened to the soporific drone of the bugs singing away their short lives earth to jordan bob don boomed out after id been idling moments away in my own world i looked up at him with surprise somethings got you out of gear son the rangers aint losing that badly i smiled son despite my ambivalence about bob don as a parent i have to admit the endearment had a nice ring when my father died from his bout with cancer and my mother forgot who i was id thought son would be a word dropped from usage in connection with me but here was bob don ready to pick up the reins ready to love me like a father like the one id lost i stood suddenly and walked through the smoke wafting from the grill you and candace crossways he asked my back no how how to do this i need to ask you a question is anyone in your family considereddangerous good lord he blinked at me with honest surprise what on earth would make you ask such a thing i felt torn about revealing the poisonpen letters part of me wanted him to know to tell me i didnt have to go to the reunion that hed find out who was terrorizing me another half of me wanted to entirely ignore the epistles not give in to the foul bullying they represented but i was swimming into unknown waters here and i needed to know where the sharks lay i ran my tongue along my lips i just would like for you to answer the question bob don i will when i know why youre asking he swallowed another long swig from his shiner longneck im just wondering if everyone in your family is going to be delighted by my presence there could be some resentment against me after all im somewhat of an unwelcome addition why unwelcome theyre just going to love you if you say so i interrupted cutting off his extroverts flow of words and tasting my beer id been giving some thought as to why ias the newest member of the goertz familymight merit vituperative messages and id concocted a theory uncle mutts rich right i asked this while bob don was in midgulp and he nodded his assent yeah rolling in it are we talking millions here mutts probably worth about ten million or so ten million no wonder someone didnt want another claimant to the family fortune around and hes in good health not expected to kick off anytime soon bob don gave me a long measuring stare i dont like where this conversations heading i hope you want to go to meet my family because it matters to us both not to hit uncle mutt up for cash or get on the beneficiary list oh no not at all i hemmed not at all bob don it just occurs to me that some of your relatives might not be overly thrilled at another potential heir he didnt answer me immediately the smoke from the grill framing his face in the dusky light he turned and ministered over the steaks piling the two thick cuts onto a plate nearly let these burn he muttered to himself and why dont we eat out here its a nice evening and the mosquitoes aint so bad in counterpoint to this comment the blue haze of his bug zapper brightened and an electric hiss announced the demise of another of our bloodsucking friends why dont you get the taters he asked i went back inside wondering why he was dodging my question i fetched the warming potatoes from the oven sliced them open in a cloud of fragrant steam and slathered them with butter sour cream and chives i retrieved the salad id made earlier from the fridge grabbed a bottle of ranch dressing and piled all on a tray along with plates and silverware when i returned to the patio bob don was staring toward the purplish horizon watching the dying light play along the branches of the loblolly pines and the live oaks that dotted his expansive backyard the air felt warm and wet from an afternoon shower but were tough about humidity in texas he didnt even glance back at me when i began to unload the fixings i hope youre hungry bob don i began cause we sure got us a mess of food here im hiking my cholesterol just looking at it he turned to me then and i could see an alien sadness coloring his face i say alien because im not sure i could ever understand the emotions that painted that particular expression he looked like a man whos gotten every gold piece in creation only to see it all turn to brass in one dreadful second i turned back to setting the table son i love you i was still unloading the tray and i didnt look up again a twitchy discomfort arrowed through my body and i felt my face tighten i havent said them words to you in a long time not since after weafter you found out about me hed murmured them in an intensivecare hospital room after taking a bullet while saving my life from a vicious killer id held his hand and like a little boy id cried but since then the topic of his paternal feelings for me had been avoided a maelstrom to be carefully circumnavigated my mouth felt dry i stared down at the jumble of torn lettuce quartered tomatoes and sliced onions in the salad bowl the smell of the steaks had set my mouth watering but i couldnt swallow past the dense block in my throat its okay he murmured you dont have to say nothing i know you still have trouble seeing me as your father i coughed past the blockage and glanced up at him bob don its just that you coming to this reunion god it means the world to me and i dont want you scared off by some idle worry that my people are gonna think that youre just gunning for uncle mutts money but after the past year weve hadgetting to know each other you letting me into your life morei just want us to be able to acknowledge each other to say publicly that were father and son i clanged silverware down on the table my stomach grumbling anxiously a moment ago for meat and potatoes quieted like a hushed baby i didnt look at him and i didnt know what to say i wasnt ready for this not yet not yet youre sure keeping quiet thats not like you bob don finally said ii dont mean to be quiet youve just given me a lot to think about he touched my arm as gently as he might a babys and i glanced into the full want in his face his voice was hoarse rasped raw by emotion youre my child i can never ever regard you any other way now i see so much of myself in you of your mother and my father myother father i interjected quickly my real father id nearly said and bit the words off just in time but the reality was as far as the dictates of biology went bob don had claim to that particular title he lowered his arm yes of course youve got his kind streak most of the time he sat down and began to slice into his steak sit down and eat jordan before your supper gets cold i took an uncomfortable seat i was evading his demand but he had neatly skipped past my question i considered telling him about the cards but knowing bob don he would have insisted i stay put and out of any potential harms way i wasnt about to be skittered off by a sick threat my own curiosity gnawed at me as to why someone was going to such careful trouble to frighten me off the family tree if i pressed him for details on who in the family might be dangerous i might need a reason to justify my queries for now i decided to keep my own counsel we ate in silence the meat was meltingly tender the potato creamily smooth and peppery the salad crisp but it all tasted like cardboard in my mouth my bones felt like they were trembling inside the bag of my skin i had been avoiding publicly acknowledging bob don for over a year and he was going to force the issue no pun intended i chewed a chunk of meat my appetite fading why wasnt i ready i snuck a glance at him scooping out the buttery innards of his baked potato because he wasnt my daddy he was a nice man a kind fellow with a big heart but he wasnt the man who raised me and taught me and spanked me when i deserved it and hugged me when i didnt he wasnt lloyd poteet and he could never be you cannot erase twentyodd years of fatherhood with an announcement of true paternity you cant push your daddys memory deeper into the grave by turning to all folks you know and saying this man is my real father its not possible if our hearts are homes some rooms cant be rented out once the occupant dies thankfully bob don abandoned the subject and we ate the rest of our meal with the drone of the baseball game on the radio as our companion we drank beer and we talked of the weather he did not tell me family stories and i did not ask him to he did not mention again that i was his child he exhausted his collection of aggie jokes and i made myself laugh through them all but i felt a creeping unfamiliar misery nestle in my chest i was saying goodbye to him in the den when gretchen returned from visiting her aunt hello hello she chimed as she came through the kitchen door she gave her husband a cheek kiss and favored me with her uncertain smile ive sometimes wondered if the long years of drunkenness wiped the memory of how to truly smile from gretchens mind her grin is half grimace and it never settles correctly into her face did you boys enjoy yalls dinner yes it was great i croaked coughing for no reason we made an odd tableau in this den the very scene where a wasted gretchen had brayed out her hatred of me blaming me for her long years of inebriation and finally the truth that i was bob dons bastard his precious bastard the times i came to this house we did not linger in this room as though its walls still held the faintest stain from her venom it was still the spot on earth where my world unraveled for all time did you have a nice visit with your aunt i asked her she blinked at my inquirykindness from me was suspicious yes we did poor old aunts not getting younger but it was nice to see her she patted bob dons arm and i saw genuine affection light her face ill be going then thanks for the dinner bob don i feared for one long unmerciful moment that he was going to mention his desire to claim me as his son surely he had discussed this with gretchen hadnt he he simply shook my hand youre still planning on coming to the reunion arent you of course i assured him i saw the corners of gretchens eyes crinkle in consternation then her smile her offish odd smileslid into uneasy place on her face i wished them good night and drove home peering into the rural darkness a blanket of stars unfurled above my head as a wall of clouds pushed onward toward the gulf clearing the sky of its low haze gretchen hated meor at least she had once could she be behind the cards if i never became a part of bob dons family i could not trespass on her territory i imagined her hands smearing blood across a card razoring a printed face pasting letters with malice it scared me that i could easily see her hands busy with such work two days before the reunion id really prefer you not go i murmured into the soft spill of candaces hair she smelled of flowers and of lime from the ceviche she made for dinner moonlight played along our bare bodies as we cuddled in bed why dont you want me there her tone was measured which meant i might be in trouble because its going to be complicated enough sweetheart i think i need to face the goertzes on my own i fib best when not having to look directly into candaces face and i examined the top of her head with intense concentration as if knowing my thoughts she shifted in my arms to turn her blue eyes straight on my face i hazarded a smile is that it yeah i kissed the top of her forehead i could hardly say im getting vicious hate mail from someone in the family who doesnt want me around and i dont want you to be in danger so stay home that wouldnt work candace would be bodyguarding my butt all the way to uncle mutts island strikes me as odd she mumbled against the tender flesh of my throat that you dont want to acknowledge bob don as your daddy yet youre bound and determined to go to this reunion meet his family let them meet you if thats not acknowledgment i dont know what is i swallowed as she began to play her fingers through my hair her other hand began a slow exploration of my chest grazing a nipple and sending a shiver through me i didnt speak so whats up jordan i suspect youre not telling total truth here listen darling its nothing to be concerned over i just think it might be best if you didnt go she ran her fingernails across my chest in a sensual tippytoe that left me holding my breath she lingered near the nipple again and grabbed with sudden force i winced honesty time hon whats going on i pried her hand off from its death grip she kissed me quickly in apology so i told her about the cards sweet god she sat up in bed thats a crime jordan were calling the police i touched her shoulder no were not i dont want bob don to know about this let me see these cards candace demanded i retrieved them from their hiding place and carefully using a cloth she read them she stared at the bloodstained greeting card with disgust and shook her head at the mutilated model this is godawful sick she finally murmured and just why the hell werent you going to share this problem i knew youd freak and i didnt want you to worry now you see why i dont want you to come and why do you want to go she demanded why put yourself in danger babe if you dont want bob don for a fatherand you cant seem to decide she ended in a shrug and gestured at the hate mail why not stay away from thisthispsychopath i dont scare easy i said with a bravado i didnt feel and im not going to be warned off by idiotic pranks like these cards i want to know why nowwhy is someone so determined to keep me from the reunion why curiosity may kill more than cats she cautioned if youre going im going with you youll need someone to watch your back you sound like a bad cop show im not joking jordan im not letting anyone hurt a hair on your head i blushed at the intensity of her words which was somehow more revealing than our casual nakedness in bed and i knew better than to argue okay fine as long as you stay out of trouble my blood ran cold at the thought of candace near anyone who could send such missives but wed moved past the point of debatei saw the stony set of determination in her face and not a word to bob don i have my own plan for dealing with this sicko tell me she murmured so i did i wondered if any passing motorists would render aid if i leaned out the car door window and screamed and thats when i decided sass and i would not only be sistersinlaw but be best friends gretchen continued she was just so kind to me and chockfull of marital advice when bob don and i got hitched lord knows she should have been bob don muttered sassd been married often enough i half thought she was gunning for the world record for times down the aisle even his normally jovial temper seemed strained by the long drive it was not an auspicious start to our family reunion mostly in that i did not want to be reunited anytime soon with my loved ones in this car much less make the acquaintance of a whole passel of new kinfolks for all his enthusiasm for this trip bob don seemed itchy gretchens paean to his family irritated him and hed snapped more than once at his wife candace was strangely quiet offering no relief from the ongoing gretchen monologue gretchen appeared determined to sparkle all the way to uncle mutts home not even the stars in the sky glitter quite that long i dont mean to complain honestly but my stomach had started roiling at the idea of being introduced to a bunch of complete strangers although they were technically blood kin and tension gripped my limbs i wanted bob dons family to like me and accept mebut at the same time i wanted not to care about their reactions to me i tried not to reflect overmuch that at least one of them seemed inordinately displeased that a stray sperm of bob dons had ended up sentient blond and breathing a final card had arrived the day before a lastditch effort to avert my arrival at uncle mutts i had not even shown this one to candace it would have scared the bejesus out of her at the moment the card lay safely contained in a bag in my suitcase along with its fellow couriers of hate i could nearly imagine a faint throb of evil emanating from the car trunk like a telltale heart the cards designer had intended comfort the front of the greeting in flowery script said in deepest sympathy open it and you saw the rest of the sentence hacked from magazine letters for your impending death youre not one of us well mourn only a moment i wish i could say a cold shiver raced through me when i read those words it seems the normal reaction and i pray for normality in my life but at this last most bitter missive i felt only a numb disbelief that someone hated me so what crime had i committed aside from the accident of my birth a crime i could hardly be judged and hanged for id spent the rest of the day in a quiet funk i had not rallied for this mornings drive to the coast bob dons sudden silence candaces odd detachment and gretchens prattling hadnt improved my mood she rarely veered from discussion of her sisterinlaw and she made no useful announcement like hows cousin herbert enjoying life outside the insane asylum if i wanted to identify my torturer i would have to play investigator again and people believe i go looking for trouble the landscape unfolded past us as the cadillac raced toward the coast the gently rolling hills of pastureland fenced in idle herds of red brangus and santa gertrudis cattle grazing in the heat we stopped at the brownmustardcolored grocery store in tiny swiss alp for dr peppers we arrowed through the heart of czech texas in schulenberg and hallettsville i saw bumper stickers written in czech next to bumper stickers that advised me to love or leave america we headed south on highway and as we approached victoria the pasturelands gave way to the flatness of the coastal plain in victoria an old texas town that seems to have every new fastfood restaurant imaginable we turned south onto highway bulleting through small towns like placedo and kamey as we continued through calhoun county one side of the road seemed thick with an unfurled skein of bush that never quite ended the other side of the road was charcoal dark farm soil an empty railroad track ran parallel to the road as if from a forgotten time oil pumps the eternal symbol of texas moved in languorous thrusts near the road the july air grew perceptibly denser with humidity as we headed south port lavaca which guarded lavaca bay and its bigger parent matagorda bay came up quickly a sleepy salty hamlet port lavaca works too hard to be a pretty town most of the businesses seemed industrial the eateries cheap and old handpainted signs for last winters local elections still stood in forlorn disuse bob don insisted on stopping at a colorfully painted mexican restaurant that looked like a botulism testing site but had marvelous homestyle food prepared by a chattering grandmother who scolded bob don in spanish for not visiting more often after our meal we drove further out on the jutting chunk of calhoun county and headed down highway toward port oconnor the land here was hardly coastal lookingtilled flatland tall grass horses and cattle grazing profusions of thick bush i rolled down the window and could smell the barest tinge of salt we drove over marshy areas with signs that said no fishing from bridge old men and boys black and white and brown sat inches from the sign watching their lines dangle in the water with the patience of statues they did not even look up as the cadillac rumbled past fishing is the main reason for port oconnors existence aside from target practice for hurricanescarla nearly destroyed it in every other billboard seemed to advertise the countys best fishing guide or a boat stall for cheap rent well do some fishing bob don promised me of course i thought thats what fathers and sons do he pulled into port oconnor proper stopping near the main beacha very narrow oneand pulling into a small but wellkept driveway for a little cottage the other homes around it looked full of vacationing families i craned my neck out the window to see the brackish greenish water of matagorda bay gulls swooped above the beach as screaming children hurled bread in the air in delight the birds were whitebreasted and graywinged a cloud of them cawed and wheeled as two children further down the beach lured them with new treats a sailboat plied past and i saw a pretty girl in a bikini lean against the boats railing as though she were unimaginably bored ill fetch rufus bob don grumbled opening the car door and slamming it shut with extra effort he stormed toward the cottage gretchen was firmly locked in im trying my best mode and she pivoted toward the backseat with a frighteningly energetic smile yall are just going to love sass she assured us for the nth time i love her already i smiled through clenched teeth jordy candace admonished me she patted the back of gretchens beringed hand im sure that well all get along like houses afire im so excited they dont know about my recovery at least bob don hasnt said anything to them about it gretchen lowered the vanity mirror and after rummaging in her purse primped with powder and lipstick i watched the back of her permed gray hair as she ministered to herself the hardness of my heart toward her softened a bit i wont pretend that gretchen and i have had an easy relationship and i couldnt easily drop my suspicion of her she was the one whod viciously and drunkenly informed me of my parentage during one of her binges shed also gotten involved in a pathetic scheme to ruin my reputation which i could have sued the hell out of her for but had never mentioned again out of consideration for bob don since shed come to work for me at the library as a volunteer bob dons idea certainly not mine wed made forays into healing the breaches between us shed sobered up i tried not to step on her toes too much in developing a relationship with my new father but she resented me and i resented her and the process of learning kindness toward each other was slow and difficult like wading through beachside rocks without turning an ankle nothing said i ever had to like or love gretchenthose were emotions i found it impossible to associate with herbut civility for bob dons sake was a reachable goal as long as she had no role in sending me hate mail we could get along fine gretchen candace said softly you look fine dont worry so much about powdering your face you look pretty i wasnt the only one making an effort to be kind why thank you candace sweetie gretchen smacked her lips together once to even her lipstick i know a young lady like yousomeone from a more refined background is going to appreciate the goertzes i chose not to take that comment as a slam toward me but as more of gretchens interminable buttkissing candace doesnt need to worry about money so shes higher on the food chain than i can ever hope to evolve unless i win the lottery gretchen snapped the mirror back into place with an authoritative air candace im so glad youre here you can show jordy the ropes of dealing with quality people i saw candace tug at her top lip with her pearly front teeth quelling a rejoinder i operated under no such restrictions thank you gretchen but i know which fork to use ill manage just fine around people with nicknames like sass and mutt not a worthy kindness but i was on edge and not feeling charitable see that you do jordan i know that bob don thinks you poop french vanilla ice cream but i know how sharptongued and boorish you can be its not classy and i dont want you to embarrass him in any way if he was ashamed of me gretchen he wouldnt have begged me to come he didnt want your feelings hurt jordy im sorry to tell you that but how would you have felt if you knew hed gone off to a family reunion and not included you just fine i retorted but i didnt elaborate how would i have reacted i had been the one keeping bob don at an arms length not publicly acknowledging him as my father in our hometown politely accepting his help and his money with my mothers nursing and his business advice with our new horse farm hed been longing for decades to be a father to me loving me from afar keeping his pride for me locked firmly away in his heart hed given me the key and id yet to use it just mind your manners gretchen said i will and practice what you preach my irritation with gretchen felt nearly physical what did bob don see in this woman how could he have loved my mothera kind funny intelligent womanand also love gretchen whose bitterness was as palpable as heavily worn perfume both of you please behave candace chided she started it i announced childishly gretchen didnt have time for a return volley the door swung open and bob don settled his big frame back into the cadillacs plush leather interior in the rearview mirror i could see his scowl i saw a lanky older man head from the cottage toward a marina a half block away rufus is getting the boat ready bob don said grab your bags and well walk down there whos rufus candace asked hes an old friend of uncle mutts that would probably be a dead wino if it wasnt for mutt bob don turned and grinned at us hes uncle mutts charity case i figure rufuss about seven bricks short of a load but hes awful loyal to mutt mutt keeps him in food and mogen david and that makes him happy poor rufus gretchen clucked he really needs to address his alcoholism he has never admitted that he had a problem he asked how you were honey bob don said the humor out of his voice i told him you were sober now and he said he was right disappointed to lose a good drinking buddy it was wellintended but not the right compliment to offer i saw a wave of pain crest across gretchens face but she set her lips in a half smile she worried one comer of her mouth with a lacquered nail as if to keep her optimistic grin firmly in place hell just have to drink on without me sweetheart those days are behind me forever i coughed not meaning to and candace flashed me a look of complete annoyance bob don and gretchen chose to ignore my gaffe completely i ducked down in the seat embarrassed of course you are darlin and im so proud of you bob don squeezed gretchens shoulder with unexpected tenderness we all are arent we kids yes of course gretchen candace patted the back of gretchens shoulder im happy for you gretchen i managed it was true i was happier for bob don because his life had been an unceasing hell while gretchen eyed the bottles bottom but despite the untenable chasm between her and me i didnt wish her dependence on anyone i couldnt imagine what existence would be like for someone continually drunk or continually wanting to drink life was made to be lived not stumbled through thank you gretchen murmured her eyes averted from us all she glanced up through the window oh theres that rufus with the boat i hope theres no wine on his breath this early in the day her voice shook like the palmetto fronds in the quickening gulf wind the fishy salty smell of matagorda bay pervaded not only the little speedboat but rufus beaulac as well he was a leanly tall grizzlefaced man with a scarred lip and redrimmed muddy hazel eyes he spoke with the rolling cadence of the cajuns that live in southwestern louisiana and far eastern texas he helped us with our luggage without comment eyed gretchen with suspicion ogled candace and didnt flinch when bob don introduced me as his son a long gaze went up from my worn loafers my jeans the untucked batik print shirt candace had given me from one of her recent shopping sprees shes one of those women who like to dress their men and lingered longest on my blond hair and green eyes i felt like he was surveying my face for flecks of family for gods sake rufus dont stare at the boy gretchen muttered you do have some manners left dont you she worked her hands into fists a death grip on her purse rufus ignored her mutt said you were bringing your boy just surprised to see how much he favors you i figgered that youd had some kid off n a nigger woman rufus gretchen gasped what a thing to say bob don blushed deeply i was unsure if gretchen was shocked by rufuss racial slur or the suggestion that bob don would have had a black mistress well i couldnt figger why else he aint owned up to him sooner gretch i saw her cringe at the diminutive use of her name i dont mean no disrespect to the young feller rufus offered me a grimy hand which i shook with disguised reluctance if rufus portended things to come the weekend was shaping up to be even more of a trial than i anticipated i surveyed his face carefully wondering if he was the letter sender he didnt seem the type for idle threat or subterfuge raw physical action would be rufuss forte its nice to meet you jordan look like your daddy when he was the young whip his eyes traveled back to candace and his distorted lip rose in a smile and aint you got a pretty petite here he bowed to her with mock solemnity rufus beaulac at your service chere delighted mr beaulac candace said diplomatically if you dont mind i think wed like to get over to the island as soon as possible im sure you can understand that jordans rather anxious to meet his new relatives i didnt know she was such an accomplished fibber she squeezed my hand a silent message well get through this rufus laughed showing tobaccostained teeth and unhealthy gums i aint so sure theyre anxious to meet him miss he favored me with another discolored grin and turned his attention back to the boat we boarded my own heart thudding in my chest we cruised away from port oconnor at the lip of land and toward the middle of matagorda bay racing away from the elongated barrier island of matagorda now a state park and wildlife refuge i kept looking around for one of its famous whooping cranes but i didnt see any diving through the summer sky the islands that gird south texas are thin like emaciated fingers of land pressing against the coast the water was a little rough and dark racing toward sangre island felt like approaching an alien shore i wasnt sure what my role was supposed to be here tourist invader or immigrant i didnt acknowledge the possibility of victim i watched bob don laugh and cajole with rufus as the boat shot across the choppy gray water what did bob don want from me during this visit act as a devoted dutiful son it wasnt a role i was sure i was prepared for i knew how to be lloyd poteets son being bob dons was playing a part that made me awkward and unsure and rufuss teasing suggestion about the questionable welcome awaiting me didnt imbue me with confidence it didnt sound like the collective goertz arms had opened to enfold the lamb that had wandered from the flock yet bob don seemed sureat least when we were back in mirabeau and he was talking me into this fool expedition that his people would embrace me as he had i tried not to dwell on the hate mail it couldnti hopedspeak for an entire family i suspected there was one bitter apple in the barrel riddled with worms the others might be crisp and fresh and faultless after all bob don was a fine man and surely he was more representative of the goertzes than my secret pen pal gretchen sat unusually silent watching the unfolding white wake the boat made in the rocky bay candace held on to my arm and appeared a tad seasick i asked if she was okay she nodded never liked boats much and they dont like me i took her damp fingers and laced them through mine the trip was short perhaps twenty minutes i saw the islandbarely a mile long if that and some indeterminate width that wasnt much greater most of the lip of the shore seemed to be grayish sand and there was a scattering of oak and palmetto trees i could see a swath of beach crowned with modest dunes and tall saltgrass sangre looked like a midget barrier island that hadnt quite made it out to sea unlike the mighty stretch of matagorda island toward one end of sangre a large rambling house stood uncompromisingly victorian i marveled that a hurricane hadnt reduced the old house to memorymatagorda bays residents lived on an edge each and every summer more than one killer storm had screamed ashore along this section of the coast rufus veered the boat out a bit from the island and gestured toward the empty bay north of the island opposite the mansion thats where they went down who candace asked yelling above the roaring motor and the whistling wind the reliant went down fighting a confederate ship i asked i thought most of the naval action along the coast during the war was up near sabine pass rufus shook his head well the confederates built a fort on matagorda bay and made the timber look like big guns to bluff the yankees but that aint here no more reliant wasnt a confederate ship reliant was one of the five battleships in the original texas navy back when texas was fightin for independence went down fightin a mexican ship thats how the island got its name sangre means blood in spanish rufus this is a distasteful story surely gretchen attempted he paid her no heed survivors from the reliant got to the island the mexicanshe pronounced it messkins captured them and cut their throats right there on the sand he gestured from where the sunken wreck lay to a sliver of beach on the north side of the island with a dock protruding he kept his hands so little on the wheel i wondered how he steered but mutt tells the story lots better than i do you should ask him i stared out at the watery spot rufus beaulac had indicated somewhere beneath those whitecapped waves the shell of the reliant rested its broken hull serving as an empty coffin to god only knew how many boys and men that had dared to defy the mexicans then i glanced again at the beach where rufus indicated the massacre had taken place those poor sailorsthey had never lived to see the republic of texas born the admission to the union the bonds of brotherly ties shattered in the civil war then the pain of reconstruction anyone ever dive down there t called to rufus he stared at me with frank horror hell no with all them dead boys whod want to go down there i started to mention that any human remains would be long gone it could be fascinating i started but rufus crossed himself with a practiced hand and looked at me with reproach you a ghoul boy he said you got more to worry about than those dead sailors he turned the boat away from the watery grave and aimed it toward the island i felt a sick unease tug at my heart you got more to worry about a tall lanky man and an older woman in a flowing robelike dress waited for us as we pulled the boat up to a dock the man had a thick shock of blondishgray hair high cheekbones set in a broad german face and watery blue eyes there was no mistaking the familial resemblance between him and bob don an unlit cigarette dangled from his mouth and he had his narrow hands set on thin hips watching us expectantly the woman was older in her sixties at least and she held a small chihuahua up to her cheek as though it were a puppet she too had the teutonic countenance i had come to think of as particularly goertzish but a warm gentle smile softened her face as the boat grew closer she took one of the chihuahuas tiny paws and waved it in greeting the dog looked bored with this social nicety and squirmed uncomfortably against the ladys bosom gretchen wiggled fingers at the welcoming party but tension crinkled her eyes and bob don frowned for a moment before replacing his grimace with a grin i glanced at candace i hoped i didnt look as petrified as i felt she gave me a hopeful warm smile i did my best to return it rufus leaped out of the boat and moored it to the dock the khakiclad man didnt offer to help instead he lit his cigarette with a battered zippo lighter and peered at me through the feather of smoke that crept past his weathered face we disembarked and i helped rufus pull our luggage out of the boat bob don shook hands with the man hey cousin tom how you doing bob don was using what i called his sales pitch tone friendly slightly cajoling hinting that hed love to do nothing more than listen to you talk the whole day long it had moved any number of new and used cars off his lots cousin tom didnt seem swayed by it he exhaled a plume of sour smoke and said well dont you got yourself an entourage this time bob don how do gretchen his voice was deep and raspy he nodded toward gretchen who clutched bob dons arm and put on her party smile im fine tom hello aunt lolly how nice to see you gretchen chirped bob don leaned down and kissed the lined cheek of the lady with the dog she giggled with glee and kissed him back with a resounding smack on the cheek bob don so good to see you you too gretchen she added with a considerable drop in enthusiasm she wielded the chihuahua into bob dons face give sweetie a big op kiss bob don opted instead to pat the tiny critter on the head i couldnt blame him as sweeties tongue draped out of its mouth in the summer heat oh youll hurt sweeties feelings and him being a blood relation the woman whom i now supposed to be bob dons aunt lolly frowned and cradled sweetie in her arms tom rolled his eyes in exasperated impatience gretchen coughed the dog was a blood relation perhaps i wasnt the only surprise on the family tree are we the first ones here gretchen ventured to break the sudden silence not hardly everybody else is already up at the house uncle mutts in rare form be warned toms eyes locked on me in the same calculated scan that rufus had performed back on the coast this him his voice hadnt gotten any friendlier yeah it is bob don said smiling genuinely for the first time in a couple of hours tom this is my son jordan jordan this is my cousin tom bedrich i extended a hand and tom took it in a macho death grip that went beyond firm i squeezed back for all i was worth well you look enough like a goertz i guess his pale blue eyes went to candace and a smile touched his lips it was a grimy grin and i didnt like it one bit however i told him i was pleased to meet him and jordan this is my aunt louisa goertz throckmorton aunt lolly this is my son jordan aunt lolly surprised me with a deep curtsy i am honored to make your acquaintance my dear boy she sprang back up brandishing the dog and this is sweetie who in a previous life was your greatuncle charles throckmorton uhhhh was the only response that came to mind my mama didnt raise no social morons though so i ignored her announcement about her husbands reincarnation its a real pleasure to meet you maam hi sweetie i improvised patting the dogs head oh my dear you must call me aunt lolly everyone does okay aunt lolly tom this is my girlfriend candace tully tom took candaces hand with considerably more enthusiasm than he had mine pleasure to meet you do you go by candy never voluntarily candace said politely then candace it is a lovely name for a very lovely lady tom suddenly seemed aware of his disreputable appearance dragging a hand across his dirty worn polo shirt yall have to forgive my clothes ive been puttering around the island all afternoon i didnt mean to be the official welcoming committee but i saw the boat coming over i was just heading back to change during this monologue his eyes went from candace back to me i steeled myself to get stares for the next couple of days i refused to let myself be rattled and i just gave tom a noncommittal grin i tried to imagine him slicing letters from a magazine to construct pronouncements of hate or smearing blood across an innocent greeting card tom i could see doing it aunt lolly i couldnt she seemed ditzy but basically harmless well welcome to the family jordan lets get yall settled tom grabbed gretchens bag and headed toward the house would you like to carry sweetie darling lolly asked candace my own sweetie smiled and took the dog holding it close one stray paw touched candaces left breast and lolly smirked oh sweetie he was just that awful when he was charles bad bad boy she waggled a finger in her poochs face who eyed it with utter disdain candace smiled politely in agreement deferring to aunt lollys more cosmic knowledge and shot me a look of desperation i was too busy shooting one at bob don who just smiled and shrugged we followed tom like sheep listing after a herder i dont think sweetie got a chance to grope candace again we walked up and past the stretch of dunes heading toward the main house it stood on the barrier flat of the island grassy and weedy with plants wildflowersrosy saltmarsh morning glory with arrowhead leaves a bed of bluebells a wooden post twining violet with butterfly pea made bright explosions of color grasses of different varieties sprouted along the path leading up to the house much of it kneehigh not far from the house was a large greenhouse where i could see even more plants profusing a wellmaintained porch wrapped around the entire big white house with wicker furniture so guests could sit and enjoy a cooling breeze off the bay bob don gestured toward the greenhouse and spoke to rufus jake and mutt pottering away rufus shook his head not much lately mutts too busy for hobbies and jakes feeling a little peaked mutt needs a new hobby i heard lolly mutter as we went up the steps i thought here we go your lifes never going to be quite the same again youll never think of family quite the same again i half expected that if i glanced over my shoulder id see mama and daddy standing by the dock waving goodbye to me i was a poteeti would always be a poteetbut none of that would matter to these folks i would be a part of whatever strange collective history the goertzes had formed the intangible web of love and hurt that binds families together an attractive young woman darkeyed and darkhaired greeted us in the front entrance she gave a hearty kiss on the cheek to bob don and a tight affectionate hug to gretchen aunt gretchen you look wonderful i could see the happy light in gretchens face had she heard that often from the goertzes when she was lost in her alcoholic fog even before bob don could introduce me the young woman was already kissing my cheek jordan its so great to meet you im your cousin deborah goertz she held me at arms length for a moment eyeing me critically and isnt it a shame were kin youre just too cute embarrassed i managed to laugh and introduced candace who was then treated to another warm deborah receptiona kiss on the cheek and a cheery hug and bob don didnt tell us you had such a pretty girlfriend im so glad youre here theres not many folks around our age except aubrey who i swear acts like hes sixty anyway old fuddy her voice warm and sweet like caramel could reduce men to abject slavery i liked her immediately and could tell candace did too if you are quite done being the welcome wagon deb aunt lolly intoned reproof in her voice perhaps youd show jordan and candace to their rooms bob don and gretchen yall are in your regular room at the end of the hall why dont yall get settled and then join us down here for cocktails then well all get acquainted and eat she patted me on the arm smiled wanly at candace and glided from the room like a spirit only the vague smell of her citrusy perfume declared shed been in the room deborah made a wrinkled face at her aunts departing form speaking of old fuddiesshe needs a little more sugar in her diet she grabbed candaces bag follow me troops the stairway she led us up was dark in stark contrast to the glaring summer light outside the banister was heavy and worn by several decades worth of sliding palms the stairs bent at the second floor then bent again to rise to the third the house must be older than i originally thought built perhaps in the last century the floor the walls the stairs all held an enclosing permanence that felt choking it was not an airy house and an invisible denseness pressed against my skin deborah kept up a line of patter all the way up the stairs so youve already met tom and lolly anyone else yet rufus i answered ah uncle mutts marionette rufus is okay but hes not one of the worlds great thinkers deborah paused at the secondfloor landing one hand on an ornate orb of wood on the staircase and have you made the acquaintance of aunt sass yet no but weve heard quite a lot about her i answered you cant hear about sassone has to experience her deborahs grin was wry but i thought i detected a flicker of pain across her features aunt sass glues this family together blood can be as sticky as glue candace offered unexpectedly a quick glance told me she was studying deborah intently perhaps to see if the mention of blood rattled her apparently it didnt isnt blood what holds a family together deborah shrugged she sauntered up the steps i figured shed misinterpreted candaces comment the third floor held several bedroomsdeborah indicated her own guest quarters were down the hall and aunt lollys room was here as well she likes to be close to heaven deborah observed while opening a door and gesturing us inside heres yalls digs hope theyre comfortable the room was nice furnished with antique pieces and a braided navyandgray rug some undetermined wildflowerlavender in shadestood in a vase a mirror one crack scarring its surface sat mounted on the wall like a diseased eye a window opened up to a view over the bay a small bathroom and large closet completed the room i hope you like it this is a room i used to stay in when wed visit when i was little i asked uncle mutt to give it to yall special i wanted yall to feel welcome she smiled warmly thanks very much i said im sure well be really comfortable deborah we want you to be jordan she said softly i mean im sure this is very odd for you its odd for us as well the family i mean a sudden grip of inarticulateness made her flip her palms up then down i dont have the words im so very fond of uncle bob don i just am glad to know youve found him i know hell be a wonderful father to you my throat felt tight found him wonderful father you didnt tell us what you do deborah jordans a librarian and i run a little restaurant in mirabeau how about you candace stayed close to me watching my new cousin oh im a nurse in corpus christi but i do get to visit uncle mutt and uncle jake a lot here at the house aunt lolly i can do without she grimaced even at merest mention of her aunts name nursing must be very rewarding work candace proceeded my tongue felt stapled to the roof of my mouth oh it is listen i need to get a few things done before cocktails and dinner its not dressy come as you are she started sidling for the door i am really happy to meet you both deborah listen candace interrupted would it be too much trouble for me to get my own room id feel better about being here if i wasnt sleeping in jordans room what with meeting his family and all for the first time a prickle of anger contracted her eyes for a moment as if candaces request was a personal jab then her face softened and she said of course bob don had just said that yall were quite the item so i assumedforgive my bad manners theres an extra room at the end of the hall candace and ill make it up for you oh please dont go to any trouble deborah point me in the direction of the sheets and ill do the work dont be silly for a nurse making a bed with fresh sheets is second nature she rubbed candaces arm kindly and gave me another smile ill see yall downstairs for drinks tom makes a mean margarita if you like em tart deborah left closing the door behind her i like her i said sitting down on the bed i like her too candace said and it worries me no end why because right now i dont want to like any of these people candace sat next to me and draped her arms around my shoulders because one of these people is sending bloodied letters to my baby i dont want to trust any of them until we know who that is were not sure its someone here on the island i offered then who else someone whos not at the reunion doesnt want you here that makes no sense and im not letting you out of my sight until i know who that is i smiled at her determination to protect me from harm im six feet two a hundred and eighty pounds and exercise regularlycandace doesnt even come to my shoulders but i pitied the fool who crossed her if youre not letting me out of your sight hon whyd you ask for your own room i stretched out lazily on the bed allowing myself to relax for the first moment since setting foot on sangre island i ran a hand down her spine she squirmed away playfully slapping my hand away first i dont give a crap about appearances but second whoevers terrorizing you theyre not terrorizing me im not scared of that fool i interjected she forged ahead will be watching you like a hawk probably looking for a way to strike at you me being down the hall gives us another vantage point to watch over your ass when youre in your room that hallway is mine no ones going to get near your room without me knowing she swatted said ass when i stood and reached for her so youre baiting the trap with me and just me while you watch from a safe distance i teased something like that she pressed herself into my arms her breath was short and she began to trace a fine web of delight on my back with her fingertips i kissed her and the world seemed far away i wished this house was empty and it was only the two of us alone on this island surrounded by the comforting arms of the sea and that wed never heard of goertz millions gorespeckled letters or murdered sailors on a beach i thought id seengretchen wandering out from the house toward the scrubby trees that freckled the island but i wasnt quite sure it was her moving in the shadows of the branches tired of feeling like i was hiding away from my new kinfolks i felt vast relief when deborah knocked on our door and offered to escort us downstairs shed fixed up a room for candace just as promised her hug and her reassuring smile were so welcome i felt a pang of guilt for harboring any suspicions about her being my hatemail fiend we sauntered downstairs quickly to find that the promised cocktail hour had just begun i had thought that the rest of the family might have come knocking on our doors to meet me the latest curiosity but theyd minded their distance i felt miffed that even bob don had not been about to play kind introducer but he and gretchen had both absented themselves perhaps my arrival was not such a big deal after all but at my family reunions the family actually tended to gather feel like the christian heading toward the lions deborah joked as we went downstairs candace laid a hand on my shoulder behind me on the stairs a little i confessed dont be fretful deborah counseled i mean as families go were not soshe paused casting about for the correct adjectivebad i guess i suppose im just used to them ignore them if they get tiresome or threatening i silently added i put my smile firmly on wiped my damp palm on my khakis took candaces hand and followed my cousin deborah into my greatuncles large den i realized i wasnt exactly sure how she and i were cousined shed referred to the infamous sass as aunt sass there must be another sibling of bob dons that deborah was daughter to it was a handsome room that spoke of an interesting mind books lined the walls many worn with use a collection of globes lay scattered around the room so that the world always seemed in easy reach a stags head crowned a stone fireplace and its glassy eyes surveyed the assemblage drawings of old ships with careful calligraphied notations hung next to the stone fireplace a reproduction of a republic of texas battle flag hung in framed honor near the window complete with singed bullet holes bob don and gretchen were talking with tom in the corner we entered the room as tom nonchalantly announced debs gone to fetch thempresumably in answer to a question of bob dons i wondered if this was what a foster child dumped into a new family felt on his terrifying first day i could practically sense their communal gaze hone in on me go ahead look me over candaces other hand closed around my arm i knew she meant well but for a moment i wanted her to stand away these people would be my kin and i needed to face them alone which one of you charming folks sent me letters a man who had to be pushing one hundred sat bent in a wheelchair eyeing me with undisguised curiosity another man in his midforties lounged in a chair a glass of iced tea by his side he looked remarkably likebut not identical tocousin tom and i deduced he must have been the other twinphilipthat bob don had alluded to back in mirabeau the silence held for an awkward interval then bob don began earnest introductions well everyone this is my son jordan and his girlfriend candace he came and squeezed my shoulder with a reassuring hand lets get the introductions started where on earth is uncle mutt right here bob don a tall fitlooking fellow in his early seventies but radiating the vigor of a man half his age strutted into the den his hair was solid gray and still thick his eyes were a piercing green and he riveted them on me as soon as he entered bob don made a beeline for him real happiness lighting his face goddamn uncle mutt you look good uncle mutt extended his right hand and i could see it was mutilatedthe middle two fingers were cleanly gone giving his hand the look of a claw bob don enclosed the threefingered hand in a warm handshake that quickly transformed to a backpounding hug bob don you goat still got that car lot youre wasting your time with bob don laughed and i figured this was an old standing joke between them still selling most of the cars i can uncle mutt uncle mutt coughed dryly best damn investment i ever made he shot a pointed look toward the lounging man i assumed to be philip bedrich as opposed to some other ventures i could name toms twin fidgeted averting his eyes from the rest of us i felt a spike of tension jolt the room and aunt lolly stifled a nervous titter mutt nodded at gretchen how do gretchen fine uncle mutt im fine she smiled around at the gathering ive been sober for nearly a year now we wanted to surprise yall im sure surprised the old man in the wheelchair cawed aunt gretchen how wonderful deborah abandoned pouring margaritas at the bar and embraced gretchen in a hug oh im so pleased for you gretchen hugged back and tears of happiness filled her eyes i glanced away back toward uncle mutt he studied me with a frank stare so this is him so this is your surprise boy bob don my face flamed red im sure bob don stiffened yes sir this is my son jordan jordan this is your greatuncle emmett uncle mutt moved to me eyed me and then embraced me in a fierce bear hug he clapped me hard on the back i didnt really hug back lord son welcome to our family tickled to death to have you here hello mr goertz i said when he released me my usually laidback rasp sounding stiff and formal bob don has told me all about you only believe the stories that make me sound studly he took my chin in his threefingered hand and examined my face closely i didnt flinch away goddamn it youre a goertz all right got my daddys eyes you do and that thick blond hair i twitched and he released my chin patting me on the cheek i know bob dons real proud of you and its a pleasure to have you in the fold welcome to our family son thanks mr goertz he grinned dont call me that im uncle mutt and im mean as a junkyard dog when i get riled so mind your manners he seemed accustomed to barking out orders and comments without being crossed after giving my face another long appraisal he offered his good hand to candace my goodness boy you can pick them whats your name sweetheart i quickly introduced candace and saw the same glint of appreciation in uncle mutts eyes as id seen in cousin toms apparently the goertz men were roosters as if i hadnt already known that honey if youre as smart as you are pretty this boys made the choice of a lifetime candace blushed really the woman whod been a continual rock who seemed unflappable by all the ups and downs of our lives went red as a beet she ran a fidgety hand through a lank of brown hair i wasnt sure if she was flustered by the magnitude of the compliment or by the whole lifetime suggestion that lay underneath uncle mutts accolade or maybe it was simply uncle mutt himselfhis presence in a room was overwhelming no wonder hed been such a legendary ladies man so much for candace being on guard if jordans destined to look like you when hes older then ill have made the smart choice candace offered her best belle smile out of the corner of my eye i saw philip bedrich make a mockgagging motion uncle mutt guffawed squeezed her hand and punched me lightly in the shoulder you got you a live wire there boy all right i stand apologetic and corrected miss candace he took me by one arm candace with the other and introduced me to the rest of my new family and this is my nephew philip bedrich uncle mutt indicated the loosely lounging fellow on the couch dont give him money philip bedrich colored at the gibe but gave me a weak smile uncle mutts a bully but hes our bully youll soon grow used to his little tirades he didnt have the physicality evident in his twin tomhe wasnt heavy but his body was rounder softer and his indolent pose on the couch appeared practiced his clothes looked expensive but not in the best tastea showy gold necklace adorned his throat and his shirt was designed for a younger man a slow languorous drawl oozed from his mouth when he spoke i shook philips hand his palm felt flaccid against my skin i met your brother already i turned to indicate tom but hed left the library arent you lucky philip laughed dryly tom rarely opts to socialize with the rest of us were not smart enough for mr scientist scientist i asked toms an oceanographer spends days talking with fish philip sipped at his drink dont act so envious uncle mutt jabbed philip in the shoulder and turned back to me philips my special project right now in the training camp of life hes hit the bankruptcy court so often for gods sake uncle mutt thats private business philips face colored with anger and i felt embarrassed for him i resolved not to share any secrets with uncle mutt he apparently served as the family megaphone aint no private business involving my money in my house uncle mutt declared were all going to put our heads together to get you out of your mess philip i happened to glance over at the centenarian in the plush leather chair a wry smile accentuated his many wrinkles as he watched the exchange his spotted palsied hands wrapped around the head of his cane and his eyes glittered with intelligence thank you i dont need anyones help philip glared at uncle mutt that philip definitely remains to be seen uncle mutt steered me away from the fuming philip and toward the gentleman by the fireplace aunt lolly scurried to him and plopped sweetie on top of the light cotton blanket that covered his legs get that goddamned ratdog off me lolly the old man bellowed his voice reminded me of nails raking down a chalkboard aunt lolly ignored his request she stroked the old mans head absentmindedly and he flinched away in annoyance she leaned down and hollered in his ear uncle jake this heres bob dons boy and his girlfriend goddamn it lolly uncle jake bellowed back pressing fingers defensively against the cup of his ear i aint that deaf i can see clearly who jordan and candace are he offered me an arthritic hand how you son my sister mildred was your greatgrandmother he jabbed a finger toward mutt and lolly they aint her kids though praise god lolly slapped jakes shoulder playfullybut a little too hard for my liking she scooped up the offended sweetie in her arms uncle jake likes to remind mutt and me we aint his blood kin but we do all the takin care of him that he needs he forgets how kind we are sometimes a vinegar tone lay underneath her honeyed voice hmmph uncle jake said but he huddled down in his chair aunt lolly crossed her arms imprisoning sweetie and smiled beatifically at him i took a step backa sudden dislike of lolly throckmorton surged through me her bullying tone toward the old man riled me her sugary but hardedged voice reminded me of a candied applewith a razor hidden in it well well well a voice sounded behind us i turned and saw a tall buxom woman in her early fifties standing in the library entrance she was resplendently attired in a brightly flowered blouse with white jeans her hair was dyed a dark auburn her bright blue eyes were ringed with mascara under the makeup her face resembled a softened version of bob dons she came forward and pecked bob don on the cheek hello brother she favored gretchen with a smile bordering on distasteful gretchen darling dont you look lively today her smile rested on me this must be my new nephew she extended a hand how do you do jordan im your aunt cecilia goertz i shook her hand and introduced candace while gretchen trilled sass honey ive been telling jordy all about you and hes just so excited to meet you yeah i can see hes all atwitter over making my acquaintance she gave candace a dismissive glanceone woman boldly appraising anotherand turned her attention back to me so you going by goertz again sass philip bedrich called from his couch he sipped at his iced tea and sucked on the lemon letting the rind drop back into the glass after all you do have a plethora of surnames to choose from youll probably need to borrow a good name when you go bankrupt again philip ill loan you one with a good credit rating sass like the others gave my face and my body an unwavering assessment you got all my brothers best features honey did you get any of his brains bob don laughed hell he got your nerve sass just keep prodding him he can take care of himself i wasnt anxious to get into a battle of repartee with cecilia goertz she obviously had a nimble wit her eyes stayed locked on me as i fidgeted on my feet one polished nail rested against her chin tapping and i imagined it running along an envelopes seal securing a message of hate inside wheres aubrey sass i want him to meet jordan and candace uncle mutt said i dont know gettin in touch with his inner child or some such garbage sass sauntered to where deborah goertz stood by the drink cart and poured the last of the margaritas into a glass she sipped and hummed appreciatively she glanced over at gretchen wheres your pickmeup darling thought youd be parched after your long trip gretchen beamed with pride im sober now sass i havent had a drink in nearly a year sass ran a tongue along her lips i watched her watch gretchen apparently no congratulatory message was forthcoming from her sisterinlaw were all very proud of gretchen i ventured gretchen started in surprise but said nothing im sure you must be sass went over and kissed gretchen lightly on the cheek i hope it wont bother you if the rest of us drink im stone dry darling of course not gretchen assured her but i saw her gaze light on the glimmering bottles on the drink cart for the briefest of moments sass smiled thinly then wiped her fingers along gretchens cheek where she had kissed her sorry i shouldnt sip at that delicious margarita then kiss you i wouldnt want a trace of alcohol touching you darling gretchen didnt flinch she turned away after a moment and asked bob don for a dr pepper he hurried to pour her soda uncle mutt broke the embarrassed silence all right everyone get your drinks and lets unwind before dinner i got an announcement to make uncle mutts glare went to every face in the room announcement aunt lolly murmured to sweetie how exciting she didnt know the half of it where are the kids i asked aunt lolly after fifteen minutes of idle conversation with my new family silence crashed down like a curtain falling unexpectedly on actors in midscene aunt lolly paled and a hand fluttered near her throat smoothing out her skin kids what kids well at every family reunion ive been at theres always lots of kids underfoot i became aware of the uncomfortable quiet holding sway in the room uncle jake coughed the fleeting sense of acceptance and comfort id started to feel from the goertzes wisped away like smoke did i say something wrong i finally managed aunt lolly offered a fatuous smile oh no honey not at all you see deborahs not been able to keep a man and the twins are both divorced and aubrey well she didnt elaborate tom has a couple of kidsshe fixed a baleful eye on himbut he doesnt have much contact with them do you tommy not a good idea is it she took a long slow sip of her red wine tom bedrich didnt appear rattled by his aunts jeer no aunt lolly i dont im not sure how thats any of your concern though abashment colored my face listen tom im sorry i shouldnt have raised the subject would you bring younguns around this crowd uncle jake asked drawing his blanket tighter around his legs i sure as hell wouldnt foulmouthed and ornery they are and i dont mean kids anyone got a mirror for old jake philip murmured from the safety of his chair well maybe you and candace will marry and have kids aunt lolly offered she blew a puckered kiss at candace who stood talking with deborah and then you can bring them to the island for a visit wouldnt that be grand deborah excused herself and i saw a hot light of anger pulse in her dark eyes aunt lolly rocked back on her heels as though shed scored a point in a childs game the gathering had thinned sass had departed in search of her son bob don and mutt had excused themselves for several minutes and gretchen had gone for a predinner stroll i pardoned myself from the crowd and headed up to my room candace might have planned to play bodyguard all weekend but i believed in the direct approach id fetch the profane epistles id received and produce them at the dinner table make a stand and make it early whoever my correspondent was let him or her know immediately that i wasnt going to be cowed if the rest of the family was as shocked as i hoped theyd be id smoke out the culprit early and get on to the business of fitting in fitting in i stopped with my hands on the stair halfway toward the third landing did i really want to do that with this clan i liked deborah and mutt and felt ambivalent about the rest but for bob don i would have to make the effort i didnt delve into analyzing what my attitude meant toward my relationship with him i began climbing the stairs again but paused as i heard voices whispering below in urgency dont walk away from me im telling you you better do something now now aunt sass dont be silly hes not a threat a voice i didnt know male younger calm with a slow rasp of a drawl not unlike my own if you blow this i stayed still not daring to move chastising myself for eavesdropping youre overreacting as usual youve got way way too many emotional triggers the mans voice sounded weary as though hed repeated this conversation before with aunt sass i emboldened myself and thudded my feet along the stairs turning and heading down to the secondstory landing aunt sass stood frozen there talking with a young fellow around my age he had brown hair with the trademark goertz blue eyes a band of freckles across his nose invested his face with a boyish air his countenance looked oddly familiar in the way that an actor sometimes will on the late show you know youve seen him before but you cant place him i greeted aunt sass with a nonchalant smile that suggested that i hadnt heard a word of her demanded murmurings to the young man hi aunt sass youre sure you dont mind me calling you that of course not honey youre my brothers boy after all her lipsticked smile worked itself into broadness and i want you to meet your cousin this is my son aubrey keller aubrey this is bob dons longlost boy jordan goertz aubrey flailed my hand with an intense grip his smile lasered me i was under a mortar barrage of enthusiasm jordan absolutely great to meet you welcome to the family i returned his handshake with a little less verveafter all i wasnt fueled by a nuclear reactor and aubrey apparently was thanks aubrey its nice to meet you too but aunt sass my names not goertz its poteet poteet youre not using bob dons name her eyes narrowed and her voice fell back to a whisper no im not i answered trying not to sound defensive not acknowledging bob don i realized belatedly might seem boorish to my new relations i pressed onward my names always been poteet and i just decided to keep the one i grew up with seemed easiest of course she smiled again and i wondered if joy ever evoked her grin aubreys smile seemed warmer if a tad saccharine i wondered again where id seen him before excuse me i need to wash before dinner i pardoned myself and went up the remainder of the stairs i didnt tarry to find out who aubrey and sass were arguing aboutbut an unpleasant tickle at the base of my spine suggested it might be me id secreted the heinous communications in an interior lining of my suitcase i retrieved them and carefully placed them in the inside pocket of my seersucker jacket i brushed my teeth and combed my hair whatever big proclamation mutt had planned would be eclipsed by my announcement i wasnt about to be intimidated by bloodied hallmark cards id teach these folks to try to bully jordan poteet or perhaps i reflected i wouldnt have to make the accusations myself if i told uncle mutt whatd been happening hed explode and he could play bad cop hed even be more likely to spot the culprit than i would the goertzes were obviously much more likely to be browbeaten by mutt than by me i congratulated myself on the excellence of my idea unless they were one of those families that stuck together through sick and sin probably not given the sniping over cocktails i headed back downstairs to find that the gathering in the den had spilled out onto the wraparound porch where the family watched the setting sun turn the gulf waves molten with light the den had emptied except for rufus beaulac lolling in a chair drinking beer and watching a rangers baseball game on a huge television wheres uncle mutt i asked he waited until the batter swung and missed before he answered off in the kitchen helping the cook he giggled yeah hes probably helpin her slice and dice and juliennefry cant hardly lose no more fingers can he rufus was either well on his way to inebriation or fancied himself damn funny his comment produced a gale of laughter but only from him and which ways the kitchen he gestured with the beer can go back through the entrance hall the big dining room then to your left kitchens back there i followed his directions ambling through rooms full of antique furniture all arranged with a careful eye to give the entire house the rough ambience of a hunting lodge the dining room was large as befitting houses of its era and i gently pushed on the service door that led to the kitchen i saw them before they saw meuncle mutt talking softly his voice cajoling his hands on the soft shoulders of a young woman who was stirring food in a pot she leaned slightly back against him and laughed at his whisper no emmett i heard her say clearly her voice a sweet bell she could not have been over twentyfive i could not see her face but her hair was long and ebony tied back in a ponytail he laughed quietly and whispered again rubbing his palms against her smooth hips i could imagine the heat of her body she laughed leaning her head back against his shoulder as he wrapped both arms around her i stepped back out of the kitchen an intruder in a private moment letting the door ease back into place uncle mutt murmuring sweet nothings to a woman a third his age no wonder this family was so godawful tense and i thought i knew with a blush exactly what his momentous announcement might be supper was excruciating not that the food was bad hardly so the pork tenderloin was tender and delicately spiced the green beans freshly steamed and brimming with flavor the marinated carrots chilled and tangy the salad crisp the wines texasmade dry and flavorful but i expected a family dinner to be convivial a chance to laugh and hear timehonored stories that are customarily retold at these gatherings the web of love that meshes a clan together should shine at these moments even when relatives sometimes dont always get along the reunions on my mothers side of the family were long joined moments of happiness in my memory good food restless play with my cousins jolting laughter from the adults when id attended poteet reunions my cousins and i would often be convulsed in laughter remembering some anecdote connected to uncle bid or aunt pearl or cousin maggie the stories were never new and therein lay their charm you learn a lot from a familys laughter the goertzes were not one for familial chortles the clink of fork against plate remained the dominant noise i wondered if my own presence caused this recalcitrance after all i was like some rare zoo specimen to these people an actual love child bastardis goertzis a rare genus and species i told myself sure to be labeled and catalogued this oddity had teeth however after seeing uncle mutts tender embrace with his cook id opted to produce the letters myself to the gathering sated with food and wine as no one seemed to be picking at their dinner muchthey gobbled like wolves my admirer might be off guard after dinner then i resolved i permitted myself a smile which aunt lolly swooped on like an owl on a field mouse something funny jordan she purred her fork idling in her salad her eyes fixed on me bright and disturbing no not at all i smiled back bob don glanced at me so i broadened my grin im just happy to be here i took refuge in a fortifying sip of wine lolly sitting next to me rubbed the back of my hand and were all happy youre here too dear her lips narrowed in a malicious grin such a nice successful boy you may restore my faith in this particular generation of goertzes deb and aubrey have been disappointments havent you sugars i had no words to respond to her rotten prod at my cousins shed been downing red wine steadilyi wondered if she was a mean drunk aubrey and deborah sitting together on the other side of the long table both glared at lolly sass like a tigress leaped to her sons defense claws bared for battle aunt lolly i hardly think its fair to label aubrey a failure hes a published author that psychobabble claptrap lolly snorted the sweetness that had characterized her earlier ramblings was gone replaced by sourness the only amazing thing is that people lay down money to be analyzed from a page especially by someone who never attended medical school aubrey dear dont get me wrong were all tickled you got your cute little book published but dont you think its time you got involved in uncle mutts business leave the boy alone lolly mutt grunted digging into his tenderloin lolly apparently was immune to the power of mutts charisma i wondered how she could dismiss aubreys advice as psychobabble when she thought her dog was her husband reborn i didnt know aubrey had penned a book and searched my memory for his name i wondered if we had his text at the library i opened my mouth to ask him the title but didnt get a chance im not really interested in investment portfolios aunt lolly aubrey said i sat waiting for the next platitude but he stared down at his plate prodding a green bean with intense concentration i suspected this was an old battle aunt lolly tired of him and moved on to her next subject candace dear do you know any eligible bachelors were waiting still on deborah dear here to settle down and become an honest woman why is lolly so bitter i wondered tired of being jakes caretaker and why dont they just hire a nurse for him instead why put the burden on lolly candace attempted a salvage aunt lolly im sure a woman as pretty and smart as deborah can find her own dates deborah flashed a brief smile at candace and then turned her grin toward lolly lollyremind me when was your last date was that when the astronauts returned from the moon or when columbus sailed by ladies uncle mutt rumbled lets be nice lolly smirked at her niece you have to understand jordan i raised deborah after her father murdered her mother and then killed himself she and i just love each other to pieces we like to tease dont pay her any heed she sipped at her cabernetshe was the only one whod opted for red wine with dinnerand then ran a speck of tongue along her thin lips after her father murdered her mother no wonder bob don hadnt offered much family history i swallowed the lump of meat in my mouth and glanced around the table deborah quivered with suppressed anger staring at the remains of her dinner she did not speak bob don stared at lolly with smoldering fury leave my brothers name out of this aunt lolly he said his own brother was a killer i felt dizzy candace bit her lip and i saw her touch gretchens shoulder in support gretchen flinched as if burned by her touch lolly whats gotten into you thats enough uncle mutt tapped his finger against the linen scowling at his sister lolly didnt even favor him with a glanceshe seemed determined to make dinner a wicked affair deborah stared into her wineglass for a long thoughtful moment then glanced back at me i felt the tension rise a pitch in the room as though an untalented violinist had taken bow to string leave deborah alone sass decided to run her own brand of interference she pushed her plate away from her and downed a heavy gulp of scotchnot her first of the evening watch what you say lolly or aubrey will make you the most interesting chapter in his new book new book lolly asked her voice momentarily dulled out of the corner of my eye i saw both uncle mutt and my cousin tom stiffen philip studied his plate as though the secrets of the ancients lay exposed there aubrey looked stricken and he wadded his napkin into a ball his fingers making quick explosive jerks of anger he attempted a vague smile its just a followup to my earlier book slightly broader in scope he sounded like a blurb from the book catalogues i received at the library practiced patter perhaps not too dissimilar to the snippets of advice he continually offered slightly broader oh yes sass continued her voice rising the s in her assertion a long hiss broad as a barn its all about families wont that make it ever so much fun and guess which family hes going to scribble about i cannot imagine our family lolly bristled offers much grist for aubreys mill we are eminently normal arent we mutt always have been always will be she seemed amused i didn t get the joke uncle mutt made a huffing sound goddamn it aubrey why dont you turn your spotlight on someone else moms mistaken im not writing about this family in particular aubrey retorted im not writing a gothic for gods sake no one laughed outside i could hear the cawing of the gulls as they ferreted the surf for their evening meal hah sass laughed grist for the mill thats right aunt lolly well see she poked at aubrey with a brightly taloned finger can i suggest some chapter headings baby i think youve had quite enough scotch for tonight mom aubreys voice cooled maybe you should call it a night yes sass gretchen chimed in i couldnt miss the pain coloring her voice her buddy and idol was drunk and behaving badly i wondered if sass was an uncomfortable mirror for gretchen sass carefully set her glass down on the spotless white tablecloth and refilled it with a defiant splash oh not yet youll get a special chapter now gretchen the recovered drunk were all so proud of you youre the one acting like you should be in a twelvestep program tom shot bitterly from the end of the table what the hells gotten into you oh i just am so proud of my boy i want you all to know what a big success his next book is going to be isnt it sweetheart write a really big one and youll hardly need your mom anymore isnt that right aubreys face tensed in anger his brow furrowing hard mom dont yes gretchen shall have her own chapter unless she falls off the wagon in which case shell get two and of course philip and tom each merit a chapter for a thorough discussion of just how different twins can be or are they the twins reacted differently philip with an indulgent smile and tom with a frosty stare lets not forget uncle jake how about a chapter on old farts who dont do a single kind thing in their lives write about yourself then miss sass uncle jake retorted unshaken by sasss swipe i felt an acrid taste creep into my mouth something was terribly wrong here this wasnt teasing either from lolly or sass this was verbal flogging pure and simple and the rest of them appeared to endure the whip i couldnt see for the life of me why perhaps sass saw the revulsion on my face bob don and jordan certainly rate a discussion dont you think dear the longsuffering father and the unsuspecting son its so charming perhaps they can join you on oprah when you tour for the book brothers and bastards that makes for a good episode she laughed at her own joke brothers rich isnt it bob don stop it lolly sipped at her red wine again youre terrible youre making me feel ill with all these histrionics are you quite done cecilia bob don asked his voice low and implacable just hush now youre drunk and youre embarrassing yourself terribly you and aunt lolly both should be ashamed of how youve acted this evening i glanced down at uncle mutt after all he did seem to be the family patriarch and i expected a thundering fist on the table to demand dignity and decency at dinner he sat back rubbing one cheek with his disfigured hand he didnt seem inclined to stop sasss rave i wasnt even sure he was listening to her he seemed lost in his own world of thought id abandoned all plans to produce the hate mail the time was inopportune and the tension in the air already smothering at least one of us tired of the tirades deborah dabbed at her lips with her napkin murmured excuse me and stood sass watched her and i saw her face darken in regret deb hon im sorry sass began then her voice faltered deborah had not taken three steps toward the door when lollys words struck like a childs stone cruelly thrown and of course we cant forget our darling deborah while youre compiling chapters sass you should add a whole book of them for deb theres simply so much ground to cover with her lets see aubrey could talk about the family ingrate or the family basket case or the family embarrassmentor the family slut and for one brief second lollys eyes lit on gretchen i saw her smile crookedly for a moment then she returned her gaze to deborah my cousin stood by the door her fingers trembling in anger on the knob her dark eyes glowed with pure hate stop it aubrey bellowed he stood and poked a finger into lollys face how about your chapter the family tyrant were not little kids you can bully anymore or the family nut sweetie isnt anything but a dog hes not uncle charles come back to life you pathetic witch because why on earth would charles come back to vow the tortures of hell have to be preferable to your company lolly simply smiled back at him her grin brittle with rancor she drew a quivering hand along her brow uncle mutt finally spoke stop it lolly you too aubrey and sass if you make another sound ill cut you out of the will uncle mutt didnt need to yell the tone of his voice carried its own thunder and the squabblers fell quiet sass pressed fingertips to her eyelids and i wondered if she was already regretting her drunken outburst aubrey write all you want about dyswhatever families i dont give a green shit but i forbid you to write a word about anyone sitting at this table you understand me boy aubrey stared back at our greatuncle whos playing the family bully now uncle mutt you cant tell me what to do in my career uncle mutt exploded yall are like a bunch of kids bickering amongst yourselvesunruly contentious little brats i took umbrage at being called namesi for one had not raised my voice or done one thing untoward but i kept my silence and now i got to tell all yall how to act before i leave the room he stood and stared down the table at the upturned faces and for a moment i didnt doubt we resembled childrenwe all hung on his words and im leaving the room forever silence fell like the guillotines blade i heard the hollow whispering shudder of aunt lolly breathing hard next to me her rasp grated on my nerves and i glanced back at her her skin was pale as bone mutt let the quiet play itself out his gaze carefully came to rest on each of our faces he gave me a long considered look of sadness and i felt a thickness coat my throat im a dead man you see uncle mutt announced a moment of absolute hush was followed by a guffaw from aunt lolly i cant say she had a hearty titter but rather it was a giggle of sick disbelief she wiped the back of her hand across her mouth her fingers trembling no one else laughed deborah sagged against the door what the hell are you talking about emmett uncle jake wheezed he sat looking crumpled in his chair next to uncle mutt the older man put one withered hand over mutts as though to say dont joke with me son yall know i aint one to mince words i been to the doctors in houston i got brain cancer and its spreading i got maybe a few months thats all and i aint gonna have all of yall bickering and sniping the last time were together while im alive i felt shock and distress at this announcement but i hadnt known uncle mutt my whole lifethese people had i glanced across the table at bob donhis face was ashen i wanted to reach out to him in reassurance but he was too far down the table i kept my hands folded in my lap oh god uncle mutt bob don tried but couldnt speak oh uncle mutt no aunt sass finally seemed speechless the back of her hand was pressed against her lips and she shot a wild look toward aubrey who remained mortally silent next to me aunt lolly began to cry i took her hand not knowing what else to do she leaned against my shoulder she was a spiteful old witch but she was losing her brotheri couldnt help but sympathize with her why didnt you tell us before how long have you known tom bedrich asked his voice unchanged for a while he smiled at his family now now lolly dont cry yall needed to know so ive told you lolly ignored his calm plea for strength her nails practically dug into my neck as she shuddered with grief what doctors where did you go in houston we can get a second opinion deborah tried the next level of denial but it didnt work her voice sounded like a weak childs whisper naw honey i been everywhere i can afford second opinions from every doctor in houston im plumb mried out it aint gonna change nothing i just hope god takes me before my mind starts slipping away he glanced at lolly as is i might lose my sight eventually from it if i last that long he then smiled thinly and looked younger than his years i couldnt help but admire his bravery in light of the circumstances mutt was everything bob don claimeda real pistol if he was afraid of dying his family would not see it now the only fear in the room seemed to be our own there was a long hush broken only by lollys racked sobbing she finally pulled away from my shoulder her face damp with tears youll come back to me emmett i know you will just like charles did maybe youll be a nice kitty for me or a bird that sings pretty promise me youll come back to me wont you uncle mutt watched his sister with sadness i dont know lolly i think im nearly ready for a rest i dont got any complaints about my lifebut maybe a little more time would have been nice just a little more he cleared his throat i told rufus and wendy already you told your help before you told us aunt sass exploded her face reddened in anger i cant believe you told that drunken coonass and quiet uncle mutt bellowed he leveled a hard glance at sass you just hush about them sass rufus and wendy have been wonderful to me they live here they see me every day and not everybody at this table can make the same claim sass wasnt daunted and she ignored bob dons plea to calm down oh so we dont live on your stupid island we dont get as much consideration as the hired help i couldnt tell if anger or griefor a combination of both fueled her voice ive known rufus for fifty years hes my oldest friend sass gulped at her scotch i saw her hand tremble bloods thicker uncle mutt is it i wondered no one had embraced him they all seemed frozen sass continued and then to put that little tramp uncle mutts fist thundered down on the table hush i wont have you talking about wendy that way shut up right now mother aubrey ventured quietly i think we all need to take a rejuvenating deeplung breath dont you aubrey sass said slowly covering her face with her hands be quiet or i will slap the tar out of you i dont want a rejuvenating breath i dont want to deeplung anything shut up oh lolly moaned yall stop bickering i feel sick philip got up and murmured to his aunt no one else seemed overly alarmed by lollys illnessi wondered if she was the clan hypochondriac or perhaps they were too stunned after mutts showstopper announcement or no one felt particularly kindhearted toward her after her vicious monologue i was bothered thoughlollys hand was pressed to her chest and she kept blinking as though trying to clear her vision im sorry lolly i shouldnt have made it a shock to you uncle mutt stood wendy he called the young woman who had been in the kitchen with uncle mutt ventured out into the dining room i hadnt seen her since we started eatingthe superb dinner had been set out on the sideboard buffetstyle and wed all helped ourselves but there was no doubt that she would have heard sasss nasty comments she was stunning not in the casual way that some women are prettybut in a knockyoudowndead level of beauty the kind of loveliness that a man might see just once and remember for decades she was vietnameseher eyes brown and softly almondshaped the brows naturally delicate her skin perfect her hair a long dark lank that framed her impeccable face her lips were razor thin but strangely erotic she wore a simple tshirt dress with a stained apron she didnt look at sass who glared at her with undisguised dislike lollys not feeling well would you help get her up to bed of course mutt wendy answered her voice wasnt a musical onebut steelystrong determined intelligent she glanced at me as i stood supporting lolly ill help you i offered and lolly moaned collapsing against meand vomiting i didnt have time to react the warm sour effluence splashed over my clothes her hand struck the table hard and spasmodic and her wineglass tumbled over spreading a stain as red as blood across the immaculate linen i quickly lowered her to the floor turning her on her side so she didnt choke on her bile when the spasm was done she tried to gasp an apology but couldnt deborah pushed me out of the way and knelt by her greataunt she elevated her aunts head and yanked open lollys blouse and pressed her fingers against the older womans chest i cradled lollys head in my lap call hurry deborah ordered wendy dashed for the phone help me here jordan loosen her clothing keep her head up its going to be okay aunt lolly were on an island deb remember sass said softly she turned to mutt surely youve got a firstaid kit mutt nodded and hurried into the kitchen i watched stunned while deborah cleaned the bile from lollys mouth lolly jerked spasmodically murmuring oh my sweet charles oh my god oh deb you get away from me now aunt lolly youre gonna be okay youre gonna be okay deb reassured her but her eyes came up to mine and i saw a glint of panic behind the calm professional facade heart attack maybe her lips moved i felt my own chest shudder tom kneeling behind me rose and rushed to jake they spoke softly quickly and then tom bolted from the room i know cpr candace knelt beside us were not to that point yet deborah whispered im an rn lets get her comfortable see if we can calm her i glanced at the others gretchen pressed against bob don his arms wrapped around her philip and aubrey stood together stunned into stony silence sass stood apart near the window as though lollys condition might be contagious uncle jake wavered on his cane staring at lolly with a mixture of shock and sorrow oh god oh charles oh wheres sweetie lolly throckmorton moaned oh my blouse is open everyone will see my bra oh dear her hands painted figures in the air above her pleadings with her fingers candace closed her hands around lollys and held them tightly the thudding of feet heralded tom he stumbled into the dining room shock on his face a pill bottle in his hand and waved it back and forth its empty tom panted its gone wheres the extra bottle uncle jake no that cant be uncle jake coughed it cant be gonethats the only bottle what on earth i began digoxin jake called to deb and me its my heart medicationtom thought it would help no it wont too unpredictable deb said lolly stopped breathing i felt the shudder of her back against my knees i moved back and deb began the ritual of cpr uncle mutt and wendy ran back into the room at the same time her announcing that the coast guard was on its way from the station in port oconnor him lugging a small satchel with a red cross on the side he dumped the contents of the case open fumbling madly through them as though his sisters salvation lay among the scattered medications and bandages i saw his hands shake above the spill do something he screamed at deborah who still concentrated on lollys still form she did not look at her uncle and she pressed hard against lollys chest counting out her own cadence to keep her aunt alive but the end came quickly louisa goertz throckmorton heaved and turned red she spasmed and fell back against the floor as though drifting into sleep i heard gretchen murmur no oh no behind me and perhaps she was the next to realize that it was over i felt numb to the bone and reached for the back of a chair to stand i became aware that i reeked of lollys vomit surprisingly aubrey helped me up as though i were an old friend a smile of disbelief played along his face uncle mutt kept repeating no no no as though it were some incantation to turn back time wendy drew close to him and took his hand i looked over at bob don he stared back at me shock twisting his features into an empty glaze deborah and candace still worked feverishly over her deborah leaning on lollys chest only when candace touched her shoulder and said i think shes gone did deborah stop and listen to the silence in the throat and the chest despite the unpleasantness that had passed between them at dinner deborah began to cry softly over her aunts body i sank into ray chair a horrific quiet like the still of the grave permeated the house it was as though we were all frozen into place except for torn bedrich who quickly set down the empty digoxin bottle as if it scalded his skin nobody who has not been in the interior of a family can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be jane austen emma youre suggesting murder calhoun county lieutenant victor mendez tented his fingers and looked at me i felt a hot flush creep up my skin and just why would anyone want to kill mrs throckmorton im not sure she was the target i might have been my throat felt like dried papiermache i coughed and took a hard gulp of water justice of the peace tricia yarbrough sitting behind uncle mutts desk frowned and why would anyone want to kill you mr poteet she was a goodlooking woman in her late fifties chubby with smart brown eyes and reddish hair laced with a shock of gray i thought she seemed a tremendously good listener lieutenant mendez judge yarbrough and i sat in uncle mutts private office near the back of the sprawling house mendez and judge yarbrough had quickly appropriated the space from the stunned and grieving mutt to get each of our statements i was the last one to be questioned and apparently the first to suggest foul play at least thats how i read mendezs expressioninterested but slightly scoffing yarbrough seemed a tad more concerned mendez was only a bit older than me cleancut with nightdark eyes and rapidly receding hair otherwise his face was boyish a bit unformed like a pudding that hadnt quite set he was one of those men who never quite seem to shed their baby fatsome morsel of youth remains eternally on their face or frame he was professional to the point and i felt thoroughly intimidated by him not to mention my own emotional state at having had aunt lolly die right next to me i should have been trembling and incoherent instead i felt a vast numbness seep into my pores anesthetizing my muscles dulling my mind i realized suddenly i hadnt answered tricia yarbroughs question mr poteet judge yarbrough asked why would someone want to kill you lieutenant mendez decamped his tent of fingers and instead settled back further on uncle mutts sofa yarbrough tapped her nails against the glass covering uncle mutts desk ive been receiving threatening cards ever since i agreed to come to this reunion i said producing the cards and laying them on the desk in front of the justice of the peace mendez got up to eye them as well i let them look through the malicious missives in silence mendez carefully handled them with a handkerchief easing them out of the protective baggies i kept them in tricia yarbrough made a choked noise of disgust jesus h christ mendez finally mumbled he leaned back from the cards as if their hate was contagious he glanced up at me any idea whos been sending these a member of the family is my guess but i dont know who when i questioned your fatherbob don goertz right mendez rustled through his notes and i nodded he said hed brought you here to meet the rest of your family for the first time so youve never seen any of these folks before right thats correct i discovered last year that mr goertz and my mother had an affair and i was the product weve been getting to know each other and determine whether or notwhether i could accept him as my father my chest tightened what the hell was wrong with me id never spluttered while talking i believe someone in the family isnt very happy about me being recognized as a member why would that be mr poteet yarbrough asked please call me jordan her face didnt waver so i reckoned shed keep relations nice and formal anyway look at this place uncle mutts loaded to the gillshis net worth is around ten million or so i think someones unhappy with me being a potential heir ten million would be a lot to spread around the family anyway mendez mused yarbrough gave him a sharp glance yes it would be if uncle mutt is of a mind to be equitable and killing you would make mr emmett more equitable in dishing out the funds mr emmett i dont know i shrugged and rested my fingers against my eyebrows all i know is someone doesnt want me here and my aunt died unexpectedly right next to me i lowered my hands but i didnt look at mendez or yarbrough if you feel youre in danger mr poteet we can get you off the island yarbrough said softly ive asked the others to all remain here at the house until our investigations complete thank you but no id prefer to remain with mywith bob don i think hell need me now mendez leaned forward you know the lady mightve simply had a heart attack shed just been told her only brother was terminally ill i nodded and uncle jakes medication being gone i suppose hed just conveniently run out its digitalisbased doesnt that cause heart attacks i knew next to nothing about medicine but i could connect digoxin with digitalis even socould be suicide i understand mrs throckmorton wasnt entirely stable mendez sounded bored good lord victor yarbrough said ive known lolly throckmorton for years she wasnt crazy she seemed to have serious mood swings i offered when we arrived she seemed rather happy in good spirits but at dinner she was belligerent even abusive to the family neither blinked at my announcement still to kill herself in front of her family that seems wrong ive ordered an autopsy judge yarbrough spoke after a moments silence we dont have a medical examiner here in calhoun county so ill have lollys body shipped to austin we could have the results by tomorrow and if poisons involved how quickly could we know i challenged she shifted in her chair perhaps a little uncomfortable with my directness toxicology tests take longer to get sometimes up to ten days lets not get ahead of ourselves like lieutenant mendez says poor lolly may have just had a heart attack you said youd known her a long time judge did you ever know if she had a heart condition yarbrough tugged at her bottom lip no she never mentioned one but i didnt know before tonight that muttmr goertzwas ill either the goertzes arent a family to broadcast their private lives i detected a tinge ofpain sadnessin her voice then she became all business again you said the deceased vomited on your clothes wed like them for analysis as well of course stomach contents i thought so shes not dismissing the possibility of poison but i wondered how her apparent knowledge of the family might color her view of the case yarbrough looked tough and professional though mendez shifted gears so youre new to this family any impressions of them what kind of people do they strike you as i fostered a smile you both obviously know the goertzes how many people in your county are worth ten million dollars mendez didnt return my smile he leaned back in the creaky leather sofa just answer the question please jordan his use of my first name suddenly changed the air in the roomand i felt the need to vent and was glad mendez had picked up on my frustration fine somethings wrong here first i get these abusive letters then i get to sit through a dinner thats so thick with tension its practically on the menu lolly verbally attacks the entire family mutt tells us hes dying and lolly drops dead i shook my head i keep thinking this family isnt exactly knit together right somethings off in the weave so to speak and uncle mutt mr emmetts done lots of good works for folks in this county mendez interrupted his expression hardened theres no need to cry murder until we get the autopsy results i assure you if someones murdered his sister well find out who did it even if it was a family member i asked especially if it was a family member yarbrough interjected thank you for your statement jordan she gathered her papers up and rattled them into order mendez stood and gestured toward the cards id like to keep these for evidence i nodded and ill bag up my clothes for you let me know if you get any more threatening messages mr poteet mendez said the interview was over i stood to leave one questionare yall going to tell people my uncles dying mendezs eyes met mine and i saw sadness in them mr emmetts business is his own not mine as long as hes not breaking the law absolutely yarbrough chimed in real pain flashed across her face briefly as though news of mutts death was a physical prod to her i wanted to ask tricia yarbrough what mutt was to herbut i didnt i dabbed my tongue on my dry lips what i was about to say might make me a traitor in bob dons eyes but i couldnt hold my silence tonightat the dinner table aunt lolly mentioned thered been another murder in this family years ago bob dons brother killed his wife did you know mendezs expression told me he hadnt yarbroughs told me she had neither commentedi saw yarbrough give mendez one of those ill tell you later looks dismissed i left the room feeling just as ill as when id arrived i went upstairs pulled off my soursmelling garments donned a robe and hurried back downstairs to the front porch one of mendezs investigators bagged my clothes and gave me a receipt for them i could see a dark body bag being loaded on the coast guard helicopter lolly mendez came up behind me one of my men will be spending the night here mr poteet he gestured toward a compactly built officer who stood near the porch swing all spit and polish you let deputy praisner know if you need anything all right of course i paused your leaving an officer here overnight suggests maybe you dont think lollys death was of natural causes dont conjecture so much jordan leave that to us mendez turned abruptly and went back inside i stood for a moment watching the helicopter in which theyd placed lollys remains deputy praisner fixed a baleful eye on me i bade him good night and went back inside desperate for a shower as i passed mutts study i could hear his voice raised in anger followed by tricia yarbroughs calm alto mendez spoke a few indistinct words then mutt railed again i headed up the stairs suddenly and tremendously tired on the way up to my room i stopped by bob don and gretchens roomeveryone had turned in for the night dulled with shock over lollys death i knocked i heard someone shuffling out of bed and then the door opened a hair son bob don said opening the door and stepping outside he eased the door shut behind him but not before i saw gretchen curled into a fetal ball under the covers how you im fine okay how are you holding up he gestured at the shut door gretchens awful upset you can imagine he shrugged just cant believe that lollys gone just cant believe it his voice shook and uncle mutts dying he didnt finish his sentence he almost looked like a little boy his usually perfectly bigstyled blond hair a messy mop his blue eyes baggy with restlessness i reached out awkwardly for him i pressed my fingers against the fabric of his pajama top feeling the roundness of his broad shoulder beneath flesh of my flesh bone of my bone that was from some old poem about family wasnt it i am so sorry bob don so very sorry he touched the back of my hand with his own thanks son it means the world to me that youre here im so grateful i wanted to tell him about my conversation with mendezabout my fears about my suspicions about the hateful diatribes id received in the mail but i couldnt not now his grief was too fresh to bear further wounding morning would be here soon enough and i still reeked of lollys puke uh do you want to talk i offered i did not reach out to him often but i could hardly be reticent now i need to get some rest he muttered and broke away from my grip ill see you in the morning okay all right in the morning he retreated to the bedroom and shut the door i stared at the doorknob listening to the quiet of the old house my imagination made me hear a footfall along the darkened hallway and i hurried to the stairs to the comfort of my own room and a long hot shower from my bedroom window i listened to the waves lapping across the bay the helicopter had risen like a gargantuan bug several minutes ago arrowing toward land moonlight silvered the water making the windgusted swells resemble trenches of metal i thought again of those brave texans aboard the reliant their ghosts entombed beneath the waters i felt isolated i wondered for a brief moment if this was how someone surrounded by a moat felt if they didnt have a key to the drawbridge a knock rapped at my door and i murmured come in candace came in bedecked in cutoffs and a tshirt from the bonaparte county fair she looked absolutely adorable in them and i felt a grin for the first time in hours tug at my mouth hey i kissed her softly how you okay awful tired how are you feeling sweetie dont use that word please i shuddered candace clapped a hand over her mouth oh my god sorry i wanted to go a few minutes without thinking about aunt lolly horribly selfish of me but im only being honest i tried lightening the conversation look at you running around kissing boys at midnight it might be a family scandal you might get your own chapter in aubreys book now and whatever would dear aunt sass say she brushed a tendril of her chestnutdark hair off her face i dont care what that old biddy says what a terribly cold woman she is jordy she sat down crosslegged on my bed her own aunt dies and she hardly changes expression i shrugged people show grief in different ways you want to stay with me tonight after all is that how you show grief mister she smiled then frowned oh god i didnt mean that the way it sounded how are you really feeling sug i lay down on the bed and she cradled my head into her lap i closed my eyes i dont know what i should feel bob don seems shocked gretchens acting devastated i know that lolly was my greataunt but she came into and left my life in a matter of hours i dont feel sad so much as shocked she was pretty awful to deborah yes she was candace gently stroked my hair she didnt strike me as a happy woman i groaned poor old thing so you think she just had a heart attack candaces voice was measured i dont know the medical examinerll tell us i suppose i explained to her about lollys body being shipped to travis county for autopsy i closed my eyes again trying not to picture aunt lolly struggling her face turning purple with the effort to draw breath if she just had a heart attack why is a deputy spending the night on the island theyre certainly treating it as a suspicious death you arent the least bit curious i find it decidedly odd that uncle jakes heart medication was gone and aunt lolly has a sudden heart attack candace said great minds do tend to think alike cliches aside i didnt answer and she thunked me on the forehead with her finger i decided to play devils advocate just as mendez had done maybe we shouldnt see murder everywhere we look shed just been told her brother only has a short time to live besides why would anyone want to kill that poor old lady she wasnt right in the head as mean as that sounds she couldnt have been a real threat to anyone candace candace was quiet for a moment i dont know it just bothers me jake seemed awful surprised that all his medicine was gone okay lets say someone did poison aunt lolly who why it seems to me far more likely that she died over shock brought on by uncle mutts announcement than that someone slipped her a digoxin overdose and why wouldnt the rest of us be sick she ate and drank everything that we did thats not true candace said i think she was the only one who had red wine everyone else had white wine or beer or hard liquor except gretchen and aubrey who made such a big deal about being a nondrinker and me he and i both drank mineral water i bit my lip in thought youre right i wonder if the police know that they took what was left of her dinner and put it into an evidence bag candace said bluntly i saw diem unless they were just foraging for leftovers and theyll have her stomach contents to analyze this is insane i said she cant have been poisoned its just too crazy plus wouldnt she have been stricken a lot earlier it might not have affected her immediately candace argued i dont know how long it takes a medication like that to affect someone neither do you i did ask the justice of the peacewho seems rather friendly with uncle muttabout how long it takes to get toxicology results she didnt even blink when i asked i rubbed my eyes weary if lolly was poisoned the policell find out and then well all be questioned till were blue in the face i stood up leaving the warm comfort of her lap the breeze through the window felt as gentle as an angels kiss of course maybe lolly wasnt the target candace continued talking to my back did you tell the police about your hallmark cards from hell i related my conversation with victor mendez to her candace snorted so hes not making a move until he knows for sure whether or not it was natural causes its not an unusual course of action sweetheart the hell its not youve gotten death threats whats wrong with this man hes investigating a potential murder in possibly the wealthiest family in the county i shrugged i imagine he doesnt want to make any mistakes period assuming theres a link between my letters and lollys death is a fair jump on little evidence i turned back to the window watching the maze of stars shine over the bay i couldnt get lollys purpling face out of my mind i had seen death before by violence and i know its signature the eyes dimming of light the curl of the lip in shock and dismay that the final moments are here the pallid wetness of the tongue in the open cave of the mouth i wondered what uncle mutt thought of his little dramatic moment now candace stretched and crawled off the bed good night sug get some sleep ill be watching your room from down the hall i know you fancy yourself as the new emma peel candace but you need sleep too ill be fine i wont be able to sleep if im worried that youre not getting any rest i kissed her tenderly reveling in the warmth of her lips against mine someday i would be dead like lolly and whatever afterlife awaited me might not include the gentle pleasure of a kiss i broke the embrace and nuzzled the top of her head i love you jordan her voice was low against my chest her lips a gentle motion against my tshirt i love you too i think ill go down to mutts library and find me a book i completely forgot to pack one ill stay up and read awhile she slipped off toward her end of the hall while i tiptoed down to the staircase the house was dark the family had called it an early evening i saw rods of light beneath doors so i knew not everyone slumbered but we were all modestly tucked in i did not hear the sound of grieving from any room and i shivered the library was poorly lit one lamp casting an inadequate glow from a side table i felt a bit like an intruder so i didnt turn on the ceiling lights plus i didnt want to disturb the taciturn deputy praisner on the porch i moved toward one of the bookcases running a finger along the volumes nearly everything seemed to pertain to either texas history or true crime the latter category lacked any appeal given the days events but i paused looking down the spines of an entire shelf uncle mutt had amassed a rather fearsome collection of murder and mayhem i turned back to the history offerings i began thumbing through a thin biography of the republic of texass second presidentand my hometowns namesake mirabeau bonaparte lamar hello mirabeau i muttered to myself reading about you should knock me unconscious a voice boomed from a corner chair mirabeau lamar he was a right sorry man i nearly jumped out of my skin i reached over and flicked on another table light uncle mutt sat in a plush leather chair a glass of brandy nestled in his hand i realized hed been sitting silently in the near dark sorry boy didnt mean to startle you uncle mutts voice was low and raspy but mirabeau lamar was a turd he wouldve killed ever damn indian in texas with a snap of his fingers only smart thing he ever did was build the texas navy oh you didnt startle me i lied i just didnt realize that you were there i thumped the lamar biography against my hand suddenly at a loss for words you may borrow the book jordan he said softly ii i realized my entire vocabulary had deserted me i swallowed i didnt mean to be poking about in your library its just i forgot to bring anything to read with me and i couldnt sleep and so i i trailed off oh for gods sake you act like im radioactive boy you want to sit down and have a brandy with me uncle muttmr goertzim really sorry about your sister i dont want to intrude on your grief and im so sorry that youre sick my voice evaporated into the dark air youre not intruding son and i told you not to call me mr goertz im your uncle so you call me uncle mutt he mouthed his brandy rolling the liquid in his cheek before swallowing i dont figure weve done much to make you feel comfortable my god hed lost his sister tonight hed told his family he was dying and he was concerned for my comfort i wasnt sure if i felt touched or puzzled at his priorities but then i didnt know what a dying mans priorities were please dont worry about me ill be fine im sure im still a shock to yall weve faced far worse shocks as a family trust me and it aint healthy for a dying man to sit in the dark thinking about his death or anyone elses so youll have a brandy with me sure i sat in another comfortable reading chair facing him across a low coffee table he fiddled with glasses at a side bar and returned handing me a snifter with a generous dose of brandy he kept his face slightly averted as he offered me the drink i could see his eyes were rimmed with red and soft with grief i glanced away not wanting to embarrass him men dont want other men to see them mourn i swirled the amber liquid in the glass and sipped cautiously my tongue burned and an agreeable sensation began a slow exploration of my limbs good aint it its french uncle mutt grinned its very good i said i wouldnt know good brandy from bad but it certainly wasnt making me feel worse you think maybe your library could use these books mutt gestured at the shelves i aint gonna need them when im dead thats very generous of you i surveyed the depths of my brandy took another hefty gulp and when i looked up mutt was staring at me intently i glanced away in discomfort and he spoke i know im sorry son i havent seen you in a long long time and i just cant get over how much you remind me of other folks in our family ones that aint here with us no more long time but youve never seen me thats not entirely true you see jordan your father and i are about the only halfnormal people in this bunch and when you came along bob don needed someone to unburden himself on that was me he paused and watched the brandy in his glass ive known about you since the day you were born bob don never told me you knew your fathers not a man to admit that he needed a kind shoulder many years ago lolly and i visited him in mirabeau we went to a juniorhigh baseball game mirabeau versus smithville you played shortstop you didnt have a particularly good game and your team lost but bob don didnt care i could tell he was nearly bursting with pride just to watch you my throat felt heavy the brandy burned a pleasant trail to my stomach i remember that game smithville stomped us and i was fit to be tied you and aunt lolly were there sure were lolly didnt know about you though she just thought that bob don and i being men couldnt go three days without attending a sporting event he chuckled softly oh lord lolly didnt want to be at that game kept asking when it would be over but if shed known bob dons son was playing on that field you couldnt have moved her off those bleachers with a bulldozer good lord further words escaped me i closed my eyes recalling the game with the intensity of disappointment that only kids feel id missed a key grounder struck out twice and when id made it to third base the next batter had choked with bases loaded and suffered the final out of the game the walk to the dugout felt like miles my face had burned not only with the spring sun but with the humiliation of loss i never would have dreamed that blood relations i knew nothing about were watching me that entire time like visitors from another world scrutinizing a primitive race i gulped at my brandy which sent a long finger of fire down my gullet id felt a stranger in this housebut uncle mutt had seen me play ball hed known the truth about my parentage longer than i had hed been bob dons one confidant i opened my eyes uncle mutt smiled he had behind the bluster a kind face youre sure theres nothing they can do for you i heard myself asking in a strained voice the doctors arent always right i did not add my father who raised me had succumbed to cancer and the physicians had been unerring in their diagnosis and prediction of his death he dismissed my hopes with a wave of his brandy glass jordan im dying theres no two ways about it son my times come and i dont begrudge the fates their due i sometimes wonder if i wont go blind wont lose my sense of smell wont go crazy i aint in a lot of pain yet but when it comes they can let me have a little of the morphine im hoping im dead before it gets too bad he sipped again i figure ive had a good life i just wish lolly hadnt gone first im so sorry i didnt know what to say and the words sounded like an empty apology i know from my own experience conveying sympathy is one of the worlds hardest tasks how many times had people oohed their pity for my mothers condition meaning well but instead raising a bitter hackle within me dont need your sympathy or your pity i need my mother to be healthy again and no one can give me that im sorry i didnt have the opportunity to know lolly better uncle mutt he rubbed at his forehead as though massaging the memories i loved her even when she could be a trial she was stubborn and sometimes she and deborah clashed but she loved this family and shed have done any duty we asked i cant believe shes gone she mustve hid her heart condition the way ive kept quiet about my cancer it would be like a goertz i listened to the bass ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner before i spoke do you know why the deputys staying the night here mutt made a hissing grunt dadgum fool justice of the peace shes got to order an autopsy she says cause lollys death was suspicious since jakes medication was missing tricia yarbrough had the gall to suggestever so gentlythat maybe lolly took her own life ridiculous im sorry uncle mutt i could think of no other comfort to offer if he didnt care for tricias suspicions he certainly wouldnt cotton to mine id gotten the distinct impression tricia yarbrough cared about uncle mutt but he didnt seem to return the feelingsat least not right now my sister died of a simple heart attack and i probably sent her over the edge being all dramatic in announcing im sick christ he massaged the bridge of his nose not looking at me christ if she was sick i ventured carefully maybe thatd explain why she was in such a mood at dinner he glanced up at me quickly yes youre right normally lolly would never say the hurtful things she said tonight it was entirely unlike her she was devoted to this family she seems not to have cared for deborah i murmured i took quick refuge in a sip of brandy oh lord deborah lived with lolly after her parents died and that was a terrible mistake two women both all eaten up with griefthey turned on each other instead of supporting each other a closeness between those two was just not meant to be his thin lips compressed and he quickly moved to defend his sisters memory from his own description i wished you couldve known lolly better too she was a individual thats for sure her and that damn dog of hers she wasnt always quite that way lolly was a pistol in her youth a lot of fun a sweet girl but charles was her whole life they never had younguns and when he diedit wasnt long after deb had come to live with thempart of lolly died i think it was the chunk of the brain that must govern reason the remark might sound cruel but i knew he didnt mean it that way it was a bald statement of fact the kind i sensed that uncle mutt prided himself on lord knows she took mighty good care of uncle jake he seems rather independent still i said uncle mutt sighed oh lord you cant keep uncle jake down on the farm hes a lively one stays busy with his hobbies and got more pen pals than i can keep track of seems his specialty is gettin into trouble we had him in a nursing home for a while but he wouldnt ever let the lady residents or the nurses alone it just got easier to bring him on home and let family take care of family weve always believed in that it sounds very noble he nodded at me approvingly i dont want to sound caustic after poor lolly dying but im glad youre coming into the family jordan we need some fresh blood jake and i aint long for this world and sometimes i aint holding much hope for the next generations look at aubrey hes so boring he tapes the weather channel theyre not so bad im sure i said hell i know but what i say about the whole lot its the truth and those damned hounds are all after my money your money i asked good lord boy he laughed did you think i inherited this island hell no i won it ive worked damned hard my whole life i made enough money for rich folks as an investment counselor i ended up rich myself you cant hang out around the texas wealthy without some of their pennies and luck landing in your pockets i got money out the ass not to sound crass he laughed at his impromptu verse and those turkey vultures are circling hard he gestured toward the ceilingand our sleeping relativesthen downed the rest of his brandy he kept the glasss edge balanced against his lip his eyes shut in exhaustion if youre worried about me im no vulture i dont want any of your money i dont have a claim on it my face felt hot with indignation i wanted to say look uncle mutt someones tried to scare me off maybe because of your damned money i opened my mouth to tell him about the letters but the words wouldnt come i liked being with him talking to him listening to the cadence of his voice you got as good a claim on my fortune as anyone else maybe betteryou aint irritated me yet and i gotta give some hard thinking to my money now that lollys gone he shrugged im sure the folks upstairs realize by now theres one less heir to squabble with over the loot the force of his words hit me like a delayed drug reaction i nearly dropped my drink thats a horrible statement to make after your sister dies well ill be damned you got some gumption i figured you might not have much after i heard you were a librarian i set my brandy down on the table and i might have thought you were a nogood lazy gambler after i heard you won this island in a poker match but i shouldnt pay any heed to stereotypes he laughed again god i bet you were a little toot as a teenager did you have you some fun i tried not to be thrown by the twists and turns that seemed inherent in any conversation with uncle mutt i guess i did i was a pretty good kid though sure is a pretty gal youve got with you she good to you yes sir she is shes about the best thing that ever happened to me well theres nothing like the love of a good woman his eyes grew wistful i wont get none of that after im dead you probably only get lovin in heaven and im hellbound for sure only attention ill be gettin is the old devils poking me with their pitchforks i wanted to inquire about what existed between him and wendy tran but i didnt i felt less an intruder in this house nowor at least in uncle mutts congenial presencebut i didnt feel as though i could ask frank questions such as are you sleeping with a woman young enough to be your granddaughter just not done you know i started to tell him how candace and i met when a slight bump came from the direction of the halfclosed library door uncle mutt raised his hand gesturing me to continue talking and began tiptoeing toward the door i hesitated only for a moment then continued feeling selfconscious well candace was my assistant when i started at the library but she doesnt work there anymore she bought a cafe along with my sister arlene and they run it together at that point uncle mutt yanked the door open philip bedrich nearly fell into the library tottering for balance he pulled his bathroom robe close about him ooops philip managed to sputter sorry uncle mutt didnt realize anyone was in here i was just on my way to the kitchen you know where the kitchen is philip mutts voice sounded stern and reproachful wellphilip took a conciliatory step into the library i thought i might get a book to read i couldnt sleep thinking about poor aunt lolly so iwell hello jordan i didnt know you were down here right uncle mutt coughed i dont approve of eavesdropping on private conversations philip i should say not philip agreed and if i see anyone in this house sticking an ear to a keyhole you can be sure ill tell them you dont condone such behavior that bandage loosely applied philip turned a beatific smile on me how kind of you cousin jordan to offer solace to uncle mutt i dont mean to interrupt your visit let me just fetch a book you should be careful sneaking around cousin philip i offered dryly theres an armed cop on the porch he looked like he might have a twitchy trigger finger to me philip ignored my jab sidled to the bookshelves and began a detailed perusal of the offerings uncle mutt regained his seat the books on personal responsibility are on the upper shelf philip reading those should cure your insomnia if the barb stung philip he didnt wince i actually wish i had more time to read all these books on texas history its a fascinating subject has mutt given you his lecture on the illfated reliant jordan it can keep one entertained for oh just countless hours upon hours philip didnt seem concerned about sucking up before any new wills were drafted little asshole i heard uncle mutt whisper rolling his eyes i glanced over at philipand saw him deftly pull a book from the folds of his robe and slide it back into its place on the shelf i didnt let my gaze linger as he glanced back at me ah heres a good one philip waved a nondescript tome i could see knights on the cover a nice book on european history thatll do the trick he drew close to uncle mutt you holding up okay uncle anything i can do im fine philip thanks for your concern uncle mutt answered his voice tight go on to bed get some rest i dont mean to be short with you im just tired i know philip said his voice a bit softer get some rest uncle mutt good night jordan i ignored the slightly snide tone his voice had taken in bidding me farewell philip didnt like me one bit i surmised uncle mutt was silent until we heard the soft tread of philips footsteps on the stairs id best get to bed jordan i got to go into port lavaca tomorrow and start the arrangements for lollys funeral god i didnt think id be burying anyone else before me would you like me to go with you tomorrow a soft smile touched his face and for one terribly naked moment i saw my own face in his no jordan but i appreciate the offer maybe you can keep my relations from robbing me blind while im gone i didnt want the conversation to end quite yet did lieutenant mendez say anything more aboutabout the investigation mutt shook his head just have to wait on the autopsy he says his eyes narrowed at me why you know something you aint sharing son yes my voice sounded miserable i told him about the cards the vicious messages theyd conveyed and my discussion with mendez and yarbrough mutt didnt speak his hands cupped before his face i felt desperately afraid id driven myself out of his budding affections he took a bracing breath are you suggestingto the policesomeone wanted to kill you and killed my sister by mistake i dont know if lolly didnt die by natural causesi mightve been the target would anyone want to kill her no no there is no murderer in this family no son no uncle mutt if anyones killed here tonight its me breaking the news like that i couldnt be subtle i had to be as loud as a fart in church i brought on lollys heart attack you cant know that uncle mutt dont do this to yourself he didnt speak for a full minute youve met the family now who do you suspect of sending you those cards i dont know his mouth worked but no words came out i want to see these letters i gave them to lieutenant mendez and i want to know why the hell lieutenant mendez didnt inform me about the threats to a member of my family i believe ill phone him now ill do that from my office good night jordan but uncle mutt for the second time that evening i was dismissed from a conversation good night jordan his scowl softened get some sleep and rest assured no harm will come to you while i live in this house good night i said im just going to pick out another book in case i dont like this one i proffered the lamar biography after all like you said he wasnt much fun he grabbed me into another of his bear hugs his breath warm against my neck i felt his shudder of exhausted grief the sadness he wouldnt truly share with any of us he released me without a word and left the den i didnt dawdle i went straight to the bookshelf to see which volume philip had so secretively and dexterously replaced the book bitter money was notched carefully back into the heart of the truecrime section i remembered bitter money being a bestseller ten years ago the lurid tale of a noted new york financier whod murdered his socialite wife it was the kind of torridly written saga that was the literary equivalent of driving slowly past a fatal car collision i opened the book and scanned the copy on the inside of the jacket yes of course the eminent banker had poisoned his wife of thirty years with a deadly overdose of her own digitalisbased heart medication my dreams were unkind in the darkness of night and slumber i swam through the shattered hulk of the sunken reliant the current piloting me along i drifted breathing the murky water like air among the tattered corpses dressed in makeshift uniforms one revolved toward me in the ebb of moving sea and i saw with horror the decaying face was uncle mutts i jerked away from the sight and the corpses began to close around me in an icy fellowship i could see their faces clearly nowa misshapen deborah jake his countenance pecked by fish a oneeyed sass and worst a bob don who looked like a demon from some nether region the lower half of his face rotted away his arms stretched out to me in an obscene embrace and i roused from the nightmare with a shudder i felt the momentary disorientation of waking in an unfamiliar place then remembered where i was and the contorted look on lollys face as she died i was thirsty but a small boys fear held me and i didnt want to get up from the bed to venture into darkness i suddenly missed my parents very badly finally i fell asleep again the bedding wrapped around me like a shroud i awoke with the sun rather than concentrate on my disturbing dream i set my mind to replaying philip stealthily replacing that book about digitalis poisoning among its less meaningful colleagues had i made a mistake what if id spotted the wrong book but i didnt think that i was wrong i thought dear cousin philip might have some serious explaining to do but i had no proof borrowing a book wasnt a crime the first rays of dawn shot through my window and with no candace to snuggle up to the bed seemed a cold place i pulled myself up donned a pair of shorts and a longsleeved tshirt and stumbled down to the kitchen in search of caffeine i wasnt the earliest riser in the house i found wendy bustling about in the kitchen getting ready to prepare a large breakfast for the family food always seems so inextricably linked with death i remembered vast buffets of food brought by neighbors when my father died but there were no neighbors on sangre island did anyone else share this familys grief i knocked timidly on the door id already opened i had met her very briefly last night but wed hardly exchanged more than hellos good morning wendy i dont want to disturb your work i just wanted to get some coffee oh hi cmon in she said her voice sounded tired as though she hadnt slept well i saw shed already poured herself a large cup of creamlaced coffee and a cigarette sat burning in an ashtray a plume of smoke rising from its cindery end did you sleep okay jordan not really i started looking in cupboards for a cup wendy quickly produced one an oldfashioned big white mug she filled it for me offered me cream and sugar the rich comforting smell of french roast wafted over me like airborne nectar the beach is beautiful in the morning if youre of a mind for a walk and this is one of the nicest times of the year to see all the wildflowers she said i wasnt sure if that was a polite way of ushering me out of the kitchen but i didnt want to leave thanks but if you dont mind id like to stay here and drink my coffee suit yourself wendy sat back down at the table took a long draw off her cigarette and sipped at her coffee she regarded me with frank eyes i remained quiet sipping at the hot brew she hadnt seemed inclined to engage in idle conversation but since id made myself comfortable she deigned to speak hard day for mutt ahead i think he has harderand fewerdays ahead i pointed out wendy stared down at her coffee each day brings us one day closer to our deaths hes not going to think much about his own problems today dying people still grieve she shook her head and took a long draw on her cigarette i thought her too young to have such a dark outlook but i had no idea where life had taken her her journeys might have been far tougher than mine hes a good employer i kept my voice neutral the best hes been a kind friend to me and i will miss him terribly when hes gone she stubbed out her cigarette and quickly lit another i dont usually chainsmoke but these arent usual days i studied her over the rim of my coffee cup she puzzled me she didnt speak with a noticeable vietnamese accent and she didnt have an easy southern drawl like the rest of the household id wondered if she was from one of the hundreds of vietnamese families that had settled in fishing towns along the texas coast i ventured forward with dark humor i guess not an illegitimate son turns up the family patriarch announces hes terminally ill and his sister dies if this is usual get me the hell out of here she didnt grin and i saw her face was vacant of the wear of laugh lines wendy tran suddenly struck me as a woman who would smile sparingly im curious she asked just why are you here bob don says youre his son but you dont seem to act like a father and son yet were not quite there yet i stirred my coffee i figured he hadnt acknowledged you before because you were too embarrassing to him you must not know bob don well i countered hes a very fine man i felt a quickening anger fill my face how dare she sit in judgment of bob don im here because i do care about bob don he asked me to come so i did wendy didnt comment immediately but got up refilled her cup and offered the pot to me i shook my head i seem to have hit your sore spot she observed without further comment i had an uncomfortable feeling that said sore spot had been filed away for future reference i take it you dont care much for mutts family i bludgeoned back in response i shouldnt have felt ticked at her but i did she glided back to her chair and sat down curling one leg beneath her it doesnt matter what i think of the goertzes theyre mutts family hes my employer my charming aunt sass wasnt kind toward you last night sass drinks too much and what she does is of no concern to me wendy poured a dollop of cream in her coffee and watched the milky swirl for a moment before destroying it with a vigorous stir of her spoon do you think i would pay one bit of attention to anything that woman says my personal opinion was that wendy would not forget a single utterance against her even if her implacable face never gave a moments reaction i didnt venture that opinion however i glanced up to see that she was carefully studying my face as though cataloguing each individual element in it she caught my eye and didnt blink or look away i took a comforting sip of coffee how long have you worked here about a year i was working as a cook for a caf in port lavaca and i hated itit was a disgusting greasy place mutt came in one day had my meat loaf for lunch and offered me a job on the spot are you from the coastal bend originally no from here and there i wandered around a lot as a kid she stood if you dont mind i need to get breakfast started ive got biscuits to make and jake likes his orange juice freshsqueezed sure i said taking the hint i quickly refilled my coffee and left wendy to her work i found the study deserted and used the phone to call sister hows it going was her first question i explained the nights events interrupted only by sisters occasional oh my lord when i was done she sputtered well when do yall get to come back home dont know depends on what the autopsy shows i cant figure it out sister the authorities here know mutt goertz know his familyand seem to think that maybe somethings up i cant put my finger on it come home she said immediately they cant possibly think you had any involvement with this you dont even know these folks sister i cant bob don needs me and anyway none of us can leave the county until the autopsy results are back so says the justice of the peace this wasnt a good idea sister blurted i knew it wasnt you were all for me coming here i fumed at least you were after you and candace confabbed in the cafe well she sounded shamed candace told me that bob dons uncle was awful wealthy and we decided it couldnt hurt for you to get to know him her voice trailed off sister i cant believe this oh for gods sake we didnt mean any harm we just figured it was just as easy to love your new family if they were rich instead of poor dont get your drawers in a knot and be mad at me dont be mad at candace i promised her id call back soon assured her again we were all fine and hung up good lord id thought candace had unblemished motivations in encouraging me to take this trip she and i were due for a little chat when she arose this morning i ambled out to the porch i heard a voiceunmistakably uncle jakes raspy whine at the corner of the wraparound porch to the left of the front door aubrey had settled uncle jake down into a highbacked wicker chair or at least i thought jake was settled down no sooner did i step out onto the porch than jake whacked at aubreys whitetrousered leg and bellowed goddamn it aubrey let me be youre fixing to give me a spell aubrey wasnt put off by a smack with a cane i saw he was also holding the bereaved sweetie close to his cheek and he cuddled the hapless chihuahua closer thats okay uncle jake give in to your anger youve lost your primary caretaker and im about to lose the most irritating relative god gave breath to uncle jake poked at aubrey again i dont want to hold sweetie right now and i dont want to get in touch with my wounded self or whatever blather it is youre spouting i want you to leave me alone thats it uncle jake vent then breathe then vent again aubrey i came up and gently touched his shoulder lets not get uncle jake excited hes got a heart condition remember yeah and no medication uncle jake added are you trying to shove me into the grave aubrey he palpated his hand against his chest as though suffering from the vapors uncle jakes heart condition aubrey answered icily is that hes forgotten what it is to have a heart thffffffffffffft uncle jake replied with his lips and tongue and dentures uncle jake you always hurt those who try to help you aubrey crossed his arms squeezing sweetie protectively the little dogs eyes rolled aubrey youre a pain let me sit here and enjoy the morning i probably got fewer than a thousand of em left to savor you aint helping my mood cause i didnt sleep well sleeplessness is common in a loss like this aubrey said especially when one is in denial of grief why if youd just let yourself cry uncle jake youd dream with the angels somebody gonna be acquiring angel wings real soon uncle jake replied listen yall i demanded they glanced at me with real surprise aubrey why dont you go get sweetie some breakfast im sure hes feeling lonely for lolly and i know hed respond to you paying him lots of attention aubrey mulled over this new opportunity for therapy murmured a polite what a wonderful suggestion cousin jordan and retreated from the porch the unfortunate sweetie in tow well aint you a smart one uncle jake chortled better that damn dog than me have to suffer aubreys foolishness he leaned back in his chair and sighed oh that plumb wore me out im feeling a tad peaked do you think you could go fetch me some orange juice nephew his voice had taken on a whine i freely admit to not caring for but i wasnt about to deny an old man his morning pickmeup even if i suspected his use of an endearment toward me was just to propel me faster toward the kitchen sure uncle jake ill be right back i ducked back into the house found wendy hadnt started on the juice yet fixed it myself with fresh oranges and brought a glass back to uncle jake he snatched it from me as soon as i handed it to him took you long enough he snapped downing half the glass in a long swallow well those oranges dont squeeze themselves i responded a bit peeved i dont mind doing jobs for folks but i at least like to be appreciated i reminded myself that aunt lolly had nursed jake and that he needed watching over uncle jake watched me over the pulpsmeared rim of his glass his eyes were a dark hazel framed with sagging flesh his mouth worked as he wiped the bits of orange from his teeth with his tongue his face was gaunt and narrow i thought he must have been looselimbed and athletic in his youth you ever in the military boy no sir im a world war one vet whaddaya think of that huh its very impressive you know what it makes me boy hard to kill i blinked and leaned against the railing excuse me im a tough old fart dont forget it i certainly wont is there a reason why youre assuring me of your indestructibility god now you sound like that clown aubrey sorry im just trying to follow the path of your conversation he snorted just setting the record straight now that lollys gone and muttll be gone soon i aint gonna go into no dadburn nursing home i got years ahead of me still and i done made enough sacrifices for this family he glanced off toward the horizon as though to reassure himself that death wasnt charging forward to claim him early having already scooped up lolly i shivered and he saw it his eyes appraising me with cold calculation you lived here with lolly is that correct i asked yep for the past four years before that we lived over in corpus christi im sure mutt will want you to stay here i said reassuringly i could understand his fear i have my own horror of nursing homes from the time when my grandfather was forced into one our visits to him were painfully brief a stench of guilt pervaded our family every time we stood and tried to make small talk in his dormitorylike room we felt suffocated there but what we felt could have only been a fraction of his suffering he had loved and given and provided to us for his entire life and the last years of it were spent rooming with a toothless crazy man from la grange my grandfather ate food cooked by other people watched tv with folks hed never seen before spent his nights staring at the ceilings lonesome for his own kin hi youre sick and old and we dont need you anymore so in you go to the human junkyard papaw i hate those goddamn places hell him gone lolly gone sass and bob doni stick me in a nursing home faster than you can spit theres plenty of money uncle jake maybe they could provide you with a livein nurse and why havent they before why did that burden fall on lolly when mutt could easily hire a nurse for you i kept my musings to myself they aint gonna do me no favors uncle jake stared out at the whitecaps dancing across matagorda bay always thought id be the first to go less lolly went and killed herself you think lolly committed suicide he shrugged cant say that to muttwho wants to figure that their baby sister killed herself but she was slowly going crazy getting as nutty as a fruitcake i dont understand he squinted at me in the morning brightness hell boy were you deaf last night didnt you hear her lay into most of the family i thought what that she was just meaner than eight acres of snakes he shook his head in silence lolly never cottoned much to deb or gretchen thats true but as of late shed started turning on the whole family talking crazy talking wild never made no sense she used to kid about that dog being charles come back to her but i think shed truly begun believing it he stared off at a bird swooping low over the bay thats a brown pelicanwatch him dive the pelican suddenly swooped into the water swallowed its catch and flapped back into flight jake watched the bird with pleasure they nearly died off in the sixties round bout here but theyre survivors just like old me i steered the conversation back toward lollys eccentricities you said she was getting less stable were you afraid she might take her own life he watched the brown pelican soar toward the beach well lord no not really else i wouldve said something to mutt but he didnt look at me while he made this statement i suppose you wouldnt have any reason to keep quiet if you were afraid for her i said softly he harrumphed listen sonny lolly was a right pain but she took care of me pretty good and she was family i didnt want to see nothin bad happen to her he coughed but now that shes gone i just gotta make sure that i aint stuck in no home people die in those places and wouldnt surprise me none if i got another good ten or eleven years to live long as mutt takes the time and sets aside the money to make sure im cared for and that none of them dadburn relations of mine can touch that money or dump me someplace i dont want to be ill be as fine as frog hair he smiled at me and there was little joy in his grin youre a nice boy aint you put in a good word for me with bob don and maybe sass of course i found myself suddenly wanting to be free from uncle jakes company his tone of voice lingered between cajoling and threatening im not cowed easily but a malevolent air hung about the old manin the devious sparkle of his eyes the creaky grin the discolored teeth god what kind of care did lolly give himhis dentures really needed a good scrubbing i stared back into his murky eyes and wondered if id caught a glimmer of thought get the mail i sent you boy i blinked my imagination was running rampant id surely appreciate it downing the rest of his juice he handed me the empty glass you think you could fetch me some more of that sure i answered you want anything else he shook his head and i turned to leave i paused at the door can i ask you a question uncle jake i reckon he peered up at me shading his eyes with his palm your heart medication bottle was empty when tom found it were you running low we need to be sure we get you some more digoxin i appreciate the concern jordan but you dont got to worry mutts getting the prescription refilled while hes in town today oh well good i guess you have to keep a careful eye on how much digoxin youve got left nah he huffed i just left that up to lolly she brought me the medcine my only job was to swallow now how about that juice a fellow gets parched sittin out here watchin the water ill get you your juice i said but if you dont want anything else i think ill take a turn around the island dont go jake said his voice came close to imploring this island aint made for wandering about i always think it has a smell of death in the air i froze by the door isnt that a little melodramatic he gestured toward the spit of sand by the dock you see that beach thats where them mexicans slaughtered them boys slaughtered boys i heard my voice ask jake smiled with the glee of a naturalborn gossip yeah right down there when it became obvious the reliant was sinking the texan captain stuck all the youngest crew membersmost of em just teenagersinto a dinghy and sent em onto the beach the mexicans corralled them after the reliant had gone down and cut those boys throats every last one his eyes glimmered at the thought thats why they call this island sangre for blood they said the blood ran so thick on the beach you could hardly see the sand i suspected the account was an exaggeration but i felt a cold tremor at the image thats horrible whoever told you uncle jake wheezed that this island was a nice place speaking of death i began what about what aunt lolly alluded to last night that deborahs father killed his wife then himself bob don never mentioned that his brother was a murderer would you jake snapped god youre dense id tell my son i snapped back my time with this unpleasant old man wore my nerves thin well we aint like you uncle jake turned back in his chair to stare out at the beach you gonna fetch that juice or not uncle jake please tell me no he glared back at me no boy any of this familys shame aint your concern if you think it is you best get off this island and never come back and jake zimmerhanzel turned his back on me to watch the eternal ebb and flow of the sea breakfast was a far more subdued meal than dinner and i felt sick relief when the final fork clinked against the last plate sasswhose hangover was apparent in her tired faceapologized for her sharp tongue the night before i behaved terribly and im sorry she tried desultory chitchat but when aubrey shepherded the conversation toward his theories regarding group convalescence from emotional trauma she shushed himand everyone else stayed quiet wendy obviously knew how to cook to texan tastes migas eggs scrambled with salsa crisp bacon hash browns grits topped with a decadent amount of butter and homemade biscuits as tender as a poem i was horrified at my appetite considering the tragedy of the past day but i was hungry and saw no point in pretending that i wasnt candace didnt make an appearance and i felt unease at her absence gretchen who looked as if shed hardly slept saw that i was disconcerted she assured me shed checked on candace who was sleeping late bob don took a seat next to me gently squeezing my shoulder in greeting i wanted to ask him about uncle jakes statements but couldntthis was neither the time nor the place the only noise for a long while was the murmurings among the family the ping of fork against china the soft slurping of coffee i watched uncle mutt survey the gathering like a lord eyeing his serfs a palpable sense of control flowed from him and his eyes were now clear and unmarked by weeping hed lost his sister he was dying himselfbut he seemed hewn of rock stable in any tempest that might arise i felt the force of his own personality intruding on the edges of mine no wonder he was the undisputed patriarch i found myself unable to look at him for long a glance told me he was watching his kin and i wondered if he was divining which of themif anymight be responsible for the threats mailed to me is that deputy still here sass asked idly buttering a biscuit yeah i offered him some breakfast but he declined never heard of one of them praisner boys passing up a meal uncle mutt answered an embarrassed silence followed couldnt blame him seemed the unspoken sentiment after all we might have a mad poisoner in the house the thought even if hanging in the air above our heads didnt seem to dent appetites bob don sat next to me during the meal but he didnt respond to my icebreaking overtures i felt a sick worry stick my heart what was going on with him with this family im heading into port lavaca this morning uncle mutt announced and im going alone i got to see to lollys funeral arrangements she asked in her will to be cremated and to have her ashes scattered into matagorda bay im going to have a memorial marker put up for her in the family cemetery here on the island well have the service as soon as we get herremains back from the travis county coroner mutt wiped his mouth thoughtfully with his napkin i assume youll all stay for the service now uncle mutt none of us brought funeral clothes sass admonished you gonna head all the way back to houston sass hell wear what you brought lolly didnt stand on ceremony aint gonna make a bit of difference to her uncle mutt sass replied one sculpted eyebrow raised theres a wrong way and a right way to do things it would be disrespectful for us to scatter poor aunt lolly all looking like a bunch of beachcombers well all need to head into port lavaca to get some clothes sass youve always worried about every meaningless thing under the sun thats how you acquired so many husbands mutt said sass opened her mouth to retorti saw a clear glint of indignation in her eyesbut she opted for diplomacy sorry uncle mutt i know youve got plenty on your mind as is and i didnt mean to speak harshly he softened as well if yall want to go into town and buy black clothes or whatever feel free but thatll keep till i get back why cant we go with you uncle mutt or take the other boat deborah asked plaintively i agree with sass we want to look nice for poor aunt lollys funeral poor aunt lolly after the verbal beating deborah had suffered at her aunts hands i watched my cousin cast her eyes down toward her plate her fork trembled as she poked at the remains of her eggs because i said so deb you can go into town later he stood and walked out of the dining room hollering at rufus to make sure the boat was ready for him to take well sass exploded safely after uncle mutt had left and could be presumed to be all the way down to the beach if this dont beat all uncle mutt is obviously becoming mentally impaired due to his unfortunate brain cancer one only wonders what other dreadful lapses of judgment await us she drummed long painted nails on the tablecloth watching as wendy began clearing away the dirtied plates of course why dont we all retire to the study to discuss the matter id prefer not to debate family issues in front of mutts domestics honestly sass dont be such a rotten snob bob don snapped real irritation tingeing his voice excuse my sister wendy she mustve left her manners on the mainland i dont pay her any heed mr goertz wendy answered primly removing the plates from in front of deborah and me youll have to soon sweetheart sass purred changes await us all wendy ignored the jab and went into the kitchen noisily dumping the flatware in the sink she didnt return sass you should be ashamed bob don stormed i believe bob don to be one of the most eventempered men i know but anger colored his cheeks why do you loathe that poor girl so i wonder aubrey offered delicately why youd take up for some stranger and attack your own sister uncle bob don perhaps youve got some unresolved childhood rivalries youd care to discuss bob don gave that comment all the consideration it deserved he kept his gaze firmly on his sister well aunt sass would say no more in the dining room but she herded bob don aubrey philip gretchen and me into the library tom had never appeared for breakfast and deborah had joined uncle jake on the porch i suddenly realized this gathering smacked of a family powwow and unease burrowed into my bones sass shut the library doors and peered through the gap to be sure she wasnt being overheard she whirled back to face her brother if you cant see that little tramp is about to unzip uncle mutts fly youre blinder than a fence post oh sass dear i think you might be overreacting just a teensy little bit gretchen said sass stared at her sisterinlaw like gretchen had just leaned over and spat on her patentleather shoe gretchen honey i know youve been in a stupor the past several years but nows the time for unblurred vision that little whore is after uncle mutts money and its just clear as day that shes gonna get it if we dont stop her i think youre overestimating uncle mutts affection for wendy bob don said in a tight voice and id thank you not to speak to my wife that way i recalled uncle mutts warm embrace of wendy her soft laughter as she leaned against his shoulders the air of intimacy that surrounded them apparently sass had witnessed a similar scene or suspected amour between lord and cook thats okay bob don gretchen quickly said eager to make peace sass didnt mean anything by it did you hon sass smiled of course not sugar were all just tickled pink over your recovery im so proud of you i could bust i pressed my lips closed after all i had no designs on uncle mutts money it was none of my business but i would not want to see bob dons inheritance threatened id tell him privately what id seen between wendy and mutt i wouldnt give sass the satisfaction dislike for her boiled up in me how did bob don and she spring from the same gene pool sass sat and crossed her legs demurely now lets get back to the problem at handwendy shes no doubt searching for a father figure aubrey volunteered and what we need to do is replace her electracomplex attraction to uncle mutt with aubrey hush sass said the voice sounding automatic i could see the pattern aubrey speaks sass shushes not a bad system if it worked i silently took a chair i thought that sass convened us all to talk about lollys death but my greataunt wasnt even being mentioned i couldnt say with clarity that grief permeated this house oh gretchen looked devastated bob don seemed dulled but the othersit was almost as if lollys death were a minor incident of the weekend as unfortunate as a broken fishing reel mother aubrey didnt surrender easily all im saying is find wendy someone else to target shift her sights off uncle mutt wonderful darling are you volunteering sass rolled her eyes i suppose not regardless wendy doesnt want mutt as a man she examined her polished nails she wants his money i dont think shes the only one overly worried about money i blurted i didnt have any undue affection for wendy but watching aubrey and sass connive over mutts cash made me queasy well well well sass pursed her lips into a wicked grin longlost son finally shows his true colors i wondered how long itd be until you were sticking your hand in the till bob don started to defend me but i stepped willingly into the line of fire i dont take abuse listen i dont give a crap about uncle mutts money i dont have any claim on it i may be a blood kin but i certainly dont have the years and years of having a relationship with him that yall do but hes a grown man and what he does is his business not yours doesnt he deserve a little happiness in the last months of his life are you worried about his heart or his wallet the battle lines drawn sass clicked her nails against the silksoft leather i dont need some recently discovered offspring of my brothers telling me what is and isnt my business i dont care what bob don says youre not family youre a stranger she turned to her brother who was staring at her slackjawed oh sass no gretchen mewled i wouldnt be very inclined to claim you as kin maam i retorted my anger getting the better of me youve been nothing but damned unpleasant since we got here youve been snide to gretchen sharp to your brother and downright hostile toward me why should i be kind to you she demanded all you want is to take from me and mine why on earth has bob don not produced you until now why hasnt he shown you off until now how marvelously convenient that he waits until uncle mutts dying how sweet of bob don to conjure you up out of thin air a trump card a nice handsome young heir who can stake a claim to part of the family fortune uncle mutt knew about me i answered anger sharpened my voice into a whisper he knew about me for years he told me so last night so im not a trump card im not a son of convenience for bob don the shock on sasss face went to her bones her mouth worked as she stared at me rummaging for a snide reply sass bob dons voice was behind me you have crossed every line of decency what the hell has possessed you you apologize to my son immediately fat chance she stood and took aubreys arm lets go for a walk son mother and son exited aubrey looking bewildered sass not meeting my eyes sonbob dons voice was lowi am so so sorry i dont know whats gotten into sass shes obviously distraught over aunt lollys death distraught my ass i muttered bluntly shes just mean as a water moccasin have you seen her shed one tear over lolly that was unforgivable gretchen seized my arm and turned me toward her how dare you speak to sass that way me i choked get real gretchen shes had it in for me since the moment i set foot here i even overheard her and aubrey talking about someone being a threat im sure they meant me all they care about is their precious inheritance thats not true gretchen said sass is one of my oldest dearest friends is she more important to you than your husband i yelled good lord gretchen shes just accused bob don of using me of being underhanded of calculating how to get his hands on money she considers hers and youre defending her i should have known we shouldnt have brought you around people of quality gretchen said coldly you ruin everything you touch jordan you turn people against each other just like you did bob don and me dont you blame me for what the bottle did i snapped and she slapped me once hard before storming out of the room i rubbed her palm print standing red against my cheek good god what had just happened in this room bob don stared at me as though i were a stranger philip whod been quietly lounging in a corner chair got up and grinned well jordan youve just had your first family squabble welcome to the clan i watched as philip shut the library doors behind him that annoying grin still decorating his callow face i wanted to punch it off but my temper had already sparked enough fireworks today and i had fences to mend and perhaps terrible questions to ask i turned back to bob don he stood at the librarys door that faced onto the spacious porch his arms crossed i came up beside him and watched a small vessel unfurl its sails the wind caught the boat hard and spray exploded from the prow i saw a child puffy in an orange life preserver lean into the wind on the deck and i imagined rapture on his face as the wet salt air kissed his cheeks the boat off on some voyage of joy looked like a far more pleasant place to be than this house im sorry i spoke to your sister that way but lets be honest i said softly its obvious neither gretchen nor sass can stand me his blue eyes crinkled in pain the past day id heard again and again how much his face resembled mine now i wasnt so sure id grown up being told that i was the spitting image of my mama with her strawberryblonde hair and her soft green eyes but the goertzes saw lots of bob don in me i wanted to see it too i couldnt tell if he was angry with me or not i watched him watch the sailboats ply matagorda bay the boat with the merry child raced toward the open expanse of the gulf for a trice the only sounds were gulls cavorting and the ceaseless wind over the water sass has always had a sharp tongue he finally said still gazing across the vista you couldnt know that but i expect better from you i dont expect you to go off halfcocked at the first prod someone gives you prod i was stunned more like a shove toward the edge of the cliff if you ask me you dont know sass you dont know anything about the hells shes been through his voice tightened like wire on the verge of snapping sass has had a few weeks to get used to the idea that youre my son youve had over a year to adjust do you think its easy for her obviously not i retorted she feels threatened by me afraid that im going to cut into her share of uncle mutt pie its not just money jordan youre a part of my life ive kept secret from her for over thirty years and shes my sister do you know who she calls when shes in trouble me do you know whos seen her through all three divorces and two widowhoods me do you know she went through a terrible depression once lost her dress shop and nearly ended up homeless i was the one who got her back on her feet hell i helped pay for aubreys college till she could pay me back i didnt know i confessed no you didnt you cant learn how complicated a familys history is right when you saunter through the door jordan youve got to give it time none of them are going to accept you overnight i counted slowly controlling my angerboth at him for the lecturing tone hed taken and at myself for the blunders id made with sass when i spoke again my voice was calm i understand im a difficult adjustment for them goodness she has an illegitimate nephew how horrifically shocking im sure thats comparable to discovering you have a new father anger tinged my words harder than id intended but i was having too much trouble picturing sass as the victim in todays play youre being awfully unfair son bob don said quietly i dont see you getting your morals impugned or your face slapped i shot back i forced myself to take a breath never mind how shes treating me if she hates my guts youre her brother why isnt she being nicer to me out of affection for you considering all youve done for her shes an ingrate shes not i love you son but i love my sister too he coughed id appreciate it if you didnt talk to her quite so stridently in the future i swallowed the reply on my tongue it was one of the few times hed spoken to me in a standard parental tone i saw that hed dug his heels into the family sand i tapped out a staccato rhythm on the balconys railing arguing was getting us nowhere and i felt a sudden sharp realization that i didnt like fighting with this man to continue to bicker was to let sass win fine ill mind my manners i locked away the burning question in my heart uncle jake has practically warned me off this island care to explain thank you he turned back toward the bay wouldnt it be nice to be out on one of them boats the wind and the salt spray in your face do you want candace and me to leave i asked softly he glanced at me in surprise leave good lord no im not sure how comfortable id feel at aunt lollys memorial service after all i hardly knew her well i thought maybe you might like to be there for me maybe i need you there son my face colored of course i just wanted to do whatever you wanted me to are you doing okay i hadnt even asked how he was feeling this morning in the aftermath of aunt lollys shocking death or uncle mutts sad announcement my lips tightened in shame im okay he answered me and id like you to stay all right i answered i squeezed his shoulder once if youll excuse me i need to go find candace and i promise that if i encounter aunt sass ill be good no missile strikes thanks son he breathed in the sea air i think ill go find your stepmother after i enjoy this view a little longer she didnt have call to slap you but i know youll forgive her lollys death has devastated her he gestured out at the island shame weve had all this trouble i could use a little peace and quiet i left him there the breeze ruffling his hair and his eyes closed against the summer warmth i collapsed facedown on candaces bed i think ive forgotten how to be a good son good lord if thats not the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard candace stuck her head out of her bathroom wiping soap from her face i rolled over and stared at the ceiling ive hardly given bob don a thought since we got hereive only worried about how i fit in with this crazy family so i end up having a knockdown with his sister in the middle of a family bereavement and getting my face slapped by my hysterical stepmother oh im a class act all the way youre not famous for your sensitivity candace murmured over water splashing in the sink but i still love you she came in wiping her hands with a towel she sat on the corner of the bed and regarded me critically after daddy died and mama got sick i said keeping my eyes on the swirled pattern of plaster above my head i didnt have to worry about being anyones son anymore daddy was gone and mama was so ill she couldnt care half the time she didnt know who i was it felt a little like being an orphan candaces fingers touched my knee then i discovered the truth it was an entirely new ball game a man trying to be a father to me and a woman who resented the devil out of me i couldnt just say yeah go ahead and be my dad bob don it doesnt work that way being a dad is so much more ive demanded an awful lot from him and hes hardly asked any effort from me he probably knows more about being my father than i know about being his son does that make sense im sure it would to the folks who book panels for oprah candace said but you might be overanalyzing just a tad how so i leaned on my elbows to look at her you didnt insist bob don fit into some mold to be your fatherjust that he be patient with you that you take your own time in accepting him isnt that true yeah i said cautiously i smelled one of those womenknowbest traps that are scattered about any emotional discussion candace began to rub my leg her fingertips tracing savory patterns on my flesh i recognized her attempt to settle me down i believe bob don owes you the same courtesy you didnt expect him to act like a father immediately he shouldnt expect you to act like a son immediately but this isnt immediately were talking about anymore i argued ive known for a year and i still cant entirely see myself in the role of his kid thats not what my life is my life was my poteet family my work my relationship with candace i sat up and shook my head i dont belong here candace this was a terrible mistake you let him down a little bit by that fight with aunt sass okay big deal kids never upset parents parents never annoy kids you and bob don have tiptoed around each other for a year its about time you acted like a real father and son and disagreed on something i chose not to listen to this line of reasoning lets just pack our bags and go they wont care if were at lollys funeral or notno one wants us here but bob don candaces face turned stern spare me this pity wallow please if you dont stay and do right by your own father and you might call him that occasionally instead of always by his name like he was just your car dealerill never speak to you again candace youre not usually a selfish man jordan in fact they could probably put your picture in the dictionary next to the definition of generous but i want you to think about the bigger picture i winced i hate thinking about bigger pictures i love to concentrate on small chunks it makes life so much easier she went on bob don bringing you here to his family and you agreeing to comeis a real statement about your relationship as father and son you sound like aubrey god forbid anyhowyou cant surrender when it gets tough so far being bob dons son has mostly consisted of him putting you up on a throne and you feeling a little awkward about his adoration now the real work begins you know i dont need a new dad my old one was just fine i closed my eyes and an image of my father appeared his arms open for me to run into pride shining in his face he always smelled of old spice and he could cook wonderful blueberry pancakes on saturday mornings i would watch him pour the mixture onto the griddle and giggle when the batter bubbled along the edges the fragrance of the pancakes heavenly and comforting when i was old enough he let me turn the pancakes coaching me through this simplest of acts when he died in the mirabeau hospital the cancer had eaten through him like a miniature shark i held his hand my nose wrinkling with his terrible odor of sickness and impending death and hed joked he couldnt get any good blueberry pancakes in the hospital would i fix him a batch and sneak them in his fingers had felt paperthin with weakness against my own i agreed and smiled determined he would not see my tears daddy hated crying i hated hed made me cry id gone home fixed him our special blueberry pancakes then snuck them back into his hospital room he never ate them because he never regained full consciousness he died two days later adrift in a delirium of painkillers i had not been able to eat or prepare blueberry pancakes sincea silent salute to my fathers memory candace saw i was lost in a maze of memories she touched my arm gently and i focused on her face as she spoke was lloyd poteet so perfect talk about pedestals jordy if bob don puts you up on one youve got your daddy up on the world trade center i sat up thats not true ive never ever heard you mention one incident where your father ever annoyed you not one time lord knows thats not normal i wonder if you ever think about anything wrong that he did i wont betray my fathers memory by badmouthing him you really are a piece of work how is bob don supposed to compete with your perfect father he cant he shouldnt have to does he have to measure up to lloyd poteet for you to care about him to love him or acknowledge him fully i stood and rubbed my eyes this discussion is pointless you cant understand horse hockey candace crossed her arms stop beating everyone with this poorlittleoldme crap jordan i suggest you just be yourself let bob don be himself and quit dwelling on your father all the time you have another fatherget used to it i have a new uncle too i retorted i mean isnt that the real reason that were here do you give a crap about bob don or do you just want me to suck up to mutt for his money jordan good god i talked to sister this morning she told me about the two of you thinking it might not be halfbad for me to ingratiate myself with uncle mutt so a little of that moneyd head my way your sister candace said slowly felt sick and jealous and scared at the idea of you getting a whole new family i told her that mutt was wealthy because it seemed to make her feel a little better i dont give a rats ass whether or not you get a cent from him and i cant believe you think so little of me she stormed to her door and opened it would you mind id like to be alone for a while candace i tried but i could see she wasnt in a chatting mood i left like a sulky teenager i took refuge in my room the down pillows were soft against my face and smelled pleasantly old i tossed and turned wishing i could find solace in a nap but sleep eluded me as much as deciding on a course of action i hated to admit that candace had a point but i couldnt easily jettison the memories of lloyd poteet as my one and only father he had been too good to me too kind slaving away at a job he didnt care much for to help send me to the best university in texas did i have to besmirch his memory to let bob don in no i wouldnt her argument made no sense my father had been perfect he had been a whirl of memories danced through my head my fathers beaming pride at my graduation from rice joy lighting his face when i won a track medal in district competition his easy grin when i told him a new aggie joke i wanted my daddy back and not to be among these meanhearted sniping difficult strangers who treated me like the plague i chided myself for childish silliness i heard the creak of a door down the hall and thought maybe candace was coming to talk againor to let me apologize i hated fighting with her and decided to meet her halfway i opened my door slowly a crack to see if it was her in the hall it wasnt deborah goertz on tiptoe paused before aunt lollys room i watched her gingerly open the door so it wouldnt creak and duck in quickly easing the door shut behind her i wondered why she was prowling so quietly if she was just fetching some item from aunt lollys room why bother with stealth i shut my door to its barest crack and waited a few moments later deborah stepped out of the room inched the door shut and rapidly stole down the hall i counted to ten then opened my own door no one was taking a nap as far as i knew so i couldnt imagine why she crept unless it was because she didnt want to he heard or seen i went to aunt lollys door and nudged it open with my fingers the door didnt creak deborah neednt have worried i entered and shut the door behind me i considered locking it for a moment and decided against it if someone found me snooping in here i couldnt explain why the door was bolted lolly kept her room ornately decorated a plush dogs bed with sweetie stenciled on the downy pillow sat in a corner a small water bowl and food dish nearby on one bureau a box of doggie treats stood open i could envision lolly sitting on her bed cajoling her precious pet with a treat and giggling with delight when she dropped it and sweetie jumped in midair of course this was entirely my own conjecture she might have just dropped the morsel on the floor while sweetie sauntered over and gobbled it at his own pace but i thought that lolly who did not seem to take much pleasure in other people and her pet mustve shared many happy moments together in this room linen curtains decorated the window and the furniture looked antique a side table held a lamp a worn back issue of southern living and an intercom systemprobably to summon her to uncle jakes firstfloor room if he needed help a notepad sat by the combination phoneanswering machine with scribblings such as philip arrives pm call jakes doctor and call aubrey photos covered much of the floral wallpaper old pictures their edges brownish with age mixed in with newer snapshots there was a photo of a far younger lolly and mutt wind blowing their hair as they leaned against a car that looked like a s ford lollys smile was lazy and sweet full of promise she had been a decidedly pretty girl with darker features than id come to think of as being classically goertz mutt looked handsome and tough i would not have tangled with him in a bar fight and im sure that women found him exceedingly attractive sandwiched between the two of them was a handsome woman with lightish brown hair and a merry grin their mother i guessed i recalled from one of gretchens interminable monologues that her name was claudia and she was from louisiana my greatgrandfathers second wife her teeth were beautiful framed in a touching smile she was enjoying a good day with her beautiful children why shouldnt she be happy a photo next to this contented picture was of a rakish fellow with dark hair and eyes his hair slicked back and his shirt collar not entirely clean he did not look like a goertz or a zimmerhanzel or a bedrich i guessed that he might be charles throckmorton lollys deceased husband he smiled pleasantly as though having a picture taken for his wife was a right likable chore my greatuncle i felt an inexplicable relief that he had not seen lolly her face purpling her chest shuddering he looked like the kind of man who would never recover from such a deepening shock he would have held her dying body in his arms and cursed the gods for taking her from him grief molding an anger that would never relent i shook my head i was filling my mind full of nonsensical fantasies based simply on old photographs claudia toussaint goertz could have been an unfeeling witch who posed well for the camera and charles throckmorton mightve been a bear of a man who never showed a glimmer of real affection to his wife i had to stop inventing stories to go with faces such flights were stumbling blocks to truth i glanced back at both photos and found i couldnt shake my initial impressions the next picture made me pause it was yellowed with age taken perhaps in the early twentieth century the gentlemans clothes certainly suggested the time of world war i the face was very much like my own wideset pale eyes high cheekbones a lock of heavy blond hair falling across the temple much like that damnable curl that i could never keep combed back the jaw was heavier stronger than mine and the nose wider but the smirkish half smile the subject allowed himself was one id seen on my own face i touched my finger to the cool glass that covered his countenance this i felt sure was my greatgrandfather thomas goertz he had been born over a hundred years ago and hed died years before i was born his eyes stared into mine the arch grin he wore wrinkling the corners i felt his smiles twin creep into its familiar bed on my face i let fancy take my mind again had he had a raspy drawl like mine one that charmed ladies and befriended a rambunctious rebel like uncle jake he had died i remembered when bob don was twelve or thirteen had he hugged his grandson dreamed great dreams for him let him play with his pipe i suddenly felt dizzy and i sat on the springiness of aunt lollys cold bed what on earth was i doing strolling along this rogues gallery of photos and inventing stories to go with each picture these people were my family but they were also strangers it didnt matter that i was bob dons bastard child thomas goertz had died years before i first drew breath he never would have known me legitimate or illegitimate and i knew nothing of him my childhood had not been filled with amusing or tragic stories about thomas goertz i was composing my own family history for these faces too achingly like mine i realized with a soft laugh that i did not even know what his grandchildren and greatgrandchildren called him papaw tom poppop granddad gramps big daddy or any of the other mutated endearments id heard uttered for a patriarch i studied his face for a moment and decided i would have called him poppop dont ask me why this was stupid i ignored the other pictures i could see some were of the twins bob don and gretchen aubrey and sass and deborah in various ages and stages those folks i knew enough about not to linger on only two other photos made me pause the first was a picture of a rather plain young man perhaps in his midthirties with strawcolored hair and wirerim glasses he sat on a stool food piled up on a table behind him a beer bottle in his hand no doubt some family function from years ago his clothes were of the sixties a copper peace necklace adorned his neck and he did not want his photo taken his reluctance was obvious a half sneer marring his mouth as the flashcube detonated in his face i wondered who he was and why he earned a spot on lollys wall his picture frame was grimed with dust the others were clean the other photo was of a young boy bucktoothed perhaps nine or ten with blondish bangs and a wide smile his clothes suggested the photo was from the early eighties a distant cousin perhaps i looked for photos of deborah with her dead parents but i did not see any there were only two photos of deborah one as a skinny but pretty teenager and another from her graduation from nursing school deborah looked miserable in every photo as if that was the only way lolly wanted to remember her face i gave the rest of the room a cursory glance wondering what deborah had done in here nothing seemed to be disturbed although id never been in the room before and had no point of reference but lolly seemed a tidy woman unless someone had neatened up her room since she died which appeared unlikely and no object called attention to itself by being glaringly out of place why had deborah come in what had she taken or had she possibly returned some item feeling uneasily like a burglar i opened one of the drawers aunt lollys underwear this i could not do i shut the drawer and opened the one below it pullovers and sweatshirts i ran my fingers through the garments not sure of what i was looking for nothing the third drawer also offered no items of interestit was mostly foldedup slacks and shorts along with an assortment of decorative collars for the welldressed chihuahua i stood shaking my head i was jumping at shadows here deborah probably had some completely justifiable reason for coming into aunt lollys room then why the sneakiness i glanced quickly through her closet nothing hung there but orderly rows of dresses all ironed i wondered how lollys mind could have lent itself to such groomed order while embracing the ludicrous fiction that sweetie possessed her husbands spirit compare that childish confection of fantasy with the hardedged voice that had dissected deborah so vengefully at the dinner table or the slowly maddening woman that jake described what kind of woman had lolly throckmorton truly been a shelf above the dresses held a menagerie of colorful shoe boxes a quick exploration of these revealed nothing but paper and worn shoes shed had small delicate feet befitting the smiling pretty girl in the weathered photo the nexttothelast box i took down contained letters lots of them they were postmarked from port arthur texas and the name on the return address was that of charles throckmorton and the letters were addressed to lolly goertz the dates on the faded whisperthin envelopes suggested this was their courtship correspondence i felt the sharp distaste of having pawed through someone elses memories dirtying them and i did not open any of the letters i quickly returned the box to the shelf pushing it back with my fingers nearly turning the box on its end to boost it up i was clumsy though and the box tumbled end over end spraying out a fan of old weathered papers i cursed myself and began to gather them quickly feeling even more like an intruder the aging paper felt dusty and smooth at the same time crusted with its presence near the sea and worn with handling i abandoned sorting the letters gathered them in a fist and shoved them back into the box i stood to replace the box on the shelf and only gasped when i looked down at the ground to see if id missed any correspondence a couple of stray words pruned from magazines lay on the floor i knelt down on the ground again and began to paw through the box my breath feeling tight in my chest i found the first card wedged in a rubberbanded mass of old love letters to her husband the card was a festive one a gaggle of puppies and kittens gathered around a humongous birthday cake the preprinted message on the inside read youre going to have a special birthday words culled from other sources spelled out an additional wish below cause its going to be your last one my hands trembled as i replaced the card a quick survey through the rest of the box provided no further evidence of lollys peculiar pastime she had been sending me this hateful mail why and what did this have to do with her death i stoodi had to call mendez thats when the door to lollys room opened or rather i heard it open id shut the closet door behind me when id come in as a precaution this makes me sound like a professional prowler but i did it without overmuch thought and i jerked my hand back from the closet door as though it were a hot stove i tried to think of an explanation for what id done and unfortunately my imagination dried up i reached for the light pull thinking that whoever it was might notice that the closet light was on but the snap of the string and the sudden quenching of the light would be a sure indicator of my presence i quickly replacedwith careful quietthe box of letters on lollys shelf i hunkered down on the floor and tried to peep through the narrow crack of the closet door it was too thin to permit viewing into the room i cursed silently and listened carefully i could hear someone moving around the room with stealth had deborah returned gentle footsteps sounded from different parts of the room i wondered what the reaction would be if i suddenly leaped out from the closetbut i had no explanation for my own presence i could hardly demand it from someone else i tried to breathe quietly through my mouth thirsty for any sound that might tip off the other intruders identity silence held for a long moment and then i heard a soft tearing sound like fabric being gently ripped the noise lasted about five seconds then stopped i heard excited breathingand i would guess that it belonged to a man sounding deeper and raspierthen hurrying footsteps the door to lollys room opening then silence i pressed my fingertips against the cool wood of the closet door i decided not to give immediate chase what reason would i have to confront someone i bit at my lip and decided to count to ten before creaking open the closet door and getting the hell out i didnt get that long as i reached eight i heard bustling noise come into the room and the closet door swung open hard still crouched on the floor i found myself staring at wendy trans shapely knees and just what do you think youre doing she demanded her knees were as gorgeous as the rest of her cups along the perfect curves of her dark legs i slowly stood wondering just how stupid i looked its disconcerting to be caught with your whole body in the cookie jar cat got your tongue wendy moved past me to hang two embroidered peasantstyle dresses on the rack she smoothed them out with a practiced hand poor lolly loved these dresses she got them in mexico on a trip with mutt well her sangfroid at my presence in a closet where i had no business made me believe i could fib my way out of my predicament if i were aunt sass i began softly id probably just say that whatever i was doing here was none of your beeswax wendy glanced back at me im sure its none of my business but if you think im not going to mention this to mutt youre mistaken let her tell mutt id give him the real explanation later good news uncle it was your dead sister sending me psychotic threatening letters all cleared up now maybe the wrong tack i decided to bluff until i could think straight and plan a course of action smiling at wendy i held up my hands in mock surrender youve got me i was snooping but only sort of only sort of one perfectly sculpted eyebrow went up i weighed my options which took very little time as i seemed to have very few just bolting past wendy was sure to result in an unfavorable report to mutt and id have to explain my presence to himof that i had no doubt spilling every bean i had didnt seem to be an option either i didnt know where wendy stood in the odd spiderweb of relationships that seemed to link the various members of this family she was hired help but i knew she was also far more listen wendy ill be straight with you she crossed her arms prepared to listen i saw a member of the family sneak in here a few minutes ago i was curious as to why someone would be prowling around in aunt lollys room so after said prowler left i came in to investigate i was looking in the closet when another personor maybe the original prowler came back i hid in the closet whoever it was just left right before you came in she didnt answer for a moment then she looked at me with her smokedark eyes did you see anyone in the hallway right before you came in i asked maybe whod you see skulking in here in the first place i considered decliningbeing a tattletale was sure to land me in trouble but id been caught redhanded so i might as well confess it was deborah i wouldnt have been suspicious if shed just walked into aunt lollys room and walked out but she obviously didnt want to be seen wendy looked surprised well it wasnt deborah i ran into when i was coming down the hall to bring back these dresses it was your father i went straight back to my room and lay down playing detective is damned hard on the nerves i closed my eyes this was one of those mornings when i should have stayed in the proverbial bed in short order id been bullied by uncle jake fought with aunt sass gotten slapped by gretchen bickered with candace spied on deborah and been caught sniffing around a dead womans closet by wendy perhaps i could fit in shooting myself in the foot before lunch or perhaps i should just make a list of the clan members i hadnt alienated and proceed to tick them off in alphabetical order goodthat would make aubrey first i sighed and closed my eyes rubbing my eyelids gently trying to stem the rising headache i felt first traumas first lolly had been my persecutorwhy what did she hope to gain by keeping me away from the reunion why did she hate me so sight unseen i thought of her snipping words from magazines and forming them into poems of hate while the affable sweetie looked on tail wagging i shuddered id seen an unpleasant side to my greataunt at the dinner before she diedthe harshness of her tone the unnecessary humiliation of deborah the blatant disregard for propriety as she spilled venom toward her family perhaps she was insane her odd insistence about her pet being her husband reborn might have been more than an amusing affectation a cold anger began to course through me id been scared witless by lolly it was a tribute to the power of words wielded by a mad fury but why even insanity has its root reasons why had this woman perceived me as such a threat and had she menaced anyone else of course there was the possibility however remote that my secret admirer wasnt lolly at all someone could have planted the unpleasant handiwork among the dead womans harmless love letters if so did that mean there was a connection between lollys death and the threats id received those questions had no easy answers so i concentrated on what wendy told me bob don was snooping in lollys room i considered normal everyday reasons first well she was his aunt and he had far more reason to be tiptoeing around her room than i did perhaps there was a keepsake of hers hed wanted or perhaps he was returning something he borrowed after a moments reflection i favored the first explanation lolly left no children to squabble over her legacy but i knew from personal experience family members sometimes helped themselves to particular belongings without waiting for the will to be read perhaps bob don retrieved a gift hed bestowed on lolly long ago that made sense that ripping noise of fabric id heard while he was allegedly in the room however didnt bolster that theory or had he knownor suspectedthat lolly was a danger or a threat i hadnt confided in him about the letters id received but i had told mutt and candace one of them might have mentioned my troubles to bob don and could wendy have fibbed what if shed seen someone else in the hallway and was protecting that person from suspicion but why i moaned to myself once again as was my wont i was spinning fantasies out of bare facts and suppositions all i could say with certainty was that id seen deborah enter and leave the room that id found another piece of hate mail among lollys effects and that id heard someone come in and out of that same room when i hid in the closet nothing more nothing less wendy had not said much after telling me shed run into bob don in the hallway and i had quickly left the room my snooping career the victim of early retirement i figured wendy would fill uncle mutts ear with my misadventure and id have to hem and haw my way through an explanation id rely on my defense of having contributed previously to the successful resolution of murder cases great tactic i chided myself such an approach implied lolly was murdered and we couldnt know that with certainty considering her mental problems swallowing a lethal dose of digitalis medication by her own hand was still the most likely explanation or mutt was right she simply had a heart condition shed kept secret perhaps the note to call jakes doctor was for her own health concerns not his i stood and stared out my window watching the heavy swells of water in the bay the wind gusted hard for a summer day and i hoped no hotweather storm was in the offing the air felt restless the breeze more an intrusive brush than a gentle caress clouds draped the sky but they were kind and white edged with a hint of gray not threatening the wind smelled of salt and the oceans own timelessness i wondered when uncle mutt would be back and fretted about him his insistence on going alone to deal with the administration of lollys cremation troubled me one of us should have demanded to accompany him it was a heavy burden to bear alone i stood at the window and leaned against the pane i could tell candace we didnt have to worrymy torturer was dead it didnt lessen the odd grief i felt over lollys demise instead i felt like the questions i needed answered had widened and deepened in import lolly wrote venom and lolly died i saw movement on the beach and from the shade of a palm tree candace and deborah strolled idly onto the boat dock deborah pointed at the careening gulls that swooped and glided above the waves i saw candace shade her eyes with her palm the wind tousling her hair like a lovers rough caress deborah put one hand on candaces shoulder and i saw them both laugh at some private joke i liked deborahhad liked her from the first moment i met her i was glad that she and candace became quick friends but i still wanted to know why deborah had snuck into lollys room i couldnt dismiss her presence there as easily as i could bob dons i admit to personal bias a knock on the door interrupted my thoughts i knew it wasnt candace come to mend fences so i didnt give a particularly hearty come in aubrey stuck his head in like he expected it to get chomped off hi got a second as long as its not for getting in touch with my inner neanderthal aubrey i sat down and gestured toward a chair whats up he ignored my rudeness settling down with a folder and to my dismay a laptop computer heading off to do some work on your book he smiled its a nice day and i thought it would be good public relations to retire to the porch and woo the muse let everyone see that ive nothing to hideand no one here has anything to worry aboutin writing this book about families he paused for a moment listen jordan im sorry my mom went off on such a tear shes just very blunt and plainspoken i like plainspoken aubrey i just think that your mothers having a hard time accepting me into the family hurt flared in his eyes and i tried to soften the blow look i know i was a big surprise to yall but thats not my fault id like to make the best of a difficult situation yes so would i he drummed fingers along his computer and his folder of notes i know i can irritate people with my theories on human interaction but i mean well no one seems to understand that i blinked here was aubrey who claimed to have anodynes for every emotional trauma and he didnt have the first clue as to dealing with people aubrey you cant continually tell folks how to fix their problems no one wants advice all the time sometimes they just want to vent and not be told what to do about their sadness or disappointment or anger did you read my last book no i admitted im sorry if id known youd written it before i came here i would have bob don didnt mention he had an author for a nephew well then maybe youll let me donate a copy to your library and send a signed copy to you id like to since we havent gotten off on the best foot kindness had been a rare treat since i arrived on the island and i thought youve judged him too quick too harshly but then ibeing a terribly bad and suspicious personremembered the heated whispers id heard between sass and aubrey on the staircase after my arrival but if i kept jumping at every conclusion that presented itself id break a leg i offered my best smile to my cousin of course aubrey id be delighted to have a copy of your book the new ones going to be even better im doing audiotapes videotapes and a cdrom to go along with the texttaking therapy and selfawareness into the multimedia age he fixed me with a catlike stare that showed him to be his mothers son it must have been quite an experience to discover bob don was your father the very idea of it just drips with potential personality destabilization such a basic challenge to your identity do you think youd ever care to talk about it so much for cousinhood without strings apparently my private life was destined to be a track on a selfhelp tape from hell at that moment i forged my plan for dealing with aubrey and his psychobabble i would play stupid after all i was blond so my slowness would be expected by those with less developed cerebellums aubrey qualified i sugared my voice acting as though id suffered a sudden q drop and gave a slow vacuous blink well sure aubrey if you want me to im not sure id ever really know how to describe how i felt if id had gum in my mouth id have popped it i gestured at the laptop you want to take notes with that he was not a clever boy oh thatd be great jordan hows about now he had the laptop open and powered on before i could blink his hands poised above the keyboard to record my innermost longings and tortures no i meandered back toward the window maybe we should talk about how we feel about aunt lollys death since thats so much more recent a pain i did feel pain and confusion and a sick fearover lollys death and i put the wound into my voice well sure of course if you like aubrey burbled i suspected he just wanted to get family members talking for his latest selfanalysis project if we had to start with irrelevant topics that was a necessary sacrifice to get those jaws moving and emotions flowing i sat down was aunt lolly very loved in the family aubrey laughed i dont mean to sound cruel of course we all loved her you can still love a dog after it bites you but youll never feel the same about it entirely i got a sample of lollys teeth at dinner she certainly chewed you and deborah up aubrey shrugged she had a lot of mental problems if you ask me the family wont admit it i didnt tell him jake was already admitting away mental problems but she was jakes caretaker a snort was aubreys only reply for a long moment he seemed to be considering his answer carefully finally he offered taking care of uncle jake could impair anyones emotional health so why not just get jake a nurse uncle mutt wouldnt hear of it said family always takes care of family yet he hires wendy and rufus true and i suppose lolly was happy enough taking care of jake it kept her out of mischief you didnt like lolly much did you lets cut to the honest chase here aubrey rolled his tongue in the hollow of his cheek i loved her because youre supposed to love your relatives but no i didnt like her much as a person she didnt like anyoneexcept uncle mutt and sweetie of course i think she used to have a few friends over on the mainland but i dont think shed been doing much with them lately did you talk to her often i remembered her note to call aubrey on her pad sometimes shed call mom and id take the message ive been living with mom for the past few months he seemed embarrassed as though i might criticize him since id moved home myself i wasnt about to tease him for his living arrangements i pressed on these mental problems you mentioned did it go along with her fixation on her dog my new cousin smiled slyly theres two schools of thought some of us believed lolly had real problems otherslike philip and muttthink it was all a little charade charade sometimes we wondered if aunt lolly was having a big joke on us allpretending to be just an amusing amount of crazy for a moment my dumb act was the real thing youre saying she faked believing that sweetie was uncle charles back from the dead and any other eccentricities she had aubrey nodded well its one theory why what would be lollys motivation attention power aunt lolly was a control addict from time immemorial she liked everyones lives just the way she had arranged them i still dont understand if everyone in your family believes youre a little crazy they go out of their way to accommodate you they dont disagree with you often if at all everyone views you as a sad case to be coddled aubrey smiled at the shock on my face i understand your mother has alzheimers im terribly sorry but wouldnt you say its true that your moms conditionher craziness for lack of a better term and dont take offensedictates a lot of how you live your life i didnt answer him immediately so philip thought she was pretend crazy who thought she was truly ill aubrey shrugged me my mother probably uncle jake they had a rocky relationship and even though lolly raised her deborah has never had a good relationship with lolly shes convinced lolly was sick but lolly was taking care of uncle jake if anyone thought she was mentally ill she had no business being his caretaker i said him being at her mercy for the first time aubrey laughed and i had a sneaking suspicion there might be a likable fellow lurking underneath the sugary platitudes uncle jakes not half the invalid he appears to be sure hes got the heart condition but hes very sharp and active still i recalled jake wielding his cane with youthful vigor aubrey might have a point so by acting the family loon lolly mightve gotten whatever she wanted but im not sure her stakes were very high uncle mutt of course indulged her to a fault shes always had the twins at her beck and call and although im sure you find it hard to imagine my mother was once devoted to her i saw anger flash in his eyes for a moment and i wasnt sure if the emotion was directed at sassor at lollys memory im sorry your mom and i started off crossways i said but i remained unconvinced of this alleged devotion when lolly was dying sass had stood by the window in frosty observance he saw the doubt in my face my mothers buried more people that she loved than most ever will deaths not a stranger to her that doesnt mean she deals with it well death is hard always i ventured your mothershe kind of blew the whistle on the plans for your book didnt she aubrey fidgeted yeah well mom sometimes drinks too much and shoots off her mouth he fumbled for words and didnt quite look me in the face he tapped idly at his laptops keys my success as an authors been a bit hard on her let me ask you a hard question then that empty bottle of jakes medicinedo you think lolly could have poisoned herself i tensed for a retreat but aubrey didnt falter he shook his head suicide in front of your family would be the ultimate form of control will any of us ever forget her now forget her last moments on earth i wont and neither will you her death wasnt an anonymous one in a hospital bed while she wasted away from some pernicious disease she branded herself on our brains she put our memories in a death grip he paused so his fancy words would sink in buttheres no reason for someone like lolly to take her own life she was too much in love with it with herself with the little role shed carved out in the family jordan if poison was involved im sure she was murdered he held his breath as if deciding whether or not to say more finally he shut his mouth and stared at me his words hanging in the air like a familys ghost temptation put the words she sent me poisonous letters on my tongue but i didnt speak i wasnt quite ready to confide in anyone other than uncle mutt aubrey might actually be okay but he was as an smooth as an eels skin and i didnt trust him fully murdered i murmured by one of us it wouldnt be the first time a murders occurred in this family would it yourouruncle didnt lolly say he killed his wife a rap at the door startled us both before i could bid the visitor to enter aunt sass pushed the door open eyeing me with frank distaste and her son with some surprise there you are aubrey ive searched half the house looking for you we need to talk my presence in my own room was not acknowledged sure mom aubrey said his voice soft i was just having a nice chat with jordan he gave me a sidelong glance hushing me from continuing my question well yes of course aunt sass hemmed she glanced at his laptop and folder of notes some of the fire seemed doused in her and i wondered if shed gotten a lecture from bob don as well finally she let her gaze drift toward the general vicinity of my face i didnt smile or look apologetic well see you at lunch jordan come along aubrey my cousin got up and followed his mother out of my room without a backward glance clutching his computer and his papers to his chest like a tardy schoolboy i shut the door after them and sat down on the corner of my bed my head hurt id planned on duping aubrey but wasnt sure i hadnt been duped myself he believed lolly had been murdered did he express that belief solely to see peoples reactions to the horrifying thought of willful poisoning he certainly wanted to dissect me for one of his chapters i imagined id be the case study for patient reacts to his own illegitimacy i wondered if for a moment id seen the bright and capable man that lived behind the psychobull aubrey might be direct on center which meant we had a coldblooded murderer in our midst but hed offered no single suspect and no concrete motive hed clammed up quick enough when his mother entered the room if he suspected herhed never have admitted his own doubts about lollys suicide so did he have another suspect in mind one he didnt wish to discuss before his mother i returned to the window candace and deborah still stood out on the deck deborah tossing bread crumbs to the circling cawing gulls candace flung another handful of torn crusts to the flock and they swooped down to scoop up the treats animals always put candace in a good mood i hoped obnoxious scavenging birds fell into the cuddly category at least for today maybe shed talk to me and i could apologizeand perhaps make my point of view clearer i dont like fighting with my love i hurried down the stairs and saw no one except philip lounging in the library i politely knocked and stuck my head in the door he glanced up at me with utter disinterest youre not out enjoying this beautiful day i asked my aunt just died i believe im allowed to mope he looked away from me rubbing a thumb across his knuckle im sorry philip i just looked outside and saw how pretty it was and im afraid i forgot myself its all right its not like you knew her or loved her why should you care if shes gone i walked in so he had to look at me youre right i didnt get the time to be close to lolly but im terribly sorry that shes dead i sat on the ottoman across from him forcing him to either be unusually rude or to look at me he glanced at me with his blank bonewhite face were you very close to her lolly didnt have any kids of her own she couldnt shed tell you about it if you gave her half a chance like her barrenness was a suitable topic for casual conversation she just never gave much thought to propriety philip shrugged i guess i loved her in the way youre supposed to love relatives he glanced at me as though to assure me i did not yet fall into that category his words were an eerie echo of aubreys she and i understood each other we got along she wasnt like uncle mutt i paused for a moment hes not exactly shy about sharing ones personal troubles with others is he philip shook his head learn from me cousin he made his final word sound vaguely dirty dont ever turn to uncle mutt if youre in trouble hed just as soon crucify you as help you he got up and poured himself a fresh cup of coffee from an elegant silver pot he didnt offer me a cup i take it you had some financial trouble you needed uncle mutts help with i was inching onto shaky ground here it was none of my business youre a clever boy to have noticed philip slurped at his coffee and went for the quick diversion tell me what do you think of our joyful little tribe hardly joyful now no i suppose not lolly deadi just feel numb i heard the creak of leather as philip settled back in his chair i plucked a book off the shelves at random and began to page through it cant stay away from books huh philip asked you probably do make for a good librarian i try to do a good job so whatre librarians pulling down as salaries these days high teens low twenties i shrugged at the derision in his voice its not an occupation anyone enters for money philip probably helps that bob don is rolling in cash huh i slowly replaced the booka biography of civil war hero dick dowlingon the shelf bob dons a generous man and i heard gretchen bragging to aunt sass that your little girlfriends got a mighty thick wallet and your point is what philip i turned to face him my arms crossed he dabbed a coffeestained napkin at his lips which were oddly red like a womans must be difficult being around folks that got plenty and you aint got diddly it doesnt bother me none philip does it bother you the words jolted him i dont know what you mean im just curious as to why youd take all that guff from uncle mutt about your wasteful financial habits could it be you really really need him to bail your ass out of the fire he glared at me with undisguised contempt maybe i do but at least ive got every right to his money you dont i dont want his money save it for morons like gretchen and bob don he laughed you dont fool me for one blessed second in fact im not the only one whod like to see some dna proof or the like that youre really a goertz after all we just got your word and bob dons and while hes stupid as the day is long even he might be able to cook up a scheme to get his hands on more of mutts money i leaned down and seized his collar yanking his deadweight up from the chair my strength surprised himand me listen i said softly to him you ever say anything bad about bob don again to me and ill clean up the floor with your ass hes not a liar and neither am i my my physical threats how very unlibrarianlike of you he met my stare with his own his blue eyes lightless like pebbles in a stream give it up philip i turned to leave tired of his innuendo and threats youre not going to win jordan i paused by the door win what i told you im not after uncle mutts money get that through your thick skull philip stood straightening his polo shirt where id pulled on it and tucking a hand over the heavy ugly braided gold chain at his neck dont cross me its a real serious mistake are you threatening me i asked in a low voice i almost hoped hed say yes my fist ached to throw a punch into his sneering face philip bedrich smiled softly famous last words cousin famous last words i stormed down to the beach anger cours ing through my marrow i despise bullies of any sort and i particularly disliked philip so much for cousinly accord hed struck a sore spot with me and id seen he knew so in his beady damp eyes i felt hot shame that philip might have detected any vestige of greed in my face i was here for bob dons sake and no one elses how could i have known that uncle mutt was dying no one i stopped dead in my tracks nearly stumbling over the sandgritted balloon of a beached jellyfish philip implied that id come here for the sole reason of cajoling my way into uncle mutts will but how was i to know his will would be put into use soon i couldnt no one knew that mutt was dyingor did they had philip known was that why he was willing to endure mutts jabs knowing that they were destined to end soon the thought gave me definite pause and the hatred that oozed from this family the venom of aunt sass the callow threats of philip the deliberate spite that flowed from aunt lolly during her fatal dinnerwhy some force unseen warped this family as surely as an inexorable weight warps a support i selfindulgently had supposed that it was simply me the unwelcome bastard but i suspected despite philips baiting that i was merely a bruise on the mortal wound of this clan thank god i had my sweetheart here to help me to talk to me to help me understand my god i realized with a jolt that id brought the only guest to this reunion philip tom aubrey sass deborah why didnt they bring their significant others their candacesto a gathering of the goertzes maybe they knew from experience no fun was to be had on this island why not after all the beach where i stood was the site of mass murder i felt a cringe in my legs as i surveyed the beach the remains of jellyfish scattered about like victims of a more recent massacre did those boys from the reliant cry and beg for their lives or did they stare straight ahead as the blades sliced open their throats and their blood ran like a crimson tide the sand felt seductively warm beneath my feet i didnt have to dwell on the dark past the day was beautiful and the relaxing whoosh of the surf reminded me i was supposed to be on vacation viciousness and death and secrecy aside i skirted the littered jellyfish corpses and headed toward the dock mutts second boat the little brutus bobbed in the waves hed taken the boat rufus had ferried us over in to port lavaca i could see deborah and candace still standing on the edge of the dockbut candace stood with one hand on deborahs shoulder her head bowed with some great weight she was crying sudden pain nipped at my heart i cant bear to see women weep and candaces rare tears always drain me i suspected i was the source of her distress and a hot flush of guilt crept up my face i didnt mean to make her cry wed argued but surely not intensely enough to evoke weeping my throat dried and i stood still unsure if i should encroach on her private moment she might not want my brand of comfort she wiped her eyes and saw me she turned away toward the bay and the wind deborah glanced over at me a sad look painting her face hells bells i walked slowly onto the dock candace you okay im fine she said softly glancing back at me deborah and i were just chatting and i got a little emotional thats all i reached out for her shoulder she didnt flinch away im sorry excuse me deborah murmured i think ill run up to the house and get a coke candace youre sure youre okay im fine deborah thanks deborah smiled softly at me turned and hurried toward the house shes sweet i said feeling awkward i looked at candace she stared up at the vast vault of summer sky the clouds resembled old sculpted bone she is kind candace finally said i like deborah i like her too the topic of deborah exhausted i cast about for the words to frame my apology in sugar im sorry i blew up at you i had no call to say what i did im feeling awkward around these folks i dont know how to be myself here and i should have listened to you im really sorry are you apologizing to me because i feel bad or because you feel bad jordy she kept her gaze on the whitecapped waves lapping at the beach one strand of walnutbrown hair kept whipping around her face and i slowly guided it back into place the cup of her ear felt warm against my fingers both she smiled then the vaguest trace of a grin and she turned her face into my palm her breath tickling my life line i kissed her cheek and she kissed my hand im sorry i whispered into her soft hair im a real butt sometimes im sorry too her voice was whispery and strong like silk i should have told you how i got arlene on the side of this trip so you wouldnt find out the wrong way and i shouldnt have used that tacticit wasnt kind she sighed youre in such a weird situation with these people and i just mouth off with my free advice youve got to decide what your relationship is with your father i cant tell you what it should be nobody can no you were right ive pretended far too long that i can just sweep bob don under the rug that hell be satisfied with only being my friend ive got to let him be a dad to me she stared up into my face with such tenderness i felt the breath in my throat halt its a terrible responsibility for someone to look at you with such love i didnt deserve herher strength her kindness her forgiveness of my multitude of faults i specialized in alienating people and raising hackles i couldnt walk past the anthill without kicking it over to see what ruckus i could raise i could not be an easy man to love one of her eyebrows arched oh babe dont give me that look it wears me out for you to think im perfect i blinked to clear my face of any offending expression you may not be perfect but youre the perfect one for me i bent down to her as we kissed her hands tangled in my hair i reveled in the gentle scratch of her fingernails against my scalp the pressure of her arm against my neck the nip of her tongue against my lips i lifted her up into my arms my big tall boy she teased then her tone grew serious do you love bob don she asked her voice a thrum against my neck the dreaded question given air at last imim glad hes part of my life now welllove him hes a wonderful man i wish my father was more like him kind generous you could be a father like him someday yourself she whispered in my ear maybe i will be i said maybe now you put me down all those folks in the house will be talking and its not right we be out here kissing on each other after poor lollys death i set her down gently this isnt a house of mourning like any ive ever seen deborah gretchen and uncle mutt seem upset but the restthey seem disconnected as if they dont believe lollys dead or worse that it doesnt matter i told her quickly about my conversations with aubrey and philip i did tell her about finding lollys letter but i left out the part about snooping after deborah and getting caught by wendy no need for her to know just how much of an idiot id managed to be in one short morning im not sure dysfunctionals the word for this bunch i dont understand why lolly sent you the letters i dont know what she hoped to gain either i let the bay wind caress my face but shes dead now and she cant hurt us jordan she began to speak her upturned face earnest in the bright sunshine she stopped what whats wrong she shook her head its nothing why dont we go back to the house im sure deborahs wondering if weve fallen off the deck fine i took her hand and we began to walk toward the house my heart lightening ever so slightly and for the first time since our arrival the feeling didnt last long enough to savor because i saw gretchen stumbling down from the house the bottle in her hand glinting like a blade in the fierce summer glare gretchen i ventured wed stopped on the path leading back to the house and gretchen nearly barreled into us her gaze concentrated on some inward journey oh jordy candace hi gretchen awkwardly gestured with the bottle a texas vintners chardonnay opened but recorked candace and i were silent oh the bottle she laughed a feeble twitter like a birds oh this yes this i was taking it to tom and rufus theyre scouring about on the other side of the island you were going to walk a mile or so to take them a bottle of wine i tried not to make my voice sound accusing i could smell the bitter tang of alcohol on her breath covered up with the thin camouflage of mint gum my heart sunk like a stone after its last skip on the water she saw the fear in my eyes and swallowed gretchen why have you done this to yourself done what ii told you im taking this to tom and rufus thirsty work theyre doing well you wouldnt believe me anyway her voice took an edge like a newly sharpened knife a sneer one i had not seen in many months curled her lip you little bastard you just cant wait to manufacture a lie about me can you gretchen lets go sit up in your room have some coffee and a nice talk candace attempted gretchen surrendered no ground no no dont need that dont want that i just want to go for a walk she wobbled on uncertain legs i dont feel so good i didnt speak i just took her arm and steered her back toward the house she stumbled along the first few steps leaning against me for support then she wrenched away as if i smelled foul and she couldnt bear another whiff she pivoted and bolted down the path i grabbed her arm and she didnt try to wriggle loose she stood there penitent her head cast down in silent shame her muscles trembled beneath my fingertips and her skin felt like a furnace gretchen i kept my voice soft and nonjudgmental just just get me up to the house dont let nobody see me she leaned against me dropping the wine it fell onto the soft grass by the path and candace retrieved it i watched the liquidpoison to gretchens systemroll languidly within the clear shell of the bottle we smuggled her into the house entering through a rear door near the kitchen uncle jake sat in the study in full view as we tried to ascend the staircase with the stealth of burglars whats wrong he called nothing i answered the sun just got to gretchen uncle jake didnt challenge us further but i could feel the weight of his stare against my back bob don wasnt in their room i eased gretchen down on the bed her eyelids fluttered and she let out a small moan gimme something damp she begged and i hurried to the bathroom rinsed out a washcloth squeezed out the excess water and laid it across her forehead ill go find bob don candace said no dont gretchen murmured but candace was already gone i am usually a resourceful man but my limbs and mind felt numb i didnt want to sit through gretchens drunk i wanted to bellow at gretchen but i kept my mouth shut i sat next to her on the bed watching the gentle flutter of flesh beneath her eyelids slowly those eyes opened and fixed upon my face i dont understand how it happened she whispered her voice barely louder than a sigh i didnt want to drink anything i didnt never again what upset you she didnt answer me perhaps lollys death had nudged gretchen back toward the demon rum seeing her die in front of all of us had been one of the most unnerving experiences of my life i couldnt blame gretchen for wanting to dull her own pain but i felt disappointed in her gretchen you dont need booze well go over to the mainland tonight find an aa meeting in port oconnor you need to talk to folks about why you drank at least i assumed she did what i knew about aa was gleaned entirely from television i had done little to participate in gretchens sobriety other than offering unobtrusive support i knew with a keen and sudden tightness i could have done more not aa not right now later she put her hand on the cool wetness of the cloth i dont understand all i drank today was a little coffee and then a couple of dr peppers thenall of a suddeni felt funny craved a hit of wine couldntcouldnt help it jordy i couldnt help it she began to sob a deep crying like shed lost a part of herself that could never be regained i surprised the hell out of myself by taking her hand she clasped my fingers hard i bent over whispering itll be okay itll be okay no no it wont hell leave me bob don said he couldnt take me drinking hed leave me if i fell off the wagon dread widened her eyes oh god damn me for drinking i squeezed her hand and said god wont desert you neither will bob don or any of us whyshe swallowedmust you be so like him why i cant give him a baby i never could her words slurred together like voices raised in distant hue and cry her drawl slowed and deepened she almost sounded like a man im sorry gretchen oh jesus dont be i wanted his baby to grow inside me never could not meant to be my mama said she said god knew id make a lousy mother god doesnt give babies to drunks her eyes stared past my shoulder riveted to the arabesque swirls on the ceiling now bob dons got you hes got his child i dont got nothing you have your husband gretchen hell leave me she sobbed then hiccuped loudly she covered her mouth with her fingertips and belched softly a tear running down her cheek fear made her body as rigid as a board he wont leave you i wont let him i soothed now how much did you drink she swallowed one whole bottle and part of another i snuck it out of the bar i drank it up here it made my mouth all cold so i wanted to get warm i decided i wouldnt couldnt stay in the house so i wanted to go to the beach on the other side of the island i could drink down there yes i could maybe take a swim a long swim she closed her eyes again her breathing labored her words mumbled i used to swim down there when i was younger tom told me the sands still soft i used to swim there with paul wed watch the egrets fly wed laugh at them clowning around in the shallows scaring up fish her memories seemed as delicate as old lace whos paul her eyes were distant i thought i saw him again last night who paul who is he she shook her head i held her hand and didnt know what else to do and you dont know why you drank i was drunk before i knew it she muttered absently rubbing her eyebrows im sorry i hit you this morning i lost my temper stupid of me i released her hand and walked over to the vanity where a glass of dr pepper sat in its puddle of condensation some soda its color lightened by melting ice cubes remained in the bottom i sniffed at the glass nothing i sipped cautiously rolling the liquid in my mouth i went and spat the mixture in the sink just as bob don came in followed by candace and aunt sass sass took one look at gretchen oh dear drunk again she said it without malice but also without pity pain stiffened bob dons face gretchen turned her face away into the comfort of her pillow her shoulders hunched not exactly i said softly her sodas been laced with everclear someone set gretchen up to drink bob don convened an unlikely war council in aunt sasss room gretchen was napping off the wine calmed and reassured by bob don that he wasnt bailing out of their marriage sass candace bob don and i sat on sasss unmade bed i kept a fair distance from sass i dont believe either of us had forgotten the harsh volley wed exchanged after breakfast the room even being one sass occupied only as a guest already bore her indelible imprint clothes lay haphazardly on the floor and across furniture dropped where shed shed them earrings lay in scattered profusion across a side table and a forest of cosmetics bottles sprouted before a mirrored vanity i hate to say it bob don sass began after a hesitant glance toward candace and me but she could have spiked her own drink and just claimed that she didnt mean to get drunk he nodded but i dont believe shed lie alcoholics fib if they want to drink hon remember that second husband of mine she glanced again with discomfort toward me aubreys daddy was a heavy drinker very heavy i know how hard its been for bob don i said nothing her own imbibing last night had been of epic proportions and i was no more comfortable with seeing aunt sasss pain than she was showing it to me i think her soda was laced she was too miserable at the thought of bob don finding out shed drunk i tugged at the corner of the comforter the room felt stifling hot despite the gentle circling of the ceiling fan overhead the air smelled of aunt sasss perfumesweet and slightly smoky like a singed rose so were left with the idea that someone spiked her drink candace said why would someone want to get gretchen drunk to hurt her aunt sass answered immediately if shes worked so hard to stay sober like bob don says nothing would hurt her more than to tank her up she reached for her brothers hand honey im so sorry i feel so bad for her i couldnt forget the slightly sneering tone that aunt sass had used yesterday when gretchen announced her new sobriety perhaps i misinterpreted or perhaps sass was just sporting her kindest face for the sorrowful moment but why candace persisted whod want her off the wagon maybe theres no motive but meanness i stood and went to survey the beautiful bay from the window the ocean offered no sign of a returning uncle mutt i wanted time to speed up so we could leave this island lollys corpse had been removed but a pervading sense of death still itched at my skin like a tendril of smoke i dont understand son bob don said to my back i faced him meanness i repeated theres more tension in this family than kindness someone could have tampered with gretchens drink just out of sheer cussedness i avoided casting accusing eyes toward sass granted getting gretchen inebriated would hurt her sass countered but i dont see anyone here wanting to inflict that pain i dont want to pick another fight with you jordan but ive lived with a drunkard myself i hate to play devils advocate but its much more likely that gretchen poured out that booze than any mysterious gloved hand with an ulterior motive youre right i said and she blinked i would agree with you normally but ive seen how hard gretchens fought for her sobriety and i dont believe shed toss it away on a whim either something upset her so badly she drank and she doesnt want to tell us or someone spiked her dr pepper uncle mutt terminally ill lolly dead now this bob don shook his head bad bad days for this family i unknowing proceeded to make them worse whos paul i asked bob don studied the brightly stitched rug on the floor aunt sass conducted a careful examination of her flawless fingernails am i talking to myself here gretchen mentioned someone named paul thought she saw him last night then she was drunk last night too sass said in a colorless tone paul was our younger brother hes dead he was deborahs daddy oh the alleged murderer and suicide were he and gretchen close bob don stood and walked out of the room i felt a familiar pang that suggested i was tasting my own shoe leather yes jordan they were once sass answered watching the doorway where her brother had retreated paul was gretchens first husband bob don had withdrawn to his own room to care for his wife candace claimed a headache and i didnt feel like lingering in sasss domain any longer than necessary i took to the porch with a tall glass of dr pepper ice and a lime slice the stalwart deputy praisner no longer stood sentry there instead i saw a boredlooking young female deputy tossing pebbles off the dock the sunlight glittered against the gun in her holster i sipped at my drink and considered the latest anthill id kicked over odd the minutiae you unearth around the roots of the family tree id never known that gretchen was previously married much less to bob dons own brother the goertz family christmas mustve been extra festive the year that bob don and gretchen exchanged vows marrying your sisterinlawthe surest way to drive two brothers apart i sucked on my lime dumped its scraggly crescent back into the ice and poured the rest of my soda over it the sun felt warm on my face and the breeze was cool and fresh i was at the coasti should have been happy and relaxed instead i felt the pulsing rhythm of a nascent headache and a homesickness for my dull plain family no announcements of terminal illnesses at the dinner table no gasping deaths on the diningroom floor no drunken stepmothers sobbing out their sobriety only the gentle nagging of my sister about my latest misadventure the repeated requests of my nephew to go horseback riding the silent perambulations of my fading mother around the furniture at our new house where she always seemed bound on some dear and secret journey the poteets were downright dull compared with the goertzes i preferred dull you stare out at the ocean any longer youll go mad a voice observed my cousin deborah leaned against the white wood of the porch and smiled thinly at me madness fits here i spoke without thinking hoping i hadnt offended her she simply shrugged aunt lolly she sighed i cant quite believe that shes gone i keep expecting her to round that corner chirping at sweetie to come cuddle in her lap or hollering at me for some imagined crime deborah stared out at the ocean watching the great mothering waves sliding across the sands i said nothing enjoying the companionable silence and the whoosh of wind and water i waited for her to talk i guessed she wanted to voice her burdens her fingers drummed a regular beat against the wooden rail of the porch a metronome for her nerves i dont want you to get the wrong idea about lolly and me deborah kept her gaze firmly on the expanse of water i take it yall didnt get along she hung her head over the porch railing oh its so complicated hey im the illegitimate kid im the personification of complicated it garnered a tense laugh from her you know lolly took me in when my mother died she made no reference to her father yes welldeborah ran a hand through her thick dark hair and seemed to cast about for the right wordsthat wasnt my decision had i my druthers id have gone to live with uncle mutt ive adored him since i was little but he didnt want a child underfoot then he was the fast and easy bachelor so uncle mutt in his grand role as patriarch dispatched me to live with aunt lolly it was kind of an arranged marriage yknow neither of us were very thrilled i thought about how badly gretchen wanted a child bob don and gretchen didnt offer to take you in no aunt gretchen was still drinking deborah shook her head she wouldnt have wanted kids anyway the child of her exhusband i could understand why gretchen bob don his brother pauluntangling that web would take time if i relied on gretchen and bob don to speak up why was lolly not a good match for you because family propriety matters so to lollyperhaps more than it should she still referred to her aunt in present tense and i wasnt heartless enough to correct her brian and i werent anything more than stains on the goertz name to her brian i asked her jaw worked for a moment reining in strong emotion my brother my little brother hes dead too oh deborah im so sorry her eyes filmed with tears but she quickly blinked them away youd have liked him real well jordan im so sorry i repeated i make for a lousy comforter dont listen to the lies they tell she stormed with sudden fury because they do lie whos they this whole goddamned family anger reddened her face and she grasped my hand her trimmed nails digging furrows in my skin theyll tell you my dad murdered my mother and then went off and killed himself but he didnt he didnt i took both her hands in mine her skin quivered against my touch i saw now she was too mad to cry fury contorted her face into a vengeful grimace do you want to tell me what happened whats the truth she didnt look at me she stared back out at the lapping bay as she talked my motherwhen i was just six and brian was only twowas found shot to death in my fathers studio her face had been blown off she stifled a shudder my father went missing later wei mean uncle muttfound a note that my father had left he said hed shot my mother then snuck out here to sangre island and walked into the ocean he said he was sorry for what hed done and couldnt live with himself anymore uncle mutt found this note she nodded it was taped to the door of the house the family had gathered here for my mothers funeral he left the noteand then vanished and you dont believe your father killed your mother i didnt mean for the question to sound so heartless and i squeezed deborahs hands in support would you she looked at me with tearless eyes my father was an art teacher jordan a sculptor he worshiped my mothers face she met him when she was one of his regular models sculptors dont destroy works of art if he was going to kill her it wouldnt be shooting her in the face her reasoning seemed wishful to me why should an artist lurk on a higher moral plane and id known painters whod obliterated canvases with no hesitation but to contradict her would be cruel i take it the rest of your family didnt agree with your reasoning no her voice cracked do you know how that feels they didnt want to talk about it they didnt want to acknowledge that something as distasteful as a murder had happened in our family tight asses all of them but bob don was kind to me and tomhe was really kind to brian aubrey was good to him too she paused to draw a restoring breath the goertzes personify the delightful combination of german immigrant stiffness and old south propriety you just dont have murderers in the family its simply not done so everyone closed together in a tight circle and pretended it didnt happen they pretended my parents didnt matter because they died in a distasteful way bitterness scored her words i couldnt speak i watched her bottom lip quiver with anger she continued aunt lolly considered brian and me as nothing but pockmarks on the family skin she had a warped sense of family honor what dad didwhat she thought he didwas unforgivable and lolly definitely believed that the children were liable for the sins of the father was she just horrible to you and brian i asked deborah shrugged she never laid a hand on either of us but everything we did was wrong a further embarrassment to the family name as if brian and i were defective being the children of a woman who let herself get killed and a man too cowardly to face up to what he did her voice mimicked lollys sugary tone those are her words not mine i thought of the sick mind that could punish children for an unproven act of a parent i could imagine her hating me now with precise claritythe end result being a vicious cycle of mail sent my way dont punish the wayward bachelor punish his wayward sperm instead make the bastard pay for the crimes of the sire acrid dislike for lolly surged in me who the hell was she to sit in judgment of me or poor deborah had she treated others the way shed treated the two of us the sharp edge of her hate might have turned back on her i saw her gasping purpling face again and coldly could not muster much pity for her i did not feel like an honorable man at that moment the police accepted this suicide note i ventured yes but dads body was never recovered there was never a sense of closure she laughed and it was a sickly ragged sound brian used to be sure that our father was alive somewhere working to clear his name like the fugitive she glanced out again toward the bay that had swallowed her father if it wasnt your dadwho would have had a motive to kill your mother her mouth worked as though restraining unbidden words from speech i dont know her name was nora did you know that you had an aunt nora i shook my head its a lovely name her mouth tightened i know my dad wasnt a murderer please dont listen to the others theyre wrong wrong as can be she fostered a weak smile your uncle paul was a good man i think you and he would have liked each other real well the pain of her loss was nearly tangible i could imagine her reaching out and giving her sadness a loving stroke im sure we would have i smiled back at her a sudden thickness sat in my chest i wish you could have known my dad and my mom before she got alzheimers but youve got another dad now lucky boy she murmured i guess yes i managed to say she saw the doubt in my eyes oh dont feel funny about it count yourself blessed if lolly could have been another mother to me after i lost minei would have given anything to have a relationship like that i needed a mom and a dad youve got a second chance jordan bob dons the kindest man i know he was so good to me after my folks died you sound like candace i cajoled trying to lighten the gloom that had enveloped us both i assume you and candace mended fences deborah offered after a long silence yes we did we try not to stay mad at each other look ive had so little luck in my life i always spot it in others know that youre fortunate i like candace shes got a spark to her deborahs voice was small shes a pistol i agreed shes lucky too goodlooking fellow like you i felt the easy weight of her arm against mine i didnt blink and kept my eyes firmly focused on the crashing foam thoughts of greek tragedy and fourfingered babies flashed through my mind and i admit to wondering for the briefest of moments exactly what the incest laws of texas were not that i was about to wade into my own gene pool my face never a subtle instrument betrayed me oh my lord deborah giggled you dont think im flirting with you do you her eyes were bright with mirth for the first time since wed begun this rather sad conversation i think sad stories told we both felt the need for human touch we took refuge in teasing each other i grinned feeling utterly foolish of course i didnt think that its just im not quite used to thinking of you as my cousin yet hmmm her voice was a lascivious alto and what if i wasnt your cousin okay we were back on suspiciously comehither territorynot my comfort zone with lovely women who share common ancestors then im sure wed be friends i ventured right answer she rewarded me with a beautiful smile her heavy burden of sadness seemed vanished at least for a few minutes surely you dont talk this way with aubrey aubrey no aubrey is too wrapped up in his spirituality and holisticness and what all else to show much interest in romance hes too busy solving everyone elses problems i guess i said odd that hes that way he was such a wild boy thank god for aunt sasss sanity he straightened himself out aubrey wild the description didnt match my prudish cousin oh jordan i keep forgetting youre not exactly privy to all our soiled family linen she drew back slightly and a strand of hair whipped around her face the shape of her eyes was very much like bob dons and for one peculiar moment i wanted to reach out and take her hand and ask tell me something i dont know about bob don tell me something only another goertz would laugh at make me feel like i belong here i want to know him better than im ready to admit but i didnt speak i dont want to be seen as a gossip she said i shook my head youre right i dont know these people and i wish i did tell me tell me whatever you want about them she gazed out again at the sea well aubreys had a tough time stepfathers aplenty none of whom ever gave a rats ass about him he turned bad as a kidor maybe rancid is a better word he ran away from home when he was fifteen and was gone for two whole years sass nearly went out of her mind he showed up again at her house skinny as a rail high on dope but wanting to come home and clean up his act she shook her head the men in this family tend to vanish at times at least aubrey came back he never told me what happened to him you really care about aubrey dont you she nodded after brian diedi nearly had a breakdown it was so hard to lose him and aunt lolly was devastated even though shed never been real sweet to either of us aubrey took care of me he was my best friend maybe that experience strengthened his interest in helping people i hated it when he ran out on all of us i hope you never have anyone you love walk out of your life that way jordan its gods own pain to deal with i didnt explain to her that i had known that very pain my best friend trey a brother to me had turned and walked out of my life years ago he had left his wife and son behindwho also happened to be my sister and my nephew i had hardly seen my friend again when he died at my feet bloodied with bullets there is no way to retrieve that lost time the thought of treyof his deathstill stung me can i ask a tough question deborah deborah nodded do you know if bob don and your father were close i asked i had a sudden heavy feeling that maybe bob don and i shared a sad experience that of our brothers having turned tail and disappeared from our lives without a trace trey had not been my blood brother but hed been the closest substitute i had close they hated each others guts deborah tugged again at her lip brotherly love was not their forte at least thats what uncle mutt told me im sure it was because they both loved gretchen but it shouldnt have been that way they were just two wonderful men who just didnt understand each other so what was the deal gretchen was married to your dad first they divorced then bob don married her youve got to admit thats a little weird little weird is a phrase thats never done our family justice the whole dirty story is and she was cut off by a scream from the direction of the greenhouse it sounded horrible fueled by a mans last breath deborah moved faster than i did sprinting past me and off the porch i followed the scream cut off abruptly as i vaulted to the ground i rushed after deborah another choked scream sounded from near the elaborate greenhouse id noticed on our arrival i saw the deputy look up from her reverie on the beach and i waved arms at her she ran toward us i passed deborah and broke through the clumps of saltgrass and wildflowers near the greenhouse to find tom bedrich kneeling over aubrey one hand raised to administer a punch to aubreys already bloodied countenance tom stop it deborah hollered she darted around me and seized toms arm his lean face contorted in anger and for one moment i feared hed strike her i lurched forward and pulled her away hes trying to kill me aubrey bellowed for gods sake get him off me i yanked at toms muscled arm he didnt want to surrender tom i said keeping my voice even let him go now its over i tightened my grip and pulled up just to show im stronger and tougher than the gardenvariety librarian tom finally stood shoving aubrey away as if he were rotting garbage aubrey scurried and sat down hard deborah knelt by her cousin critically examining his contusions she glared up at tom you want to tell us what made yall come to blows toms watery blue eyes didnt waver from aubreys face no the deputyi could see berthold inscribed on her name tagslowed to a jog her hand on her holster whats the problem here folks tom hardly looked at her staring down at the ground aubrey wiped blood from his nose and muttered something under his breath well gentlemen the deputy inched closer to tom its nothing just a family disagreement oh you always throw punches during disagreements ice edged the deputys voice im not hurt aubrey amended look maam we were horsing around it just got out of hand his voice drifted off and tom didnt answer you want to press charges against this fellow deputy berthold jerked her head toward tom aubrey shook his head no of course not it was stupid of us to fight a gleam lit his eyes though that i didnt believe the deputy could see i dont want to hear about any more trouble berthold frosted us all with her stare i hadnt even done anything and i felt guilty ill have to report this to lieutenant mendez anything odd happens here he hears about it you two going to behave now both men nodded like recalcitrant schoolboys berthold fixed them with a baneful eye turned and headed toward the house twice she looked back to glare ooooh aubrey muttered authority figure think shes got a dominatrix set at home he grinned at tom and i saw a thin smear of blood along his teeth tom glanced away from his cousin in disgust you know tom deborah said helping aubrey to his feet no one is remotely impressed with this silent heman crap youve perfected to an art a very cheap art what the hells the matter with you nothing he answered aubrey i asked i turned his jaw toward me he had a busted lip and a cheek guaranteed to bruise up colorfully but otherwise he appeared okay what happened here aubreyto my surprisestammered for a moment then took a long swallow deborah and i waited he flicked a tongue across his bloodied teeth and lip before he spoke dear cousin tom just didnt respond to my latest advice i guess i irritated him thats no excuse deborah slapped tom on the arm he didnt flinch what the hells wrong with you she asked aunt lolly dead this house in an uproar and you pull this stunt sorry tom mumbled good lord wait till aunt sass gets a load of this deborah began and aubrey jerked away from her gentle touch goddamn it im not some puny kid that has to go hide his face in his mamas apron im perfectly capable of taking care of myself arent i tom aubrey shouted it seemed an odd comment in light of toms whaling of him but now was not the time for semantic analysis aubreys voice cut the air in cold fury i stepped between the combatants aubrey go get cleaned up and calm down i said ill have a talk with tom you made a serious mistake tom real serious why dont you ponder it for a while aubrey said he spat blood i saw dark hatred color his face cmon trouble deborah took firm hold of aubreys arm and hauled him toward the house he shot one last venomous look toward tom before leaning on deborahs shoulder i regarded tom with a disapproving glare you resorted to punches because aubrey laid some of his greetingcard psychology on you tom poked the inside of his cheekunshaven and covered with blondish fuzzwith his tongue and didnt meet my eyes finally he looked at me and said keep your nose out of my business jordan i see youre sticking to the role of the silent moody relative right now that youve had your tussle for the day i assume drinking heavily and composing bad poetry are next on the agenda now youre sounding like aubrey tom shook his head definitely dont throw a punch at me tom im a lot meaner and tougher in a fight than aubrey ever thought of being he surprised me by laughing meaner than aubrey nope under all that sugary concern for his fellow man aubreys a conniving little bastard he paused and met my gaze directly sorry no offense intended oh tom i shook my head with an indulgent smile surely an educated man like you can arm himself well in a battle of wits bob don claims youre smart are insults just not your specialty no i have better things to do with my time than trade barbs with you tom turned to leave wait a second i grabbed his arm and he stopped a hint of ire fired his pale eyes and i released his arm what other responsibilities demand your attention staring out at the sea i prefer my own company jordan and after youve been around this crew awhile you might too indulge me why does aubrey hate you why do you care im more than a little curious about the rather peculiar relationships pervading this family now that im a member then take some familial advice cuz curiosity isnt a goertz virtue his mouth set in vexation and his cheeks reddened in fact curiosity kills kills who lolly he jerked away and headed off past the greenhouse and down the path i saw him rub his knuckles against the side of his cutoffs and i realized with a twinge in my gut that he was wiping aubreys blood off his hands with as much concern as if he were wiping away water or soda tension infected this family like a deadly strain now it had erupted into open violence distaste burned in my throat just as soon as aunt lolly was decently scattered and id done my duty to bob don wed be off and id never have to set foot on this godforsaken island again i watched tom leave damn it i wanted to like him i thought with his educationbob don mentioned he was an oceanographertom and i would have lots in common apparently not he vanished around what bob don had called a secondary dune a sand dune that becomes isolated on the barrier flat behind the main dune ridge to me it looked like a small hill covered with vegetation probably he was seeking refuge for when aunt sass found out what hed done to her darling baby angel i let that consideration die a natural death tom wouldnt flinch at anything sass said he wore his silence like a snail wears its shell conveniently attached for retreat but tom could be prodded from that armor with the right ammunition aubreys bloodied face offered proof the question was what weapon did aubrey wield i headed back to the house lost in my own musings and therefore nearly fell flat on my face j tripped over a shovel lying near the greenhouse i mentally chided rufus for not cleaning up properly the shovel was in reach of either aubrey or tom had the fight escalated i picked up the implement myself knocked the clots from its bladeand noticed sand mixed in with the mud and clay the dirt smelled vaguely sulfurous i finished cleaning the shovel and tried the greenhouse door it swung open the greenhouse looked much bigger on the inside it was elaborate divided up into four sealed compartments for different levels of warmth and humidity plants of all shapes and sizes grew in heady profusionroses flowers of many colors growing foliage that looked common from the mainland but that i couldnt recognize i found what looked like another room for toolslocked oddly enoughand set the shovel down i wandered toward the back of the greenhouse and found aunt sass sitting before a beautifully growing rosebush in one of the compartments she seemed lost in thought and i paused for a moment not wishing to disturb her reverie she sensed my presence though and glanced at me uncertainly then returned her gaze to the flowering roses my whole body tensed her dislike for me felt as constant as the unending breeze and i felt tired of being continually defensive id decided to let bob don be a father to mei had to make peace with his loved ones might as well tackle the most difficult project first i went and sat on the bench next to her my fingers reaching out for the delicate petals of the rosebush this is a really cool greenhouse its jake and mutts pride and joy theyre both big on plants her voice was carefully neutral but at least she wasnt leaving at the sight of me i dont suppose i could interest you in a peace treaty she fidgeted i need to go find aubrey i interrupted her excuse to tell her about the fight outside the greenhouse shed just missed i thought for sure shed bolt to the house to comfort her son instead she stared into the unfolding depths of one of the roses and you took up for aubrey yes maam she gave me a crimped smile thank you youre welcome the ceremonial bows out of the way i let out a sigh of relief i dont know what he said to set toms fists flying has your cousin always been so shorttempered no she answered after a pause toms a slow burn thats what worries me she didnt elaborate for a moment then added aubrey has an annoying habit of finding someones weakness and prodding it to see what happens then they blow up at him and he offers his pop psychology as an antidote its his worst feature toms retreated i wish i could say he was licking his wounds but i dont believe aubrey landed a punch one of her eyebrows arched and she permitted herself a smile dont underestimate aubrey oh yes he can sound like a complete jackass when he decides to play the amateur freud but hes a tough boy hes overcome a lot he didnt seem too cowed by tom i offered no need to mention aubreys spittingcobra impersonation to sass i decided a change of subject was in order hows gretchen feeling i checked on her a minute ago shes resting im afraid shell have a rotten headache when she wakes up sass touched a rose stem and breathed in the flowers perfume itll be worse for a while now wont it her craving for liquor i dont know i would imagine so i dont think it ever entirely goes away i wasnt going to pretend to understand the seduction of alcoholism i enjoyed a beer or a glass of wine on occasion but to have an unquenchable need for a beverageno matter how good it made you feelwas a thirst i didnt understand the why of gretchens drinking was not a question id pondered for any amount of time i should have you knew her when she was drinking sass asked oh yes in the worst way she was the one who informed me that bob don was my father i hadnt known before then she was stinking drunk and yelled the news out at me aunt sass stayed silent for a long moment thats a terrible way to find out such ashe stumbled for the appropriate wordrevelation yes it is it was followed by a rather tearful explanation from your brother i didnt want to believe him gretchens words then his words had slid into my heart like an ice pick gracefully inserted between my ribs silence again aunt sasss lips red and full twitched slightly unaccustomed to holding her words at bay hell be a wonderful father to you if youll let him but if you ever hurt him ever disappoint him ill see that youre sorry for it why are there so many threats flying through the air in this house i asked my voice surprisingly mild should i be afraid of you sass i know you dont care much for me i dont know you im not sure that i want to why i ventured i felt suddenly that the spiderwebs of subterfuge were trembling in the building breeze of truth she and i were on honest ground youre a mistake she said softly i dont mean to sound cruel but its true my brother had an affair with a married woman and it was horrible for him your mother should have stayed in her own bed with her own man how she could seduce bob don get herself with childa son no less exactly what bob don has always wanted and prayed forand then blithely go back to her husband and raise bob dons child like it wasnt even his and deny him having diddly to do with you all those years its sick and its selfish and its meanhearted heaviness pressed against my chest you dont even know my mother she was the greatest mother anyone could ask for its awful easy to sit in judgment of a stranger maybe but my brother has never excelled at picking the right women and i cant help but think she was a sorry excuse for a person i stifled the fury i felt finally i spoke ill give you the benefit of the doubt that aunt lollys death has you terribly upset and ill just pretend i didnt hear that garbage dont you patronize me i know exactly what im saying its just the truth that you dont want to hear i dont have to listen to this crap i said brushing past her she seized my arm with surprising strength and brought her mouth close to my ear like a lover whispering an endearment if youre not going to let him be a father to you just leave his life get out dont you think hes been tortured enough already youve been the carrot dangled in front of him for years the great reward maybe he could get on with his life if he knew what your intentions were you make it sound like im marrying him i didnt look at her face it aint that different sugar youre either gonna be a big part of his life or not at all theres not any middle ground for you to stand on and dither i dont see how this is any of your concern now i looked at her and saw the strained smile on her face oh honey it is because next to aubrey no one matters more to me than my brother and im not about to sit knitting while you stomp all over him id never want to hurt bob don every day you keep him at arms length hurts him every day you call him by his right name instead of dad hurts him every day you try and overanalyze what his being your daddy meansand you are just the bookish sort thatd fret till youre bluehurts him now that i know about you you arent gonna hurt him no more i took a steadying breath i see where aubrey gets his penchant for dispensing unsolicited advice you dont know beans about me and yet youve decided to sit in judgment all i need to know she hissed is that you have one of the kindest men in the world chomping at the bit to be your father and you aint letting him and its hurting him bad i can see it in his face he seems fine to me ive known him a lot longer than you have jordan i care about him which you apparently dont a slight sneer played its way onto her face what is it he calls you jordyl what a childish nickname it suits you if youre done i challenged he told me this morning he took a bullet for you he nearly died for you her words felt like slivers of ice against my skin even in the summer heat he laid his life on the line for you and you still cant decide if hes worthy enough to be your father fuck you the decisions easy youre not worthy to be his son she pushed past me her shoulder setting the roses quivering as she grazed the bush and stormed out of the compartment i heard her slam the main greenhouse door a few moments later i stood watching one of the rose petals drift to the floor lost from its fellows i went back to the house easing the door shut behind me my throat ached and i wondered if id screamed at sass without realizing it a cold languor filled my limbs despite the heat of the day part of me wanted to run up the stairs find bob don ask him if anything his sister spat was true it couldnt be i wasnt that unthinkingly cruel and my mother certainly wasnt the conniving slut sass was only looking at one side of a very difficult and painful situation overanalyze not me no way of course bob don knew i cared when hed gotten shot saving me my mother and my nephew from a deranged killer id stood by him at the hospital admitted he was family worried and fretted over him i wasnt a callous man and as soon as he got home from that hospital you carefully slotted him into a place in your life where you demanded nothing of him and he could demand nothing of you isnt that called sweeping the dirt under the rug damned inconvenient new father lets just pretend we have eternity to decide if he ever gets a chance to be more to you than an embarrassment or a debt unpaid the voice spoke in my ear like a miniature devil tittering on my shoulder urging me to mischief no no i wasnt hateful i had just been confused shocked afraid i looked up from the floor and saw uncle jake watching me from the library his eyes sharply focused a book lay open on his lap and eventually he simply nodded at me and went back to his reading his finger tracing a path through the prose i wavered between retreating to my room burying my head in a good book in the study with uncle jake or seeking out some private enclave on the island away from prying eyes sharpened tongues and nagging consciences the last option beckoned alluringly i went into the kitchen found it empty and grabbed a can of dr pepper from the refrigerator i popped the top and took a long swallow keeping my eyes closed as the sugary coldness gushed down my throat youre a mistake what a sick woman sass was hiding behind alleged concern for bob don and after id kept her son from getting pummeled and offered her the olive branch of peace i heard the kitchen door swing open and shut and i turned no one stood there odd i moved to the door opened it and peered out into the dining room to see who id frightened off by my simple presence in the kitchen nobody i eased the door back feeling a disquiet tug in my gut probably just aunt sass scrounging for lunch and withdrawing when shed seen me no problem as far as i was concerned for one moment i felt like i wasnt alone in the kitchen but the only noise was the hiss of my own breathing im letting that woman rattle me i assured myself and opened the back door into bright sunshine i jumped down the stairs and wended my way past the greenhouse rufus puttered inside whistling tunelessly and sipping at a root beer a radio warbled an old conway twitty and loretta lynn duet about a louisiana woman and a mississippi man i didnt want to hear one stanza about starcrossed lovers i put up that shovel for you i paused for a moment in front of the greenhouse what uh sure thanks rufus mumbled you ought to be more careful with your tools rufus i nearly tripped over it out here rufus blinked at me what the hell are you talkin about jordan that shovel i left propped by your toolroom door didnt you see it no he rubbed his scraggly chin with a begrimed hand i dont leave my tools lying around theyll rust out in the rains we get all the time oh well someone else mustve left it there werent no shovel when i came back here his gaze left mine and he busied his hands above a table cluttered with junk and plant cuttings well whatever wheres a good place to go for a walk now rufus beaulac looked at me and his eyes narrowed what you want to go amblin around for why wouldnt i its a beautiful day i didnt add i wanted to escape the tension in the house the unease that had smoked through the rooms even before lollys deathand my own sick feelings of remorse i need some exercise you want to help me dig up some flowers for lollys service thatd give you plenty exercise listen rufus id be glad to help you after lunch but right now i just want to know is there a good walking trail along the island is there or isnt there little hot for wanderin around and we got enough trouble without you headin off just to get lost yeah he doesnt want me exploring this island annoyance tinged his words more than if i was simply a pest i guess ill just find my own path thanks i pivoted to leave this aint no resort he answered rudely theres a kind of path that goes above the beach dont stray from it rattlesnakes and cottonmouths around here he smiled a bleak grin they got a real taste for collegeboy flesh aint nothin a cottonmouth likes more than sinkin their fangs into some idiot too overeddicated to know better than to stay away from what aint his business snakes on an island yeah theyse some here theyre all over matagorda island too you be careful serious jordan the cottonmouths like the sides of pools ditches anyplace theyse a little water you set careful foot there hear yes i absolutely hate snakes and tried to keep the tremor from my voice and the rattlersyou hear that buzz you step light yeah they like thick clumps of weeds and grass where they little mouse friends live you get bit we got maybe just enough time to get you to port oconnor maybe he grinned his gums looking discolored in the faint light of the greenhouse thanks for the warning i retorted hurrying off before further horrors could be suggested rufus might be full of it i decided i had never heard of cottonmouths on offshore islands but what did i know maybe he just wanted to put me off walking around the island where no one could keep an eye on me pure and simple rufus didnt want me snooping around sangre island i resolved to find out why the pathand i use the term rather looselyrufus described was the one wed taken up from the dock on the beach little more than grass worn away sand mixed with crushed shells littler dunes engulfed in the fleeting beauty of colorful wildflowers and matted with hardier twining plants lay behind the main dune ridge the flatlands behind the ridge were grassy and thick with shrubs the wind was a constant companion bowing all in its path i walked down the trail well past the empty dock when was uncle mutt due back i felt with him gone the family was hardly more than an unsupervised classroom ready to erupt into anarchy the wind surged cooling my skin and easing the smothering humidity long strands of cloud stretched across the formerly empty sky my clothes had started adhering to my skin uncomfortably during my latest exchange with aunt sass and i pulled my tshirts fabric away from my back i didnt let my eyes stray far from the path just in case rufus was correct about snakes i hate snakes really and truly i pulled a pair of sunglasses from my shorts pocket and donned them the path became entirely a figment as i reached a small bend out of sight from the house the shore here was sandy dotted with beached shells i watched a small crab pale skitter from my approach and vanish into a burrow with the house out of sight and the only sound my own breathing and the hard whisper of the wind caressing sangre i could imagine myself miles away from any people it might make a good place for sunning with candace but the idea of lounging in the bright summer air didnt seem appropriate with poor aunt lolly dead and with so much unresolved between bob don and me i peered and puttered for a while then climbed up a slide of sand and high grass into the scrubby flatland sand kissed everything i wandered for a while listening to the distant caws and cries of the seagullsand keeping my ears open for any rattling noises profusions of groundsel shrubs small plants saltgrass and a rainbow of wildflowers covered the land a colony of stubby darkbarked huisache trees not quite as tall as my head swayed in the quickening breeze black mounds of sprawling macartney roseid been told it once served as living barbed wire on area islandsdotted the land its bloom seemed already past and bob don had warned me about the briars pesky thorns i breathed in the air of isolation the island was rough in its beauty but i could see why mutt put up with all the difficulties of living here having to import most of his potable water horrendously expensive electrical service the inconvenience of always being a boat ride away from civilization the quiet the beauty were worth it all i walked through a thick motte of live oaks the air felt moist and stifling mosquitoes swarmed and i slapped at my neck and legs repeatedly cursing myself for not having the foresight to douse thoroughly with repellent no help for it now i pinched my lips together and forged ahead i found a small clearing near what i would have guessed was the islands center it opened up from a precut path lined with thickets of saltcedar trees that would have been far easier to take than the way rufus pointed me silly old toot i saw an old wroughtiron fence squaring off a section of land tombs stood cluttered within the fences borders most of them aboveground in the boxy marble style of interments id seen in galveston and new orleans wild spurts of grasses and small pointed bursts of spanish dagger separated the stone monuments i unlatched the gate and opened it the creak of its hinges sounded eerie in the hushed wind almost like a human cry the first mounds were marked with a standard stone tombstone here lie two confederate soldiers known only to god november the marker appeared much more recent than the graves themselves added at a later date i wondered if these men died in the actions in matagorda bay when union general nathaniel banks launched his major offensive against the texas coast matagorda bay had been in the thick of the fighting another memorial this one a spire of hill country granite topped with a decorative anchor was in memory of the crew of the texas ship reliant lost in battle no doubt the memorial owed its existence to mutts fascination with the past i found myself wondering how this island had stayed out of government hands remaining in private fortunes id heard of the federal government seizing islands in the matagorda area condemning the homes and kicking off families that had been there for generations too little to bother with not of strategic importance i thought of the dead men in the sunken hull of the reliant off the coast had they thought this island mattered had they watched it as their boat cracked and sank a refuge out of their reach as the mexicans closed in cannons roaring i had studied texas history as a boy and knew that neither side offered the other much clemency when captives fell into enemy hands the massacres of goliad and the alamo did not encourage kindness toward the foe the butchered boys on the beach of sangre island served merely as another reminder of the casual cruelty of war i strolled past other graves and tombs apparently someone had lived on sangre since texas became a republic for there were additional memorials one family the merciers seemed to have held the island the longest i squatted before their tombstones running my fingers over their weathered inscriptions the back corner held goertzes a simple elegant tomb topped by an angel reaching toward heaven was marked nora jean goertz fresh wildflowers newly picked rested below the inscription next to it was another marble tomb this one with a small statue of a boy apparently caught wandering along a beach barefoot with a basket of shells in his hand brian riley goertz too brief a time i ran my fingers along the inscription too brief a time here also fresh flowers lay against the engraved stone i thought of the brightly smiling bucktoothed boy in the photographs in lollys room in the corner an even rectangle was neatly staked out awaiting the shovel and the marble lollys memorial rufus or uncle mutt must have come out and already marked out the plot and perhaps left fresh flowers on brians and noras graves voices drifted toward me coming closer from down the path i circled the tombs feeling like a trespasser keeping the stone blocks between me and the new visitors the thick growth of saltcedars hid them from my view i didnt decide to hide among the dead until i heard one of the voices was philips ranting in hot anger i hunkered down in the dense grasses that divided two of the older tombs i prayed there wasnt a fireant mound nearby but none of the pests had invaded the territory of the dead i did manage to scrape my elbow good on a corner of nora goertzs tomb and winced at the sudden sharp pain i didnt have much time to inspect the wound philips baritone carried toward me on the neverending wind another softer voice answering his i lay flat in the tall grass not daring to peer around the monument my choices were few and what are you going to do if they spot you claim youre sunbathing in a graveyard i didnt have a clue i decided not to fret until the problem presented itself i inched my face around the corner of the tomb and saw them stroll past the saltcedars philip huffing along followedsurprisinglyby wendy tran he appeared angry she seemed fidgety even at this distance i could see her glance around nervously as though expecting unwanted visitors they stopped at the gate to the cemetery philip mopped his glistening forehead with a raggedy handkerchief wendy stopped and crossed her arms she said something i couldnt hear and looked back over her shoulder i ducked my head behind the tomb i couldnt see them and they i hoped hadnt seen me im not gonna keep you long philip said lunchll wait you got the money of course not i need more time philip her voice sounded tight and controlled i wondered if she was quite as placid as she acted in the comfort of her kitchen i dont have much time myself darlin i cant be waiting on you to work your magic if its gonna take all weekend philip mutts not here today i cant get the cash from him if hes gone arranging his sisters funeral no one planned for lolly to die maybe someone did philip spoke so softly that i could barely hear him sweat stung my eyes blood stuck dirt to my elbow and a mosquito roosted on my bare calf for lunch but i didnt dare move i could feel the thud of my heart against the earth wendy didnt answer immediately and for one sinking moment i thought id been spotted thats a horrible thing to say poor lolly yeah right philip snorted she was your aunt yeah and what was she to you sunshine just an old lady who wouldnt get out of your way silence held sway again and i wondered if wendy had left insulted at philips implication when she spoke her voice was as cool as the stone of the tombs you just talk to hear the sound of your own voice philip you cooked the food sunshine she died at the dinner table dont they always look hard at the chef she had a heart attack thats it wendys voice rose yeah she had a heart attack and uncle jakes heart medication is missing obviously i wasnt the only one pondering that fact wendy rushed into the momentary hush for gods sake jake used it all up you know how he snivels for his pills the mosquito cocktailing on my blood was joined by an afterwork gang of his fellow bugs i bit my lip and kept myself still if i moved overmuch or made too much noise i would be detectedby two people calmly discussing the possibility of murder i allowed myself one slow openmouthed breath the smell of the islandthe salt of the air the mixed perfumes of wildflowers the hint of pollen the subtle rank of my own sweatfilled my nose i willed myself not to sneeze you aint exactly been weeping and wailing since lolly died philip said and i suppose you wanted to come out here to dig her grave with your own grieving hands wendy paused and i watched an ant wobble curiously toward my face i tried not to imagine a diamondback slithering through the grasses and encountering my body like a big speed bump that would have to be surmounted philip didnt answer wendy and she continued play nice philip do you want me to help you or not oh sunshine its definitely in your best interest to help me out hate to see an eclipse happen to my sunshine you know thats bad luck i waited for another one of wendys characteristic pauses to greet this statement but she wasted no time dont even think of threatening me philip you dont have the money to write that checkso to speak she laughed a long brittle giggle i had never heard her laugh before and her coldness chilled my skin even in the humid heat ive got to go fix lunch for the family ill let you know when ive gotten the money until then leave me alone and let me do my job wendydo it well youll be amply rewarded philip sounded as though the words tasted bad in his mouth you neednt worry but i dont want you talking to me again unless its to ask whats for dinner im sure that wont arouse anyones suspicions oh and is anyone suspicious his voice held a nasty tone another wendy lull held then i heard i found jordan snooping in lollys closet this morning him i find suspicious generally what the hell was he doing there being a sneak i dont like the way hes ingratiating himself with mutt goddamn luck jordan would resemble the old coot and i caught the bastard buttering up mutt last night in the library uncle dears taken a liking to him jordans nothing but a smug little shit i cant have him interfering sunshine well nothing you can do about him the hell i cant philip rumbled four words to halt your breathing trust me i waited until i was sure theyd left no way i was venturing back down the path theyd come i wasnt risking that theyd stop to confer or plot or argueand id stumble up behind them a falsely amiable mask set on my face burrs in my hair out doing headstands in the meadow grass stains up and down my entire body slid into home during the softball tournament being held on the other side of the island i am not a skilled liarusuallyand i didnt want to manufacture a story instead of returning the way that i came i decided to support the fiction that id been exploring the whole island so i continued my trek across sangre to the side closest to the mainland here the ground seemed a bit damper with thickets of honey mesquites bright freckles of lavender texas vervain fuzzy violet coast mistfiowers and the yellowishgreen spotted horsemint speckling the land i held my arm away from my bodythe scrape was messy and i didnt want to get blood on my clothes i found a rough trail probably worn by rufus or tom on their island perambulations and headed back for the house i stumbled along the trail found one shady spot to sit and eased to the ground i figured i couldnt beat philip and wendy back to the house so i might as well saunter in late i wouldnt want them to wonder if i was lurking near their private confab i forced myself toward calm i closed my eyes wendy was chiseling money out of uncle mutt for philip i assumed shed nab a percentage for her services so the affectionate scene id witnessed between wendy and mutt in the kitchen was part of her ruse to wile away the cash from my uncle poor uncle mutt hed been thoroughly duped the look on his face as hed cradled wendy in his arms had been one of unmitigated bliss reflection on a lifetime of remembered joys hed held wendy as tenderly as if he were still a young man and he didnt have much time left for the physical pleasures i blinked uncle mutt was dying if philip needed money why didnt he just ask and why if unwilling to ask didnt he wait for the few months uncle mutt had left either philip suspected he wasnt likely to benefit from uncle mutts will or there was another time pressure on him for cash uncle mutt had referred repeatedly to philips business ineptitude i supposed that once again philip had bottomed out and uncle mutt refused to line the coffers i decided it was time if possible to learn more about philips business ventures he was from corpus christi i should start my inquiries there dealing with my uncle was another matter uncle mutt might easily believe philip was up to no good but would he accept wendys involvement in these machinations i had no proofand no idea how wendy planned to pry the funds from uncle mutts wallet it depended on how much money was at stake a few hundred a few thousand a million i blew out exasperated breath my stomach rumbled i stood and headed back toward the dock time to see what wendy had cooked up for lunch id have preferred to know what she was concocting for my unsuspecting greatuncle i dont have a career in espionage awaiting me i snuck in the front door thinking wendy would be occupied in the kitchen wrong she spotted me entering the house she was setting the table in the dining room and she raised a perfect eyebrow at meme with my dirtied clothes and bloodied arm good lord what happened to you i shrugged i was exploring and i took a tumble down a dune i scraped my arm on a shell or something im okay as soon as i manufactured this fib i thought shouldnt you have a little more sand in your hair and clothes and in the wound wendy didnt appear to notice my relatively sandfree state she examined my arm critically weve got a firstaid kit in the kitchen ill clean that up for you or ill find deborah shed probably be insulted if i didnt let her exercise her vocation ill tend to it myself i blurted this woman made me uneasy wendy was no cowering servant girl from a victorian novel the coldness of her laugh the educated way in which she spoke the assurance she showed in dealing with philipit was a combination that didnt lend itself to domestic duties and id detected concern in her voice for my injury who was this woman her perfect eyebrow arched again unless youre limber enough to kiss your elbow you cant tend to this here sit down i waited while she fetched the firstaid kit she cleaned the wound tsking as she did so thats a big scrape jordan you want to be careful and keep it disinfected i watched while she spread medication across the skinned arm and taped bandages to it her touch was surprisingly tender thanks i said as she finished ill try not to be such a klutz she closed the firstaid kit with a click and regarded me with curious eyes the phone rang and she sighed probably another person calling to offer sympathy for lollys death i think everyone in calhoun county must be worried over mutt its nice to be liked i offered she shrugged hes important i dont know if thats the same as being liked she answered the phone softly explained that mutt was unavailable and began to make sympathetic assurances into the receiver after a few moments she thanked the caller jotted down the name and number and hung up the phone all that concern for the living she said half to herself she glanced up at me they dont worry about the dead theyre beyond worry i offered the words rang horribly callous to me and i blushed youre right we can only help the living thats a favorite saying of mutts her gaze seemed locked on some faraway object and i felt the unintended sting of her words bob don was living the man i called daddy was dead my mother was dead too although she maintained an illusion of life by filling her lungs with air and pumping blood through her veins but the thoughts that wandered through her brain were homeless and illformed and her memories were warped and unplayable like a vinyl record album melted by the sun it wasnt life we can only help the living wendy saw pain in my face and gracefully changed the subject im afraid lunch isnt fancysalad and sandwiches it should be ready in a few minutes thanks i said ill just go get cleaned up i excused myself and sauntered up the stairs a backward glance told me wendy eyed me speculatively as though she found the story of my injury doubtful had she and philip seen me in the grass and just played a joke on me my name had come up rather abruptly and i hadnt spied on them the whole time to see if theyd spotted me i paused on the stairs i could feel the weight of uncle jakes stare on my back i glanced over my shoulder he was watching me with the cool glare of someone who has seen a lot of pain in his life your daddys upstairs i believe he said softly oh god had he heard the venomous argument between sass and me the greenhouse after all was his favorite haunt i wasnt eager to have my problems become fodder for this familys discussions thanks maybe ill go talk to him i could think of no other answer to offer think thatd be a good idea boy fathers and sons shouldnt be so far apart he thumped an arthritic hand against the pages of his book his fingers curled like a talon your father had a hard enough time with his daddy dont make history repeat itself i think history always does repeat itself i said we seem to make the same mistakes over and over again this family this island yes jakes eyes glittered with the hard light of truth youre a perceptive boy an unaccountable shudder ran along my spine creepy old man sitting in the library like some warped oracle i wanted to be away from him see you later uncle jake i said and scurried up the steps i could feel the weight of his incessant stare on my shoulders as dreadful as the gaze of a dead orb instead of going to my room or to bob dons i headed to candace s i knocked on her door her voice strained bade me wait a moment then i heard the sound of a toilet flushing and water gurgling in a sink she opened the door with a damp washcloth pressed to her chin her skin was pale and her eyes had trouble focusing on me hey whats wrong i asked she turned and sat on the bed from the bathroom i could smell the faint sour odor of vomit oh im okay i ate a snack that didnt agree with me im fine all the talk of poison made my heart stop at the mention of distasteful food you sure ill get deborah to take a look at you no i dont need deborah ill be fine really its nothing just let me lie down for a bit wendys fixing lunch how about some soup sugar uh no im really not hungry she rubbed her eyes and sighed whatd you eat what i took her hand eat what did you eat that made you feel queasy its really nothing jordan i wish you wouldnt conduct the spanish inquisition over this i think i ate some bad cheese or something im fine she lay down on the bed and noticed my bandaged arm for the first time what happened to you i closed her bedroom door candace doesnt approve of me sticking my nose into other folks business and i didnt want to admit to my recent exploration of the island my discovery of the graveyard and the conversation between philip and wendy so i told her the same story id fed wendy good lord well be careful candace covered her eyes with her wet terrycloth veil but her tone of voice let me know she was staring at me right through the cloth women can do that you know maybe you shouldnt traipse around this island alone its fun like a boyhood adventure i feel like tom sawyer or huck finn i tried to sound carefree she raised one corner of the cloth to fix a baleful eye on me you quit being a boy quite a while back darling at least i hope so your behavior doesnt always support that conclusion youre no fun have you apologized to aunt sass i tried we were getting along fine until she started chewing my ass out for not letting bob don in my life like she knows anything about it i didnt elaborate on sasss rather valid reasons for disliking me i wasnt too crazy about myself at the moment i walked over to the window the bay draws you like a magnet especially if you grew up never seeing water wider than a river or a little lakeand contemplated the ceaseless rhythm of the waves a long groan emanated from beneath the wet towel jordan please i dont feel good i dont want to hear you gripe about aunt sass just right this minute maybe later in the day so ill have something to look forward to candace can be a tad sharptongued but this was a new level of cattiness even for her well she said she wasnt feeling good and here i was blabbing away ill let you rest you let me know if you feel up to any lunch okay sure thanks jordan im sorryi dont mean to be snappish i think ill just take me a little nap i patted her hand and left her to rest no excuses now i went down to the second floor and stopped in front of bob don and gretchens room i knocked gently no answer i tried the door found it unlocked and eased it open gretchen lay softly snoring on the bed one arm thrown away from her body her small mouth agape at least she was sleeping off the booze after she was herself again we could start to help her help her the very thought rang alien when applied to gretchen shed been a shrew to me the first few months that id learned bob don was my father shed resented me belittled me bullied me and attempted to blacken my character in mirabeau but shed changed slowly as the sobriety took hold shed lived her life according to reason rather than rum shed had to reevaluate her priorities and her choices its easy to make horrendous decisions when youre ablaze with drink shed extinguished the fire of her addictionor at least the blinding burning heat of her cravingand laboriously rebuilt her life and even given our ongoing verbal skirmishes shed accepted me i wasnt a drunk i wasnt a terribly bitter person why couldntchange why couldnt i shed the anger the fear the shock that bob don was my father and proceed apace with my life fuck you you re not worthy to be his son the words still stung like the salt of tears on a childhood cut score one for sass if god stripped the flesh from my frame right now hed find a blackened mark across my ribs shed nicked the tenderest part of my heart unbidden the memory came of bob don barreling into my house smashing in a door to race to my aid a murderers gun swinging toward him the harsh unforgiving blast of the pistol the dread crimson blossoming across his big chest and the stunned light of realization in his eyes as he collapsed to the floor youre a mistake the mistake i decided as i watched gretchen sleep was letting sass bully me no more id stand my ground and if she didnt like it tough i only had to get through lollys funeral and then candace and i were out of here id never have to lay eyes on sass or philip or any of this misbegotten crew again id swim to my nice quiet side of the gene pool and trouble them no more i was gently shutting the door when i saw it a small framed photo standing on the table by the lamp it drew me like metal to magnet the girl was perhaps twelve years old the wind whipping her brown hair about her head the set of the eyes the determined mouth the perfect skini was sure this was deborah and next to her brian perhaps four years younger embraced her he was talking to her unaware of the camera his face in profile dark locks curling about his brow his nose pert his cheeks the ruddy red that only irish blood supplies he looked happy laughing with his big sister i studied the picture gretchen mumbled and stirred in her sleep i retreated the picture in my hands and eased the door shut behind me i hadnt finished my conversation with deborah the fight between tom and aubrey had cut it short i left the photo in my room and decided now would be a good time to wrap up that talk i found deborah among a tense quiet group in the kitchen this was not to be a convivial summertime lunch why should it be with aunt lolly dead uncle mutt ill aubrey and tom feuding philip and wendy conniving deborah sneaking uncle jake complaining sass terrorizing bob don moping candace vomiting and gretchen drinkingwith all that i didnt feel like a party wendy was assembling sandwiches while aubrey watched sipping selfrighteously on a coke deborah fixed iced tea and philip nursed a bloody mary all conversation ceased when i walked in hi i offered hows the arm feeling deborah glanced toward my bandage wendy mentioned you took a nasty scrape im fine i made my voice sound hearty and forced my smile to its greatest width apparently my fake enthusiasm was contagious cousin jordan philip boomed a cordial smile splitting his face i wondered if the vodka had put it there im afraid i owe you an apology i spoke rather harshly to you this morning and i really didnt mean to weve just had so many shocks lately i just wasnt myself my apologies he offered his hand i hesitated then presented mine in return he attempted to squeeze my fingers to bone dust with the fervor of his handshake but i kept my smile in place i dont have any hard feelings philip i dont expect yall to just usher me right into the family silence greeted this announcement confession time im not the worlds easiest person to get along with and i know lollys death has put a terrible strain on us all especially yall since you all knew and loved her sorrowful glanceseven from philip and aubreywere exchanged among the gathered and i sensed for the first time that despite all the travail and difficulties the goertzes still saw themselves as a family dysfunctional in the extreme perhaps but still connected by ties of blood and affection not healthy troubled by some deep tumor within the familial body but willing to live aubrey turned toward me and i saw the bandage on his forehead and the cleaned cut on his lip one cheek had bruised beautifully its colors like a tropical sunset ill apologize right now for my mother jordan shes had no call to treat you the way she has i dont know whats gotten hold of her i shrugged she and i both care a lot about bob don shes worried im hurting him shes probably right i could hurt him and hed never tell me bob don and i dont talk real honestly a lot of the time i quieted embarrassed at my sudden rush of confession philip coughed listen jordan aunt sass has dealt out enough pain on her own he surprised me by putting a protective arm around aubrey she dont got no call to be rough on you just because she cant come to grips with bob don keeping you a secret i fumbled for an answer im sure aunt sass has bob dons best interests at heart aubrey i really dont mean to quarrel with your mother but she lectures without knowing the complete story did she tell yall he nearly died for me did she paint me as an ingrate an unfeeling bastard i dont mean to be one i dont thats a goertz family failing deborah spoke quietly you get accustomed to the endless advice after a while is that advice i asked and for one moment there was a dead hush then wendy tittered and fullscale laughter broke out even philip joinedor pretended to joinin i felt the slightest bit more accepted but i couldnt help but wonder what might motivate this new friendliness toward me i didnt think an upsurge of appreciation for my wit and good manners had conquered their hearts i could almost hear candace chiding me for senseless paranoia lunch was a casual affair the small group sitting around the big table eating sandwiches and sipping tea uncle jake joined us but seemed content to chew and growl occasionally he opted not to cast his ominous gaze my way rufus and tom did not appear i said gretchen was resting no one contradicted my story and that candace was feeling a little ill bob don and sass hurried out past our gathering coming down the stairs a lump coagulated in my heart as they left not glancing toward us or even acknowledging our presence the quiet seemed thick and i decided to break it id decided to start investigating philips business concerns there was no time like the present what line of work you in philip he took several extra seconds chewing his already thoroughly masticated sandwich before answering investments of a sort aubrey pursed his lips of a sort is right all the wrong sort now aubrey be nice and after i took up for you with tom philip quickly bit off another chunk of bread and roast beef to keep from elaborating on his trade i didnt relent municipals moneymarket funds you work for one of the big national shops philip swallowed and took a long sample of his bloody mary he chomped an inch off the celery stalk if food was his delaying tactic i could wait longer than he could chew actually all of em i serve as an adviser to the wealthy folks along the coast help em diversify their holdings uncle mutt used to be philips biggest customer aubrey offered with a smile used to be kindly keep my clientele private aubrey philip said he stuck the mangled celery back in the glass of murky tomato juice i nibbled at my sandwich now i had a handle on what might have transpired between philip and mutt mutt invested money philip lost or mishandled it mutt withdrew his support philip needed cash how much money had philip lost for mutt surely mutt was too clever to entrust philip with much i wouldnt give him my loose change i clicked my tongue against the back of my teeth watching philip fidget in his chair deborah diverted the conversation broaching that safest of texas subjects highschool football philip took the lead and proffered endless opinions on the chances of teams along the coast this fall uncle jake snorted at the new topic he opened his mouth as if to speak then closed it thoughtfully and slowly i felt like wed just been spared the dragons flaming breath his eyes met mine for the briefest of moments and i thought his glance said ain t buying this shit from philip are you the discussion of football quickly waned so i forged into the rough waters i have to admit coming here has been full of surprises like finding out that gretchen was married to bob dons brother deborah fixed a steely gaze on me i thought you and i had already covered that story jordan i just wondered why it was never mentioned to me before by either it wasnt mentioned because its a painful subject deborah stood i dont really want to talk about anything regarding my father anymore if you dont mind im sorry deborah i didnt think its one of my greatest failings i felt blood redden my face candacell tell you i always manage to taste my own shoe leather at least once a day thats not such a bad crime deborah said her voice softening the light from the window played along the glints in her hair and i could see the smudges beneath her eyes she suddenly looked very tired and older than her years uncle jake whod been so unusually quiet spoke i dont see what the big deal is about not talking about paul god knows weve exhausted that subject before its probably due for a fresh beating uncle jake its painful for me to talk about dad deborah shoved her plate away from her id hate to do anything to impinge on your martyrdom uncle jake replied thats uncalled for aubrey interrupted uncle jake you must be feeling tuckered out why dont you go take a nice nap when youve lived as long as i have deb you can bitch about how sad life is you aint hardly shed your first tears lots more comin for you uncle jake coughed a deep rheumy noise deborah smiled thinly her teeth even white stones against her trembling lip uncle jake i truly fail to understand why god is taking uncle mutt and leaving you around way past your time good god deborah i exclaimed philip aubrey and wendy were stunned to silence jake stared at deborah with birdbright eyes he leaned forward on his cane as if insatiably curious for what she might say next dont jordan deborah said softly dont take up for jake you dont know what a sick old man he is how mutt and lolly endure himshe broke into a strangled soti dont know i cant stand to be in a room more than a minute with him and im sick of pretending that i can deb jake raised a hand in supplication toward her youre barely kin so what if you were my greatgrandmothers brother i never knew her im supposed to care about you your feelings when youve never shown the slightest regard for another human being in your life you sit there and tell me not to feel pain after my dad vanished and my mom died and my brother died she wiped tears away with the back of her hand no one can suffer but you wrong old man you sour everything you come near she stood i think ill go see how candace is feeling she turned and we heard the patter of her feet on the stairs jake did not look at us he rose leaned on his cane and slowly made his way to the diningroom door he glanced back showing only his craggy profile his gaze firmly fixed on the polished hardwood floor i shouldnt have read that book on tough love ive upset deb im sorry to have ruined everyones lunch uncle jake aubrey began but jake shook his head bitter old fool that little girl has no idea how much i really love her he turned on his cane and went across toward the study his movements brittle with age he eased the door closed behind him aubrey and wendy quietly began to clear the plates philip followed them into the kitchen and i could hear the soft murmurs of their voices i am a wellmeaning idiot sometimes if i couldnt heal the rift thatd divided sass and me perhaps i could help deborah and jake i crossed to the study door raising my knuckles to knock and held them still when i heard jakes low cadaverous laughter as though he were giggling at some profoundly funny joke my head ached and i felt slightly ill my self i didnt relish further talks with a nut like uncle jake and i wasnt about to go chasing around the island to find out what bob don and aunt sass were doing so i retreated to my room and lay on the coolness of the cotton quilt covering my bed i wondered idly if goertz hands from long ago had shaped the quilt with the crisscrosses of intrigue lies and deception that seemed to stitch this house together the idea that anything fashioned by goertzes could provide a momentary refuge made me laugh i stared at the ceiling until my eyes began to feel heavy with sleep the only noise in the room was the soft rise of my breath and the counterpoint of the waves of matagorda bay crashing into the sand i was nearly asleep when my skin prickled and i felt and i will swear to this until the day i diea gentle stroke of a finger across my closed eyelids i didnt move i didnt open my eyes my whole body felt as though it would sink through the quilt if i remained motionless i waited for the telltale footstep the hiss of human breath the creak of a floorboard to reassure me that id simply dozed and while unawares candace or bob don or someone else had ventured into my room to awaken me silence i remembered to breathe slowly i opened my eyes light filtering in from the old and faded curtains held dust motes in its grasp and i watched them spin my face felt warm and crinkly sure signs of a summer nap id probably just dozed off and dreamed i fingered the corners of my eyelids but there was no sleep grit in them to clean away i sat up on the bed my mind still fuzzy i hadnt slept well since our arrival and the unrelenting feeling in this houseof tensions smoldering ready to burst into crisp flamemade me edgy occupied with my own fears about meeting my new family i hadnt thought objectively about what might be transpiring within these walls forces i didnt yet understand warped this family tree i scooted so i could lean back against the polished headboard and got comfortable for a long hard think uncle mutt was dying my throat tightened at the thought id no doubt that there was much to disapprove of about emmett goertzhe was a womanizer a bit of a dictator a fellow whod stake unholy odds in a poker game to win an island i wondered if he would have obliterated the family fortune if hed lost that particular hand of cards but at the same time he had a warmth and a gentleness about him that drew folks to him for all the acrid dislike that volleyed between the goertzes uncle mutt avoided the venom i wasnt sure if it was because of his undeniable charisma or because he held the fat wallet and with him dying a vast fortune tottered above grasping hands he had no children he had never married assuming that he wasnt leaving his entire wealth to charities or pet causes surely enough money was available for everyonefrom tom to aunt sassto come into substantial funds assuming of course that uncle mutt equitably distributed his money i knew nothing about his will except that he had mentioned lollys death would force him to rethink his legacies perhaps hed intended to leave most to his sister if so had the rest of the family known that lolly stood between them and millions within thirty minutes of uncle mutts announcement to the whole family that he was terminally ill aunt lolly died by a means that technically could have fallen under suicide or of course she simply had a heart attack but now i didnt believe lolly took her own life aubrey contended that she was either actually mentally ill or dominating her family through her ruse of eccentricity if she was sick she might be suicidal but if she was unrelenting in her need for control i didnt reckon an egoist like aunt lolly would ever kill herself it would mean ringing down the curtain on her starring role and leaving sweetie her devotion to her little dog seemed comical when she was alive but i didnt doubt for a second that it was genuine not to mention that her death came along with viciously threatening letters to me a doping of gretchens drink to drive her back to the bottle and philips scam to hustle money out of mutt much seemed afoot so if lolly hadnt taken her own life shed either been murdered or died of natural causes if her heart couldnt bear the news that mutt was dying wouldnt her attack have been far more sudden i knew nothing about heart seizures but i supposed she would have keeled over at the news if prone to episodes only the autopsy could answer that question if the verdict was natural causes then we could continue our mourningas it existed and the grief in this house was frighteningly eerily minimaland the deathwatch over uncle mutt could begin again if murderthere was one less heir to contend with a prickle of fear ran along my back one less heir and here i was an unexpected addition to the rank of possible legatees unwanted unwelcome and aubrey wendy and philip had already commented on uncle mutts warming reception toward me i didnt want his fortune i wouldnt have turned money away if it came into my hands but i had come to this island looking for lost parts of myself not cash i thought of uncle mutt unseen unknown watching me during that longago juniorhigh baseball game i could picture him standing next to bob don in the weathered gray bleachers shading his face with the flat of his hand while he watched a skinny blond boy pound a fist into his shortstops glove and shout encouragement to the pitcher i thought it likely he had silently sent his own cheers to me and wasnt bob don cheering you too i forced my mind back to the issue at hand with uncle mutt gone i suspected the very heart and center of the goertz family would be gone too i found it hard to envision deborah dropping in on philip for a long weekend visit or uncle jake calling up aubrey just to see how his next book was coming would the members of this family wander away from each other once the common center of gravity vanished make the leap i told myself assume lolly was murdered who had motive and opportunity i got up and walked to the window and opened it the bracing sea breeze wafted over my face heavy with the smell of salt fish and time i ran down a mental list of motives uncle mutt i couldnt see any reason why hed want his sister dead and he seemed genuinely distressed and troubled over her death besides he was dying the concerns of the living were only his for a short while i thought i could strike him from my list uncle jake he struck me as an ornery demanding even calculating man and if lolly had been poisoned his digoxin medication was the likely source of the fatal dose he would have had plenty of opportunity to amass a deadly amount of digitalis with jake the stickler was motive he had no reason to wish lolly dead aunt sass my initial dislike for sass hadnt budged much she outright hated me for how id treated bob don and she obviously resented anyone who encroached on what she considered rightfully hers and aubreys my status as newest family member had earned me only loathing as far as she went and aubrey had mentioned that aunt sass was devoted to lollybut i couldnt help but remember the standoffish stance sass assumed as lolly lay croaking her last words aubreys claim that sass was inordinately fond of lolly might be a diversion from a far more unpleasant truth aubrey his uninspired platitudes covered a much more subtle mind than id initially suspected and his row with tomand the venom that followedsuggested aubrey had a mean streak that his glib selfhelp rigmarole belied hed survived as a runaway for two years and could no doubt take care of himself hed angered most of the clan with his plan to write a book on families and he was already in violent conflict with one family member tom and i wondered if his devotion to his mother might include doing her bidding even if the cost was another human life tom the quietest member of the family had also shown the most violent temperament his pale eyes made me uneasy with their furtive glances he would have i was convinced beaten aubrey senseless if deborah and i had not intervened his own unwillingness to explain his actions doubled my apprehension tom was a tightly reined fury biding time for release had lolly gotten in his way hed brought down the empty bottle of heart medication after her death placing his fingerprints on it were they already there before the tragic dinner i could almost imagine those cold pale eyes watching the pills spill into his open palm measuring out a dollop of death philip he was at crosspurposes with uncle mutt over some failed financial venture i believed i needed to know more and his odd partnership with wendy tran to chisel money away from uncle mutt only heightened in my mind suspicion on him for lollys death wouldnt one crime naturally link to another within this closed group why did he need money nowl why not simply wait until uncle mutt was dead and buried even if his alleged mismanagement of uncle mutts money meant he didnt benefit under the will philip could hit up one of his more favored relatives for a needed loan and i could hardly forget that truecrime story of digitalis poisoning subtly slipped back on the shelf by philips own hand he quickly vaulted to the top of my suspect list deborah her quick and easy friendship with candace her supportiveness of gretchens sobriety and her openness toward me had won me over but id still seen her sneak into lollys room with distinct slyness her unwillingness to talk much about her own branch of the family trees tragic past her complicated relationship with lolly and her row with jake made me wonder if even darker secrets lurked there and my liking for her aside she was a nurse shed know better than anyone the amount of digoxin needed to silence lolly forever rufus i couldnt quite fathom how rufus beaulac could have possibly benefited from lollys death but an unquiet thought about him disturbed me first he struck me as a man much like a lapdog hed do the bidding of whoever he considered as medieval as it sounds his master id no doubt that uncle mutts ego was fueled to a degree by rufuss loyalty i wondered if when uncle mutt found a task too distasteful rufus became his errand boy with a shudder i envisioned rufus nodding slightly as uncle mutt told him to get rid of lolly i didnt believe rufus would use poison his methods would be far more direct unless of course his hands were directed by uncle mutt or some other intelligence wendy i thought her beautiful and dangerous like a blossoming rose with piercing thorns one moment she was leaning against uncle mutt in the casual caress of a lover the next she was conniving with philip to bilk mutt i did not like her or trust her and i could easily imagine her poisoning anyone who got in her way alsoshe had the greatest opportunity shed prepared the food wed eaten and even though wed dined buffet style had she managed to give lolly a select deadly portion gretchen and bob don of course i didnt suspect them while gretchen had proved in the past she could scheme with the best of them i did not believe her capable of murder and bob don the very idea was ridiculous but they were as inexorably caught up in the wireedged web of this familys pain as any of the others gretchens past with bob dons brother paul still seemed a sore wound and bob dons own ignoring of sasss numerous faults might blind them to further tragedies i was convinced gretchens drunkeness wasnt due to her own failure but rather to the cruelty of one of our own i resolved to protect bob don and gretchen from whoever might have targeted them for such vicious behavior and was that person necessarily lollys killer lolly had sent me terrifying mail had she terrorized anyone else if so had that other victim struck back with annihilating force i also weighed the possibility that lolly wasnt the intended victim poison can be used with uncertain aim what if someone else at the dinner table was the mark and even if i dismissed that possibility and accepted lolly as the target for the digitalis i had hardly considered the puzzle of opportunity the family had bustled in and out of the dining room before the meal candace claimed only lolly had drunk red wine and a fair amount of it i remembered her arm lashing out in her initial convulsion spilling her wine across the snowy tablecloth if jakes digoxin pills were the source the capsules could have been opened and emptied into lollys wine but when if lollys dinnertime cocktail was consistently a red wine that no one else touched i needed to ask some hard hard questions someone had the time to dope her wine or her food i rubbed my temples my theories were all well and good but they were more insubstantial than the ocean spray that scented the air i didnt have proof and i didnt have a clear path to follow to a suspect and no confirmation that lolly had even been murdered if it was foul play no doubt the police here would catch the murderer after all it had to be one of us and while they completed their investigation we might all be stuck on this island a lot longer than anyone had plannedtrapped with a murderer cold enough to kill within his or her own family i decided to check on gretchen and found her in her room drinking a large glass of ice water can i come in i asked she didnt answer but closed her eyes and placed the cool glass against her forehead i ventured inside her room shutting the door behind me and stood before her bed how do you feel i asked she sat on the edge of her mattress and didnt look at me gretchen i tried to keep the irritation out of my voice her earlier painfilled confession made me more patient than my hairtrigger temper generally allowed i didnt want her to hurt any more bob don said you think someone spiked my soda with alcohol her tone was colorless and flat yes unless youve changed your story about what happened no not at all she rubbed her cheek with her hand as though stinging from an invisible slap i dont know why anyone would slip me a mickey though i chose my words carefully although no one here seems willing to admit the possibility quite yet i think lolly was poisoned gretchens head jerked up shock lighting her eyes i continued if someone here was cruel enough to kill her spiking your drink for a laugh wouldnt be hard to imagine she stared at me darkness bagged the skin beneath her eyes she absently rubbed the hollow of her throat but the family always wanted me to be sober whats the point of derailing me they cant derail you not if you dont let them i sounded like aubrey but i didnt know what else to say meaningless advice worksat least to assuage the givers guilt the ploy didnt play gretchen answered me with a hard smile youre being awfully nice i guess its easy for you to feel superior to me right now her voice had taken on an unpleasant edge i was all too familiar with what i can see the goddamned pity in your face jordan youre just looking at me like im a worthless drunk all over again that is about as far from truth as you could wander gretchen ive been worried about you she shook her head and stared again at the window and its bright canvas of sky how could you worry about me after all the bad blood thats passed between us i dont know its not like you and i have ever been close and we may never be but i know how hard youve worked for your sobriety and it pisses me off beyond belief that anyone would casually shove you toward the bottle we never have been close she murmured echoing my words she tented her hands before her face hiding her eyes from me breathing in her own breath do you know how much i loved bob don when i first met him how painful it was not to be with him because you were married to his brother i asked no jordan because he wore too much plaid she snapped my heart lifted a littleshe still had a sense of humor albeit twisted i didnt answer i only laughed softly she laughed too but an undercurrent of deep sadness cooled any frivolity in her voice she continued yes and paul wasnt a good man he was empty inside i dont know how else to describe it deborah would never speak ill of himshes kept only the kind memories of her daddy but bob don was so different from paul she lowered her hands and tears glimmered in her eyes i thought if i could be with bob don id never do anything to ruin it and when id divorced paul and married bob don i was the happiest woman alive until the booze stole my life i remembered once when bob don had told me that gretchen drank because she suspected someone mattered more in his life than she didthat person being me his secret son now i wondered if there wasnt another reason locked in the meshwork of relationships between gretchen and the goertz brothers so why did you start to drink gretchen a terrible question finally asked her lips pale and clean of her usual makeup trembled what does it matter now i drank i craved it and i drank my fill every day for years she stood and crossed to the window she laughed a low throaty chuckle im amazed my livers still with me remember the bad flu epidemic several years ago i got terribly sick and i still drank bob don had to put me into the hospital in austin he didnt want everyone in mirabeau to know how bad off i was protecting my reputation which was like holding rainwater in a leaky barrel i probably should have died then i didnt i got a second chance and were not going to let anyone take that away from you i reached outvery tentatively like petting a spiderand touched her shoulder she flinched at my fingers i promise you jordan im not lying im not i didnt intend to drink i didnt spike my own soda i believe you and were going to find out who messed with you she heard the anger heating my voice i dont need you to be my knight little boy did you know lolly was screwing with my head i dont know why i felt the need to share my own sorrows with her but i quickly related the story of the vicious hate mail id received you didnt say how you knew it was lolly she finally said her shoulder trembled under my touch i found another hate letter in her closet i had forgotten that explaining how i knew my torturers identity would mean confessing to searching lollys room she was a rotten bitch gretchen said her voice sounded like she was uttering a prayer she hated me for hurting paul he was her pet her joy she never had children of her own and she loved paul like he was hers strange because god knows no one else could abide him she could never forgive him for what he became she glanced over her shoulder at me one stray lock of grayish hair dangling in her forehead and i saw then that she must have been a strikingly pretty girl her beauty was only an echo now though distorted by time and the havoc shed wreaked upon herself i wished she would answer my question as to her drinking trigger from so long ago i tried again so whyd you start drinking pauls positive influence she searched my face for what i didnt know ii dont want to discuss this anymore i cant cant why i stiffened does it have to do with bob don playing detective again she ventured a half smile you neednt bother on my behalf and as far as whoever spiked my dr pepper i plan to track down that particular skunk myself you might need a little help i might but my brains not so pickled i cant figure out whos screwing with me her mouth set in a fierce line and from my own experience i nearly felt sorry for whoever had dared to tangle with gretchen revenge was her best dish i wanted to talk with deborah again but she was napping in her room and i didnt disturb her candace still felt unwell and lay on her bed paging through an old issue of southern living i offered to bring her up some lunch but she said shed had a glass of tea and some crackers and felt better i left her to her magazine and went in search of bob don i found him alone on the porch sitting on the swing the bright chain that connected the swing to the porch ceiling squeaked quietly as he rocked back and forth i stood in the doorway watching him this man whod come in and completely capsized my life in the rough waters of truth the breeze from the bay blowing with greater force now ruffled his hair and he looked like a little boy forlorn without his playmates i came and sat next to him we rocked quietly for a moment i just talked with gretchen shes awake and feeling somewhat better i offered i know i took her some water to drink earlier his voice sounded soft as usual but it lacked the sharp edge of persuasion he always used to close his deals he sounded exhausted he sounded angry i suspected his ire was directed not only at me but at the terrible situation we were locked in we creaked along for a while not talking he did notor would notlook at me i stayed quiet hoping the hush would force him a dedicated extrovert to speak but he stayed intractably mute id committed the wrong the first words in the treaty would be mine to write im sorry if i upset you by asking about paul i had no idea it was a tender subject with you he moved his khakiclad legs back and forth the squeak of the swing his only answer i forged ahead i meant no harm and i hope youre not mad at me i expect it you always poke your nose in where it dont belong bitterness wasnt his standard reply i knew he must be terribly upset and i resisted my natural urge toward sarcasm thats not entirely fair bob don you cant expect me to be around your relatives and not hear about some dirty family linen youd just as soon i not know jordan you could find dirty linen if it was burned and buried beneath the clothes hamper but i dont want you playing detective here not with my family what are you worried im going to find out about nothing i just dont want you getting hurt his voice quavered on the last word i grabbed his arm what do you mean get hurt he covered my hand with his own son i brought you here because i love you and i want my family to know i have a son i love i want them to see you and know you and maybe in time love you like you were always one of us his mouth tightened every holiday with them every reunion i felt like something was missing because you werent here id watch aubrey and deb and brian tear the paper off their christmas presents and i couldnt even tell them you existed never got to watch you unwrap a gift never got to give you a toy his voice choked it left a mighty hard hole to fill he cleared his throat but i didnt bring you here so you could go snuffling around the family garbage like an old hound dog this isnt one of your little hobby cases excuse me i managed to sputter anger coloring my face his gaze held mine like a vise i dont want you poking around here as soon as uncle mutt gets back and that justice lady says were free to go you and candace are leaving youre right theres no need for you to stay for lollys services yall can take my car back to mirabeau this aint got a thing to do with either of yall yes it does i parried lolly threatened me his face drained of blood i explained about the scarred greeting cards christ amighty he finally gasped how do you know it was her i snooped in her room i answered were you snooping in there too wendy says you were the color that had evacuated from his face surged in an angry return i dont know what shes talking about but like i said nothing heres got anything to do with you being here i said slowly has everything to do with me and with you you were the one who begged me to come here begged me to give your family a chance you want me to be a goertz but you dont want me around when the going gets tough i could not keep the edge of anger out of my tone thanks for the vote of confidence oh so now youre a goertz sarcasm was a stranger to his voice just because theres trouble brewing and you cant keep your hands out of it it never seemed to matter much to you to be a goertz just because you were my son and it might matter to met i cant be your son if you dont trust me now ive been threatened and the woman who tried to scare me away from this reunion is dead i find out you married your brothers wife and that said brother killed his second wife and himself i think somethings off here and i think you know a hell of a lot more than youre telling bob don how am i supposed to be a son to you if you dont trust me maybe you ought to trust me when i say its none of your goddamned business he stood if you aint gonna act like my son then i guess you dont have to listen much to me but i think itd be best for all concerned if you and candace left i kept my voice steady contradiction doesnt suit you bob don first you wanted us to stay for lollys funeral now youre bound and determined to get us off the island why the change what are you afraid ill find out his lips dried by the sea breeze twitched into a lean hard smile im not afraid of anything i just want you to go this trip wasnt a good idea i should have kept the heat i felt close to me away from him but i didnt bullshit you cant screw around with my head this way bob don you want me to come here put my neck on the chopping block with your family and now that youre concerned im going to find out some dirty secret of yours you want to pack me off either im your son or im not finding out something unpleasant about you isnt going to change the way i feel you feel how do you feel about me he thrust the words in like a sword i fumbled for the swings chain steadying myself against it i care about you i respect you i want you to be happy i just his words cut through my litany of meaningless syrup you dont love me jordy you dont love me like a son should love a father and you never will you havent given me time i started meekly but i stopped as he stared into my face pain direct from the heart made his features tremble time how much time do you need youve had over a year with us seeing each other nearly every day ive saved your life once nearly at the cost of my own i felt the heat of sasss accusation against me in his voice ive provided a nurse for your mother so you and your sister dont have to slave away day and night ive been there for you in thick and thin and im sick sick of being kept an arms length from you like i was a goddamned leper his voice broke with emotion and he clumsily wiped an arm across his eyes when he looked at me again he was flush with hurt and he jabbed a finger toward my face either i am your father or im not for all those long years i wanted to be your daddy i couldnt and maybe those empty years mean i never can be if thats true id just as soon cut my losses and go on pretend once again i dont have a son all those years you wanted to be a father my voice sounded like a strangers riddled with its own hurts why didnt you ever step forward then whyd you let me live for years thinking i was a poteet he shook his head his expression hard oh no you dont you aint gonna lay this on me jordan i did as your mama asked bullshit i hollered pain i didnt recognize had me in its grip i felt like id been endlessly prodded by a bully who finally faltered and i was flailing back you could have done what you wanted never mind my mother you could have claimed me as yours you let my whole life be a lie i let your life be normal he roared with a mama and a daddy who loved you and a sister i let you have it all while i had nothing but a drunken wife and all the pain god could give a man he glared at me with eyes too much like my own you think you know what hurt is poor poor jordan so you found out you got the wrong daddy and youve had a tough year hell ive had thirty tough years watching you and never being able to reach out to you your choice i snapped back that was your choice he lowered his arm tired of pointing yes fine if you want to play it that waymy choice you chose not to be my father and now you want me to choose to be your son anger wobbled my voice i saw aubrey watching us from the safety of the gardens when he saw me see him he turned and fled i am choosing to be your father if youll let me bob don lowered his voice but now you have to go jordan you get out of here or you and i never speak again his hands closed into fists and he could barely speak his lips tightened into a vicious frown i managed to form words with my bonedry mouth i dont respond very well to emotional blackmail bob don i dont like ultimatums for a moment the only sound was the rush of the waves on the beach below us i dont like doing my damnedest to be a father to you and being made to feel like a redheaded stepchild youve made it quite clear you think you dont need a dad i wont trouble you anymore get your bags packed and go then take my car gretchen and ill make arrangements to get back to mirabeau fear played along his face he glanced away from me toward the front door i shook my head and took his arm i kept my voice soft stop this just stop it you dont want to push me away i know you dont what i dont want is to hurt anymore about you son i wish youd never found out i was your father then you could have stayed the ideal son in my mind i never would have sullied my picture of you with a real person wed sparred with the truth that lay between us for the past year i had tried to reconcile the lie my life had been he had tried to father me past the thirty years we hadnt shared his abandoning the quest to integrate us into a family seemed completely out of character i stood my ground i dont believe you tell me what it is you dont want me finding out my mind nimbled over the possibilities is it about whatever might have happened between you and paul and gretchen all those years ago or why sass is such a terror or why tom seems to hate the rest of this family or whatever happened to deborahs parents or what wendy might be up to or is it some dirty secret of uncle mutts his eyes were blue steel on mine and i realized sickeningly that id completely miscalculated bob don meant business and in the worst way this isnt mirabeau you are here by invitation boy and that invitation has just been revoked as soon as mutt gets back you go you leave here if you dont i knock you out and dump you on the boat back to the mainland myself whether or not you and i are still father and sonand the whole concept kinda seems a joke right now since you wont show me a dogs consideration will depend on what happens when i get back to mirabeau anger coursed into my face i could feel the blush deepen my skin hurt forked my tongue into a weapon i havent exactly behaved like the model son im sorry to disappoint you but thats inevitable when you stick me up on a pedestal so high i cant even see you or the ground you havent treated me like a son youve treated me like a pathetic charity case like im some mistake youve got to make up for sasss cruel words rang in my ear youre a mistake a mistake is that how you view me your mama was sharptongued too when she got riled he muttered and whats that shit i barked im sick of these little insights into my mothers character you seem compelled to offer me do you think i dont know her i spent a hell of a lot more time with her than you ever did that wasnt my choice i loved her he said through gritted teeth i shook my head it still amazes me she cheated on my father with you i cant quite picture it maybe it wasnt the grand passion youve painted maybe it was two or three quickies in the toolshed god knows there arent any other witnesses to back you up maybe i am a mistake then maybe my mother wasnt anything to you but a convenient piece of ass and all i am is you not having a rubber in your pocket when you got a bad itch to fu he stepped forward then quickly and slapped me across the face the force of the blow was not hard but i rocked back on my heels my hands groping for the swings chain shock and surprise lit his own eyes and as i rubbed my stinging cheek i saw the hand hed struck me with quaver jordan he croaked you hit me i said my voice shockingly mild no he shook his head i wont have you talk about your mama and me that way i dont want to hear the same old litany bob don you made your feelings clear just now a sharp stabbing pain lanced my heart oh what had i done he stepped forward remorse etched in his face i wanted to hit him i wanted to hold him i wanted to turn away and pretend that this terrible exchange had never taken place instead i looked past his shoulder to see two boats roaring across matagorda bay toward sangre island i stumbled up the stairs of the creaky house i went to candaces room and rapped quickly before stepping inside candace glanced up from her magazine she didnt look so sickly a bit of color had returned to her face her eyes widened at my expression uncle mutts on his way back with the police if they need to talk to us well talk otherwise get your bags packed were going going going where back to mirabeau bob dons made it abundantly clear that were no longer welcome here she dropped her magazine what are you ranting about and what about aunt lollys funeral i didnt bother to hide the anger heating my blood the man who provided the sperm to create me is no longer interested in my company he doesnt trust me and i cant be a son to him candace he doesnt want us at lollys service you thought hed need us he doesnt believe me i tossed one of her carryons onto the bedspread and reached for her book bag wheres your stuff we can be gone in an hour or so if the cops dont need further statements from us wait a minute hold on ace she took the other bag from my hands tell me whats going on i started sounding like a recalcitrant child disavowing his own blame in a schoolyard squabble hes all bent out of shape because he thinks im snooping around his precious family and now its become pretty obvious that hes not going to trust me with whatever haunts him here and i dont believe he ever loved my mother and im sick of him trying to tell me what kind of person she was and hot shame silenced my torrent of words i felt roiling nausea churn my guts i turned from candace and hurried into her bathroom i knelt before the open toilet right before lunch made an encore appearance when id quit retching i spat the sourness out of my mouth i clenched my eyes closed and leaned against the porcelain bowl there are not many moments in a mans life when the quiet comfortable fabric of his existence unravels in a long painful thread id had my share the dampsmelling funeral parlor where my grandfather lay in the quiet of his coffin and i had my first look at human death the dark rainy morning the doctors told me with their fixed expressions of professional disappointment that daddy was dying and they could do nothing the faultlessly beautiful night in boston when the phone call came from sister that my mother had been diagnosed with alzheimers the vengeful drunken slur of gretchens words when she told me i was bob dons bastard i felt the wrenching tug at my heart that this was another such moment id laid open the anger frustration and pain id nursed so carefully treasured so well against bob don and my poor mother id suggested their loveand i should have known better of them bothwas nothing but physical pleasure bob don was a callow cad and my mothermy beloved smart funny unpredictable kindhearted motherno better than an easy lay if i had decided to be mad it was in the sense of insane i spat again into the toilet candace had followed me and without speaking rinsed a washcloth and applied it to the warm spot where neck met back youve been urping too i said by way of casual conversation maybe ive caught whatever youve got she rubbed the cool comfort of the cloth against my neck and splayed her fingers into the short hair on the back of my head i dont think so can you tell me what happened honey i retold the tale not shying away from my own culpability in the stupid exchange candace listened and when i was done she rubbed her eyes with her fingertips oh jordy please dont do this to him and to yourself do what if i have ever doubted you and bob don are blood kin that doubt has to be gone yall are so much alike its not remotely funny great now you too listen i dont want to hear a lot of psychobabble about this candace cant you just tell me im right and agree with me for once that bob don and i do not a family make loving you doesnt mean sharing your brainwave pattern she answered not unkindly she mopped at my lips with the wet washcloth maybe we should all breathe a sigh of relief this finally happened what youre arguing it might be healthy like i said before you and bob don acting like a real father and son is long overdue i stood and went to the sink i ran water into my cupped hand slurped it into my mouth and rinsed the ick from my gullet i spat back into the sink and stood to look at the woman i loved one of your most annoying traits candace i said with a calm i didnt feel is that you always talk like youre some special seer like god pointed you and you alone to the flowchart of my life that you know what everyone ought to be doing or thinking or saying to each other and that if folks dont follow your advice you can peer into that crystal ball you keep stashed away from the rest of us and foresee the onrushing doom god im tired of that jordan dont yell at me the calm tone of her voice grated like fingernails raking a chalkboard i will yell thanks i will yell my throat raw if i feel like it i have spent the past year trying to get used to the idea of a car salesman that i never liked much being my father of my mother being an adulteress of living the rest of my life in a little town that i love but that offers me very few career choices and watching my mother slide down into dementia you know those arent fun things candace disney hasnt designed a ride around those little activities quite yet and now ive gotten to meet my new family and what a fucking thrill thats been she was silent i dont like to whine truly i dont but i am tired sweetheart my voice dropped and my head felt light i am tired of feeling like ive got to adopt bob don just because maybe he didnt wear a rubber thirty years ago jordan and because you keep telling me i need to give him a chance no i dont there is no law legal or moral that says i have to give him the time of day i dont need another father i buried my father already i would just as soon leave now like he wants im tired of being treated like a pariah here im tired of feeling like i must apologize for who or what i am and im so mad at him at my mother i cant even think straight i said rotten things to himand a part of me meant it are you done her words were soft i felt my fury begin to subside i stood and leaned against the towel rack feeling more tired than i believed possible no yes i dont know please cant we just get out of here fine well leave she turned soundlessly away and began packing she folded shirts and walking shorts with cold precision not looking at me finally she spoke i have to say you surprise mei never thought youd run away theres a difference between running away and acknowledging youve had enough i answered she didnt look at me briskly packing her belongings i had never spoken so harshly to her before but i felt the sudden weight of weariness that id tried to ignore for months crash down on me my relationship with bob don seemed finished and with an icy idleness i wondered if the same could be said for candace the thought jolted me and i forced it toward the back of my mind i helped her in piling clothes into her bag neither of us spoke we didnt get a chance to finish stuffing the luggage aubrey knocked on the door and opened it barely waiting for an answer yall gotta come downstairs mutt and the police are here he ran a trembling hand across the sheen of new sweat on his forehead they got the autopsy results it was a heart attack uncle mutt said in a low soft voice lolly had a heart attack silence greeted this announcement i sat on the couch sandwiched between candace and deborah the air in the study felt old and heavy like air from a tomb recently opened my hand wandered to candaces and i took hers in mine sweat slicked her palms sass and aubrey sat on the other couch with bob don and gretchen sass stood she held hands with her son uncle mutt at least it was quick her voice quavered the poor dear didnt suffer much as i listened to sass speak i watched bob don he would not look at me instead concentrating on comforting gretchen she pressed her face into her fists and didnt respond to her husbands touch when will we have her body back for the service sass asked tricia yarbrough the justice of the peace whod visited us before and victor mendez exchanged glances finally judge yarbrough spoke not quite yet cecilia ive ordered further toxicology tests on lollys body ice trenched mutts voice thats ridiculous tricia the coroner said heart attack what else is there to know the coroner also said lolly had no signs of heart disease theres no reason for her heart to have given out the way it did sometimes these things just happen sass ventured mendez cleared his throat judge yarbrough thought there was sufficient reason to call for the additional toxicology tests considering mrs throckmortons heart was healthyand there was digitalisbased medication missing from the house mutt stared hard at the authorities i hope youre not implying my sister took her own life she would never do such a thing tricia yarbrough pursed her lips im sorry emmett truly i am but i have no choice weve got to know what killed her and if aunt lolly had no cause to commit suicide i piped up glares arrowed in on me for gods sake the woman was halfcrazy deborah said matteroffactly im sorry to be so blunt uncle mutt but lolly wasnt balanced she had no business taking care of uncle jake and being entrusted with potentially dangerous medications lolly was eccentric not crazy theres a real big difference deb mutt boomed my sister would not take her own life if they find digitalis and she didnt commit suicide uncle mutt thats not going to leave many attractive alternatives i said stay out of this jordan mutt said you dont know what youre talking about she was threatening me i said candaces hand tightened against mine i glanced at victor mendez who stood near the study door i explained quickly to the family about the malicious cards id received and told mutt that id found another vicious note in lollys closet im sorry uncle mutt but you cant tell me sending those cards was the act of a balanced mind holy hell uncle jake murmured uncle mutts face reddened with ire no lolly would not do such a thing she would not someone planted that card in her closet jordan a hush fell over the room why sass finally asked why would someone frame lolly for scaring jordan i dont know mutt snapped he ran a hand through his hair grief painting its rictus on his handsome face this aint happening it was a heart attack for gods sake she didnt kill herself and she wasnt murdered uncle mutt please be reasonable philip said he began to pace back and forth before the windows as he spoke like a lawyer delivering eloquent summation we have to quit kidding ourselves that lolly was entirely sane she very well might have ended her own life mutt sank into a chair by our couch deborah reached out to embrace him he leaned against her and she wrapped her arms around his shoulders his face reflected his misery i dont understand why would she try to frighten jordan away from our reunion she said she was excited about meeting him and why why kill herself philip knelt before mutt im so so sorry uncle mutt i couldnt remain silent philip i managed to croak why dont you explain what i saw last night when you and mutt and i were in the library tricia yarbrough and victor mendez had remained silent during this exchange id felt their eyes wander from face to face lingering a moment perhaps weighing us each on some internal measure of guilt and complicity now i felt mendezs dark eyes rivet on me as i tried to find my voice again philip stared at me excuse me i dont know what to explain because i dont know what you saw i saw you replace a book on the shelves a copy of bitter money i blinked at mutt and mendez and my voice strengthened it was a bestseller several years agoan account of the maggie mason murder case her husband poisoned her with digitalisbased medication mutt bolted to his feet grabbing philip by his shirtfront what any truth in this philip philip paid mutt no heed rather he fixed a saucy smile at me over his uncles shoulder i have no idea what jordans talking about uncle mutt i stood releasing candaces hand and went to the shelf where id seen philip return the book my heart sank as i saw the slot was empty the book mat had been next to bitter money leaned into the space like a weary companion the book is gone i said feeling my spirits sink if it were ever there philip snorted and why would he lie mr bedrich victor mendez finally spoke i was used to far more vocal police officers but mendez seemed the sort to observe and analyze not interfere philip tried to shrug but mutt kept his shoulders in a steely grip answer the man philip mutt demanded i dont know why jordans fabricating this tale we dont know him at all hes a stranger bob don spoke i can assure you all jordan is no liar throughout this tribute bob don kept his gaze firmly on victor mendez gretchen glanced toward me with redrimmed eyes i didnt slip any book back on the shelf the idea is ridiculous philip patted mutts hand as if begging for release mutt eased his grip and philip took a step backward if i was going to borrow the idea of poisoning aunt lolly i wouldnt return the book im not stupid id destroy it like i would any evidence against me you sound like a seasoned professional at this candace said i suppose i hadnt alienated her entirely if she could still spring to my defense and as you point out philip the book is missing you might not want to destroy the book if uncle mutt or someone else who spends time in this study would notice that it was gone i said i wanted to search the shelves for the copy of bitter money pulling volumes off in a frenzy but i didnt i forced myself to a calmness i hadnt had with bob don or candace mr goertz would you notice if a particular book was gone from here mendez asked he stared at philip who decided to quit glaring at me and now studied the pattern on the antique rug the glibness faded from his face hell uncle jake and lolly read more true crime than i ever did i dont recall the particular book that jordan mentions i might not notice but uncle jake might mutt leaned toward jake uncle jake you know this book jordan speaks of jake sat enthroned in a deep leather chair that looked ready to swallow him he glared at philip with undisguised loathing yes we had a copy of bitter money i clearly remember reading it and lolly read it as well i dont believe we ever got rid of the book it should still be here so where is it philip i demanded how the hell should i know philip snapped but his eyes had acquired a cunning look that made my spine tense and if i returned the damned book why would i get rid of it later no logic required to make accusations here jordan you dont make sense not a surprise though maybe youd get rid of it i said if you thought id seen you slip it back onto the shelves missing it cant be dusted for fingerprints this is insane philip stormed toward me but mendez intercepted him okay fine look at me motive and opportunity right isnt that what all criminals need i dont got either why would i want lolly dead you need a motive asshole and i dont have one i loved my aunt i didnt think lolly was half as loved as some kin proclaimed her to be but i kept my mouth shut jake prodded philip with his cane youre a liar jake hissed i know you didnt love lolly you aint got love for nothing in your heart but green and silver this from a man who snarls at little children philip shot back but his voice had transformed he sounded desperate cornered what the hell would you know old man lolly told me jake pronounced she was afraid of you of what youd do to lay your hands on your inheritance just a tad sooner uncle jake whacked at philip again with the cane incisively and hard philip fairly jumped back mr zimmerhanzel victor mendez stepped forward and i wanted to say about time are you going to let them snipe at each other of course you are lieutenant you might just learn something uncle jakes eyes blazed at the young officer who didnt seem the least bit cowed by the old fellows malevolent glower youre wasting our tax money are you gonna arrest philip or stand there and let the grass grow you seem awfully eager for an arrest to be made mr zimmerhanzel why is that tricia yarbrough crossed her arms because philips guilty as sin jake retorted he stole money from mutt before and i dont see jordans got any reason to lie about what he saw in this library he poked the air with his cane youre the law its your job to exact justice if you wont someone else will i dont abide vigilantes in my county mr zimmerhanzel mendez said and for a sick moment i thought i saw a light of amusement in his eyes as uncle jake postured as the family avenger uncle jake i cant believe youre turning on me this way philip managed to utter jake studied the ornately sculpted handle of his cane mendez didnt relent on jake why did you think mr bedrich wanted to get his hands on an inheritance is he a beneficiary under mrs throckmortons will him in lollys will fatass chance uncle jake laughed a finger of dislike crept up my spine i think she planned on leaving everything to deborah aubrey and tom deborah stiffened next to me in obvious surprise and i saw tom whod so far kept his tongue jerk from staring at his brother to staring at uncle jake candace leaned an arm behind me to touch deborahs shoulder and my cousin twitched nervously aubrey didnt visibly react she couldnt she wouldnt i heard deborah whisper jake laughed at the reaction his announcement caused but that aint the real money in this house old philips after mutts money he needs it bad to pay off his gambling debts he done hit me up already for a loan those fellows who break legs aint inclined to wait until mutt here kicks off i do not have gambling debts philip argued not what lolly said jake retorted that makes no sense jake why kill lolly then if he shouldve tried to kill me uncle mutt collapsed into a chair wendy knelt solicitously at his side he breathed heavily for a moment then stared at his nephew is that it philip you were gunning for me and poor lolly got in the way she took the poison intended for me philips assurance finally collapsed for gods sake listen to yourselves uncle jakeuncle muttthis is me you think i killed someone you think i killed one of us for holy gods sake the enormity of their accusations buckled philips knees and he sank down onto the ottoman in front of uncle jake the old man trembled as if cognizant of the wounds hed inflicted then covered his face with his hands whyd you go and have to do an ornery thing like this jake asked his voice barely a whisper he became silent and kept his fingertips pressed against the wrinkled plain of his forehead poor lolly innocent lolly tricia yarbrough cleared her throat we still dont know that digitalis was involved mrs throckmorton could have simply had a heart attack she scanned faces mine mutts deborahs jakes philips arent yall getting a little ahead of yourselves in casting accusations anyone here got something they want to share i felt a sick tug in my gut theyre casting accusations because they re sure the digitalis will show up in her body why wouldn t they just glue their lips shut if they had any real doubt theyre covering their butts philip stared at jake still stinging from his uncles accusation he then whirled to face his twin brother tom tell them tell them i couldnt do it tom bedrich leaned against the corner bookshelf his haggard face drawn into a frown i dont know philip i dont know you anymore any of you youre my brother for gods sake that ceased to count for much years ago philip toms voice chilled me devoid of fraternal affection aubrey interjected i dont think any accusations should be leveled at my cousin without an attorney present philip lets get a lawyer here if youre going to be questioned by the police philip didnt take aubreys advice as support his appeals crescendoed in anger and fear as he jumped to his feet i dont need any damned lawyer because i didnt do it and theres no evidence to support a claim that i killed lolly or tried to kill anybody i forced myself to speak again dread making an accommodation in my heart i was playing every trump card i had and i wasnt even sure of the game i wanted to whisk bob don out of the study squire him away to a private room and shake the truth out of him about whatever demons haunted this family instead i forged ahead exposing the fractures in our family tree philip i heard you and wendy talking out at the cemetery the quiet in the room was as dense as the quiet of those tombs philip glared at me with a shining light of pure hatred it shone for one sickening moment then he safely eclipsed it by closing his eyes wendy stood from where shed squatted by the grieving mutt an insensate lump to the arguments raging around him i dont know what youre talking about wendy said flatly i went for a hike i was by the crypts when yall came down there and had a little confab about getting hold of some of uncle mutts money wendy laid a possessive hand on mutts crown of gray hair he seemed to hear my words but he hadnt yet formed a reply to them looking at me slackjawed i still dont know what youre talking about jordan wendy said i dont talk to wendy but to say hello and ask whats for supper philip offered after a quick sidelong glance at his partner in crime why the hell would i be jawing with her out in a goddamned cemetery so no one would hear or see you i replied determined not to let them evade me wendy shook her head she reminded me of a chessboards queen idly glancing down at a helpless pawn your facility for lying is amazing but since none of us know you i dont suppose we should be surprised know me what does anyone know about you wendy i countered my challenge didnt faze her perhaps youd explain to lieutenant mendez and judge yarbrough why you were sneaking around lollys bedroom this morning she was right about my facility for lying i suspected lolly might be sending me the hate mail i wanted to find some evidence to support my theory the fib slid out of my mouth with surprising smoothness i closed my mouth before i could elaborate further on my falsehood i didnt glance at deborah or at bob don who wendy claimed to have spotted as he exited from prowling the room while i hid in the closet until i knew why bob don was in that roomwhat secret did he have i could hardly ask him about it in this room full of accusing faces and just why did you suspect lolly wendy continued her hand played insolently in the gray of mutts hair like she was stroking a pet mutt watched me with stony eyes great my mind fumbled for an answer well i saw how hateful she was to several of you at the dinner when she died i began but then an unexpected ally leaped to my defense i asked jordan to go into lollys room gretchen said standing on shaky feet her eyes crimson rings in her face well it speaks philip muttered who uncorked the bottle real venom stained his voice philip shut up and sit down mutt ordered some of the regular steel was back in his tone philip attempted a brief scowl but sank onto the ottoman by uncle jake i glanced at bob don who glowered at philip with undisguised loathing i didnt know then lolly had been sending those hateful scribblings to jordan but after she died i was so upset and i wanted a keepsake of lollys i asked jordan to fetch it for me it was then that he found the other card that lolly intended to send him gretchen smiled winningly at lieutenant mendez i had practically forgotten he was in the room he didnt tell me about it until this afternoon what keepsake did you want mutt asked i dont like the idea of someone pawing through my poor dead sisters belongings gretchen raised her hands in mock supplication i know mutt i know its tacky of me but lolly told me once shed kept the wedding photos of my first husband paul and me and i wanted them back i asked jordan to look for them why didnt you fetch the photos yourself this surprisingly from deborah she looked scared to death her hands folded tightly against her chest as though ready to shiver in the july heat probably too fucking drunk to do it herself philip said and bob don launched himself off the couch i hadnt known he could move quite so fast for a big man he bolted like lightning he seized philips already muchhandled shirt in his hands and shoved his cousin over the ottoman philip went down like a fallen oak splaying out at uncle jakes feet and cane mr goertz lieutenant mendez shouted pulling bob don back i reached for bob dons arm but he flinched violently away from my touch i slowly lowered my hand feeling aunt sasss eyes mock me you did it you spiked her drink goddamn scheming punk bob don pointed down at philip who was trying ineffectually to scramble to his feet finally tom assisted him great philip snapped now youre blaming me for gretchens binges he glared at the assemblage shes hit the sauce again dead drunk this afternoon and bob don and jordan and sass and candace would just as soon we all not know my soda was spiked gretchen leaned against sass and sass put a protective arm around her i didnt intend to drink aunt gretchen you should probably avoid confrontation right now lets you and i go discuss your relapse aubrey offered but no one paid him any heed crooning the same old tired song of the boozer aunt gretchen philip taunted undaunted by bob dons anger philip use your brain gretchen said her tone eerily calm if lolly was poisoned someone slipped it into her food or drink someone basically tried to poison me the same way except with alcohol silence cocooned the room as the family weighed the implication i wanted to sink down onto the couchmy head throbbed with tensionbut my feet felt coated in concrete gretchen turned to mendez a half smile lighting her face her lips trembled were not a very nice family lieutenant full of shiftless bums mean old men crazy women and my first husband was a murderer so where you gonna start wed each been banished to our rooms as lieutenant mendez and judge yarbrough continued their investigation and interviews i could only imagine what game plan their minds had concocted after hearing such poisonous talk accusations counteraccusations slander grief hatredwe all needed to be flown to the nearest tabloid talk show and unleashed on the audience they wouldnt know what the hell hit them or perhaps we could become sponsors for a lozenge company as we screamed our throats raw at each other at least mendez had seen fit to begin his interrogations with philip everyones most likely suspect i stood against the window watching the sun begin its decline toward the sea clouds surged above the ocean as dark and foreboding as the fear in my heart it was as if the weather reflected our moods the light no longer dappled the waves the air smelled sour with the rank odors of the sea the sky so unsullied earlier had shrouded itself with heavy black thunderheads rumbles growing closer made the wood beneath my feet shiver if you dont like the weather in texas especially on the coastwait five minutes because its sure to change the gulf is a cauldron for sudden harsh storms i watched as a flurry of boats hurried toward port lavaca and port oconnor the smudge that marked lands end across matagorda bay beckoned i wanted to leave and i could not yarbrough had declared a quarantine on travel and none of us were daring to break it her words had made it clear that while no one was getting their miranda rights read no one was above suspicion and what would flight suggest aside from guilt anyone who knew truth in this sordid matter would do well to come forward and not hide it i wondered if a family as sundered as this one seemed could still cloak each other the goertz family huddled together against truth like it was a cold driving rain i felt a sharp tang of fear for bob don he wasnt going to trust me with his secrets he wasnt going to let me help him a knock sounded at my door softly come in i called gretchen entered shutting the door firmly behind her i wanted to see if youre okay she said you surprised me lying like you did to protect me she didnt answer at first she sat on the corner of my bed curling her legs beneath her like a cat you and i have to stick together jordan were the outsiders here outsiders she smiled a half smile of shaky resolve were goertzes all right but were not quite up to snuff didnt you hear how hard lolly was on everyone at dinner and those are the real family how do you think you and i ranked in her eyesthe family drunk and the unexpected illegitimate child she ran a hand through her permed graying hair were distant bloodnot quite part of the family but still there when lolly was ragging on aubrey about his book about the various characters he could discussshe said the family slut and she looked right at you i sat down next to her on the soft quilt why is that jordan i she started then stopped ive caused a lot of grief to this family im sure most of them wished id never come along im sure thats not true i offered deborah and sass obviously care about you do they i marry a goertz and leave him for his brother i drove a wedge between two men who should have been the closest of friends but who became the most bitter of enemies i destroyed pauls life and lolly could never forgive me for it she was always hateful toward me she told me once it was fitting i was a drunk i deserved it you cant feel guilty about leaving paul you had to do what was right for you i touched her shoulder and she didnt flinch away no one can begrudge you your happiness happiness ive given little joy to myself or to anyone else she massaged her forehead a tired expression furrowing her brow do you know what guilt is jordy real guilt the kind that never lets you sleep or eat or think for a long stretch of time it hovers near your shoulder like a little devil whispering in your ear i attempted comfort you said you didnt give happiness to people but you made me happy today when you stuck up for me gretchen goeitz looked hard into my eyes all the old discord between us seemed to have happened a century ago as we sat together on the bed listening to the wind crescendo around us and the first patters of hard rain slammed against the windows she took my hand for the very first time and her palm felt cold against mine a thin sheen of damp covered her fingers and they trembled in my grasp you must know you must know how much he loves you her voice sounded small like a childs whisper he doesnt want me here he wont trust me hes so afraid of losing you he knows now what with lollys threats against you her deathhe should never have brought you here he doesnt want you to pay for our sins sins i leaned in closer to her our noses and mouths nearly touching our voices were mere murmurs do you love your father jordan do you i took a long shuddery breath im still not used to thinking of him as my father she stilled my talk with her cold fingertips enough analysis enough posturing enough denial push has come to shove his life may depend on this tell me do you love him his life may depend on this her fingers felt icy against my lips her palm smooth against my jaw i pressed my tongue hard against the roof of my mouth yes i managed to croak yes i love him gretchen closed her hand around my face and for one moment i thought she would kiss me her eyes were halfclosed and she breathed slowly her mouth open her breath smelling of mint gum i want to help him but he wont let me why i whispered she pressed her lips together and regarded me again with surprising frankness i was afraidbecause id been such a bitchyou could never love him could never accept him i used to want that i wanted you never to want him as your daddy but no more she clasped both my hands in hers youve got to help me jordan help me protect him i dont think i can do it alone tell me you have to promise me youll help protect bob don please i wavered for a moment just what did he do promise me she insisted i promise ill do everything i can to protect him i kept my words barely louder than a soft breath he and i arent distant blood right she shuddered blood again this has been a place of needless death ever since those sailors were butchered on the beach i want to leave here and never come back tell me i squeezed her hands long silencesthe ones that last years and graft themselves into your very bonesare the hardest to break she tensed like steel had hardened in her arms and legs and she didnt look at me for minutes i held her and waited the outside squall roared and the rain went from drops to solid sheets enveloping the house in rattles and hums paul he killed paul she forced the words out like a dying cough but paul committed suicide i whispered thats what deborah said ruled suicide the body was never recovered now that shed made the dreaded admission the words came a little easier tears dribbled from the corner of her eyes and she smeared them across her face with the back of her hand deborah said paul left a suicide noteleft it on the front door said he walked into the ocean because he couldnt live with the guilt of shooting nora but deborahs sure her father didnt kill her mother i am gretchen said oh i am because after paul killed nora he came here to kill me down the hall a door slammed and i heard a sharply angry deborah bickering with aubrey that he had to go talk to mendez next aubrey sounded reluctant and morose deborah urged him along and shortly their voices faded down the stairs lightning flashed its hard light in my window and i oddly imagined god taking a snapshot of gretchen and me clutching each others hands her tongue flicked over her lips theres a taint in every family something in the blood that can warp any poor soul that gets too much of the bad ingredient in mine its loving booze my brother was a drunk too and our grandmother before us although no one ever wanted to admit it yeah in my family its being sharptongued and nosy i whispered back she laughed then briefly and i felt the first true connection between us take shaky life i watched her wipe away another tear so whats the taint of the goertz blood silence and a horrible horrible pride the kind of pride that forces an entire family to its knees in its service a pride that leads to insanity because it shackles you so paul suffered from it and lolly did too thats why theyre dead tell me what happened she spoke now without hesitation relieved to have her needed ally paul was an artist a gifted sculptor when i left him he quit working he became terribly depressed mutt and lolly insistedlolly and paul were always close they were cut from the same cheap bolt of cloththat he go into treatment he met nora when he started work again she was his favorite model they married soon after she paused deborahs so like her mothertrusting kindhearted smart but maybe too book smart and nora was sweet it would have been easy for her to hate me considering what id done to paul but she never did at least she didnt ever show me anything but kindness i loved her too and she didnt deserve such a terrible death a sob broke her words and i stayed quiet while she composed herself we all thought paul was finally happy deborah and brian were born in fairly quick order and he seemed to settle down he and bob don didnt speakthe resentment the hatred between them went too deep theyd loved each other once but no more my fault no not your fault their choice i said she ignored my attempt at consolation it wasnt over paul started sending me these she pulled from her pocket a creased and yellowed envelope worn with handling she offered it to me and i carefully removed a card it was an oldstyle greeting discolored with years the paper felt coarse but fragile beneath my fingers and smelled of a dusty closet the cover of the card showed a huge round yellow smiling face the eternal grin of the s no text was written on the front but when i opened the card i saw the preprinted greeting you make me smile scored in faded words beneath the kindliness was an ugly intimation especially when i think of you dying i handed her back the card feeling sick she slipped it back into the envelope quickly and wiggled her fingers as if dusting some foulness off her hands my god just like the cards i received she swallowed it was pauls sick joke he sent me others but i had them destroyed i never told bob don i knew hed go after paul i just wanted to forget paul existed i never thought she covered her face with her hands im so ashamed i was so foolish you couldnt know its not your fault i squeezed her hands how odd life is a year ago this woman was my mortal enemy and now we sat trying to muddle together through a dark and torturous past united by the love we felt for the same man family makes strange bedfellows i know hindsight is hell but whatever was wrong with paul nora couldnt fix he killed her shot her in the face deborah claims her father since he was an artist who had sculpted nora so often wouldnt kill her the way he did gretchen shook her head deborah clings to hope no one wants to believe her daddy could kill her mom i knew her father better than she did blasting away noras face makes perfect sense for paul did deborah tell you he marred or destroyed all the sculptures in his studio after he killed nora the expression on my face answered for me of course she didnt jordan that fact wont support her theory of her father as the wronged victim another round of thunder rumbled above the roof but fell faint quickly and the rain began to ease against the windows the band of the storm seemed to be passing us paul vanished after nora died the police searched for him the family gathered here deborah and brian were of course terribly traumatized mutt was worried sick about them i felt terrible guilt as if id robbed those children of their mother i cant say why it makes no sense but guilt and grief dont always have rhyme and reason do they no they dont id lashed out at bob don out of guilt and griefguilt that i could think so little of my mother grief that my life wasnt the perfect picture id imagined it to be no sense required he came in the night gretchens expression went slack as she brought forth the memory and her hands felt boneless in mine i was asleep thanks to a generous serving of whiskey i wasnt drinking so hard thenher voice quaveredbut it was the start of the beginning bob don couldnt sleep sickened over what had happened and how the family was reacting lolly was nasty to the children hardly kind at all everyone seemed so ashamed of what paul had done as though it reflected on the rest of us how terrible for us to have a murderer on the family tree no oneexcept her children of course and bob don and i seemed broken over what had happened to poor nora she was the victim not us as a family the goertzes couldnt understand that you said he came in the night i prompted bob don couldnt sleep he had thought if hed reached out to his brother mended fences tried to reconnect with himwell noras terrible murder could have been averted isnt that just like bob don yes my throat felt constricted your fatherhe went out to walk restless he was i dont know for certain but i believe he went to noras grave wed buried her here she had no family of her own her children were all the blood relations she had in the world paul was thereat the cemetery they fought and bob don killed him coldness fingered my spine i repressed a shudder no i couldnt imagine bob don a killer much less a slayer on the scale of cain no no yes jordan i woke up feeling sick and needing to throw up i heard them talking downstairs heard bob don crying over what hed done he was hysterical paul had a gun told bob don he was going to kill him then me for ruining his life they fought for it bob don shot him through the heart she looked away from me i wanted to go to him but i was so frightened i didnt want to believe it was true so i went back to bed you said them talking what themv she swallowed again mutt jake sass lolly they all knew what bob dond done they all knew paul was dead by his own brothers hand my god it was selfdefense right why didnt they just call the police she shook her head again not this family not the goertzes mutt said the shame of paul being a murderer was bad enough without one brother striking down another selfdefense aside best he said for paul to have taken his own life cleaner that way the othershad to convince lolly she loved paul so but even she finally agreed that protecting bob don was more important gretchen shivered oh ive wanted to tell this for so long and i couldnt not even bob don knows that i know i never told him and he never told me i guess he was afraid id turn away she cried then long racking sobs and i held her close feeling her pain begin a slow drain in the cleansing of confession after a few minutes had passed she eased her breathing and i pulled away from her to look her square in the face so what did they do with pauls body i dont know buried it somewhere on the island i guess or dumped it out in the gulf her tears formed curving roads on her cheeks her eyes were so red they appeared on the verge of bleeding and no one else knew i asked no the twins were here and aubrey and deborah and brian but they didnt know did they it occurred to me if gretchen could overhear the older goertzes covering up pauls death so could the younger ones please dont hate your father gretchen implored hes not really a killer he was just trying to save himself of course i dont hate him but i dont understand why the goertzes did what they did their pride its their fatal taint thats why lolly was so bitter about aubreys book at dinner and why she was so terrible to deborah and brian and why she was so hard on everyonethat damnable pride no one could live up to at least i never could eventually i gave up trying so whyi gestured at the hateful envelope gretchen had produceddid she send me cards like those and how could she know that paul had sent you such threats id shown them to her after nora died she took them from me and said shed destroy them and afterward i wanted them gone i didnt want the police to find any reason for bob don to have killed paul but you kept one i kept one her voice was hollow and distant anytime i doubted bob don doubted my love for himand when you drink you often think you dont need anyonei have that card to remind me of the price he paid to protect me i bring it with me whenever we come to sangre so i never never forget she didnt look at me again and i sensed that her story wasnt completethat a final coda to all this misery was missing i turned her chin back toward me gretchen what else nothing isnt that enough after a moments hesitation she regarded me now you see why weve got to protect him because we hid the truth if the investigation into lollys death reveals what bob don didtheres no statute of limitations on murder but it was selfdefense maybe the courts wont see it that way regardless they all hid the truth they covered up pauls death and forged a suicide note isnt that a crime i cupped my head in my hands a slow throb coursed from my temples through my head god and you think lollys death has to do with this coverup i dont know yes probably maybe she was going to tell on the family after all these years and someone decided to stop her why would she tell shed be implicating herself as well i leaned my forehead against hers maybe she truly was going crazy losing her reason and crazy people talk what else is there to know gretchen ive told you the whole story youve got to help me protect bob don she tightened her grip on my arm if lolly was going to blow the whistle on the rest of the family why would she attempt to scare me offusing the same method paul used to terrorize you i dont know maybe she thought it was shameful for bob don whod already created enough trouble for the family to have a bastard im sorry she treated you badly it seems odd i mused why strike at me that particular way never mind her shes dead she cant hurt us now but you got to help me come up with a way to protect bob don gretchen i said gently i dont know what we can do to protect him if any of this family conspiracy is connected to lollys death the whole house of cards might tumble down ill stand by him all the way but im not sure what you want me to do she blinked youre smart you solve crimes surely you can concoct some way to keep bob don from getting in trouble i stood listening to the fading hiss of the ebbing rain darkness was falling now and the setting sun was barely a molten hump above the horizon clouds formed a shroud across the sky obscuring the comfort of the stars ill think of something but inspiration seemed as fleeting as the afternoon light well what she demanded i dont know yet give me some time i cant manufacture a plot out of thin air she swallowed and silently accepted my answer im glad i told you this jordy ii knew you loved him i knew i could depend on you she stood i got to get back to my room bob donll wonder what mischief im up to she surprised me with a quick kiss on my cheek and then she turned and left leaving me alone the open door of my room loomed like a portal to a world of murder and secrets all the open domain of this terrible house a feeling of death and guilt thrummed through the air almost palpable and i was supposed to rescue my father from the sins of his past i sank down on the bed feeling crushed by the sudden weight of responsibility find a murderer and save my father i lay on my bed thinking staring at the ceiling trying to slowly piece together a plan whoso rewardeth evil for good evil shall not depart from his house proverbs i mustve dozed off when told your father killed his brother sleep is a natural escape while i juggled theories and ideas as to who had murdered lolly i kept seeing bob dons face hovering above my own his kind eyes his gentle smile his hearty laugh that made you know you were as welcome as could be i could not see him pressing a trigger killing his own brother even in selfdefense was gretchen lying i didnt believe so but i didnt want to swallow her entire story my eyes felt heavy and i shut them for just a moment paws pressed against my heart and i awoke with a start sweetie stood on my chest his tongue lolling out of his mouth with exertion he stared down at me with enormous and forlorn eyes also at loose ends i knew how he felt i sat up scooping the little dog into my arms and stood to stare out the window no more rain fell but the sky was mottled with dark clouds like a snakes skin the next wave of bad weather wasnt far off the coast guard boat bobbed in the waves mendez and yarbrough still blessed us with their company i am not a superstitious man but i wondered why this little texas island served as a nexus for disaster the shattered reliant and its valiant men entombed beneath the waves the massacred boys on the beach the collection of graves amassed in the cemetery the lonely marker of little brian riley goertz too brief a time his inscription had read i wondered if the same tragic air that haunted this island had warped this family somehow some cold hand reaching beyond its grave to shape human life i shook my head and sweetie wriggled in my arms i chided myself for this sudden gothic veer in my thinking reality was an old warm dog against your skin writhing to be petted attributing bad conduct and human sadness to the island air seemed ludicrous this was not shirley jacksons hill house nothing walked here alone my sour temperament was my own fault not that of arcane foulness seeping through the rooms holding sweetie i went and closed my door what brushed your eyelids this afternoon as you slept i sat on the bed and set sweetie on the covers he chased his tail in a quick single circle as if assuring himself he was the only pup present then curled up into a crescent of fur and watched me with his huge peasants eyes i scratched the top of his head and his ears lay low with pleasure i felt a surge of affection for this little dog not without some surprise i wondered if sweetie sat watching his mistress while she composed her missives of hate to me life is odd i thought usually i warred with gretchen and got along peaceably with bob don now the situation was reversed and i felt an uneasy soldier and the battle might be brief bob don sounded ready to proceed in life without the travails of trying to forge a relationship with me and just how was i supposed to protect him from his own past the task seemed impossible and how was he going to react to gretchen confiding in me he might well the ceiling creaked above me i sat very still on the bed old houses cry out in the struggle against time and this one weathered by sea and wind and rain was no exception but that noise had sounded like the distinct pang of weight against old wood another faint scream of a troddenupon board then another why on earth was anyone tiptoeing around the attic i stood sweetie suddenly bolted upright flung himself off the bed and scrabbled at the door like the room was ablaze i inched the door open and he shot out like a jag of lightning his claws skittered on the hardwood floor of the hallway and he bounded down the staircase i eased the door shut quietly a long minute passed then another soft footfall from aboveaway from the wall that held my window moving toward my closet i tiptoedafter all if i could hear them they might hear meto the closet door and carefully opened it the door swung open on silent hinges i fumbled for the light cord another creak sounded a trapdoor occupied a back corner of the big closet id noticed it when i unpacked in the same abstract way one notices the particular shade of color the walls are painted i reached toward the trapdoor wondering if i could feel the weight of another person on the opposite side of the wood i didnt touch the door thoughi suddenly felt the sharp gnaw of fear and remembered the ghostly tickle id felt against my skin and the kitchen door that had swung open with no one near idiot no such thing ghosts dont exist and if they did they wouldnt make boards creak minutes crawled by like hours i heard someone walk down the hallway sasss voice out in the garden calling for aubrey a voice raised downstairs in anger that i suspected was philips the sea wind played against my window in capricious gusts rain began again whipping against the window the striking drops sounding like a childs fingers thumping against the glass the attic held its silence i tarried another ten minutes then opened the trapdoor disuse made the hinges shriek and i cringed waiting to see a face appear in the black doorway dust motes danced around my face and i sneezed no response issued from the darkness so i unfolded the wooden steps attached to the door and clambered into the attic the house was old but the attic seemed decades older the air tasted ancient tinged with time and dust i realized with some disappointment that i didnt have a flashlight to guide my way i retreated to my room i could still hear aunt sass braying for aubrey like she might holler for a wayward dog i wondered if maybe tom had gotten ahold of aubrey and was busy resolving their unfinished business by beating aubrey to a pulp or maybe aubrey had been sneaking around the attic while his mama called for him out in the garden i watched aunt sass from the window huddled underneath her umbrella no aubrey materialized aunt sassd catch cold if she didnt get out of the storm a quick exploration of my room revealed no flashlight but i did find a candle and matches id hoped as much since the frequent storms along the coast could result in power outages i had no idea if the island had its own generator i ascended back into the attic feeling a tad like a male jane eyre wondering if a raving former wife of uncle mutts awaited me in the darkness ridiculous id let a goofy scared dog and my own overactive imagination propel me away from logic i am always reasonable and i refused to let myself be girded by the most inane doubts and fears why be afraid of a dark attic you just found out your father killed his crazy brother and that this whole clan covered it up for years you should be more afraid of this family whatll they do to you if they learn you know about their little conspiracy darkness cloaked me my candle provided meager illumination the attic was long running the length of most of the house i wondered if each and every room offered access to the garret the way my closet didsurely not but folks made odd architectural decisions in olden days i decided it might be worthwhile to identify every point of ingress the attic offered forgotten homes of spiders dangled from the rafters the errant dust the only prey caught in their clutches the air smelled of the sea i began moving toward the south side of the house away from my room boxes and trunks dotted the walls arranged haphazardly wherever they were deposited the grime of long memories coated the containers i ran my fingers across locks and old tape kept time out nothing here that i could see had been disturbed but someone had been here if not taking somethingperhaps hiding something i looked for the signs that any container or object in sight was new nothing gleamed as freshly unwrapped from plastic there was little here that spoke of recent years i stared down at my shoes now smeared with dust the floor itself was dirty and i should have thought to see if the intruder had left footprints in his wake i began backtracking along the floor keeping the candles gleam close to the boards i heard the wind gust against the glass the rain building i thought again of aunt sass yelling out in the rain for her son i felt a tug of concern for her to my surprise perhaps it was easier now to understand her vitriolic reaction to my wavering about bob dons status in my life she knew what hell hed been through after pauls death maybe she felt he needed a new connection of family and i was his best chance something gone right after the fabric of his old family became irreparably stained then i saw ita tennis shoes tread in the grit then another and another stepping back over the first the prints stopped at an array of boxes and trunks outwardly indiscernible from the rest of the goertz family detritus that clogged the attic i put the candle close to the cartons looking for signs of recent contact i finally found one trunk where the dust had been brushed away from the clamps a fat blot disturbed the grit on the floor i guessed someone had knelt here and i believed it had been a manthe knee and shoe prints were large like the goertz men i eased the trunks lid open it moaned in quiet protest clothes lay in militarily perfect folds creases still sharp although the garments themselves smelled musty i fingered through the stacked shirts and pants they were a boys clothes long unworn a catchers mitt a cracked softball nestled in the web of its leather lay on one side of the trunk i brushed fingers against the glove it was silky with wear softened in the way only a childs sweat will i had a shortstops glove with the same feel back home and i smiled with the memory of it a baseball cap for the houston astros fitted for a childs head lay perfectly next to the mitt the logo was old the colorful stripes left over from the early s i remembered itid worn a similar cap myself i pulled the cap out carefully for some reason i felt compelled to treat these items with reverence as though id unearthed them from a longburied time capsule below the cap was a stack of familiar bluebacked books i smiled again as i withdrew the top volumes from the stack the flickering torch mystery the secret of the caves the shattered helmet all classics from franklin w dixons hardy boys series the spines were worn with reading and rereading these books had been loved this series had been my favorite boyhood reading as well tagging along on adventures with the intrepid frank and joe i had even bragged once to sister that when they made a hardy boys movie id be the natural choice for joe shed laughed at my arrogance these belongings could have been mine i put the books back in the trunk i rooted about in the clothes some more finally i found at the bottom a vneck burgundy sweater the kind every boy is given during some christmas and naturally loathes a diamondshaped monogram of bgr the g huge and pointed for the surname was sewn on the right breast of the sweater brian riley goertz i felt as though id just brushed the satin in a coffin and my hand had come away smeared with some noxious substance i wiped my fingers against my khaki shorts feeling uneasy i groped through the clothes either something had been taken from this trunk or someone wanted to mull over memories of brian or someone wanted to hide something and chose this as their cubbyhole my fingers brushed through the garments again and i touched cardboard sandwiched between two shirts was a small box the sort used to store jewelry it had been taped shut but i peeled the tape off and opened the box an assortment of mens jewelry lay inside an old elastic watchband snaked its way through two rings i examined the booty the watch was an old timex and the face of it was smashed one ring was a simple wedding band with no inscription the other ring was a college ring for corpus christi state university a mans jewelry secreted among a dead boys belongings this jewelry then wasnt young brian goertzs pauls perhaps given to his son but if so why pack it away after brians death unless deborah couldnt bear to have her fathers effects or didnt want them the jewelry box seemed an intruder in the trunk of brians belongings and realization shuddered down my spine a wedding band a smashed watch a college ring from the city that was the cradle of the goertz family paul goertzs body had never been found according to the family this jewelry might be confirmation of everything gretchen told me i imagined a dimly lit sculptors studio in corpus christi nora goertzs dead body sprawled across the puttyspeckled floor her face a wet red mess the smell of gunfire crisping the air so what then paul goertz turns from the carnage and calmly slips off his watch his wedding ring and his college ring before he goes to stalk gretchen and meet his own death it made no sense the picture seemed all wrong maybe notif he was going on the run and the jewelry could be used to identify him had pauls mind worked that way and perhaps hed removed his broken watch if nora had smashed it while fighting for her life perhaps or perhaps the family complicit in their burial of pauls body to shield bob don stripped the corpse of its jewelry before disposing of it forever that made no sense did they plan on presenting the watch and rings to brian one day here my boy these belonged to your disappeared presumed dead daddy wear them in health no why would the goertzes save this it could be found one day and implicate them all a slim chance yes but why even take the risk i thought for a minute no easy answer reared its head i emptied the rest of the trunk and found nothing else that piqued my interest i ran my fingers along the trunks lining but no mysterious catches or bumps to indicate hideyholes presented themselves i leaned back on my heels and sighed an armor of falsehoods covered this damn family an unyielding barrier id have to blast my way through to get to the protected core of truth i stood and hurried down the length of the attic looking for other entrances i found one over candaces room at the other end of the house damn she was probably out and whoever came up here took advantage of her absence i walked slowly back toward the trapdoor leading to my room feeling an odd coolness descend on the attic as though the outside rain robbed the air of its july heat i knelt again by brians forlorn trunk what happened here a strange heat kindled in my heart as though i could reach past time and death to touch my cousins hand my father killed your father im so sorry my fingers brushed the trunks surface and as if in answer a chill blasted through the attic freezing me to the spot iciness prickled my skin through my tshirt and walking shorts i kept my head bowed stunned by the sensation not daring to look up because i was certain that if i did i would see a young boy standing there shimmering in the light insubstantial as air with silvered blank eyes no i chided myself you and your stupid imagination so i raised my head and there he stood not six feet away from me the boy in the photographs wavery in the dust motes he wore bright summer clothes a dark elongated bruise marred his pale throat like a long purplish smudge he reached a hand toward me palm up a strand of seaweed clung to his thumb i saw bitterness and hate well in his angels face then he disappeared i trembled the cold deepened for a few long moments then vanished as though a window had been opened and warmth readmitted to my world i wiped a shaky hand across my eyes i hurried about my business with thoughtless precision i quicklyvery quicklyrepacked the trunk with the exception of the jewelry box which i stuck in my pocket then i sealed the trunk and stood and retrieved my stilllit candle i warmed my hands over the bright hot flicker they shook above the little flame i retreated back down to the relative safety of my room rapidly folding up the access door to the attic wondering if anyone would comment if i nailed it shut i walked back into my room closed the closet door behind me and set the candle down extinguishing its flame with a hard breath rain lashed against the windows the storms second wind fiercer than its first thunder cracked the sky and the firmament of the floor quivered a little with its force my hands still shook and i turned the hotwater tap on full blast running the water over my fingers i felt numb a litany to reassure myself of my sanity began to chant its way through my mind you do not believe in ghosts you have never believed in ghosts your imagination has kicked into overdrive it was a spookylooking room so you imbued it with the qualities you expect in a movie with a webshrouded attic the past couple of days have been hell on you mentally so you just manufactured this little fantasy of a ghost boy for a distraction you saw nothing you saw only what your imagination produced for you you must get a grip on yourself jordan for gods sake i washed my face and used the toilet then soaped my hands and face again i bit my lip hard to feel the sharp reality of pain the water felt like life against my face i dried with a towel and stared at myself in the mirror in the calm fluorescent light of the bathroom my hand resting on the cool of the sink the attic seemed far away and seeing the daily trappings of groomingthe basin speckled with flecks of whiskers from my morning shave my toothpaste tube dented in its middle a bottle of aspirin with its cap not set quite straightall this ebbed my fear and the first fingers of doubt massaged my beating heart the cold the vision of the boyid no doubt manufactured it all in my shock it was nothing more time to deal with the pressing issues at hand i pulled the jewelry box from my pocket and decided to hide it among my own clothes until i decided on a course of action i stuck it under a rice sweatshirt id brought for the cool nights that breezed across the coast even in summer and heard the crinkle of plastic in one sleeve as i shoved the box underneath the shirt i hadnt been the only one sneaking around the house nestled in my sweatshirt was a bag full of green pills the delicate letters on the capsules identified them as digoxin these arent mine i tossed the bag on the table in front of victor mendez and i dont know who planted them in my room how about dusting them for prints i dont usually bark out suggestions to lawenforcement officers on how to do their job but fingerprints equaled realitysomething i desperately wanted to deal with instead of longburied family secrets and imaginary children lurking in attics if mendez noticed the tremor in my voice he gave no sign instead he stared at the medicine youre saying someone purposefully hid these in your room i resisted my natural urge toward sarcasm my friendship with mirabeaus own police chief had taught me that investigators often repeated what a witness told them to be sure they had the story right i nodded yes sir i found them just now hidden in one of my sweatshirt sleeves from a corner chair philip bedrich glowered at me well mr mendez finally something you cant accuse me of thats not true i answered mildly i dont know when the pills were stashed in my room you had as much opportunity as anyone else i marveled at how controlled my voice sounded considering the events of the past hour philip shook his head this whole comedy of errors is bullshit why would i stick pills in your room i dont know philip i dont know why you do half the things you do you dont understand he muttered mendez ended our cousinly concord with a wave of his hand he slid the bag of pills into a second container an evidence bag youhe pointed at meoutside you stay here mr bedrich like ive got places to go with the rest of my family thinking im a murderer philip mumbled he ran a hand across his thinning hair and a look of sick worry crossed his features i suspected the iron facade was starting to buckle he didnt seem to have the moral fiber to endure a solitary siege i couldnt imagine what it was like to face a police investigation without my familys support i did not envy him the loneliness he was bound to feel mendez guided me onto the veranda a strong salty breeze gusted in from the water the sun had vanished below the horizon clouds blotted the night sky settling close to earth i felt i could reach out and tangle my hand in their clammy heaviness the wind off the gulf was wet the rain didnt seem to bother mendez he stopped by the swing where bob don had slapped me and regarded me with frankness why does so much in this case keep coming back to you mr poteet he shook the evidence bag in front of my face i saw for the first time how young he looked surely this was not his first homicide but perhaps he was more accustomed to the murders of everyday life the husband slaying the battered wife the teenaged gang member blasting his rival into early oblivion the careless drunk mowing down a pedestrian in her path lolly throckmortons death was the end result of a lace of complex interrelations that offered no simple answers i wondered how mendezs first writeup of this case would read i didnt envy him his job i dont know why someone here doesnt like me or believes i might be easy to frame why would someone want to frame you for mrs throckmortons murder i imagine to avoid prosecution i said mildly doesnt that seem reasonable to you but why you mr poteet youre a stranger to most of these folks blood relation or not strangers are the best scapegoats less guilt that way for the perpetrator give me another reason mr poteet i dont think youre being entirely honest with me he was not a stupid man and i had underestimated him lord only knew what body language my wornout form was speaking i made myself uncross my arms and look as open as possible listen i dont have another reason unless its some of my relations have taken a serious dislike to me mendez tented his cheek with his tongue yes i can see they have why is that theres a lot of money at stake in this family my uncle emmett is terminally ill and hes worth millions i dont think another potential heir is a particularly welcome sight he unwrapped a stick of gum and popped it into his mouth you and philip dont particularly get along we dont maybe youd like to see him sweat i shook my head ive known philip only a day i dont like him particularly but not enough to stir up trouble against him its worth neither the time nor the effort i dont have a whole history of resentment against him mendez chewed watching the scudding clouds darken the night no star glimmered not even one to wish on you see anything else unusual around here aside from my dead cousins ghost i shaped my answer carefully not wanting to betray the fright id felt upstairs i didnt want to see the inside of whatever mentalhealth facility the matagorda bay area offered tom and aubrey got into a fistfight deborah and i had to separate them someone i believe spiked my stepmothers drink with booze because shes an alcoholic and they wanted to end her sobriety aubrey upset the family when his mother announced hes writing a new book about screwy families i already told you wendy and philip planned to chisel money out of uncle mutt anything else mendez was no fool hed spotted the pause in my speech the flicker in my eyes as i remembered my experience no nothing elseexcept yes mendez prodded i thought i heard some sneaking around in the attic i had to tread carefully here i wasnt yet decided what to do about pauls jewelry id found i didnt want the world crashing down around bob don mendez watched me unblinking seeing ghosts and protecting someone who killed a devilish voice chirped in my head i know he would not have killed except in selfdefense an angel murmured in response the storm loudened and i waited for the boom of thunder to pass before answering is there anything else well need to get your prints tomorrow dont be offended we have to have everyones tomorrow my officers and judge yarbrough have returned to the mainland he didnt look at me unless youre so eager to give us your prints you want to come into the sheriffs department tonight odd that the police are gone i kept my voice neutral i think youd want to complete your interrogations make an arrest i dont have any evidence yet mr poteet i have only the word of you and your kin and some of the stories dont quite agree yet were waiting on the toxicology results and im not insensitive to mr goertzs feelings after all this is a house in mourning deference to the rich man im a little surprised at you i couldnt hide my bitterness a murderer strolling free in this house and mendez played local politics mrs throckmorton could have taken the pills herself that possibility still has not been eliminated mr goertz has finally admitted that his sister wasnt always quite balanced in her actions oh ill bet he finally has acknowledged that little fact i suppose its less embarrassing than having another murderer in the family i stepped close to mendez close enough to smell the mint gum on his breath he tensed resenting the intrusion i didnt care you know my uncle paul killed his wife anger had fueled my words too quickly i didnt want to dwell on the horrors that had followed poor noras murder it seems to have shamed the family thoroughly paul goertz killed his wife his family didnt kill that woman they shouldnt feel shame but a light in his dark eyes told me his own clan mightve reacted very similarly i had no answer for him mendez went in to conclude his talks with philip and i heard him call to uncle mutt sitting solitarily in the kitchen uncle mutt stormed past me and didnt give me a second glance philip sat sunk down in his chair his hands cupping his face i felt an unaccountable pity for him he looked like a forlorn lump tom was nowhere to be seen didnt his own twin even believe in him i went upstairs time to start investigating philip bedrich a little more closely i found a phone in lollys room and dialed itasca hueblers home number back in mirabeau itascas my main assistant at the library and possibly one of the great ferreters of information ever known to man i could almost picture her scooping up her maroon phone receiver shes a big texas a ampm supporter and sandwiching it between her jaw and shoulder hello itasca its jordan hey sugar how you enjoying your vacation i didnt want to get into the sordid details of the weekend itasca was sweet but she loved to gossip fine just fine but i was wondering if you could see clear to doing me a favor i live for these moments jordy she teased whats up id like to check up on a fellow named philip bedrich hes an investments counselor of some sort and hes trying to get me to invest some money with him i cant exactly do a little research on him while im here because hes staying at the same house could you call the sec see if hes registered with them and see if hes got any kind of record i could hear her scribbling down the information and i spelled philips name for her again all right she asserted ill give em a call and see what i can see i gave her the number where she could reach me thanked her and hung up poor philip itasca was relentless i stood to leave and thats when i noticed the feathers caught in the wicker of sweeties bed basket white down fluttered in the wooden weave surrounding his pillow i leaned down and pulled the feathers awaythere was the beginning of a tear on the pillows side id heard clothor something similarripping when id hid in lollys closetwhen wendy had asserted bob don was in the room but i hadnt been able to identify what had been disturbed i upended sweeties pillow a long gash tore open the pillows bottom and the downy innards had been disturbed i sat thinking for a long moment then got up in search of candace are you still mad at me i asked from her doorway she lay curled like a cat on her bedspread her eyes halflidded in sleep the thought of her being in the proximity of a coldly conniving killer was enough to frost my blood i didnt want us still bickering she smiled no im not still mad at you i sat down next to her on the bed im going crazy here arguing with bob don in the middle of all of this madness is rotten and then having a spat with you she touched a hand to my lips itll all be over soon i think the police suspect philip he just looks guilty i ran a hand along her hip and she closed her eyes i wanted the comfort of lovemaking but i knew celibacy was the order of the evening instead i softly kissed her hair and she ran a gentle hand along my cheek i love you i murmured and im sorry i was a jerk jordan i love you too even when youre a jerk ill try not to dispense so much advice sometimes i tend to want to tell you what to do instead of just listening a little i kissed her cheek again it was warm but not with fever she smiled at me if you and i can mend fences you and bob don should be able to tightness locked my throat gretchen had confided in me i wanted to tell candace what id learned about bob don but i didnt dare not yet there was no sense in putting her in harms way bob don and i arent setting new records for bonding why cant we just go on with our lives without hurting each other god im tired of this i moved to the window if i give you advice now are you going to explode no im done with that she leaned against my shoulder try something for me put yourself in his shoes he didnt want to abandon you he did what he thought was right and he did that knowing that your mother might never have told you the truth about him he turned and walked away because he wanted to spare you all the pain outside the storm throbbed like a colossal heart i listened to its roar and beat but i couldnt have done that candace i couldnt have just walked away from my child turn heel and flee he watched me he watched me grow up and never came close never tried i swallowed and my eyes stung with repressed anger candace pressed a palm against my back sorrow tinged her voice because to try would have been to ruin your life you were just a little boy his distance was a gift to you then let him come close to you now i rubbed my forehead with the heel of my hand and he doesnt want me again hes made that clear yet gretchen wants me to save him from his own family i cant hes a stubborn goat same as you because he believes you dont want him as a dad now listen jordan if you let him walk awayif you walk awayits going to leave a terrible hole in your life you and he both deserve better but i she stilled me with a kiss when she spoke her lips were soft against my own dont judge him so harshly its hard to know what you would have done in his shoes she hugged me and her throat warmed against my own i held her feeling the heat of her the soft bellows of her lungs setting the pace for my own breathing i told gretchen that i love him she hugged me tighter then why dont you go talk to him again she caressed my face with her fingertip yes i said softly i think i will i stood and paused at the foot of her bed were you in your room late this afternoon when the storm kicked back up she shook her head no i went down to the den and watched television with deborah so my prowler would have had access to the attic through candaces room and candace provided an alibi for deborah i knew sass was in the garden when i heard the footfalls and i didnt believe uncle jake spry enough to navigate a trapdoor and steps plus there was no sign of his cane in the dust at least three i could scratch off my mostlikelytobeskulkingabout list maybe after i talked with bob don i needed to go examine the shoe selection in this house and see who wore a particular tread i found bob don in the television room on the ground floor the tv was tuned to the weather channel and the perky meteorologist described the rapidly moving tropical depression surging up toward texas hurricane season had not kicked into gear but we were due for an onslaught of rain and wind rufus beaulac lay slumped in the leather recliner i knew was uncle mutts regular roost a beer tottered in his loose grasp hi rufus i said would you please excuse us id like to talk to my father alone bob dons head jerked up at the label id used rufus flashed a look of annoyance just as i was gettin comfortable sorry i didnt budge rufus roused himself from the recliner he regarded bob don with a smirk no good drinkin buddies round here since gretch sobered up sass is a snob and the twins dont drink near enough a faint hint of malice colored his words and i wondered for a moment if his had been the hand behind gretchens drunkenness you go and get a head start rufe bob don said and maybe ill join you in a few minutes i could use another shot of bourbon in the worst way rufus regarded me with his murky hazel eyes and his scarred lip formed a crooked smile later boys he saluted ambling out of the room i shut the door behind him i dont much like him i announced bob don kept staring at the television watching a report on a forest fire in oregon i dont think you much like anyone i came and sat on the couch next to him tendering a foot over the hard borders separating us thats not true maybe not you actually referred to me as your father rufus doesnt know the honor hes received sardonic was not bob dons usual style of repartee and he stumbled over his own words you are my father i said softly accident of biology just like you said he stared at the televised inferno true of every child though isnt it jordan i tentatively touched his arm and a cascade of images from the past year flooded past my eyes bob don lying in the hospital after taking a bullet intended for me his blue eyes bright with pain bob don standing over my other daddys grave telling me in a soft voice to realize the good fortunes in my life bob don pleading with me to give gretchen a volunteer job at the library as he subtly tried to knit us into a family the hurt look in his own eyes after hed slapped me on the porch i grabbed the remote from his hands and silenced the television i made a rotten mistake i felt so angry when i found out that you were my biological father and i wanted to punish you i suppose for being part of the conspiracy of silence he turned reddened eyes toward me dont blame your mother she did what she thought best she did what she wanted she wanted to save her marriage she wanted to protect my sister she wanted you out of her life i dont blame her any more than i blame you i dont want to blame anyone anymore i just want my voice broke and he waited in the sudden silence i just want you to be a father to me and a friend the words came in a rush as though id been holding them in my mouth for months sampling their unusual taste he didnt throw his arms around me he didnt whoop for joy why now why the change i couldnt admit to him that i knew hed killed his brother not now perhaps not ever i took one of his hands in mine his was large and warm and every finger was callused from the hard work he did on his property on the weekends ridding himself of the stress of the car dealership and no doubt the stress id inflicted on him over the past months because i need a dad and i need to be your son but you already had a father you told me you didnt need another his voice was hushed i couldnt blame him for not accepting my turnaround immediately id dithered and railed too long for him to risk the hurt of me changing my mind candace has pointed out to me that ive tended to put my father on a pedestal one does that with the dead sometimes but not in this family i silently added daddy wasnt perfect if he was he wouldve saved some money so that we werent in such dire straits when mama got so sick i shrugged he was a good man but he wasnt an ideal man only i made him that way bob don was silent staring at my hand clasping his his pale face mightve been carved of ivory the memory rose to my lips before i could stop it when i was twelve i stopped confiding in daddy id come home from school one afternoon and told himi smiled a little at my follythat whenever i looked at my english teachershe was a beautiful young woman named pamela guenthermy pants hurt because they got too tight because my talleywhacker got hard bob don didnt smile but i thought i saw a brief flitting bit of mirth in his eyes i continued daddy took all this quite seriously and sat me down and gave me the sex talk he was very kind and factual and told me i had nothing to be ashamed of that night daddy and his poker buddies had their weekly game at our house they played out on our enclosed porch when the weather was nice and it was a beautiful night id come down to say good night before going to bed and mama asked me to take the men a tray of beers so i did i came out and began setting the beers down andthey could hardly keep their laughter in id set the last beer in front of royce collins and he said hey jordy your pants hurtin you these days i froze and then bertram wells asked me you gonna be the teachers pet jordy they all exploded in laughter daddy couldnt even look at me lucas behr informed me that if i put grease on captain talleywhacker and stayed out of school maybe my pants wouldnt hurt me so bad and they all laughed again and the sound drifted past our porch screens and across the whole neighborhood i stopped for a moment bob don squeezed my hand tightly id never felt such deep humiliation in my life i laughed along because thats what you do to be one of the guys backing away from them with the tray i wanted to kill daddy for breaking our confidence he saw something in my eyes and just stared down at his hand of cards the others laughed and wished me a good night im sure they didnt mean harm it was their way of acknowledging me as a growing man but id told daddy a secret i wanted him to keep and he hadnt kept his mouth shut for a whole five hours maybe i was a hypersensitive kid but it hurt all the same and daddy should have known how id react that night lying in bed i decided the only people i could ever entirely trust again were mama and my best friend trey and y all are both lost to me now mama in sickness trey in death when maybe i need you the most why did god take you both from me i stared at the floor not wanting to look at bob don pretty silly to get upset about right no its not bob don answered softly id have been embarrassed too and you were a sensitive kid everyone knew that never could abide much teasing my words came in a gush i mean in the whole scheme of my life that one night doesnt matter i still loved daddy i still do he was a wonderful father but he was as capable of hurting me as anyone else bob don reflected for a moment your daddy loved you fiercely remember that most of all but he was a man who did what he thought other people wanted him to do that poker talk probably went around to sex and he didnt think telling that tale on you was breaking a confidence he probably thought it was just adding to the conversation maybe he was proud of you for becoming a young man i shrugged if i ever have a son ill never do that to him bob don finally smiled no youll make a whole other mess of mistakes hell complain about all part of the package jordan i didnt answer right away and the quiet hung between us by the way i said at last that cure lucas behr recommendedgreasing up mr happy it doesnt work bob don exploded in nervous laughter ill keep that in mind he said color rushing into his cheeks and my pants still hurt me sometimes like when i look at candace bantering i felt the connection between us take hold i sent a silent wish toward heaven im not betraying you daddy by taking him into my heart i know im not please dont hate me i glanced at the man who gave me life im sorry for the trash i talked earlier i whispered if i could take them back i would i believe you loved my mother and i know she loved you too im sorry i suggested it was anything cheap that was your anger talking yes i said other words failed me im so sorry i slapped you ill never do it again thats true i agreed i didnt know how to convey the surge in my heart have a father again the jumble of feelings of hurt and fright and giddiness id experienced in the past year smoothed into a warm mellow sensation of acceptance i think when we get back to mirabeau i should let folks know that youre my father i mean some folks already know but they dont speak of it we can speak of it now tears braced in his eyes okay ill keep the name poteet if you dont mind whatever you want son son i echoed i glanced almost shyly at his face there is no mark of cain there i cant believe this man killed his own brother even in selfdefense and im not going to let anything anything happen to him i suppose if youre going to call me son i should call you something other than bob don he opened his mouth then shut it again id feel a tad odd calling you daddy i ventured what did you call your father he smiled almost as shyly as i had i called him daddy i laughed of course why is it southerners are so unimaginative with nicknames for parents and so imaginative with nicknames for grandparents i thought of the photo of my greatgrandfather id examined so closely in lollys room seeing so much of his face in mine and my odd intuition that i wouldve called him poppop hey what about pop aint pop what yankees call cokes well yes i answered he rolled the word about in his mouth as though tasting it pop well if thats what you want to call me i guess ill get used to it i could tell the endearment wasnt entirely to his taste and felt an unexpected relief he hadnt adopted it immediately in mindless gratitudeperhaps the days of putting me unreachably aloft were over we could deal with each other as men now well why dont we try it out and see how it fits okey doke he finally said and then spoke for us both this kind of all feels funny doesnt it yes its a strange family to be joining a momentary flash passed over his face as though the mention of the rest of the goertzes cast a dark shadow across this longawaited moment oh god son lets all just leave just go back to mirabeau and pick up our lives theres nothing for us here but the investigation he snorted i dont care what that judge says there aint no reason to keep us here anyway lieutenant mendez has left left left us here going soon if he aint already his voice sounded choked he seems certain that those toxicology tests are gonna turn up jakes medicine or something else seems lolly sending you those cards convinced him that she took her own life crazy like she was crazys not enough why would she kill herself he stood and leaned against the dens bookshelves i didnt relent someone planted a bag of digitalis pills in my clothes so if the cops searched itd look like i had a stash of poison i heard mendez and mutt talking mutt told him thats exactly what lolly would do to make it look like you killed her along with the cards you can see how crazy she was his voice drifted off are you protecting a murderer pop the only thing crazy is that theory lolly didnt want me here for some reason tried to frighten me away and when that didnt work poisoned herself with jakes medication and tried to frame me for the crime listen to yourself pop mutts influence might make mendez buy this but i dont why on earth would she his face set dont ask so many questions dont fine i wont id traveled that road before today and gotten nowhere fast so you think we can go soon putting distance between us and sangre island felt like putting distance between us and paul goertzs death lets hope uncle mutts calling a family meeting tonight after he has himself a long chat with philip and wendy i swallowed i would not want to be in their shoes facing mutts formidable wrath pop leaned against the shelves he looked weary to the bone i wanted to go and embrace him tell him i knew about the familys dark past but i didnt he would have to tell me his secret on his own terms i could not ford that deep harsh river for him he opened his mouth as if to speak then closed it firm you probably need to talk to gretchen explain how things are between us i need to go talk to candace okay son he came forward and awkwardly embraced me in a bearish hug the thump of his heart thrummed against my chest and his breath scented with bourbon was a warm stream against my ear for all my famed wit and tongue i had no words he did i love you he murmured he kissed the side of my cheek and embraced me again he released me after another moment and turned away i watched him leave the den and felt for one terrible moment as if id stepped off the edge of a precipice gravity was not the only inexorable force in the world loves just as potent i went upstairs to tell candace i had a father and to set in motion the most horrifying night of my life i didnt find candace in her room so i ambled down to deborahs quarters thinking she might be visiting my cousin my cousin it seemed even more real now that pop was pop i felt light almost giddy as though a weight had been lifted from my aching back the choice to love is frightening but its also energizing i felt like a new man in many ways i was deborah sitting on her bed saw it in my face she sat in a dim circle of light tossed by her bedside lamp perusing a photo album you look happy whats up it seemed wrong to share my good news before telling candace so i simply smiled and said i let my head soften a tad she glanced at me in puzzlement what stubbornness i shed myself of some of it tonight i sat on the edge of the bed thats not always a smart move she closed the album and tossed it away from her as if it reeked deborah whats going on here what do you mean she evaded my stare watching the lightningnow nearly continuousas it illuminated the sky with you and this family she didnt respond for so long i thought she had not heard my softly uttered question she slicked her lips with her tongue still not looking at me finally she spoke im just a bad reminder jordan of what an unfortunate time for this family im sorry she laughed a short brittle horrible sound youre a stranger and you care more than they do think any of these people gave a shit about my mother oh sure they were sorry as hell she died terribly sad terribly unfortunate and wasnt she so pretty they spoke all the right lines in the play of mourning but i never felt they cared about my mom she paused your moms sick right alzheimers yes is it bad very but she still draws breath deborah murmured my mothers face was blown off i shouldnt dwell on it but i do you can at least hold your mother tell her you love her touch her hair i can only drop flowers on a cold grave my heart ached for her i didnt know sorrow like deborahs so the goertzes were more worried about your dad worried embarrassed is more like it horrified at what was being written in the papers paul goertz wanted for murder she licked her lips again and i saw the worn exhaustion in her face ever have a murderer in your family no well not that i know of the lie came easily she laughed again jagged and full of weary sadness its kind of like playing a board game rule one dont ever pass go without being reminded your fathers a killer rule two never speak of it to outsiders you get really good at manufacturing colossal lies wheres my dad he travels a lot hong kong paris berlin or he died of cancer always an easy out she closed her eyes rule three anyone who breaks the first two rules gets the whole wrath of the family down on them and wrath is what bitchy comments from lolly a whack from jakes cane a lecture on loyalty from mutt you dont understand deborahs voice was a tight wire of anger im afraid of them your own family for gods sake why theytheyshe stumbled to my shock i saw fear in her face as dark and deep as a well because a terrible realization nudged against my consciousness and deborahs words on the porch what seemed like an eternity ago brian used to be sure our father was alive somewhere what happened to your brother deborah her lips tightened into a grieving line i told you he died when he was about twelve or so yes we also dont talk about it much her voice lowered to the barest of whispers he died in this house though didnt he i tried not to picture the shade id imagined in the attic not not in the house he died down off the beach tell me he he went swimming by himself late at night when we were all here for a family reunion he got a cramp or something he got caught out in the surf he drowned deborah didnt look at me i blinked trying to blur away the image of the boy id seen in the attic how did you know who told you bob don she asked no gretchen i answered automatically actually i saw your dead brother wild aint it i cant say he sends his best he glared at me with bitter hatred i took a long shuddering breath im so sorry deborah her hand clasped mine why do you want to know about brian the answer lurking in my heart was in my mouth before i could even give it form my family is a great one for reminiscing for keeping the dead alive in our hearts by sharing stories about them talking about them letting those who came after they were gone know about them ever read katherine anne porters story old mortality talks about how dead relatives get built into these amazing legends i loved that story because it rang so true to my own family i shook my head but the goertzes are strange theyre not like any other family ive ever seen they dont talk about their dead ive yet to hear one memory one anecdote about anyone in this family whos passed on did you all take a vow of silence no its not entirely true tom and i care about my brother still tom i know you think hes a hairtrigger temper but hes a good man at heart he was always so good to brian toms sure and her voice broke as though recognizing the betraying tone of confiding in me i changed tactics there wasnt anything suspicious about brians death was there her eyes widened in shock of course not of course not there couldnt be it was only the family that was here just like last night when lolly dropped dead i grabbed deborahs arms and pulled her close to me you dont believe your aunt committed suicide do you or had a simple heart attack she averted her face from mine i dont know what to believe she was a sick woman you know that tell me about your brother what was he like she broke away from me and fled to the window leaning her head against the rattling pane more thunder sounded counterpoint to the building wind please dont make me talk about brian please i surrendered realizing id rudely overstepped the bounds of decency in pressing her for information deborah im sorry i dont mean to upset you well you do she pivoted and glared at me meaning well though im sure youre awfully busy prying into your new familys past ever think you might be ignoring candace i didnt answer her immediately did candace complain to you jordan shes a wonderful girl and she loves you so and i know you love her why dont you just take her and leave the police cant possibly suspect you in lollys death they might now youre manufacturing excuses are you staying for bob dons sake in a matter of speaking i answered carefully i turned to leave and if i stay deb its because as strange as it seems to me yall are family now and ive never abandoned family in crisis never she didnt say anything as i left candace wasnt in her room and she wasnt waiting in mine either damn i glanced at my closet and against my will a prickle of goose bumps raised themselves along my flesh somethings up there i took a steadying breath dont be ridiculous counting clouds a voice boomed behind me and i nearly jumped out of my skin i turned to find philip glaring at me lounging against my doorway his arms crossed casually across his chest no just thinking thinking jordan like about how you can screw me over next his face darkened and he spoke so softly i could barely hear him over the gusts hammering against the house im not trying to screw you philip i retorted oh really so you just manufacture these lies about me for idle amusement i didnt lie about what i saw or what i heard his tone harshened the old cadence of the schoolyard bully you dont want to fuck with me or what i shot back feeling a creeping weariness set into my bones im not the least bit afraid of you philip and if youve committed murder im going to see you go down for it ah the big detective he mocked i dont suppose it ever occurred to you that if we had a copy of bitter money i looked at it because i saw lolly die and i recognized the symptoms of digitalis poisoning i didnt know you were wellread you can be snide with me all you want jordan but i didnt murder my aunt and i didnt plant those pills in your room even if you didnt kill lolly youre trying to steal from mutt you why dont you use that vaunted brain of yours lets say i did return the copy of that damn book so no one would see it if you and mutt hadnt been in the library i wouldnt have had to be secretive think about it i opened my mouth and then shut it lest flies nest you suspected lolly had been poisoned like the wife in bitter money and uncle mutt killed his own sister youre not the only one who might play holmes all right sherlock why would mutt kill lolly my eyes narrowed and why are you suddenly confiding in me i would never make the mistake of confiding in you he snapped you jump to too many conclusions and you act way too impulsively im just asking you before you go off halfcocked again to sit and watch the cars go by cars you make no sense he grabbed my arm he was surprisingly strong and yanked me closer to him i tried to wrench my arm free but philip held me in a relentless grip im only warning you for bob dons sake i dont think youre really worth sticking my neck out for but im gonna youre his kid and he loves you something fierce so just listen to me stay out of this goddamned mess stay as far away from uncle mutt as you can and go home as soon as youre able his slow languorous drawl had speeded to a brisk pace kept low to a harsh whisper his eyes were chips of cobalt in the dim light from my bedside lamp and his heavy face resembled smoothed implacable marble let go i said distinctly not bothering to hiss as he had he released his vise and an expression of resignation crossed his face i yanked my arm away dont lay a hand on me again philip i said i wont i wont bother to warn you again a nervous rap sounded from the door frame and aunt sass stood there watching us both uncle mutts called a family gathering downstairs in the library with professor plum and the candlestick philip joked no one laughed he turned without another word and brushed past her she watched my face her own expressionless dont tell me philip rattled you i thought you lacked nerves or feelings of course not i started toward the door not willing to suffer her company she pushed a hand hard with rings and nails against my shoulder my brother claims you and he have settled your differences says yall are truly father and son now and im sure it galls you i kept my voice low i wasnt about to let sass steam me again make sure it works out dont renege on your promise i dont want to see my brother hurt any more yes your support is just the kind he needs i moved past her and be kind to gretchen no one wants her upset and drinking again sass called to my back i turned slowly her smugness was practically a low art form i wanted to tell her i knew all about her familys filthy secret and see if she could squirm but i held my silence as close as a lover i didnt answer just looked at her and eventually she wriggled under my gaze crossing her arms in discomfort why do i believe gretchen drunk and bob don unhappy truly wouldnt matter much to you thats ridiculous do you think they dont deserve to be happy after all he killed your other brother shouldnt he pay but i kept my thoughts to myself i declare theres something wrong with you she muttered pushing past me in her own retreat i followed her down the stairs to the clan gathering the study was funereally quiet it looked like a room that belonged in a far more placid house books stood lined perfectly on the shelves patiently awaiting interested readers a crystal vase of lilies stood on a side table mournfully drooping in shallow water the television was tuned to a sports channel muted baseball players moved between the points of the great diamond the crowd celebrating silently as the runners headed home the collected goertzes ignored the excitement on the screen i found candace sitting with deborah on the couch tom stood moodily by the windows close to the hammer of rain pounding the panes he did not even look at me as i came in philip and sass my favorites stood near the fireplace heads leaning close together wendy roamed the room bringing drinks aubrey stood on the opposite side of the room from tom watching the assemblage with guarded eyes jake sat in his customary chair staring off into the air his face creased with sadness i wondered if he was finally beginning to mourn for lolly pop and gretchen stood near the television talking in hushed tones gretchen caught my eye and gave me a shaky smile maybe everything was going to be okay mutt strode into the study his body seemed tensed and he darted a quick glance around the entire room as if quickly tallying attendance get settled yall he went to the television and switched off the baseball game everyone get a drink if you dont have one wendyll get them wendy paused in front of me since nearly everyone else already had glasses in hand what do you want she asked beer please i watched her retrieve a cold bottle of shiner bock from the studys bar refrigerator aubrey gretchen and candace all declined alcohol aubrey poured tall glasses of cranberry juice for himself and candace gretchen opted for a can of diet cola everyone got their drink mutt asked as wendy handed me my beer this aint no party mutt uncle jake huffed if you got a point make it i do he said and he hoisted his own glass of bourbon in the air to lolly to her beloved memory awkward silence filled the air then a rush of voices murmured in unison to lolly we all sipped at our drinks i felt little enthusiasm for mutts toast it seemed in odd taste at best pop wouldnt catch my eyes he was busy watching gretchen sitting next to him on an antique chaise and where have the police run off to aubrey inquired he sipped again at his juice and sent a challenging stare over the rim of his glass at his uncle they have not run off aubrey theyve left this family to mourn alone as they should mutt iced his answer with a chilling tone and without completing their investigation philip quietly observed my sisters death is a terrible tragedy theres nothing to investigate mutt didnt act like hed heard philips aside cost you a pretty penny didnt it aubrey said he took another hard swig of his juice and the look on his face suggested hed consider spitting it at mutt i sipped my beer and watched mutts reaction he shook his head sadly at aubrey you perplex me aubrey thats just the word for what you do you nag this whole family to get in touch with their feelings but as soon as we start expressing grief you turn up your nose do we stink like shit to you this charadeit isnt grief he stared around the room has anyone here cried is anyone sorrys shes dead oh aubrey i heard gretchen murmur dont dont how dare you ask such a question uncle mutt stormed how dare you ask if im sorry my sisters dead aubrey didnt flinch did you gather us here just for a toast uncle mutt tom quietly asked or was there something else you wanted i uncle mutt fell silent i thoughtoddlyhe was unprepared for the question tom sipped at his drink and i saw mud ingrained deeply around his fingernails how generous jordan is aubrey said i see he toasted lolly after she sent him those despicable letters dont you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk candace snapped god aubrey youre like an endless selfhelp tape i glanced at her she was not usually irritableat least with anyone but me her skin looked flushed and she sipped at her cranberry juice while scowling at aubrey its called forgiveness aubrey i added before he could lay into candace i forgive lolly for what she did to me im in an awfully forgiving mood these days i didnt glance at pop but i figured a hint of a smile might be on his face how fortunate for the rest of us sass observed from her perch stop this bickering uncle jake said he rubbed at his chest a faint wheeze issuing from his mouth yall make me tired too tired tell lolly to get my pills deborah stood and hurried to him aunt lollys not here uncle jake she glanced at mutt who also went to his uncles side good god dont all hover jake said im okay just id like to get to bed take my pills deborah eased the old man up to his feet and tom pushed past mutt to take jakes other arm sass tried to help but jake waved her away i dont need a damned parade cecilia deb and tomll manage good night all he made an absent gesture of farewell and the rest of the family bade him a quiet chorus of good nights as he left propped up by tom and deborah maybe we should call a doctor for him sass suggested deborahll take good care of him mutt said he went to the bar and refilled his glass with a sloppy pour of bourbon wendy stood behind the bar watching himand uswith arms folded wrapped in her own silence whatll you do with uncle jake now that lollys gone i asked hes been worried youll ship him off to a nursing home hell i aint gonna shove poor jake out on an iceberg if thats what you mean goertzes take care of family always family he turned back from the bar and i saw he was a little drunk mutt favored himself with another big swig of bourbon and raised his glass once more as though one awkward moment wasnt enough heres to lolly our lolly the second salute was met with less enthusiasm i felt fidgety as though i was sitting through a toorehearsed play as the others reluctantly quaffed their drinks i stood for my own toast to other absent kin i said tipping my beer bottle toward mutt to brian may he rest in peace the storm intensified outside or else the sudden shocking silence in the room made it seem louder sit down son pop said from his chair gretchens face paled to brian aubrey murmured downing more of his juice he shifted from foot to foot as if uncomfortable toasting dead children is horribly shameful that was sasss contribution youre right i shot back at her i didnt know if it was the beer warming my veins but i felt sick and tired of the hypocrisy seeping through the rooms i guess you know about the tragedy of brian mutt answered and i dont appreciate you making light of it i certainly am doing no such thing uncle mutt he wasnt the only one who could frost his voice i feel sick and sad i never got to know my cousin brian i feel cheated he sounds like he was a great kid he was sass made a coughing noise he was a wonderful kind boy philip stared at the floor aubrey turned away and downed the rest of his drink pop put an arm around gretchens slumping shoulders i glanced again at sass to my amazement she was crying fat tears rolling along her rouged cheek what did you knowthe beast could weep i wanted to say im sorry im sorry hes gone but i didnt i said nothing aubrey leaned against the back of the chair uncle jake had vacated maybe we should go check on uncle jake tom mightve buried him you know toms been roaming around the island with a shovel aubrey looked excited his skin was flushed his eyes wide and he dragged a hand across his lips i saw with distaste a ropy string of drool stuck to his hand shovel mutt said what the hell for aint no buried treasures on sangre so what is buried here uncle mutt aubrey persisted i turned to stare at mutt of course if i could gather suspicions in a matter of dayswhat of aubrey or tom or deborah whod had years to think and reflect on the events of that longago night nothing nothing mutt said i glanced back at aubrey just as his eyes rolled and he fell away from the chair his knees buckled and he collapsed bonelessly his head striking the rug his empty glass of juice shattering on the hardwood floor he gasped in hard breaths and began to retch moaning sass gretchen pop philipthe whole room rushed to his side crowding around him and gretchen began screaming out for deborah to hurry back down her voice was like a banshees to haunt ones dreams aubreys face slick with vomit turned toward mine as sass tried to ease him into a more comfortable position his pupils were huge like black holes of death the broken cranberry juice glass lay at my feet oh no i leaped toward the couch as candace stood and cradling her stomach folded to the floor i seized her arms in mine and pulled her close to me her skin felt clammy against my hands the thump of her heart against mine seemed thuddingly slow im sick she said and vomited across my back i grabbed her and headed for the bar sink shoving mutt and wendy out of the way i fumbled for a glass of water forced it down her she threw it back up over my fingers shuddering okay maybe vomiting was better to get whatever filth was in her system out of her i shoved my fingers into her mouth doubling her over the sink and felt another warm rinse of bile cascade past my hand get some mustard i hollered at gretchen mix it in water across the room i saw philip stand up from kneeling next to aubrey a look of disbelief on his face pop rushed to the bar holding on to candaces side i pulled her head back mopping at her face screaming at my father to get deborah candace stared up at the ceiling as though looking for the entrance her breath shook no no she gasped jordy no baby well get help i said youll be okay i glanced at pop call and get the boat weve got to get them to a doctor pop stumbled for the phone jordan wendy stood behind me and she stepped around to support candaces other side wendys face usually emotionless was now crumpled with shock oh no candace moaned her damp fingers squeezing mine numb hard cramps doubled her over and i couldnt see her agonized face no please not the baby not the baby it was over i sat on the floor outside of candaces room banished for the moment by deborah i could hear quiet noises of movement inside as deborah tended to her patient blood candaces and that of our childslicked my hands and i stared at my reddened trembling fingers outside the wind continued its angry roar but it was a mere whisper compared with the rage i felt inside i didnt even hear pop approach and kneel down on the floor next to me he didnt speak he just wrapped awkward arms around me ignoring my bloodied state and i hugged him back fiercely i thought tears would come should come but i felt empty and barren inside but pops hold was comforting and he smelled like a dad should of mint and bourbon and sweat after a minute he spoke hows she doing i managed to speak my voice not sounding like my usual raspy drawling baritone it sounded like the voice of an old man the bleedings stopped shes resting shes still showing some effects from the poison but deb induced vomiting with warm mustard water and she said she thinks shes going to be okay i could hardly make my mouth form the next words she was pregnant and she hadnt told me our baby is gone i am so sorry son so very sorry pop whispered into my hair the phones i asked still down the storm he didnt finish his sentence then a boat weve got to get her to a hospital son he pulled away and his blue eyes stared hard into mine we cant take a boat out in this mess it should pass soon well get her and aubrey more help i cant just sit here i bolted to my feet we have to get her help deborah cant do everything i gestured helplessly toward the shut door you listen to me pop grabbed me and shook me hard jordan deb has done everything she can but we cant call for help right now and we cant risk taking a boat out in this storm we could swamp in minutes and what good is that he squeezed my arms the phones could be back up at any minute well keep trying well get them help i steadied myself the last thing candace needed was me hellbent and foolish hows aubrey deb left candace for a while to tend to him not good he drank more of the poison than candace did but hes holding on sass and gretchen are with him pops eyes teared and i realized aubrey mattered a lot to him oh pop im sorry i embraced him i know youre worried sick about aubrey too i hope hes okay sasssaid she hopes candace is all right pop averted his face i know you and sass havent gotten along shes just a tad protective of me i dont want to talk about her i said abruptly okay gretchen said shell be up in a minute shes worried sick about poor candace pop tactfully changed subjects shed have been up here its just that sass needed more help with aubrey i understand pop i turned from him and leaned my head against the wall the door opened and deborah slipped outside she looked exhausted dark bags sagging beneath her eyes her hands were clean but i could see the red tinge of blood still on her knuckles and her unpolished fingernails deb i asked is she going to be okay shes resting and the vomiting has stopped the bleeding hasnt resumed but i dont know what poison was used and i dont know what else to do just treat the symp toms as i can she leaned against the door she needs a doctor jordan is the phone working yet no i said and pop says its way too rough to risk a boat right now a rough boat ride might do more harm deborah said softly can i go back in now i asked yes but she needs to rest she needs someone with her at all times in case the symptoms worsen gretchen came down the hall then looking as weary as the rest of us her eyes were reddened from weeping oh god pop said aubrey hes still with us sass is asking for you deb gretchen leaned against her husband ill go check on him one of yall stay with candace she hurried down the hallway i watched her leave pop stay here a minute would you i turned and went into her room one lamp was on and it cast a harsh light across the pallor of candaces skin she breathed slowly and i saw a thin stream of drool issue from her mouth i wiped it away with a towel by the bedside her eyes lay halfopen and i brushed her hair back with my hand she smelled of vomit i pulled the sheets back and stared at the towel jammed between her legs three more soaked with blood lay crumpled in the corner deb had been in a hurry i didnt want to think about what might lie inside hands shaking i picked up the towels and moved them into the bathroom i didnt want candace to see them she had been poisoned and shed lost a lot of blood her skin was cool and clammy to my touch i brushed her cheek softly and her eyes opened her pupils huge and dark the blue of her irises barely circles around the blacks baby i stroked her face with one hand daddy her eyes shut again no sweetheart its jordan im here oh she exhaled harshly and another cascade of spit oozed from her lips i wiped it away is the chickory on yet you know you gotta drink chickory when youre in new orleans i grimaced whatever substance had nearly killed her also painted illusory pictures in her mind no baby the coffees not on yet ill go make you some though um those damn birds sure are making a racket tears stung my eyes ill make them be quiet sugar she licked at her lips and shrugged away from my touch fucking birdsll wake up the baby a dark flush colored her skin and she bent to her side retching the heaves were dry and i held her until they subsided she rolled back over on her back and grew still her breathing a little more even candace she sniffed once and didnt answer slipping into sleep i sat and watched her for five minutes dabbing at the saliva that slicked her chin when her sleep seemed even i went back out into the hall gretchen was murmuring to pop in a soft reassuring voice gretchen would you mind sitting with candace for a minute shes resting a little more comfortably now sure hon she broke away from pop and regarded me for a moment then she surprised me with a fierce hug its going to be all right jordy it will be then she broke away from me and went into candaces room easing the door shut behind her pop stared at me with bleary eyes you tell me why why would anyone hurt candace i asked i dont know he began and a hard fury seized me i whirled and grabbed his shirt hard enough fucking secrets i hissed i found pauls jewelry in the attic i know you killed him his jaw worked whawhat i know paul came here after he murdered nora he intended to kill you and gretchen you killed him in selfdefense and the whole family conspired to cover it up yall forged his suicide note that mutt found or pretended to find yall dumped his body somewhere here on the island or out in the baybut kept his jewelry i found it oh god oh god pop whimpered he stumbled away from me but i didnt release his shirt i heard the rip of fabric he stared at me with frenzied eyes i can hazard a guess at what happened here tonight aubreys writing a book on screwedup families and god knows hes got himself an unbelievable case study here maybe he found out the truth about pauls death maybe someone decided aubrey knew too much and had to be gotten rid of like he wasnt anything more than a fucking insect my voice cracked and candace made the mistake of drinking cranberry juice out of the same pitcher goddamn it you tell me who did this pop sobbed i eased my hold on his shirt my heart pounding if he didnt tell me i dont know he muttered you were in lollys room this morning you took something out of sweeties bed was it pauls jewelry is that where shed hid it i dont know what youre talking about jordy you listen to me if you dont tell me its over between us i will walk away from here and youll never see me again you will be out of my heart and out of my mind words fueled by grief and anger poured from me like foulness from a suppurating wound ill even leave mirabeau candace and i will go and youll never see us again you tell me whats happening here his entire face trembled oh god i never wanted you to know my brothermy bruhbruh he wept then he wept like a man possessed by a demon and then shown the face of god we sank to the floor together in our embrace his head turned away so i couldnt see his tears gretchen opened the door and stared at us i shook my head at her and she retreated back into candaces room i let him cry then wiped his face with the bottom of my tshirt after his sobs subsided he stared at the colorful patterns of the persian rug on the floor i cradled pops heavy jaw in my hands and turned his face to mine i will still love you no matter what you did i whispered no matter what but this isnt going to continue im not going to let whoevers behind this misery get away he tried to pivot his face away and i wrenched it back squeezing hard where does it end my child will never be now candace and aubrey may die lollys already dead you tell me who this is i honestly dont know honestly believe me he blinked how did you know what i did gretchen told me shes known ever since paul died his blue eyes bloodshot widened she knew yes all these years she knew and she still loved you he made an unintelligible sound what happened that night tell me iwe were all here mutt was beside himself at the thought of a killer in our family he was deeply worried about deborah and brian how this would affect them we had buried nora here cause she had no people of her own i didnt want to believe paul had killed her he and i hadnt gotten along since gretchen divorced him and married me id tried but he wouldnt i couldnt help but feel as though noras death was somehow my faultif id gotten sense into paul or if id just stayed away from gretchennora never would have come into our family never would have died he dragged the back of his hand across his face nora was a fine woman a good person she didnt deserve to die like she did and you went to her grave that night i prompted he nodded miserably i dont knowmaybe i just wanted to be alone apologize to her for the mess id created in our lives what paul did wasnt your fault pop youre not responsible for his actions he shook his head i felt like her blood was on my hands i couldnt help but blame myself a shiver ran through him he was there hiding behind one of the tombs god jordan the look on his face haggard and crazy hed stolen a boat from port lavaca and come to the other side of sangre he had a gunsaid he and i had unfinished business my brother my own brother his voice faded and his eyes went distant with remembered grief but it wasnt paul it was some stranger in his skin he took a fortifying breath i squeezed his shoulders in support i told him to put the gun down he and i could settle our differences with fists like gentlemen he laughed kind of crazy like said he couldnt do that had three bullets he saidone for me one for gretchen the last for himself so he meant to kill himself too he paused not that it makes what i did no better he told me to stand on noras grave said it was fitting my blood could soak the ground where she lay said hed kill gretchen there too if he could i did what he said im so ashamed id pissed my pants and i stank paul laughed at me and he raised the gun i knew then he truly meant to shoot me he touched my jaw you know that fear son i know you do weve both been there yes i managed i know what it means to see in another persons eyes that they mean to kill you he leveled the gun at me i was begging him not to that we were brothers he cocked the gun and i quit thinkingi just threw myself at him he fired and missed i felt the bullet go through my hair i tackled him and we fought for the gun and i got my hands on it and it went off and oh god there was so much blood and this smell of burned flesh the memories weighed too hard on him and he bowed his head pop i said he was dead in my arms he didnt say a word before he died i dropped him and i ran back to the house i was out of my mind uncle jake and sass caught me out on the porch and i told them what happened sass got lolly and mutt and told them aunt lolly was hysterical that id go to jail the terrible shame the family was already suffering would just get worse so uncle mutthe said wed make it look like suicide i forged the note mutt jake and lolly did away with the bodyi dont even know where it is mutt just told me theyd taken care of it the police accepted the story and we all thought that was the end he sagged against the wall exhausted now that his tale was told a vein of lightning blasted the sky and its elfin light played along our faces from the halls window one of them mustve taken pauls jewelry off of him i think it was hidden in lollys room in sweeties bed wendy said she saw you there he shook his head firmly then shes lying i never was in that room i swallowed the murderer must be sass mutt or jake then pop coughed misery clouded his face but gretchen found out you found out maybe one of the other kids did too i mean you said thats why aubrey got poisoned because he knew something i closed my eyes aubreys cold chatter during the family gathering idly challenging you know toms been roaming around the island with a shovel i hugged pop close thank you for trusting me i love you son he began but i stood i need to go check on candace and aubrey i paused my hand on the door gretchen sat quietly by candace who slept i watched the gentle rise of her breath and watched gretchens fingers laced with hers shes sleeping gretchen said not looking at me she seems better deb may have saved her life i went and kissed candaces forehead will you stay with her while i attend to some business whatwhere are you going im making sure no one else gets hurt even if i have to blow this family apart to do it i touched gretchens shoulder bob dons going to be okay he is i dont want him to get in trouble for what he did she began and i pointed at candace see her thats the price of secrecy in this family the price of wronged pride no more gretchen you or i or pop could be next she gulped yes of course ill stay with her ill take good care of her jordy i know you will thank you i gave candace a final look before i shut the door behind me i went downstairs to aubreys room deborah stood outside testing the hallway phone she slammed it down in disgust phone still dead i asked yes goddamned storm goddamned island she rubbed her eyes with her hands hows aubrey holding on hes not conscious and his vomiting has stopped but his heart rates slow and i dont have anything to give him for it was it digitalis like lolly i dont know some of the symptoms are similarthe vomiting the clammy skin the delirium but i dont think either of them got a dose the size of lollys i didnt speak i cant be sure what they were given deborah leaned against the wall i need to check on candace shes sleeping and she seems to be resting better gretchens with her i took debs cold hand in mine youve saved her life thank you oh jordan deborahs mouth set in a tight line im so sorry so sorry about the baby i swallowed i had no words i knewshe confided in me when you saw us out on the dock she was trying to find the right way to tell you bitterness welled in me oh god she shouldnt have worried about it she could have just told me she was concerned about how youd take the news of being a dad you were already dealing with so much with your own father i think she was just biding for a better time how far along was she about six weeks and jordan dont be upset with her please she didnt want you to feel trapped oh god im not upset with her but a secret place in my heart froze why couldnt she just have told me i was sick of secrets sick of shadows part of me wanted to tell deborah the horrible truth about her father let one more secret end here but i held back it was a dreadful message to deliver and i decided those responsible needed to confess their crimes uncle mutt was going to sing like a canary before i was through may i see aubrey i asked deborah nodded ill go check on candace just go on in aunt sass is with him she squeezed my hand and went up the stairs i rapped on the door a voice called come in i slipped into the dim room aubrey lay under the sheets a sheen on his flushed face like candaces his room reeked of vomit a sickening perfume scenting the air aunt sass sat by his bed dabbing at his lips with a cloth she glanced up at me then stared what do you want she asked her voice was curiously blank drained of its usual verve and sarcasm how is he he was hallucinating earlier now hes asleep i dont want to think he may not wake up she turned back to her sons form candace the same perhaps not as bad she didnt drink as much as he did i pulled a chair up to the opposite side of aubreys bed sass watched me for a long moment then turned away i went to his closetno tennis shoes there i checked on the other side of the bed aware of sasss eyes on me a scuffed pair of white leather sneakers lay on their sides i examined the bottom of one the tread was similar to the print left in the attics dust so aubrey had been the one sneaking around the attic and the one whod hidden pauls jewelry and probably the one who took it from lollys room while i hid in the closet so why had wendy lied for him sass wiped at her sons mouth although i couldnt see any spittle had formed mutt says we cant take a boat yet have to wait for the storm to break mutt doesnt run this family anymore i said softly and her hand jerked along aubreys lips she made no answer so i pressed on dont you think hes pulled the strings long enough on you all i dont know what you mean her eyes locked on aubreys sleeping flushed face his breath seemed a bare whisper if deborah didnt get the poison out of him soon enough hell die his heart will fail her glower raked across my face why do you say such horrible things to me tell me who did this to him sass i dont know she snapped if i did id settle the score really you knew bob don killed paul and didnt seem to hold a grudge she exhaled in a long slow sigh get out of here i dont know what youre talking about end this charade now sass silence has brought this family nothing but pain its put lolly in her grave and it may put candace and aubrey there too at this she shuddered no hes going to be okay my babys going to be just fine she uttered her assurance with a strident tone you know if you and i were ever on the same side we could kick serious ass i murmured and she sobbed i sat as her crying intensified aubrey moved restlessly in his doze he knew didnt he he found out about the coverup cooked up between the elder goertzes to protect pop for pauls death her lips narrowed in answer and someone found out he knew and decided to shut him up except candace got taken out along with him im sorry about your girlfriend i hope shes okay she might be but she lost our baby sasss face drained of color and she made a noise in her throat my babys lost your baby might be lost too is all this worth your silence i dont know who did this to him i dont know who killed lolly do you have a suspicion she shook her head it could be any of them whats the bad blood between aubrey and tom i dont know they always got along fine until aubrey came back from being a runaway i think tom disapproved of aubreys mistakes i stood i believe im going to have a few words with tom maybemaybe you could just let this alone she whispered aubreys doing better i think and im sure candace will be fine you can leave and never come back and ill be sure aubrey stays away and keeps his mouth shut no one has to know your father killed paul and no one has to know you covered it up i took a step back youre more worried about your own skin than you are about your sons the accusation wounded her and she stiffened thats not true but her eyes didnt linger near me or near her unconscious sons face no wonder he ran away i headed for the door where are the notes for his book sass his laptop i gestured at the empty desk near his bed did they get up and walk away she evaded my question whatre you going to do jordan sass challenged tell your tale to the police lead them to pauls body you have no evidence and if you blow the whistle your father might be tried for murder is that what you want huh answer me i hesitated by the closed door before i turned back to her who said anything about the police sass mutts convinced the police to leave us alone im not so sure im interested in law as much as justice i dont need the police for that then youre just like the rest of us no worse and no better i shouldnt have called you a mistake youre a goertz through and through she sank down next to her son and began to stroke his face with hard caresses as though she could pour her own lifes energies into him i shut the door on her and her words tom and mutt had questions to answer as i went down the stairs a jab of pain in my own stomach nearly floored me i realized i hadnt eaten a bite since lunch i needed to keep up my strength although eating food of any sort in this house seemed risky id find some canned soupor other safe comestiblein the kitchen and fix dinner for myself pop gretchen and deborah hell maybe id even fix something for sass and perhaps aubrey and candace could be helped by food i skirted past the voices in the study i could hear jake and mutt arguing loudly apparently jake had been retrieved from his bedroom with all the panic and had found a second wind to bicker with mutt i hurried to the kitchen finding it deserted i busied myself with pots and pans grilledcheese sandwiches and canned tomato soup should be safe i reasoned my eyes stung the combo was a favorite lunch of candaces i tried not to think about herabout the babytoo much not out of selfishness its just that i didnt want to be crumpled into a fetal ball too consumed by grief to act or avenge i didnt have the luxury of remorse right now the knot i felt in my guts would have to wait for a better time to unravel when candace and i could mourn together my shoulder blades itched as i worked as though sasss words had left a spike in my back just exactly how did i propose to bring this poisoner to justice without exposing pop as a killer even though i knew hed shot paul in selfdefenseor even by accidentthe family had conspired to cover the death up as though itd been the most heinous fratricide ever committed what if the police and the courts viewed pops actions as homicide by continuing to pry into the past i might be sending my father to prison i emptied the tomato soupits tanginess nipping at my noseinto a pot and turned on the heat the soup resembled sour thick blood and again i fought back thoughts of candace red reddish soup reddish blood on her legs on my hands i remembered last valentines daythe scattering of red rose petals on my bed our laughter at my silly antics which seemed so far away i belonged by her side i wondered if i did nothing would anyone act lolly was dead aubrey and candace might die and with a mad poisoner in the family would any of us truly be safe i was risking my fathers freedom by proceeding with an investigation but i was letting a murderer get away scotfree if i didnt intervene i slathered butter on bread stuck cheese in between and began to grill the sandwiches the heat from the stove offering a little comfort as the storm continued to rage smells good a voice said behind me i hadnt heard tom come into the kitchen he stood by the refrigerator and fished a can of cola from its depths he glanced at the makeshift dinner i was preparing and very smart too jordan cheese and bread and canned soup safe and difficult to tamper with have you given the subject of poisoning a lot of thought tom a cold anger threaded through my body as i watched him lounge against the refrigerator he popped open his coke and took a long draw well gretchen came down and said aubrey and candace seemed to be improving candace was pregnant she miscarried my words struck like a slap his mouth gaped jesus christ jordan im sorry holy hell i moved away from the stove and toward him you nearly beat aubrey to a pulp today and when you were putting jake to bed tonight he mentioned youd been digging around the island is there some connection there tom he stiffened and his pale specters eyes locked on mine i had nothing to do with aubreys poisoning then who did only a chopping block with a score of magnetically attached kitchen utensils dangling above it separated us i dont know why were you pummeling aubrey earlier today its a private matter between him and me i shook my head wrong no private matters left tom not after murder and attempted murder my skin felt whitehot as i stared at him why wouldnt he tell me the truth if you hurt candaceif you killed my babytheres no place on earth youll be able to hide from me tom he tensed his muscles straining like whipcord under his shirt he was older than me but tautly fit you and i have no quarrel as long as i stay out of your business right right if aubrey lives do you think hell continue to be quiet about your feud especially if he doesnt know who laced his juice toms face blanched aubrey knows how to keep his silence rules change when someone tries to kill you or tries to kill someone you love my voice was barely a whisper but my words seemed to thunder in my ears i could feel the war drum of my own pulse a maddening beat a connection suddenly formed in my mind that shovel what have you been digging for tom buried treasure or maybe buried bodies i dont have to listen to this crap he began to turn away from me and i whirled him back around with a strength i didnt know i had you shit you knew youre looking for pauls body arent you anger darkened his features and i stood there slackjawed he jerked his head toward the stove where a plume of smoke billowed from the pan your sandwiches are burning tell me tell me what you know i barely had time to utter the request before his fist came flying at me i didnt react soon enough he clubbed me on the side of the head and i fell twinkling lights playing about my eyes and the odor of singed cheese in my nostrils tom leaned down toward me his voice nearly soothing little boys who dont know better get killed around here im not your enemy put some ice on your cheek before it swells he turned to saunter out not hardly i grabbed him before hed taken four steps whirled him hard once and belted my fist across his smirking face he staggered back and i piledrived another punch into his gut his breath whooshed out satisfyingly and his bonepale eyes bulged in surprise catch your breath i advised him and get ready to talk tom you he managed a dribble of blood oozing from his cut lip you shit you made a mistake buddy he launched himself at me mowing me down in his embrace and tumbling us both against the kitchens back door glass shattered wood splintered and as he collapsed heavily against me every bone in my body cried in agony rain roaring in from the broken door pane splashed our faces i lashed out a kick catching him in the chest and he cussed at me with his meager lung power i scrambled past him trying to get the advantage by not being pinned against the door he clawed at my legs his nails raking down my bare skin i twisted away but not quick enough his pummeling fists rained down on the back of my head driving me to the floor he smashed a hard blow between my shoulder bladesat a spot no doubt marked hit here for maximum pain and my wind abandoned me i tasted the grit of the floor a nasty mix of dirt salt and grease goddamn little idiot he huffed from above me you fucking think you know what youre doing you dont i couldnt see toms face i didnt dare look i was too busy concentrating on inching my leg into position you dont want to delve deep here okay otherwise you end up like aubrey keep lecturing me butthead or maybe you end up like brian oh shit and i dont want to have to pound sense into you he didnt get the opportunity i swung my leg hard catching him in midsentence and off guard my foot connecting decisively with the tenderest area of the knee he hollered and collapsed like fallen timber his body splaying out next to me i sprang to my feet my whole body a bruise and i seized one of wendys heavy blades held above the chopping block by a long magnetic strip the handle felt smooth and firm in my hand as i tumbled down onto toms chest my legs pinning down his arms and the cool of the blade hovering near his throat his eyes widened jordan he gasped shut up for a minute i gasped back just shut up i let the knifes tip pirouette near his flesh barely skimming his adams apple tom shut up i pushed down on his forehead with my left hand my fingers tangling in his thick shock of hair my voice was ragged a strangers rasp now you listen secrets suck believe me i know this and secrets here have killed my baby and nearly killed the woman i love so tom you are going to tell me every secret i need to know i drew the knife lightly across his throat tracing a wrinkle no tom you are standing between me and the person who tried to kill candace i whispered and between me and the person who killed my baby its not a place you want to be he clenched his eyes shut a voice sounded from my throat but not one i recognized as my own ill cut you to the bone tom no amount of plastic surgery will ever make your face right again you tell me what i want to know a thick tear rolled from one of his eyes i suddenly wanted to cast the knife aside i felt a violent surge of disgust thrum through my whole body i had resorted to the basest violence the most cowardly threats a sick swell of nausea rolled through me settling deep in my guts please i coughed its mutt he breathed a shuddery whisper mutt poisoned them my breath froze in my throat thunder roared why aubrey knows paul died here on the island not suicide how i demanded how does aubrey know dont know tom gasped claims hes got proof that paul didnt commit suicide what proof dont knowaubrey wont tell me i got so mad at him i tried to pummel it out of himbut you and deborah stopped me his eyes rolled around trying to see where i held the blade i moved the knife fractionally back from toms throat and how did you know about pauls death brian told me he suspected mutt had lied about pauls suicide when did brian tell you the day before he drowned my god that was fourteen years ago yes what had tom said to me after hed walloped me little boys who dont know better get killed around here brian i murmured it wasnt an accident was it oh god they killed him they killed that little boy only twelve years old just like they killed his father not they tom managed to speak just mutt and aubreys protecting him or at least he was youre sure it was mutt cant prove it would love to before he gets away with it he wont theres no statute of limitations on murder i threw the knife away it clattered across the floor i stared down at tom with a deep and abiding shame for what id done except death and i want to nail the bastard before this brain cancer kills him tom rubbed at his throat and eyed me with new respect they teach you to punch like that in library school i never went i answered i stood staggering away from him the grilledcheese sandwiches were blackened lumps in the ruined pan and i hurled them pan and all into the sink the soup had boiled over leaving a noxious bubbling mass it too went into the sink you and i should be on the same side i said to him hed pulled himself to his feet why do you want to fight everyone how am i supposed to know whose side youre on he grumbled oh for christs sake i wanted to throttle him do you think i want to protect mutt if he poisoned candace my head and back throbbed aching from toms fists no but you probably want to protect your daddy tom lowered his voice oh god he knows too the kitchen door swung open what is that smell wendy asked as she entered followed by philip both of them stopped and stared at the mess a damaged back door smoking pans in the sink tom bleeding from his mouth my face a massive bruise what the hell philip began get out of here i yelled tom you okay philip began ogling me as if i were deranged get out tom hollered at his brother philip stumbled backward and quickly escorted wendy from the room she shot me a look of stunned amazement before the door swung shut i waited long seconds hearing their footsteps retreat how do you know its mutt how did he kill brian how did he poison aubrey and candace and lolly goddamn it do you think if i had the evidence i wouldnt have turned him in already i dont have anything but what brian told methat mutt knew his daddy hadnt committed suicide and had buried him somewhere on the island and that your daddy had helped why didnt you say anything after brian died tom sank to the floor oh god i wanted to but you dont break the code of silence tom these people dont deserve loyalty like that youre making yourself accessory to murder i didnt know the legal ramifications but that sounded accurate and i wanted to scare him the tactic failed you think it was loyalty hell no i just didnt want to end up dead like brian and i couldnt prove he hadnt drowned he liked to go for midnight swims when he could sneak out of the house mutt and lollyd both tan his hide if they caught him at it he broke into gasping sobs god he was a great kid fuckers i leaned down next to him the battle in me spent so whyd you change your mind he looked at me with his pale eyes unfocused and veiled with unshed tears oh christ brian comes to me in my dreams he comes to me and tells me to look for his daddys body here on the island and he drags his fingers across my face and when i wake up i can smell the dead rot of the sea he blinked and stared away from me its driving me completely nuts so i go and i dig and i aint found shit crazy right no its not its not crazy at all two days ago i would have recommended a therapist for tom but that was before id seen the darkthroated boy in the blackness of the attic i lowered my voice to a hoarse whisper what if i told you ive got the evidence aubrey claimed to have toms eyes widened you do what the jewelry of pauls id found stashed in the attic was my only trump card and i wasnt quite ready to trust tom enough to toss it on the table i hesitated and he saw the fear shine in my eyes what the hell uncle mutts voice boomed from the diningroom door are you boys doing in here i whirled to see his mutilated hand pointing in accusation the angry glare on his face and the pistol he carried at his side his fingers drumming restlessly against its dark skin looks like yall been tusslin some mutt said watching us both with stony eyes i thought i heard a crash but i just figured it was the storm didnt expect to find you boys tearing up my kitchen so whats the problem i inhaled restorative air no problem just a misunderstanding its all cleared up now i eyed his sidearm no need to break out the artillery uncle mutt the kind cajoling grin hed shown me in our times alonethe times when i believed id bonded with this lost unclewas gone in its place was a hard smile one that did not suffer fools or shine upon the unlucky why you boys resorting to fisticuffs jordan you got a bruise coming up on your face gonna be as purple as a plum im fine like i said its a misunderstanding its my fault uncle mutt tom interjected he straightened and sniffed wiping the blood away from his mouth im real sorry shut up tom mutt favored me with a pitying glance his eyes glinted with amused malice a shudder of horror ran up the back of my legs and i leaned against the counter you sure you okay jordan he asked im fine i answered tension made my mouth taste of old pennies you sure you not back on the powder tom you look a tad hyper mutt glanced at me his smile broadening see jordan ol tom likes to take a toot now and then its been an ongoing problem for a while he done lost a job over it and i had to make a goddamned big donation to an aquarium in florida to get him another job tom didnt look at me im clean mutt and ive been clean for years so why you so excitable tonight mutt asked his tone idly baleful didnt make me believe he expected a serious answer uncle mutt arent you going to ask how aubrey and candace are i shaded my voice with a calmness i didnt feel son i was just up there checking on them theyre both holding on god bless them the thought of mutt near either candace or aubrey made my blood run hot he didnt exactly gesture with the pistol but it moved in his hand why dont we head into the living room and have a nice chat jordan you want some ice for that bruise no thanks im fine an ice bag sounded like heaven but i wasnt about to let mutt minister to my needs mutt stepped back from the door and not looking at each other tom and i went back to the study each stride felt like a step further out on the plank im making a deal with the devil i decided as mutt escorted tom and me into the study i thought the rest of the family would be massed here waitingbut the room was empty except for uncle jake apparently retrieved from his bed by all the commotion he sat huddled under a robe and a quilt his long fingers splayed out across his face as he dozed in the deep of the leather chair his skin looked as frail and creased as old paper rufus stood by the window watching the tempest paint its fearsome beauty across the night sky where is everybody i asked showing some sense of selfpreservation jake muttered from his cocoon of fabric i think everybodys headed off to their rooms to wait out the storm i noticed mutt hadnt relinquished his firearm yet i would have to be very very careful in what i said i didnt speak but went and sat on the couch feeling soreness and exhaustion vie for control of my body jordan i promise you soon as the phones are back up well get help here or well get the boat out as soon as the storm lets up whichever comes first thank you i managed to say the words felt dead in my mouth mutt fidgeted i kept my eyes on the gun jake snorted youre making me nervous waving a goddamned firearm around emmett you dont need that thing uncle jake tom finally spoke for gods sake someone tried to kill aubrey and candace oh hell jake answered maybe they just got food poisoning wendy aint the cleanest cook around its not food poisoning jake i answered i hesitated for a second then plunged on candace was pregnant she miscarried oh my god jake breathed covering his face with his wrinkled hands mutt walked toward me his face working deborah didnt tell me oh god jordan im so sorry i allowed him to embrace me my skin feeling soiled at his touch he patted my back in a mockery of grief i wouldve enjoyed seeing your child born before i die mutt whispered in my ear i am so sorry god he sounds sincere is tom wrong maybe it isnt mutt over mutts shoulder tom stared at me in unabashed horror maybe it was foodsomething they ate jake attempted again misery clouding his usually acid voice candace didnt eat anything but crackers today i fought the urge toward bitter laughter food made her feel illbeing pregnant and all i shook in barely contained rage i believe you can put the gun away now uncle mutt tom said no need for it in the first place mutt released me and glared at tom you dont think its wise for someone to be armed especially around you after you go and attack jordan here why dont we all just go lock ourselves in our rooms tom suggested his wry grimace only made his lip bleed again until the phones work that way no one elsell get hurt no one else is getting hurt mutt intoned theres a logical explanation for what happened to poor aubrey and candace and we just have listen to yourself i screamed and i mean screamed my control collapsed i made my throat raw with those three words there is only one explanation and dont you dare insult my intelligence they were poisoned someone meant to kill aubrey just as they killed lolly why are you holding on to this fiction that nothing evil has happened here no one answered i didnt know which one i wanted to throw up against the wall first i steadied my stare on mutt and didnt look at tom maybe aubrey found out something he shouldnt family secrets seem to lurk in every nook and cranny in this house do you care to comment uncle mutt mutt breathed and did little else his eyes looked like flat mirrors reflecting only the world passing by him he closed his eyes once and opened them settled firmly into his lie no i dont my lips clenched i had liked him genuinely felt cheated of all the years id been denied his company in my eagerness id wanted to see myself in him he had committed the original sin in concealing pauls death but whod committed the sins that followed id taken three steps toward mutt and his hand tightened on his gun he stared at me and finally offered a thin smile you dont understand this family jordan he said i understand you all too well silence for any crime wrap the guilty protect them from justice nowe protect the innocent he snapped you may be of our blood but you dont know us you arent one of us yet i dont want to be you are one of us youve taken bob don as your father youre obligated to help himas you would any of us a slyness underlined his words i dont want to see harm come to anyonebut i wont idly stand by while other people are killed i wont be you i wont protect a goddamned poisoner youre in the family circle now son mutt began his litany again and that brings with it certain responsibilities a code of silence i challenged if i was going to deal with the devil made flesh i had to be seen as a peer not a peasant wrong you dont know the damage youll do jake intoned looking at me with lifebright eyes dont you dare to speak to me about damage jake i shouted mutt spoke with quick decisiveness his eyes never leaving jakes withered face hush jake tom take your own advice go lock yourself in your room if youre of a mind tom shuffled toward the door then stopped jordan will you be okay i didnt want him to leave me alone with these two but i couldnt manufacture a plausible reason theyd hear the fear in my voice of course ill be fine im sorry about the fight tom me too he mumbled and he left waste of a brain jake opined he sniffed into a handkerchief as raggedy as he was that boys heading for grief mutt offered me a wavery smile so whatd you two fight about i chose my words like steps in a minefield i thought id read the situation clearly enough to hazard a ruse im afraid i wasnt very kind toward philip tom defended his brother in the grandest goertz tradition yet misguided mutt moved me gently toward the couch and we sat he nestled the gun in his palms a precious jewel grandest tradition you mean family first i ventured yes always family first isnt that right jake jake made a snuffling noise of agreement yet someone in this family turned on aubrey and candace and lolly a rattle of thunder pounded the island the glass on the study doors wavered in their panes i half wished one would shatter and the bracing air of the gulf would invade the air inside this house felt too worn with use too thin to support life our breaths seemed weighed down with the heaviness of the lies riding on them jordan weve known terrible tragedy under this roof yes we have i think youre wrong to believe anyone wanted to harm lolly i still believe it was a simple heart attack jake broke the silence mutt stop you got to accept the possibility them tests gonna show my heart medication in lollys body she could have taken her own life crazy as she was getting mutt stared at the carpet i swallowed jakes right yet aubrey and candace are struck with symptoms remarkably similar to what killed lolly to my amazement mutt attempted a new dodge okay say lolly killed herself maybe she took the poison in cranberry juice before dinner maybe she poisoned that pitcher of juice before she died and what happened to aubrey and candace was just a terrible accident ive no idea how long it was in the bar fridge do you know jake hell no jake answered lolly was the only one drank the stuff regular i never cared for the tartness of it insane so this is how it is maybe they find traces of digitalis in aubrey and candace and the blame falls squarely on poor dead lolly who left a trap behind for the living in a pitcher of juice where is mutt getting this much digitalis he might ve been swiping jakes pills for months one every few days so as not to arouse suspicion or maybe he got it from the plants in the greenhouse id wandered through the greenhouse but i frankly wouldnt have known a digitaliscontaining plant if itd bit me your theoryforgive me uncle muttsounds a little farfetched i sounded frighteningly mild i watched his gun if it had been in my hands mutt would be on his knees sobbing while i pressed the muzzle against the soft gray hair around his temple and ordered him to confess you think one of us is capable of murder his eyes looked bright and shiny in their faked shock paul goertz was a murderer i said quietly anyone can murder mutt trust me on this jordan rufus spoke from his silence near the bar i known your uncle mutt for a damned long time he aint lying to you there aint no murderer here paul was sick mutt said and lolly was sick i ignored his assertion family circles codes of silence i glared hard into mutts bright blue eyes i can keep a code if i get what i want mutt stared back at me for what seemed like an eon he did not breathe finally he closed his eyes in hard sad resignation rufus would you please take uncle jake up to bed he needs his rest rest my ass jake retorted i aint sleeping any with this storm howling jake please let me handle this discussion with jordan go get your rest i aint sleeping but rufus can warm me up some milk in the kitchen if youve a need for private talk rufus helped him to his feet you might want to use canned milk uncle jake safer that way i suggested coldly jake didnt answer and the two of them shuffled out of the room mutt stood and began to pace slowly across the worn tapestry of the persian rug his shoulders bowed as if bent ill bend those shoulders when i break your back i steeled myself for the performance i had to give now candace was depending on me i could not bear to look into her face see the misery my family had inflicted on her without saying this person did it this person hurt you and i exacted payment you know i said youre defending your own sisters murderer he stopped and shook his head no if poison was involved lolly killed herself you expect me to believe we have a suicide followed by two attempted murders please thats right your father bragged you had quite a hand in solving crimes ironic he smiled thinly at me and i fought an urge to slap him across the room ill keep my silence about what happened to paul i said fake puzzlement crossed his face and i blew it away with soft words i know my father killed paul in selfdefense and the lot of you covered it up to protect him it doesnt sound to me like paul was any great loss to humanity i kept my voice steady feeling the weight of mutts unrelenting stare on my face but one of you who kept that secret is willing to kill to keep it still for some reason one of you feels threatened by lolly by aubrey why dont yall come forward together confess then the murderer has no reason to kill this little story of yours is enthrallin jordan makes no sense but i have proof paul didnt kill himself ive found it and im betting its proof aubrey had i have reason to believe he had possession of it before i did what proof mutt demanded a half smile on his face id like to see the proof that can make fiction reality im tired of sparring with you i stood youre a coward uncle mutt youre dying soon so what does it matter what happens im going to know whether you help me or not who poisoned candace who tried to kill her who killed my baby the most horrible silence id ever heard in my life was the pause before he spoke i cant help you mutt answered his words sounded like a whisper of farewell i wanted to pull the skin from his bones instead i made my smile thin and measured then i cant help you ill have to give the authorities the evidence ive got oh im sure that pauls murder of his wife and his threats to gretchen and pop will be considered my father may not get into too much trouble or he may go to jail but whoevers committing these murders loses their motive now and forever maybe you wont go to prison since youre terminally ill and no ones going to put a man jakes age in prison but pop and sass will have to answer for what they did and so will anyone else who knows who doesnt tell i tinged my pronouncement with more bravado than i felt i winced inwardly at the humiliation pop would feel if his actions were brought to light but that pain was nothing compared with what candace had endured hard hard choice but in the cold light of reason not a choice at all mutt breathed not speaking you wont do this to your father not after you just found him yes i will because protecting him is the same as protecting the poisoner i wont do it i cant he killed my child my actors mask cracked on those words and the hate and anger i felt glided through mutt saw the truth of it oh god he moaned the gun still dangled in his mutilated hand i pointed at it are you going to shoot me you cant kill me and explain it away with a dramatic suicide or poison left behind by a dead woman he glanced at the gun then at me his hand shook its philip a chill prickled my skin so you say convince me mutt carefully placed the gun on the bar and his shoulders sagged hes obsessed with ruining me with exacting revenge on me and now hes screwing the entire family tell me hei let him manage some of my finances for a while it was a tremendous mistake he lost everything i entrusted him with fortunately i was prudent in how much i let him handle at first i thought it was simply bad management poor investment choices but it wasnt the stock market taking an unexpected dip philip stole the money i dont understand why didnt you report him hes blood blood counts to us and i couldnt just turn in my nephew so you let him walk scotfree and gave him a chance to steal from you again with wendy dipping her hand into the till too no wendys on my side i suspected with my death practically being a circled day on philips calendar hed be after what money he could get out of me cause theres nothing for him in my will he shook his head at my scowl so i got wendy to approach him pretend that she could land some of my money if hed tell her what investments she ought to suggest to me he fell for it and i started to move my money around just like tossing a ball to a dog so he dont chase a cat this is crazy why would he want to hurt lolly or aubrey lolly committed suicide i aint telling you that again boy at that moment i feared him implacable anger limned his words i still found his premise ridiculous but the heat in his tone suggested lolly even if suicidal was not the only unbalanced member of the family okay say lolly killed herself and her death has nothing to do with philip then why would he try to kill aubrey codes of silence remember say nothing just tell me aubrey ran away from sass when he was a teenager he went to houston he got involved in the drug trade as a runner he aint real proud of those days good god aubrey freely dispensing advice trying to place a mental bandaid on the emotional wounds we dared to show i wondered how much human wreckage hed seen in his days of coke and roses philip was dealing drugs trading a lot with the other stockbrokers in town the lowlifes who thought they were big shits aubrey made a delivery to philip not knowing his own cousin was a dealer as things go thats not so bad perhaps mutt didnt appear convinced but it gets worse aubrey found out philip was dealing to tomhis own brother tom was nearly dead from snorting coke and philip was still dealing it hard to him my throat felt cold feeding his own brothers addiction yes philips the most heartless animal on this planet yet youre willing to protect him mutt shook his head aubrey probably was going to write all about philip in his new book philip was never arrested never suspected as far as i know of dealing drugs hed lose his business his freedom if this all came to light mutt turned to me his arms open wide see see how it has to be i dont want this known whats the point the point how about making philip pay for what he did when aubrey finally broke free of that life and went home to sasshe told her about tom sass called me and i got tom the hell away from philip and got him into treatment i done saved toms life not that hes ever shown much gratitude he sniffled and lightning flashed in the window like an explosion of light i imagined a bolt piercing the bays skin of water burrowing into the murky depths like gods own finger youre lying to me i said in a clear calm voice nohe shook his headim not gods truth jordan then why do you even have philip here if he stole from you and he peddled dope to his own brother why do you invite him tom and philip have made their peace theyre brothers again thats probably why tom and aubrey have been so crossways aubrey trying to make life more difficult for philip mutt saw the disbelief in my eyes he coughed why do i have your father here when he shot his own brother to death thats different no no it aint i have philip here because this way i can keep an eye on him and i can hope he changes his ways aubrey and candace are paying the price for your hope he wouldnt look at me you still think lolly killed herselfafter you saw philip slipping that book about digitalis poisoning back on your shelf i didnt see that you did i still didnt believe him the truth was near the skin of what he said but he was holding back and how do you explain brians death mutt looked genuinely puzzled brian that was an accident brian knew his father didnt commit suicide and somehow that proof came to aubrey now what the hell does any of that have to do with philip brian drowned he was just a kid nobody wouldve wanted to hurt him mutt said his skin had gone snow pale and the corners of his mouth whitened as he frowned for gods sake jordan im awful sorry about what happened to candace philips to blame and thats all there is to it now ive told you and you know now his voice grew low you deal with philip as you want there aint no cause to be digging up the past its just gonna hurt your daddy more i stood and walked past him the gun still lay on the bar i hefted it in my hand and turned so mutt was clearly in the barrels sights i can believe some of what you say philip selling dope and stealing money tom letting drugs ruin his life aubrey running away from home but youre only telling me a halftruth it doesnt all fit together mutt and thats not enough he raised one eyebrow you going to shoot me i ignored his question do you think were all idiots oh no doubt jake and sass have kept their silence when paul vanished im sure people thought it was for the best the wife killers taken his own life he cant hurt anyone his children dont have to bear the shame of a trial and such maybe even when brian died folks thought it a terrible accident and when lolly collapsed across the table it was a little easier to say she was nuts she sent insane letters to me she thought her dog was her husband reborn so she had a heart attack or mustve killed herself arent you sick of the long list of lies his eyes were stones ive told you truth maybe half of it thats the best lie to tell i cracked the magazine open it wasnt loaded i see its a specialty of yours i crossed to the phone and tried it again still dead the shut doors of the study rattled and pop blustered in fright in his face my heart froze candace shes the same i think shes resting a little easier he glanced from mutt to me whats going on here your sons ready to destroy our family mutt spoke sharply this family was destroyed long before i got here i answered i stuck the unloaded gun in my pocket mutt wasnt the only one who could benefit from a prop excuse me i left them heading up the stairs to philips room the lowing sounds of men singing gregorian chants surprised me as i leaned close to philips shut door the voices rose as if a cathedral lay on the other side of the wood throats hummed in praise of god baritones mixing with the cry of countertenors funeral music for philip was fine with me i knocked on the door the music diminished in volume after a moment and philip bade me come in i swung the door open he lay on his bed in a thin robe hands on his chest in monkish repose he barely glanced at me then returned to considering the ceiling contemplating your sins i asked no i cant undo anything ive done i just go on he blinked at me i hope you didnt beat up my brother too bad neither one of us is worse for wear i closed the door behind me i walked to the side of his bed the vague sense of distaste i felt whenever i was near him rearing its head a stack of tapes stood by a portable player palestrina a mozart mass a collection of gregorian chant and a name i didnt recognize i picked up the cassette gesualdo tenebrae he was a murderer aside from being a talented composer like drawn to like he fixed his blue eyes on me i may be many things but im not a killer how are candace and aubrey doing do you care he watched my face actually i do i think youre a pain but candace seems perfectly nice if a bit too enthralled with you and no bad blood between you and aubrey i dont care much for hypocrites but i hope aubreys okay im sorry its taken their suffering to bring this family rightly to its knees i sat on the bed and pulled mutts firearm from the back of my pants philips eyes widened as i toyed with the gun candace lost a baby i didnt even know she was pregnant philip jerked up to a sitting position genuine shock flushed his face oh my god oh shit he swallowed christ jordan im so sorry mutts downstairs he says youre the poisoner i expected vehement denial castigation of the accuser and general bluster none came philip stared at me then started to laugh a throttle of a giggle that old shit hes still trying to cover his bases are you no im not i have no reason to hurt lolly aubrey or your girlfriend he claims you do i rubbed my fingers along the gun unloaded but philip didnt know he watched fascinated like a bird transfixed before a slithering cobra look jordan ive never liked people like youblond boys who have the world handed to them on a platter you dont even know me philip you have no clue as to what my life is like at least i never dealt drugs got my own brother addicted or stole money from my family he raised a hand and an eyebrow his gaze stayed on the gun but then his eyes met mine in unexpected frankness fine you want to play priest in the confessional yeah i sold drugs i sold a lot of them to college kids to soulless lawyers to bored housewives did i fuck up some lives sure my own included dont wait for me to weep for you you never did jail time only because he said mutt found out and he gave me a choice turn over all my drug moneyall of itto him or hed turn me in he aint no saint i leaned back doubt clouding my face philip laughed mutts a piece he took the money id made for himself but he got tom straightened out it was a fair trade he glanced down at the stack of spiritual tapes my lifes better now sos tom he and i arent ever going to be close again but were okay more hurt tinged this admission than he would ever openly admit his heavyjawed face creased and he bit at his lip pensively i didnt speak for a moment and the tape of chant ended with a click and it sounded like the doors of heaven shutting you stole money from mutt philip smiled again wrong im trying to prove hes stealing his own you must be on drugs again hell i never took that stuff he shrugged you deserve to know whats happened here the game that mutts played out to its end he leaned forward the sly boyish smile of a secret to be shared cutting his face mutts not dying thats crazy dead men dont pay taxes philip said hes decided to vanish by going into his grave if he wanted to fake his death he wouldnt claim to have cancer hed fake an accident or something and drop out of sight philip nodded so one would think but not our mutt heand the delightful miss wendyare planning on taking whats left of his fortune heading far away and setting up house with new lives new names why he wants to marry her without the family hovering i guess or maybe hes just tired of lolly and jake being like warts on his ass he coughed then stared hard into my eyes and i get the distinct feeling theres something bad in his life hed like to forget and evade forever but i dont know what it is pauls death and brians dead men cant be prosecuted either philips eyes betrayed nothing more perhaps he didnt know about the coverup involving paul and just how have you been planning to prove this i got muttfinallyto let me handle some of his financial affairs he figured he could keep an eye on me but eyes look both ways dont they hes been a little lazy about not passwording some of his computer files and i noticed key investments being sold off dumped into banks in the caymans and switzerland mutts slowly moving offshore so to speak still not proof enough no not on hard paper but you tell me why hes got drivers licenses and passportsfor names other than emmett goertz and wendy tranin his safe did you see those he nodded he asked me to get some papers out of the safe and i grabbed the wrong envelope he was in the john off the study talking to me while he peed i slipped out a canadian passport made out for edward grimes but with emmett goertzs picture on it i stuck it all back in before he came out of the john id nearly pissed myself my throat felt dry who to believe so when is he planning on jumping ship dont know but hes announced hes got six months to live so my countdowns started he coughed again hell die and suddenly the family will discover theres nothing left no money no land no stocks damned uncle mutt theyll say he done spent it all and muttll be off lying in a hammock in jamaica screwing wendy and laughing his ass off at us all so why havent you called the police yet i dont have proof has he committed a crime and maybe id be happier if he vanished im tired of dancing to his old tunes i rubbed my eyes with my hands suddenly i felt an unforgiving weariness pervade my whole body so why are you telling me and what are you going to do next cant do anything until the storm lets up and we get the phones back but im telling you this because mutt suspects ive been sniffing around he wants to discredit me so why doesnt he announce your past crimes to the world himself philip shrugged maybe he doesnt want the authorities looking too closely at me or at any member of this family and if he thinks aubreys going to ruin me with his book he doesnt need to lift a finger hed be vanished by the time that book hits the shelves the dirty works done for him and your little teteatetes with wendy philip smiled i told wendy i needed her to steal some money away from mutt for me or else i might have to rat on him i blinked youre trying to blackmail him you let him know that you know his scheme i didnt want to believe philipbut as much as i hate to admit it i was starting to accept his story philip ruffled at the accusation extorting from a criminals not really a crime its a public service actually i figured that he wouldnt give me enough credit to deduce his real plan hed believe id steal from him sooner or later and hed let it be sooner i wouldnt be surprised if he tries to leave me holding the bag on some of his debts be just like the ornery cuss philip saw the dismay in my face listen jordan he likes you he aint ever liked me much im sure its a disappointment to you that hes the way he is but truth is hes a selfish sob and hes always been one that book you took the book on digitalis poisoning i saw you replace it do you think youre the only one who might try to investigate a crime i saw intelligence in his face a look id previously dismissed as arrogance i was the faulty arrogant one lolly never mentioned any sort of heart condition and shed been aching for mutts money from time immemorial his announcement that he was dying would upset hershe did love him after allbut it wouldnt induce a heart attack shed have shown the proper sorrow and probably bought a parakeet to pretend it was mutt come back he coughed damned old lolly anyway the way she died it reminded me of the woman in bitter money i swiped the book after dinner to compare symptoms but i couldnt exactly parade it around the house could i my morning coffee mightve had something in it aside from sugar and cream the book vanished im guessing mutt did away with it and the police frankly dont seem to care his money tips the scales of balance round here and tricia yarbroughs been sweet on him since forever she wont want to believe hes a killer youre underestimating judge yarbrough she wont relent on him or anyone else she thinks killed lolly after all she ordered the additional tests philip shrugged then maybe it becomes more important than ever that he vanish and sooner rather than later your brother thinks mutt is the poisoner i blurted philip cocked a finger at me and i realized i still held the unloaded gun i tucked it back into my pants tom might be dead on lolly finds out that mutts faking his own demise and she threatens to expose him if he doesnt stay he takes jakes medicine and doses her wine with it she dies from what looks like a heart attack even if the poison gets detected he can always point to her eccentricities as evidence of craziness of suicide thatd be conveniently backed up by the cards she sent you i dont think mutt knew about those i countered but what about aubrey mutt tried to kill him philip shook his head i dont know maybe aubrey found out about his scheme somehow and aubrey wasnt winning over anyone with that book he was planning he didnt elaborate and i didnt offer my own version aubrey let mutt know he had stumbled across the truth about pauls or brians death i dont want to add to your hurt philip said softly but maybe aubrey wasnt the target maybe he was just someone who drank the same cranberry juice candace did the suggestion froze my heart mutt would have no reason to hurt candace none at all philips blue eyes looked a great deal like pops sometimes did heavy and sad except you havent been exactly subtle about poking your nose in folks business and your dads bragged to mutt and lollyactually all of us when youre not aroundabout your involvement in solving crimes maybe he aimed to poison candacenot to kill her just make her sickto scare you off then he miscalculated severely philip surprised me with a quick squeeze of my shoulder its too bad i dont like you we couldve been friends you cant pick your relatives i said and he laughed softly you bring that gun up here to shoot me just curious no its not loaded i wanted to scare you i glanced toward the window i could not place why i believed philip and not mutt perhaps because mutt had avoided my eyes and philip had been frank with his looks minor but telling you scared me for a minute he coughed again i am truly sorry about candace and your baby i grabbed his arm then help me nail the sonofabitch he cocked an eyebrow and looked halfamused how what should we do force him to open the safe see if hes still got those id papers there that gun of yours didnt just become magically loaded did it just how are we supposed to force him to do anything and thats when the lights went out popping like the last beat of a heart philip and i stumbled out onto the secondfloor hallway it was pitchdark he had no candles or flashlights in his room and i groped my way along the wall find mutt philip hissed i want to know where the hell he is brief illumination came with a scattershot of lightning arcing across the sky you find him i gotta check on candace still carrying my unloaded gun i sidled to the stairs and ran up to the top floor candaces room was locked i knocked hard and identified myself when gretchen called for my name the door opened a fraction one candle had been lit shining weakly on the crowd gathered within candaceand now aubrey toolay in bed both still aubrey was mumbling to himself candace seemed flushed sass leaned over them both deborah sass pop and gretchen sat around the bed sweetie blinked at me nestled against gretchens foot i closed the door behind me they all stared at me youve been in a fight deborah noted are they okay whats wrong i began to babble but sass cut me off with a wave of her hand theyre holding on but it was too much for deborah to run from room to room so bob don carried aubrey in here her voice lowered a notch toward tenderness it was best not to move candace i noticed thensasss right hand was linked with aubreys her left with candaces has she asked for me i leaned down and kissed candaces forehead she didnt stir in response no deborah answered she mopped gently at candaces brow theyre slipping into coma jordan weve got to get them to a hospital i say we try the boats even in the storm sass moaned averting her face from the rest of us the powers out i announced stating the obvious whats going on downstairs pop demanded i go down you and mutt are glaring at each other he wont talk to me he starts yelling for wendy stay here all of you lock the door behind me and dont open for anyone but me this is insane sass blurted acting frightened in our own house aunt sass please i begged just stay here aubrey needs you so does candace she blinked at me then at her brother she fell silent and leaned her cheek against the quilts covering aubreys stomach im coming with you pop announced he clambered to his feet no pop stay here protect the i can assure you deborah announced icily that i can protect myself and so can gretchen and sass fine then yall protect pop i dont want him in any trouble tonight my requests then apparently heeded i kissed candaces forehead again and dashed for the door take the candle gretchen called no i answered deb needs it i shut the door on gretchens reply a moment later i heard the bolt slide home theyd be safe in that room i hoped i felt my way along the wall stumbling i could hear voices raised in hue and cry two floors below shouts of two men and one womans strident tone mutt wendy and philip probably having it out i made a quick stop by my room where i fetched a matchbook and the candle id used to explore the attic i didnt want to think about what id seen there while the entire house was bathed in darkness i was tentatively feeling my way down the stairs when the shots rang out i crouched in the stairway listening above the lashing cry of the storm the only regular sound was the intense drum of my heartbeat another gunshot erupted i hugged against the wall you see ive been shot before i know the lancing agony of a bullet ripping through skin and muscle the heat of it kissing your bone the blind pain that defies imagination terror welled up in me like black blood from a deep wound my breath rattled in my chest a voice from above whispered harshly son pop i grimaced pop go back upstairs stay with the others no i wont i aint gonna let you go down there listen i nimbly ascended a few steps to where i could see his outline crouching in the heavy blackness of the hallway one of us has to go ill go i think the shootings over no ones screaming so maybe no ones hurt i believe this technique is called clutching at straws but i didnt share that thought with pop i shoved the gun toward his hands in the darkness is there a cartridge for this up here i dont know i dont think so mutt always kept all the guns in his study pops voice was strained pleading jordan just stay up here with us listen ill be back in a minute please go back stubborn just like your mama i didnt argue this time he turned and headed back toward candaces room i breathed a sigh of relief silence fell i imagined philip lying wounded or dead on the study floor a thin tendril of smoke rising from the hole in his skin and id let him go down there alone whoever was down there shooting he or she had been the one to hurt candace to kill my child i blew out the candle and closed my eyes for a brief prayer then i rushed down the stairs my hands aching for a throat the study doors stood halfclosed and i heard only silence within slowly i pushed back the door keeping my head low the other study doors stood open onto the porch wind and rain rattling in soaking the floor the air felt oppressive with the weight of the storm the room was a shambles as though a fight had torn it apart i crept in keeping my back against the door breathing softly through my mouth listening for any telltale sign that i wasnt alone lightning cascaded its eerie flash into the bay and the room lit dimly and i could see the body lying on the floor folded over the end of the rug i scurried forward my fingers trembling as i fired the match and lit the candle light spilled out in an eldritch glow and i stared down into the vacant dead eyes of rufus beaulac the bullet had smashed through his throat and his hand lay limply near the terrible wound as though he needed simply to cough and all would be well bloodmaroon in this uncertain lightspeckled his face his chest his twisted lips the floor i held my fingers above his mouth no breath stirred against my skin oh my lord a voice not my own murmured and i nearly screamed i jerked the light upuncle jake sat huddled in his chair his face as frightened as a childs his hands were clasped in the fold of his robe and he shivered in the dampness gusting in from the door he blinked at me as if he didnt quite know me jordan oh dear somethings wrong with rufus you better fetch deb hes hes dead uncle jake are you okay i felt a sudden sharp fear that with his heart condition tonight would bring on an attack where are the others puzzlement clouded his usually acerbic face im fine theytheyre outside mutt and philip argued about opening the safe and taking the boat he pointed toward the wall safe exposed now because the reproduction battle flag covering it lay on the floor the safe door was open like a dark eye the boat my heart pounded i hurried to the study doors and out into the storm rain smashed into my face like a hard slap the sky frothed with violence dark cancerous clouds pummeled each other lightning leaping from them to earth in obscene caresses in seconds i was drenched to the skin i shaded my hands against the wind and the rain trying to make out the stretch of terrain from the house to the dock i stumbled forward past the dark shape of the greenhouse into the blackness of the night i had gotten to the beachthe illfated beach that gave this island its terrible name for a moment in the glassiness of vision in unrelenting rain i thought i saw the shadows of a dozen boys lying in the sand in their tattered uniforms throats laid open like rufuss i gagged and yelled out but there were no boys there was only a dark shape lying on the beach facedown in the wet sand i stumbled forward and pulled on a shoulder heaving him over philip i screamed out his name and leaned close to him ragged breath hit my ear i felt up and down his head his body trying to see what was wrong sand daubed in a wound on his head i had to wait for a flicker of lightning to see itd been creased by a bullet i yelled his name again but he didnt answer lights flicked on out on the water the boat i ran toward it the wind slamming into me screaming out at uncle mutt waves rocked the small boat in the pale gleam of its running lights i saw wendy hurriedly donning a life preserver and i could see mutts second boat little brutus its lines cut bouncing in the pounding waves unreachable dont leave us dont leave us here you asshole i hollered into the wind you murderer murderer i couldnt see them clearly the rain cut at my eyes like talons their boat bobbed in the hard swells bumped against the dock and turned out toward the bay now i was on the dock arms flailing trying to keep my balance in the violent gale a wave struck their boat it rocked and began moving away dont dont i screamed if they ever heard me there was no indication the dock jolted and tottered under my feet i turned away from the fleeing vessel and hurried back to philip he still wasnt conscious and i slowly pulled him up into a firemans carry hoping i wasnt hurting him worse if he had suffered injuries i hadnt detected halfway back to the house tom and pop found me pop seized me in a grateful hug nearly making me drop philip they eased him from my shoulders he was not light and we headed toward the house i came up after them onto the porch staggering with delayed shock i steadied philips back as pop and tom carried him in between them i stumbled as we headed onto the porch and my hand smashed through one of the panes of glass in the study door cutting it deeply i yowled as warm blood gushed over my hand oh christ i muttered jake still sat in the study watching us with wide eyes he looked like a little boy on a tooscary adventure whats happened he cried muttor wendyshot philip the bullet creased his head i managed to gasp theyve left us theyve taken one of the boats and cut loose the other jake got to his feet with more alacrity than id have given him credit for his eyes were bright furnaces of shock the phones are still out he said i just tried a minute ago get philip on the settee pop gasped tom hurry get deborah down here they lowered philip down to the sofa and tom sprinted up the stairs in the dim light of my candle which jake had kept lit philips wound didnt appear so gravemore of a deep bruise and a nasty laceration it was clear the bullet hadnt penetrated his skull but he was shockingly pale and i started cleaning the clumped sand from around his face oh jordy your hand pop muttered ill take care of philip thats a bad cut gonna need stitches we got to get deborah to look at it itll keep i answered oh shit pop mutt did all this that bastard deborah and gretchen barreled down the stairs with tom gretchen let out a little shriek at the sight of rufuss body deb paused at rufus but saw he was dead she pushed us out of the way to examine philip she began issuing orders to the others come here jordan jake called let philip be debll take good care of him let me tend to that cut go ahead jordy pop ordered you got to be sure you got the glass out of there i was a medic in the war jake said i know how to fix a cut he led me as though i were a small boy into the hallway and down to his room ever since i needed a cane jake said mutt put me in this downstairs room but i like it he took my candle and lit another candle on a mantelpiece over a small stone fireplace it was a nice room the furniture was oak antique plants hung in profusion from shelves and the ceiling like an extension of mutts beloved greenhouse a beautiful writing desk stood in the corner and i remembered mutt mentioning jake had many pen pals hed have a hell of a story to tell now family pictures dotted the walls most of mutt at various ages there were some of a man i recognized as a much younger jake with a child thats mutt jake said he went into the adjoining bathroom pretty child he was just like you i shivered in delayed shock soaked and chilled my hand was a bright flame of pain hes not pretty uncle jake hes a murderer id prefer not to ponder that right now jake answered his tone was mild as though this were a normal framework for conversation he lit another candle in the bathroom got to keep candles around when you live on the coast hate to take a dump in the dark despite the horrors of the night i managed to laugh not much of a laugh but a laugh i suddenly wanted to see and hold candace very badly now get over to the sink and rinse out that hand good ill fix you up a bandage i obeyed him standing before the sink and rinsing my hand under the cool cascade of water i was still soaking wet but the water from the faucet seemed kinder than the rain blood spilled from my hand in ropy threads and i gritted my teeth against the sting jake peering into his medicine cabinet by candlelight hummed and extracted a box of bandages antiseptic spray and surgical tape quite a dispensary i said the cut hurt like hell and i hoped glass hadnt lingered in the wound always had to be prepared he muttered lolly so damn clumsy she was always hurting herself i tended her more than she tended me he moved behind me and out of the small bathroom giving me some room use a towel to stanch the bleeding son ill get your bandage ready i pressed my forehead against the mirror still wincing at the slicing pain across my palm the glass felt cool against my forehead like a tonic this was not how i expected a family gathering to endin murder betrayal and such deep sorrow i felt like curling into a ball and letting my exhaustion take me mutt had killed lolly and rufus tried to kill aubrey who wouldnt he have destroyed to hide his past and i had so wanted to believe in him to trust him but something was wrong why try to kill aubrey if aubrey had discovered mutts plot to fake a death and light out with a new identity aubrey would have told sass immediately they were too concerned for their inheritance not to some piece of this puzzle was still missing i remembered the note on lollys desk pad to return aubreys phone call had she confided in him then blustered at the dinner table when she realized he was collecting information for a book about screwy families then if aubrey knew what lolly knew mutt did have reason to kill him but i could prove nothing now i blinked in quivering fatigue jordan you okay jakes voice was gentle i wiped my nose with my good hand yes i came out of the bathroom jake sat me down on his bed steadying himself with his cane he took my lacerated hand gently in his he applied the bandagealready wet with medicine to the wound with a hard strength like he was pressing a flower into a memory book the antiseptic stung sharply and i cried out there there jake soothed itll ease the pain make it go away he wrapped the tape around the bandage three times with surprisingly nimble fingers sealing it tight my skin felt warm thank you i said he touched my cheek with his knobby finger oh jordan this hasnt been a good weekend has it again i didnt know whether to laugh or cry he patted my shoulder and glanced up at the pictures on the wall oh mutt jake murmured and i heard a distant lament in his voice i loved that boy like my own son he didnt love you uncle jake i said i swallowed exhaustion made my face feel numb and my skin burned and tingled i rubbed my cheek with my good hand he loved us all jordan jake said and for a moment there was such tender affection in his voice for his nephew i couldnt shatter his illusion i stood holding my wounded hand close to my chest love is that what you call what he did i stared hard at jake im sorry uncle jake but mutts not right in the head he shot rufus dead he killed his own sister and what about aubrey a voice deep in me piped up jake lowered his eyes he didnt mean to hurt rufus rufus just didnt want him to take the boat and tried to stop him jake i leaned close my lips felt heavy and i had trouble forming the words mutt isnt dying of cancer hes been planning to vanish fake his own death and hide out on his money he was going to abandon you how foolish you are jordan hes gone to seek help i blinked at this utter abandonment of logic he wouldnt have left rufus if that were true i felt sick at my stomach and i sat down on the bed and argue the other side of the coin say mutt had no reason to poison aubrey aubreys book was going to get rid of philip as a problem right so who tried to kill aubrey and candace sass wouldnt poison her own son mutts gone off for his new identity who in the original conspiracy is left oh my god it cant be jake stroked my hair softly i was blond like you when i was a boy youre a good texas german boy like me he laughed thinly oh i know you think mutts awful but he fixes things hes always made whats wrong right again in our family anger flared in me i swallowed the nausea i felt no uncle jake he hides things he makes sure everyone else hides things too until the truth explodes in your face i stood i know about paul i know what my father did and i still love him if yall hadnt hidden pauls death at the timepop probably would have gotten off with selfdefense pop wouldnt have had such terrible guilt over all these years gretchen maybe she wouldnt have drunk herself into a stupor and brian my throat my lips felt coated with novocaine i sat down roughly on the edge of the bed my eyes round with surprise brian jake said airily was an annoying little shit who got what he deserved just like you are he leaned close to my face his breath sweet like cinnamon can you feel it working in your veins my boy whatwhat i tried to stand but stumbled fell to the floor clawed at the bandage hed kindly wrapped around my hand my skin burned monkshood he answered conversationally oh its very nasty very a little dabll do you you might have as little as ten minutes left i tried to speak but my throat felt like stone i wobbled to my feet the door blurring before my eyes a sharp crack sounded and i realized as i went to my knees that jake had struck me in the shoulder with his cane id hardly felt it i knew of boys in the great war he murmured to me forced to live in the french countryside for what they could forage eating monkshood killed quite a few i saw through the haze descending across my eyes a smile light his face pop candace i wanted to scream oh god no not like this no whywhy i managed he leaned down from the bed prodding me with his cane because you know do you know how tired i am of worrying about who knows and who doesnt know im old and i deserve some peace of mind he tapped my shoulder it was my idea to hush up pauls death of course i love your father and i didnt want him to suffer for killing a noaccount like paul i knew he would never talk he was too deeply ashamed and besides hed done the killing and mutt and sass could be trustedthey helped dispose of the body but lollyhe made a tsking soundshe wasnt very trustworthy did you know shed even told me shed been seeing pauls ghost and brians ghost here in this house she was going crazy slowly and she was starting to talk about what wed done the dancing light of the candle made flames appear in the holes of his eyes i tried to scream to scream my throat raw a wobbly moan came out guttural unformed everything was fine until brian decided to pry into his fathers death lolly apparently kept pauls jewelrybut you know that dont you whatever lolly was thinking by holding on to those baubles escapes me her silly sentimentality i suppose and brian found them and began digging around he prodded me again with the cane it was very annoying to have to kill a child im not a monster i have feelings but children should know their place dont you think i glanced away from his madmans eyes my blood felt clogged with ice i pulled away from him but my strength waned i collapsed at the foot of the bed huddling on the floor i tore the bandage away with fumbling fingers suddenly the lights came on power returning to the house i squinted against the sudden brightness theres no specific antidote for monkshood jake informed me consideration oozing from his voice dont trouble yourself with the bandage and id appreciate it if you didnt bleed on my rug youreyoure insane i burbled no you are for sticking your nose into peoples lives into murder he leaned close to me i tried to warn you away when i heard you fancied yourself a detective but you didnt pay attention to the little cards i sent you but lolly lolly my ass he sniffed i sent those cards to you mailed by my penpal friends they didnt know what was inside the envelopes they thought i was just playing a little prank on a fellow hobbyist his breath smelled foul against my face didnt it ever occur to you prying could be dangerous it didnt occur to aubrey either in writing his stupid book but look what happened to him he paused for a moment and i thought dont let the last words i hear be this madmans ravings oh pop candace im sorry sister mark mama i love yall goodbye daddy trey are you there come find me tears rolled down my cheek and i could feel my life ebbing fear speared through the numbness in my body and look what you made me do i have nothing against candace or your child your childs blood is on your hands not mine his voice rose to a shriek he poked hard at the tears on my cheek quit crying you dont know what grief is whelp stop it i felt a faint poke against my cheek as he jabbed me hard with the rubber tip of his cane a hard knock rapped on the door i heard pop jordan uncle jake the phones are working again i tried to yell but it was hardly more than a gasp jake threw a pillow down on my head and called jordans fallen asleep bob don and i dont want to wake him come back later i yanked the pillow from my head my vision swimming and somehow found air to fight past the deadness of my throat and my tongue i screamed a long wavery sound jordan jake whats wrong the end of the cane slammed against my head jordan the door pounded with the force of pops blow i pulled myself out of the canes reach adrenaline pumping me to my feet no way was i giving up to die i staggered toward the wall trying to aim for the door very nasty very you may not even have ten minutes left blurriness descended across my eyes and i sagged against the wall fighting to keep my balance i saw jake murkily moving off the bed and toward me his hand pressed against his chest the door buckled in wood splinters flying as the hinges cried out in protest pop was there catching me cradling me in his heavy arms oh sweet god he cried out nausea squeezed my guts jakes voice wavery and a little breathless drifted into my ear as i gasped against my fathers rainwet shirt bob don now it had to be done he let out a raggedy tortured breath jordan would have told on us all what have you done to my boy pop screamed and he shoved me toward the bathroom suddenly my head was dangling above the toilet and pops fingers were jammed in my throat already nauseous i retched but slapped his hand away from mine nodidnt swallow on my skin he poisonedthebandage pop shoved my hand under the faucet rinsing my palm screeching at the top of his lungs for deborah and the others theres no antidote bob don jake spoke his breath coming in short gasps im sorry you see the sacrifices i makefor the family you see i had to do it for you for all our sakes his own color didnt look good through my glassy vision i dont feel well now kiss jordan goodbye and fetch me my heart pills please pop released me i stumbled back into the bedroom leaning against the elaborate oak paneling of the room i would die in i slid to the floor blinking hard wondering if i could ever feel warm again i swallowed bile i blinked harder as i heard voices raised in fear screams supplications bob don for gods sake get me my pills my pills oh god i tried to call backwas one voice gretchens my throat refused to work i raised an arm feeling as if breath were a memory and focused my vision on the figures in the room i could see jakes hand raised in a silent plea pops hand holding something just out of his grasp you kill my boy and you want your goddamned pills old man i watched a hand fall i watched a life end i closed my eyes more screams someone rushing past me into the bathroom hands touching me pulling me up from the floor a kaleidoscope of noise and fear and grief and in the middle of it all pop standing before the bed with uncle jake lying before him fingers splayed out across his withered chest it was like a waking death for me somehow deborah kept me breathing when my lungs felt like lead she screamed at me through the swimmy visions through the fading lights and as the coast guard helicopter rocketed away from the island with philip aubrey candace jake and me aboard through the convulsions philip hollered at me too that i had to live his voicenot a whine this timepierced the rumble of fading thunder i asked for pop they would not tell me where he was at one point i believed myself dead it seemed logical my blood felt as cold as it could be without freezing into slush cut me and it would have been like pricking a icee cup then i remembered the swirly icees sister and i drank as children chattery cold and sweet against our teeth i fell asleepor slipped into coma you pickbefore we landed at the port lavaca hospital i awoke under a rebreather mask oxygen pouring into my system an iv dripping into my arm my fingers felt numb but when i scratched on them there was a flash of sensation jake was correct there was no specific antidote to monkshood but the hospital had pumped me full of oxygen and heart stimulants and i had made it past the first crucial hours when i could speak and a nurse busily strutted into the room i said i want my father and i want my girlfriend she started like id scared life out of her ill see what i can arrange she arranged gretchen my stepmother took my hand and held it close she explained that pop had told the police everything about paul about brian about mutt pauls suicide had been reopened and pop was being questioned under house arrest candace was going to be okay so was aubrey they were just down the hall from me and when i could have more visitors and they felt up to it they could come see me or i could see them many of gretchens sentences were long she spoke forever she held my hand and she cried philips wound was superficial although he told me it hurt like hell he joked and he laughed and when the rebreather mask came off and i just had the nasal prongs he said they should charge me less he said the doctors had identified the poison used against aubrey and candace convallatoxin a cardiac glycoside similar to digitalis found in lilies of the valley jake had apparently poured water from the vase of lilies in the study into the cranberry juice the water was poisonous from the cut lilies i remembered the vase sitting there in quiet beauty and shuddered philip said jake had a heart attack after attempting to kill me apparently his medication had been misplaced and they couldnt find it to give it to him in time i remembered pops voice taunting jake with the pills it was an entirely new code of silence aubreys notes and laptop had been found stashed in jakes room full of hints from phone calls from lolly that pauls demise was no suicide and telling him she kept evidence under sweeties watchful eye aubrey not pop had been the one ripping open sweeties bed to locate pauls stashed jewelry wendy had simply either lied to me or seen pop in the hall right after aubrey made good his escape jake had stolen aubreys notes and laptop right before his attempt to kill aubrey and silence him forever regarding pauls death aubrey was no hero though he confessed to being the one to spike gretchens drink eager to note for his book how the familyand gretchenwould react to her loss of sobriety gretchen and sass were not pleased with him in the least but they waited until he was released from the hospital to lecture him thoroughly and suggest he get some counseling i kept asking to see candace later i was told later the police questioned mevictor mendez and tricia yarbrough leaning down into my face i told them id fainted during the poisoning and seen nothing i kept my eyes focused on a ratty piece of tile in the ceiling jakes death was ruled natural causes by heart failure and several days later the toxicology results came back from travis county there was a lethal dose of digitalis in lollys system this story has three endings first about pop time passed i rose from my bed trembling with the sensation of knowing i would live wheeling the iv along with me easing a robe over me when pop arrived with gretchen we embraced in silence he rubbed the back of my head gently they sat in chairs i sat back down on the bed they said you told them about pauls death i began glancing toward the closed hospitalroom door i was in a private room which i couldnt afford i had heard one of the nurses talking about the press descending on the hospital because of that crazy family on that island at least i would hear this alone yeah i did and theres going to be a hearing he stumbled over the words and would not look at me gretchen would you excuse us of course ill go check in on aubrey she did not mention candace i watched her leave no i shook my head at the word hearing no theyre searching for uncle mutt and wendy pop offered by way of diversion hes been charged with rufuss murder the boat no sign of it or them pop they cant find you guilty well all testify yeah jordan family members on the stand should sway ajury we arent manufacturing that three of us were poisoned and poor rufus was shot for gods sake do a residue test on all our hands thatll prove none of us killed rufus my voice trailed and jake he died from the heart attack pops face was ashen yes he died his face cracked and his voice broke under the unimaginable weight we need never speak of this again i could hardly hear the words coming from my own throat but you dont believe in codes of silence i killed my brother jordy and now ive killed my uncle iim some sort of fucking monster pop sobbed hard covering his face with his hands shivering under fearsome grief i wrapped my arms around pop and heard jakes voice from that nightmarish evening im not a monster no youre not i murmured youre not youre not it turned into a slow slow litany eventually he came to know it was true pop did not go to jail the police talked to him and aunt sass for hours on end about paul goertz after the truth about paul came out deborah didnt speak to pop or aunt sass or to any of us ever again i think of her often she moved to atlanta to work in a clinic texas had gone bad for her forever i suppose i think she could understand pop having to shoot paul but she could not grasp the fear that made the family hide the crime and the hiding of the crime is what killed brian the guilt was no less burdensome because it was shared by so many paul goertzs body was never recovered sass confessed she lolly and mutt had weighed it down and dumped it far out at sea perhaps his bones still remain in the watery sludge at the gulfs bottom we will never know the police exhumed brian goertzs remains the tests found traces of monkshood in the boys body jake had poisoned him when hed discovered brian was close to unearthing the truth about pauls disappearance then taken him down to the beach and drowned him at least so they hypothesized i tried not to think what had transpired on the dark beach so many summers ago the poisoned boy being dragged toward the water by his bruised throat an old man with the bright flames of hate in his eyes pop was exonerated after a humiliating hearing that made him an old man he and gretchen are back in mirabeau now but press across the state had their field day and it doesnt seem quite so busy at his car lot he sits and watches the tabloid talk shows much of the day as though he needs to hear confessions of others no matter how paltry or sordid the second ending came far after the others but it is the least important the following thanksgiving i received a letter with a baton rouge louisiana postmark and the following text printed in a generic computer font i know you enjoy receiving mysterious mail sorry for all your troubles dont bother trying to find us a friend has mailed this and we are far away from baton rouge and any other place you might wander im sorry for what jake did i never knew he hurt brian i would have killed him myself had i known and im sorry he hurt you i didn t want to believe that he killed lolly it was easier not to i was horribly wrong but nothing i do now will undo that nothing i dream of rufus sometimes he was really worried about us going out into the storm he didnt understand it was forever he shouldnt have tried to stop us i wish it hadn t happened that way but it wasn t my fault it was yours you were opening too many cans of worms jordan forcing me to act too soon i dont hold rufuss death against you and do hope you dont blame yourself i was glad to hear that jake didnt kill you i hope you are well i miss our talks but i dont think of you often when i do though it is at that little league game you at shortstop and my heart swelling with secret pride i am not too old to finally be a father myself you know but my child will not be blond like you and me perhaps i someday will tell my child about curious cousin jordan but probably not life always seemed easier when you were a family secret we should have stuck to that rule and never allowed you near us do not come looking for us i dont believe you are interested in trying the letter was not signed and my friend at the police station in mirabeau could find no prints on the paper or the envelope i gave the original to the fbi they gave me a copy i burned my copy one night watching the smoke waft into the air in the quiet of my backyard i did not want it in my house the final ending came in the cool of candaces cottage back in mirabeau she had left port lavaca without me i didnt know where her heart lay philip and gretchen told me that when she recovered her senses from her poisoning she sank into deep depression when told her baby was gone and that i had been poisoned as well but when i recovered she showed little interest in seeing me i railed and begged the others to take me to her trying once to get to her room and forcibly being restrained gretchen assured me candace did not want to see me as the needle slid home and i faded into a chemical drowse she came in once while i slept and gretchen said she seemed to want to take my hand but then she fled the room her father and mother came from mirabeau to drive her home after i had visited sangre island one last time i returned to mirabeau my sister fetched me and cried much of the way home candace she said would not speak to her i had been home three hours feeling frozen and inert when i rallied the courage to go to her house i felt ill and i felt sad and i felt hot anger that she had abandoned me she answered the door looking thinner than was good for her and pale under the barest summer tan her hair was pulled up into a ponytail sweetheart i said are you just never going to talk to me again she made no move to let me in no ill talk to you youre looking good much better than when i saw you last i didnt get to see you then you left i had to jordan i dont ever want to see the texas coast again i needed to be away from that place i needed you pop was a wreck and deborah wouldnt speak to any of us and left andand i needed you im sorry i dont mean to hurt you her eyes were flat uninterested in what i had to say do you not love me anymore i asked hoarsely i dont know i cant doi cant do this anymore what sweetheart tell me youre drawn to trouble jordan you cant bear to pass it by you cant leave things alone if you had if i hadnt jake would have gotten away with murdering lolly and brian if you hadnt id still be pregnant with our child the cold hard truth hung between us thats not my fault im not sure i believe that jordan she began to ease the door shut i just have to have some time to think think about us if there is an us i slammed my hand against the closing door i love you you know how i love you yes right now i wish you didnt the door shut for a long while i stood on her porch unable to move i had no words for her i had no comfort for her because i didnt think she would have believed the end of my story when i returned to the goertz house on sangre island with pop and gretchen and philip and tomto see what was left to begin to put our lives in orderi had spent a restless night in my own room endlessly contemplating pops upcoming hearing the dread id felt when candace collapsed the loss of my unborn child the death id nearly faced the horrible secrets that had shrouded this house so long it had warped the very wood of the building itself i was taken with a notion to burn the house to the ground and salt the earth id wandered out to the porch in my sleeplessness and there i saw two small figures standing hand in hand at the houses edgeone a boy of twelve the other a boy of younger years theyd shimmered in the midnight moonlight their faces in brief stark relief brian and a child i did not know yet knew with my heart and soul with candaces eyes and my nose and blond hair and a wide pert smile of sweetness like pops they both raised hands toward me in warmth in loveand dissolved into the night breeze from the bay i wanted to follow him into the breeze into the night instead i went back inside the house to the family god had given me i went into pop and gretchens room where i listened to the soft sibilance of his snore and sat on the floor watching my father sleep until the dawn
