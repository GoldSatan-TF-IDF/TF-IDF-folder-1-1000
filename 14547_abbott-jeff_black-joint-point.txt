black joint point jeff abbott part one the devils eye there comes a time in every rightly constructed boys life that he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure mark twain in shimmering heat jimmy bird smoked a cigarette and paced off a rectangle of dirt about the size of a grave a little wider a little longer jimmy wasnt good at math that algebra in high school where they mixed letters and numbers together had been his undoing but he could eye a piece of ground and calculate how long it took to clear and dig to a certain depth ditches garden beds graves the earth on black jack point fed salt grass and waisthigh bluestems and jimmy pictured a hole six feet across six feet down he figured it would take him and his partners three hours of steady digging being a little slower in the dark then an hour or so to sort through the loot load the valuables on the truck and goodbye poverty in a few days hed be poolside in the caribbean chatting up coffeecolored girls in bikinis fishing in water bluer than blue buying a boat and lazing on its warm deck and watching the world not go by but he felt uneasy even with millions in the dirt under his feet what if somebody sees us hed asked this morning then we take care of them jimmy alex had said what do you mean take care of them i mean just what you think alex said it with that odd half smile caused by the little crescentmoon scar at the corner of his mouth like he was talking to a child i dont want none of that jimmy bird said and as soon as he said it he knew hed made a big mistake it showed a lack of drive a complaint hed heard about himself from his wife his mama his daddy even his little girl alex had kept smiling like he hadnt heard that smile made jimmys bladder feel loose i mean we shouldnt leave a mess jimmy quickly amended thats all i meant alex smiled patted jimmys back no messes i promise jimmy bird took a stake with a little flutter of fluorescent orange plastic ribbon topping it and drove it into the middle of the ground make it easier for them to see in the dark he felt relief that old man gilbert wasnt going to be up at his house tonight he couldnt see the gilbert place through the density of oaks but that was for the best no one to see them no one to get hurt no messes i promise jimmy bird didnt like those four words the more he considered them maybe he had gotten demoted to mess and he patted the pistol wedged in the back of his work pants for reassurance patted the gun three times and he realized it was just the bopbebop rhythm of his little girl patting the top of her teddy bears head hed miss her most of all once he left the country hed send her some money later anonymous like for her schooling she might get that math with the letters and numbers mixed together way better than he had by his reckoning he would go from ditchdigger to multimillionaire in about twelve hours jimmy bird slung the metal detector back over his shoulder and moved through the heavy growth of twisted oaks they drove home early because the bedsprings squeaked patch gilbert was a romantic but a bedandbreakfast full of artsyfartsy bricabrac was not his idea of a love nest but his lady friend thuy linh tran had wanted to go to port aransas even though it wasnt terribly far from port leo and could hardly count as a real getaway thuy thought port aransas romantic because it was actually on an island you rode a little ferry to get there and you could watch the porpoises darting in the ferrys wake theyd had a nice dinner and red vino at an italian place patch had taken his pill to rev his engine theyd snuggled into bed and he didnt even have thuys modest gown off before they discovered the bedsprings on the genuine antique bed screamed like banshees every time they moved were not making love in this bed patch thuy said but i took a pill at seventy he felt no erection should be wasted no its monday night this place is mostly empty aint nobody gonna hear us angel he started nibbling on her ear no she was sixtynine and more stubborn than he was so they had quarreled the trip was her idea but it was for his birthday and he wasnt happy with this squeaking turn of events and in a fit they got dressed and checked out and just drove back to port leo to patchs old house on black jack point the drive was mostly awkward silences it was midnight and they were both in sour moods and patch suddenly worried that thuy needed a little courting she wanted to go straight home when they got back to his house but he convinced her to come in and make up and drink a little wine she wasnt sleepy arguing had riled her up made her more talkative so he was hopeful shed spend the night how longs it been baby since you walked on a beach late at night patch gilbert poured thuy another glass of pinot noir now thats romance a beach real late at night thuy smiled i ran across a beach at midnight with three children in tow hoping not to get shot and to find a spot on the boat when i left vietnam patch it wasnt romantic she leaned over and kissed him a chaste little peck against his winewet mouth i should go i havent been up this late in years he felt their time slipping away her kiss gave him that shivery energy of being twentyfive at least inside come down to the beach with me i thought you retired from sales well honey if i have to sell you on the idea you didnt sneak another one of those pills did you dont need em shameless we dont have time for shame listen well just get the sand in between our toes his voice went husky and he took the wineglass from her hands it feels good the wet sand against your skin patch baby he kissed her gently almost shyly he felt the neediness in his own kiss the hopeful wondering not felt since high school before the marines before selling drilling equipment for so many years before cancer took martha and left him alone if there was going to be any dessert on his plate he loved thuy but had never broken the habit of lovemaking as careful conquest im too old for anyone to call baby thuy said never too young patch said lets go he took her hands in both of his and stood gentle insistence worked wonders after a moment she stood with him the night was clear but the moon was an illlit curve patch frowned because he loved the moonlight on the bay on the sands on the high grasses it silvered the world made it lovely as a dream tonight was too dark he and thuy walked down the long path a line of gravel threading through the salt grass down to a small curve of beach the blackjack oaks were gnarled and bent from the constant wind from st leo bay he and thuy slipped off their shoes boots and socks for him espadrilles for her and they walked to the edge of the surf the summerwarm water tickling their toes the milky way thuy pointed at the wash of stars we call it vai ngan ha what do you call kissing hon nhau she ran a finger down his spine and he grinned at her i counted those same stars as a little girl i wanted to know exactly how many there were i wanted them all like most children i was a little greedy im greedy for you patch said they kissed and she leaned into him the surf wetting the cuffs on his jeans he was sliding a worn hand under the silk of her blouse when he heard a motor rev steadily then purr and die he leaned back from her patch listen he heard it again a truck motor the engine rumbling a door slamming down the beach and over to the west deep in the grasslands in a thick growth of oaks from the southern end of black jack point goddamn it he said what is it kids joyriding on my land he walked up the beach smacked sand off the bottom of his feet hopped pulled on socks yanked on his cowboy boots let them be lets count the stars theyre trespassing he said digging ruts in my land maybe theyre looking for a makeout spot not here this is our spot just call the police she said naw im gonna go talk to them you go on back to the house no she slipped on her flats ill go with you might be snakes out there im not afraid she took his hand ill show you how to lecture kids they walked up the beach into the grasslands into the darkness as stoney vaughn wiped the smear of blood and brains from his hands a sick fluttering twist in his guts announced you just screwed up your life for ever buddy it was an unusual feeling failure shock the loss of control that flooded his heart he glanced up at jimmy bird loading the newly boxed coins into the dark hollow of the storage unit intent on his work jimmy wasnt looking at him or at alex either alex was watching along the corridor of storage units a gun in his hand making sure that no one saw them the only light was from the trucks headlights stoney wadded up the hand wipe alex had thoughtfully offered threw it on the floor reconsidered the wisdom of that act and tucked the bloody wipe into his backpack against the hard heavy lump of stone he kept wrapped inside he had to be careful now he swallowed the dryness in his throat kept the shudder out of his voice alex this changes everything alex black didnt even glance his way not really i planned for this how exactly did you do that we lay low for a while we cant buy the land right away obviously obviously so we wait a bit one of those nieces will be wanting to sell soon and then you can unfold the wallet and play your little getfamous game alex stepped back inside the storage unit unclipped a flashlight from his belt played it over the boxes which ones got the eye there small box on the top jimmy bird said stoney forgot to breathe he felt the heavy weight of the emerald in his knapsack feeling bigger than a fist bigger than a heart oh jesus alex would kill him alex pried open the box played the light over the big fake green chunk of rock stoney had slipped into the emeralds place hed been so careful going through the loot finding the stone first replacing it with the fake before the others even spotted the emerald he waited watched alex glance over the stone then alex shut the box gentlemen he said his head down his round wirerim glasses catching the glow from his flashlight heres the plan we double lock the doors stoney you got the key to one lock i got the key to the other alibis those are your own problem but none of us knows the others none of us ever heard the others names he glanced over at jimmy you come with me well clean up your truck get rid of the evidence the bodies stoney started arent going to be found for a long time alex said if ever i knew him the copsll come talk to me jimmy bird said his voice was hoarse trembling maybe not i dont want to sit around i want my cut now alex stared at him im just asking for whats fair jimmy bird said sure i understand but first man we got to get your truck cleaned up well give you your cut tomorrow help you redeem it for cash get you out of the country thanks i just want whats fair fine after the three men stepped out of the storage unit alex slid down the door fastened a lock onto one side stoney his hands steadier than he thought possible fastened the other click click locked now alex said mr bird mr vaughn i know youll both behave now that youre accessories he turned the flashlights beam up into his boyish face dont threaten me alex stoney said you dont have a dig without me you wouldnt have any of this without me thats right stone man alex said i also killed two people for you tonight so maybe you owe me more than i owe you right now stoney kept his mouth shut lets go jimmy stoney well talk in a week not before calm down i just made all your wishes come true alex smiled slapped him hard on the shoulder go home sleep tight dont let the bedbugs bite stoney forced a smile he watched alex and jimmy bird climb into the winch truck stoney got into his porsche he followed the truck out of the storage lot it turned right heading south back to port leo stoney turned left heading up toward copano flats and the comfortable sprawl of his bayside mansion he jabbed at the radio and head banger rock nirvana great he thought the voice of a dead guy turned up too loud blasted the car he kept one hand on the steering wheel the other hand in the knapsack where hed placed the emerald it felt hot in his hand which was crazy buried in the ground for nearly two hundred years it should be cool you just stole a couple million dollars from a homicidal maniac he thought stoney vaughn made it a half mile down the road before he had to pull over and throw up four oclock tuesday afternoon court done justice dispensed and the honorable whit mosley wanted nothing more than to swim twenty hard minutes with his girlfriend in the warm gulf off port leo beach eat a big steak at the shell inn cuddle with lucy on the couch watch the astros raise his hopes again make love at the end of the game right there on the couch like theyd done night before last while the postgame show droned lucy liked baseball as much as he did but now lucy was standing in his office door frowning not looking in the mood for a steak or a swim or a ninthinning delight i think uncle patch is missing lucy said whit shrugged out of his judges robe let the black silk fall to the floor glad to be just in his regular hawaiian shirt and old khakis and birkenstocks again the air conditioner in the courtroom sputtered with signs of age and this july in port leo had been blisterhot everyone in traffic court cranky and his robe smelled a little stale hed have to wash it tonight judicial laundry not listed in the job description hes not down here at the jail whit said no senior citizen discount dont joke whit lucy said hes not at his house his car is there hes not i thought he and thuy went to port a i called the b and b i booked for them and they checked out last night didnt even stay a few hours maybe they went to another hotel but his car is here whit what about his fishing boat still here his doors were unlocked and theres wineglasses out on the table two of them one with wine still in it so they came home and didnt clean up maybe hes just out with thuy in her car i called thuys daughter they havent spoken to her today either which is unusual they said she calls them every day whit really im worried theyre old they sure dont need chaperons youre not listening lucy said i have a bad vibe about this she fingered the little amber crystal around her throat something has happened to them call your friends at the sheriffs department or help me go look for them the police wont do much of anything for twentyfour hours he said not thinking and she burst into tears he had never seen lucy cry before he took her in his arms let her rest her face against his shoulder okay lucy okay ill call the sheriffs office all right and well start making phone calls well find them but when patch finds out youve made all this fuss you got to take the blame for it she sniffled i will okay thanks baby my auras feeling calmer already sure lucy he didnt pay much heed to her talk of auras and vibes but it was part and parcel of lucy and part of loving her he kissed her forehead wiped away her tears with the ball of his thumb he dialed the encina county sheriffs office figuring that within an hour or so patch and thuy would be found but fishing along a stretch of black jack point and all would be good and fine it didnt happen the sheriffs office once called found a broken window at the back of patch gilberts house lucy noticed certain items missing a silver candelabra a cookie jar in which patch kept ample cash a jewelry box that was a family heirloom the search began patch gilbert owned over two hundred acres on black jack point and on late wednesday morning the searchers found the turned earth along the edge of his property the disturbed soil was a hundred yards up from the beach a rectangle of torn loam hidden among the thick fingers of the oaks broken grasses draped over the ground like a shroud the deputies and volunteers started digging and whit made lucy wait up at patchs house wait here with me she said please she was shaking her freckled arms folded over each other her hair a mess from having dragged her fingers through it nervously i cant sweetie i got to be down there he was justice of the peace and because encina county didnt have its own medical examiner he also served as coroner if there were bodies hed order the autopsies rule on cause of death conduct the inquest if it was needed his chest felt sucked dry at the thought of patch and thuy murdered and buried but he didnt like the vacant broken look in lucys eyes he put an arm around her and turned to deputy david power maybe i should wait with lucy david made a dismissive noise youre supposed to be down there he said as though comforting relatives of the dead was secondclass duty compared to forensic investigation you dont need me until you find bodies he said and he felt lucys skin prickle under his fingertips sure judge whatever david power turned and headed down toward the thick copse of oaks lucy watched him leave well hes an asshole lots of negativity he doesnt like me whit said im friends with his exwife maybe you should go down there she said ill be okay ill stay here as long as i can he and lucy sat in patchs den a dark room covered with thick brown paneling in turn covered with fishing trophies and a fake muscled marlin he held her hand and watched all my children to avoid thinking about what the shovels might be unearthing lucy stared at the screen i cooked dinner for the two of them last week meatloaf i burned it a little cause we got to talking and i was drinking too much beer it tasted like a shingle they didnt complain ate it with a smile whit squeezed her hand i should call suzanne she said her cousin her only family other than patch lets just wait and see they watched a commercial offering tarot card readings for a callperminute charge while an energetic woman with a doubtful caribbean accent proclaimed the future to amazed callers that approach is so misleading lucy said look at her shes hardly listening to that caller shes just slapping those cards down her voice was flat as she pretended the searchers werent tearing up her uncles land im sure your psychics do a better job sweetie lucy owned the coastal psychics network which as she put it served the needy and the bored across texas at two bucks ninetynine a minute that is robbery she fingered the amber crystal on her necklace i at least run a clean ship maybe i ought to advertise more im cheaper than madam notreadingthecardsright he hugged her a little closer gave her a tissue for her nose need to tell you something about patch what he was the one suggested i call you for a date she laughed but it was half tears did he now called me up after you were in my court said i had given you too heavy a sentence for those unpaid tickets not unpaid ignored on principle same argument shed used in court a little more effective with him now patch had settled her five hundred dollars worth of fines shed done her community service whit checking on her a little more than needed he said i ought to even it out by taking you to dinner old men playing matchmaker is a bad idea lucy wiped at her eyes because they won the war they think they know everything a deputy young sunburned blond buzz cut bright with sweat appeared in the doorway judge mosley could i speak with you his mouth barely moved as he spoke are they dead lucy asked is it them yes maam it looks like its them im real sorry lucy put her face in her palms well shit it was a bad vibe she finally said from between her hands claudia salazar let the sun warm her closed eyes she had dozed on the pool lounge chair the water evaporating off her skin thinking i could get to like this claudias past few days had been a bitch finally closing out a series of burglaries on port leos south side aimed squarely at the tourist condos by arresting a repeat offender who sadly had three kids and was bound back to jail covering two extra late shifts for a patrol officer friend who was down with a bad summer cold because the whole port leo police department was shorthanded and then the terrible gilberttran murders which were beyond port leos jurisdiction but the sheriffs office and the police department helped each other with highprofile cases david power her exhusband had politely declined the police departments help and her thought had been pride goeth before a fall it was the most biblical thing she had thought in years she wondered without ego if he was too irritated with her to want the departments help she decided not to care as of today she was officially on vacation she opened her eyes sat up on the lounge chair watched ben standing by a table between the pool and the french doors fiddling with a stubborn cork on a wine bottle what a rotten guest i am she said i fell asleep ben vaughn pried the cork out and grinned youre exhausted dont worry about it she smiled if shed gone swimming with david drunk wine in the early afternoon then dozed he would have used it as a basis for analysis did i bore you whats wrong with me ben just let her be and she was grateful for that claudia stood feeling selfconscious in a new purple bikini a bit too adventurous for her pulled a long tshirt over her head and smoothed it out along her hips no more wine two glasses is my limit youre on vacation ben said i made lunch hope thats okay ill find it in my heart to forgive you so what can i do to help just sit youre my guest ben disappeared back into the house the deck for the pool ran along the edge of st leo bay and in the summer heat the bay water looked green as old glass the waves like white lips rising to the surface for a kiss then vanishing she put on her sunglasses vacation well a few days off and then back to the grind but sitting on a multilevel deck with a private dock backed by the house that had to be approaching seven thousand square feet well it was better than eating takeout and watching old movies on video which was how shed spent her last vacation ben returned carrying a tray two huge shrimp salads the shrimp firm and pink perfect crescentmorsels slices of avocado a small crystal pitcher filled with a homemade dressing rolls steaming he set the lunch down in front of her wheres the chocolate ingrate he poured them each wine again held his glass aloft in a toast to a great vacation for you and to old friends to old friends she said clinking her glass against his friends funny word she thought it could cover too much ground theyd been lovers long ago but she couldnt look at him and think exlover he was too different now from the shy gangly boy shed known and we didnt even have to catch the shrimp ben said sometimes im relieved by that other times i think its a shame my dads the last salazar whos still shrimping the smile dimmed slightly on bens face and she set down her fork im sorry i didnt mean to bring up an unpleasant memory ben smiled again she liked his smile warm and happy with a front tooth slightly crooked its okay my folks have been gone a long time claudia i miss them but you keep going on his parents had been lost in a sudden storm on the bays edge their shrimp boat swamped ben had been sixteen at the time his brother stoney just starting college i might have made a good shrimper you would have gotten bored but youre your own boss ben took a small sip of white wine out on the water out in the sun now stoney he would have sucked at shrimping claudia glanced around the deck the private dock the toobigforhertaste house it wouldnt have paid the mortgage on this place she liked the pool the lunch being with ben but felt an awkward consciousness of being in his brothers house as though she were trespassing she had kept glancing at ben trim in his modest swimsuit with his nice hands and his smile and wanting to kiss him but she wouldnt not here if she kissed him she might not stop and his brother might walk in at any moment what exactly does your brother do you said investments i can never quite figure it out he did venture capital work out in california for a while got a little singed in the dotcom meltdown decided he wanted to come home he does a lot of consulting for financial services firms in dallas and houston hes trying to get me into his business he shook his head stoney used to steal my allowance set up a lemonade stand with our money give me a cut wed make more than our allowances put together i think hes still following that business model it seems to be working he has expensive hobbies cars boats treasure hunts treasure hunts hes financed some treasure dives in the florida keys you know galleons that wrecked in shallow water got buried by the sands on the bottom takes a team to recover them its his obsession crazyass way to risk your money you got to make the big bucks to play that game his tone went wry and youre not interested in the big bucks ben grinned again me in finance id be doomed the clients would be doomed he shook his head i like teaching but the pay sucks and too many of the kids are unmotivated and the parents care even less im starting to think you seriously got to have a call to teach like being a priest or a cop she said or a cop he agreed you ever think of giving it up last year briefly but no not seriously living here with my brother well stoneys spoiled me ben speared the last fat shrimp in his salad pushed it through the little pool of dressing in his bowl but i dont have a talent for making money moneys not everything it can sure buy a whole lot of it still youre right and god knows stoneys not what youd call happy hes nervous jumpy i dont want to think what he was like when he worked in a highstress job lets talk about something other than your brother claudia said the three glasses of wine and lazing in the summer sun made her suddenly feel a little playful that was a delicious lunch thank you i didnt know you could cook i knew youd had a hard week ben said least i could do citizens should support their officers in blue every way they can a tease colored his tone and she skimmed her toetips along the muscle of his calf just to flirt back a little she stopped as the french doors opened a man came out tall and brown haired like ben but a little thicker in the shoulders and the stomach dressed in a summer khaki business suit but no tie the shirt buttoned to the throat his hair was gelled combed to kendoll perfection and he didnt smile until ben turned toward him hi bro ben said come on out dont want to interrupt the man said its your house ben said you cant interrupt claudia this is my brother stoney stoney claudia salazar stoney vaughn offered claudia a hand with nails manicured as smooth as pearl his grip was firm but the flesh of his palm was soft claudia i remember you from school i was a few years ahead of you nice to see you again his gaze went quickly down her to her breasts her hips back to her face quicker than a blink but she saw it and was glad she had on the tshirt hello she said you have a lovely home its comfortable his modesty was so false she almost laughed instead she said will you join us i cant today ive got to do some work up in my office but you two enjoy yourselves claudias taking some time off from work ben said shes an investigator with the port leo police two beats of silence really that must be fascinating work stoney said if you find burglaries riveting claudia likes to fish ben said maybe tomorrow morning we could take the jupiter out into the gulf have some fun why dont you take the day off come along bring one of your girlfriends whos on the a list this week none of them im in the doghouse ive been too busy to call works just been a bitch lately yall go though no do come claudia said yeah ben agreed sure stoney said that sounds great claudia lovely to meet you enjoy the pool have fun they shook hands and claudia watched him hurry back in she had the oddest feeling he wished her and ben gone out of his sight out of his house whit grabbed his forensics kit and followed the young deputy down past the manicured lawn through the thick growths of wildflowers and the high grass ahead was the wide bowl of st leo bay black jack point occupied the northernmost stretch of the bays reach with port leo south and at the middle of the curve the bay breeze shuffled the hot sticky air and on the wind whit heard the murmuring voices of the deputies of the department of public safety crime scene crew for a moment the crowd out of sight the voices sounded ghostly even in the eyeaching sunlight he remembered being here as a boy patch telling the local kids he let fish and swim off his little dock you know black jack points haunted by old black jack himself and by pirates and indians and settlers that got scalped got their throats cut be sure nothin dont grab your foot while youre swimmin it wont let go they like a young soul best taste goooood and the safe thrill of being scared and being fairly sure that patch was joking mostly sure they hadnt moved the bodies the hole was deep nearly six feet the soil threaded with torn grass he knelt at its edge while the dps crime scene tech snapped off photos the group was silent now the buzz of the mosquitoes the loudest sound patch gilbert lay on his back arms spread dirt still covering most of him his mouth open wide and loam pooling between broken teeth his face was ruined beaten into pulp a plane of graying hair askew on his scalp little broken tiles of bone peeking through his forehead thuy linh tran lay atop one of patchs arms as though he cradled her in a comforting hug dirt was scattered on her bloodshot irises a bullet hole marred her forehead whit slipped plastic bags over his shoes carefully stepped down into the grave touched patchs throat then thuys he wrote down the time on his death scene form for the record suddenly the promise of tears burned at the back of his eyes and he wanted to cry for this funny good old man and this generous woman but he didnt want to lose it not in front of this crowd he felt davids stare against his back whit stepped back out of the grave he began his work of detailing the scene for the inquest report and the autopsy orders keeping his eyes on the papers it was easier that way david knelt down by whit i think the man got hit with a shovel hard repeatedly probably even after he was dead wonder why the killer shot her though maybe broke the shovel on him couldnt use it on her patch would have fought hard whit said hes an old man david said with about ten times the heart and guts youll ever have whit thought makes me think of a case i read david said up in oklahoma or old couple got killed while out walking buried right off a hiking trail whit tuned him out david loved to recite old police cases from true crime collections as though they held all the beauty of love sonnets all the details and none of the context whit bit his lip when david paused for breath whit asked one of the techs to take extra photos of their faces of their wounds the techs did and measured the depth of the bodies carefully clearing more dirt back from the corpses when one of them gave a little cry of shock what is that the tech stepped back from where thuys feet still lay partly buried and whit saw two curves of brownish skull exposed look here another tech said clearing away dirt next to patchs knee a crooked brown bone of finger bent as if to beckon old bone real old dont touch it whit said stop the digging why david asked theres other remains buried with them i got to call the guy in san marcos this closes down everything were not stopping this is a serious crime scene david began they talked about site analysis in jp training you have to stop the dig david took a breath of infinite patience what guy in san marcos forensic anthropologist i dont remember his name but hes got to check out the site they mustve gotten buried in old unmarked graves whit wiped the sweat from his brow you cant move em until the fas here with his team judge mosleys right david one of the dps techs said quietly hes talking about dr parker he can be here in forty minutes dps sticks him on a chopper and rushes him down here fine david said his lips went thin as wire get this guy here then quick he turned away from whit to confer with the dps team whit took out the notepad he used at death scenes jotted down descriptions of the bodies talked in a low voice with the dps photographer while she snapped footage told her what angles would help him at inquest he tried not to look at patch and thuys broken faces instead he kept glancing at the old worn bones the forensic anthropologist a banty rooster of a man named parker a fortyish fellow with a shaved bald head and sporting a yankees cap arrived by dps chopper within an hour accompanied by a team of graduate students armed with dental picks brushes trowels string and stakes whit left them to their work spoke words of comfort to lucy and her cousin suzanne and the tran family all waiting up at patchs house he came back down as the afternoon began to melt into night the port leo fire department set up lights so the work could continue parker and david talked a lot david losing patience and getting it back the team sifted dirt from the site carefully and found more bone fragments little pebbles of teeth when parker got up from his digging to gulp a cup of water whit cornered him at the jug on the back of a dps truck so what is this looking like dr parker off the record judge yeah because i dont like to commit before all the datas gathered so dont commit we havent removed bones yet but theres at least two skeletons in there more likely three theyre badly disarticulated theyre not laid out as if they were buried and then not disturbed again why would the new bodies be on top of them i think these old bones were dug up dumped back in the dirt and your murder victims dumped on top of them the whole sites a jumble i mean bones that look that old you expect it ground settles over time bodies sink but these seem well shuffled anything other than the bones latches nails locks a few slivers of wood locks locks that was freaky whit thought why would you put a lock on a coffin you said wood from a casket possibly wouldnt a casket have kept the bones better organized apparently not these parker finished his water dont think they were buried in caskets coffins would have mostly rotted away by now anyway these bones how old are they the wetter the soil the browner the bones get over time these are pretty brown well assemble the skeletons as much as we can tonight and tomorrow well probably remove the bones in the next few hours once weve cleaned away the dirt gotten samples sifted photographed and mapped the site if we can identify the make of the nails and latches that can help us date the bones the family of the murder victims are friends of mine whit said wed like to get mr gilberts and mrs trans bodies out of there as soon as possible well hurry parker said a softening in his tone for the first time youll need to transfer the old bones to my custody for examination judge whit nodded and parker headed back to the dig flush with light from the fire trucks the diggers worked tenderly quietly around patch and thuy as though the couple slept and the techs were gentle spirits come to grant them sweet dreams finally they were done the bodies were lifted out slowly placed on clean sheets whit filled out an authorization for autopsy had david countersign it he watched the bodies taken away by the mortuary service for autopsy in nearby nueces county the service people carried the bodies carefully on their stretchers the forensic anthropologists continued their work around the old bones industrious and steady as ants by midnight wednesday fading into thursday the fa team had put an astonishing assortment of bones including three human skulls brown as walnuts into paper bags whit signed over the bones to parker and the fa team headed to corpus christi to sleep and finish their work lucy slept upstairs whit had showered and lain with her until she dozed off then come down to patch gilberts empty den at two am unable to sleep he watched an old perry mason rerun perrys was a perfect world for you one where justice ticked along sure as clockwork whit let the tv mumble along and sat in front of the bay window he cracked open the window so he could hear the murmur of st leo bay the night was dark the moon shy behind clouds the fireflies glowing and vanishing like candle wick embers just snuffed out between wet finger and thumb the fire truck lights still blazed over the nowcanopied site an officer standing watch the old house was full of the old man his laughter his teasing on a side table there was a bottle of glenfiddich that whit had seen patch open only last week he found two shot glasses and picked up the bottle he poured the shots of fine scotch one for him one for patch he didnt touch either drink for a long moment then downed both the scotch burned his throat a little made his eyes water closest to tears he would get patch thuy promise you whoever did this wont walk he went to bed curling next to lucy shielding her from the night patch gilbert wanted a hundred thousand dollars raised real quietly gooch said you know how i feel about publicity im not talking to the police but ill tell you about the deal gooch opened a shiner bock he and whit watched the noontime sun play along the ripples in the golden gulf marina the summer liveaboards were gearing up for lunch the inescapable jimmy buffett tunes drifting across the waters lunchtime beers popping open hungover throats clearing and gearing up for another half day of lazy life am i supposed to be grateful whit pulled a soda from the cooler goddamn it gooch dont you do this to me thursday morning court had been full traffic and small claims but whit was distracted bugeyed from lack of sleep and anxious to hear back from parker on the bones and the nueces county mes office on the autopsies i dont know that i was the first or only person patch approached gooch leaned back in the lounge chair took off his tshirt in the bright sun closed his eyes his chest was big and broad dark with tan but white where the scars lay one small and blossomshaped looked like a bullet wound another like a healed slash across his abdomen another like a longago stab in his shoulder he never talked about the scars why would he ask you for a hundred thousand bucks gooch opened one eye to stare at whit it was strange to have your closest friend stay an enigma gooch could stare down hired killers practice the intricacies of handtohand combat and make troublesome people disappear into federal custody he was a fishing guide captain of a premier boat named dont ask and yet something far more he was one of the ugliest men whit had ever seen with a face a mother might reluctantly love but he had charisma that drew certain people like moths to a flame gooch had saved whits life several months ago disposing of drug dealers with all the ease of a priest dealing with tardy schoolgirls and gooch had made it clear that explanations as to the how would not be forthcoming whit had sensed that gooch waited then to see if the friendship would survive if whit would respect his obsessive need for privacy whit was glad to be alive and pretended like nothing had happened people consider me resourceful and discreet gooch said ah whit said a heavy sailboat crawled into the marina on it three women in bikinis turned their faces and flat bellies toward the warm sun whit watched them lean against the rails in glorious idleness so what level of detail you want gooch asked go deep fine patch was a steady client of mine took him and some of his old army friends fishing he knows i know a lot of people people with money so he asked me if i knew of folks who might be interested in a very quiet private investment people who could part with a hundred thou and not blink patch could have sold some of his land if he needed money apparently not an option he considered gooch said i told him i would need to know more he said hed tell me more if i got an investor or two willing to talk to him i told him i couldnt waste the time of wealthy people that i had to consider these folks were my clients and if this was some halfassed scheme it was going to make me look bad shit maybe he was selling lifesize chia pets you know he gave you no indication why he needed this money just asked me to line up some multimillionaires which frankly represents a very narrow slice of my client pie and you think he approached other people he struck me as being in a hurry i asked why he couldnt go to a bank he said he wanted it quiet but fast i believe the term he used was hot and big enough to blow this town off the map so he wanted no attention now but whatever he was working on would create a great deal of attention later gooch sipped beer so theres your anonymous tip was it good for you maybe he was blowing smoke gooch maybe he owed someone a big chunk of money someone decided to collect possibility gooch said you knew him better than i did was he a gambler no he was always just the nice guy whod let you swim and fish off his land ive never heard of him having debt problems blackmail patch he bragged about taking viagra he was incapable of being embarrassed an old man bragging about medicated hardons is one thing gooch said maybe he had a deep dark secret that had finally grabbed him by the throat or someone close to him was in trouble and needed the money not lucy gooch clicked tongue against teeth cleared his throat watched a little red sailboat putter out into the bay dont start dumping on lucy again whit said lucy is lovely charming in a giddy goofy sort of way impeccable ass but im not sure she can read a book much less a mind on the other end of a phone why cant you like my girlfriend i dont want to see you conned shes not a con artist yes telephone psychics are known for their high ethical standards you havent really gotten to know her thats true if youre happy im happy fucking deliriously happy whit stood ive got to get back to the courthouse ill let david know what you said but youll keep my name out of it yes ill try patch wasnt a quitter gooch said id look hard to see if he found that money someplace else found his wallet and her purse david sat in the one straightback chair in whits small office it was shortly after one oclock on thursday afternoon dumped in beneath the bodies cash and credit cards gone so this was a robbery gone wrong burglary judge david said you know the difference maybe it was a robbery turned burglary or the other way around but whit decided to be rocksolid polite act like a judge for once let david be acid acid was just asshole with a different final syllable a burglary then yeah tran and gilbert cut short their stay in port a head home two days earlier than expected catch a perp breaking into the house perp kills them both buries them on a remote stretch of the point where theyre not likely to be found for a while the killer laid patchs head open theres no sign of that attack having taken place in the house whit said then it didnt maybe they took the old folks from the house hauled them down into the oaks killed them there they sounds like more than one person and for all this effort they got a little cash and silver they dont bother with the electronics look your honor you spend a little more time in this business youll see things usually arent too complicated criminals are dumb as stumps if they were smart they could go be investment bankers or judges a hint of amusement surfaced in his tone killer or killers got surprised they kill the old folks they take off why bury the bodies why not just dump them in the bay theyd float up faster its quicker to tie weights to someones feet than to dig down deep enough to hit old graves whit said he started to mention the anonymous tip from gooch but david raised a hand listen judge you pretty sure you gonna rule these deaths as homicides of course yes then thats all you need to worry about your honor anything beyond that youre stepping on my toes and my toes theyre real tender they get hurt real easy and my feet hurt im in a bad mood were clear yes whit said im going in to corpus to meet with the me and with parker and his people around four they have to sign custody of the old bones back to me you want to go hed mention the tip then let david squirm the whole thirty miles into corpus better than listening to talk radio sure thats fine i got a suspect to go question this afternoon you do who pick me up around three well head into corpus david winked put on his stetson stepped out of whits office said a hearty hey to edith gregory whits secretary then headed out down the courthouse hallway with a strut ill tell you about my suspect then if the mood hits me oh youre gonna be in the mood said whit alex black closed the door to his room at the sandspot motel and flicked on the light with its freezeyourass air conditioner and an ongoing nextdoor groanathon from a couple he dubbed the honeymooners this temporary home held few charms he wanted to leave he wanted to go to the storage unit and run his hands over the coins feel the heft of the devils eye say a silent fuck you to every archaeologist and bureaucrat who had ever crossed his path instead he sat down and called his father on his cell phone bert extons room

old guy alex said his goodbyes hung up he had buyers lined up for the coins dealing strictly in cash no questions asked and he could find a buyer probably a colombian trader for the devils eye but a big emerald like that hed have to move carefully even getting it appraised would draw unwanted attention he could be in miami in a week any loose ends wrapped up stoney was the one remaining problem he lay back down on the bed and began to imagine various deaths for stoney vaughn quick ones you didnt want to spend any extra time with stoney if you could help it in the clear sunshine of the gulf of mexico the blood and gore painted sparkles across the green waves filmy scales glistened like jewel dust torn shrimp pinwheeled down from the surface pink and brown and white a kaleidoscope of flesh slivers of fish guts bobbed the light shifting their colors from red to green to gray as they sank beneath the water beautiful claudia said gross ben vaughn said but i mean that in a real manly way thursday morning claudia stood at the open back of jupiter a fortyeightfoot luxury craft fishing rod in hand she usually preferred fishing on the open deck of a boat but jupiter offered the cool shade of the cabin a cushioned wicker chair a glass of grapefruit juice at her elbow she watched a heavy gulf shrimper chug away from them its wake now colored with the pool of chum ben had poured overboard ben hoisted himself up the ladder from the swim platform he washed his hands of brownish film at the sink you ready to fish the buffet claudia smiled am i ever sort of glad my brother didnt tag along ben sat down next to her relaxed grinning im not sure what a third wheel is on a boat sweet of him to let us use the boat stoneys too busy to play with his toys im glad im not summer vacation ben leaned over and kissed her easy thats for luck she cast her line into the spreading heart of gore nailing its center he cast after her his line hitting the edges of the chum smear you dont need any coaching i just need someone to vouch for my unbelievable fish stories if i end up not catching a thing she said we each caught a whale right ben sipped at his soda claudia watched sleek figures dart and turn beneath the bloody cloud within seconds a thickbodied yellowfin hit her line she jerked once setting the hook and then let the monofilament line spin out as the yellowfin raced away revving along for a hundred and fifty feet the tug and play went on for ten minutes and soon the strength at the other end of the line faded claudia reeled her prize in and carefully held the bulletshaped yellowfin aloft for inspection a real beauty youre gonna outfish me arent you the day is young claudia eased the heavy yellowfin into the customized live well in the salons corner and cast her line out again but her luck didnt hold her next cast caught a fightfilled bonito that tired after ten minutes as claudia reeled the bonito toward the boat a dark shape flashed beneath the faded slick of chum and her line went slack ben pointed into the murk shark grabbed your fish for lunch claudia watched a tenfoot silky rocket underneath the boat sharks an odd tickle touched the base of her spine i hope he enjoys the lunch i caught him lets find less crowded waters ben went up to the flying bridge and steered jupiter away from the shrimpers wakes moving far out past a weather buoy marking seventyfive miles from the texas coast they spent the next hour or so hooking king mackerel and ling ben pulled up a big ling inspected it let it go the fish hit the water and dove down into the hard blue dark best catches ive had lately that kiss worked all mine do she said so i got a question whyd you call me ben after all these years he cast his line again let it settle you arent with david anymore its funny now i actually never feel i was with him you didnt love him i did but not the way youre supposed to theres a recipe theres a minimum requirement he and i were comfortable together but comfort wasnt quite enough did you ever think of me when you were married yes she said a few times but if you had shown up on my doorstep all you would have gotten was a friendly hug and a cup of coffee i took my marriage seriously ben im sure you did ben took her hand i never told you this but you were my first claudia he grinned i had to get you out in the middle of the gulf to confess that no danger of anyone overhearing i suspected as much if i remember couldnt admit it to you the guy can never be the virgin she squeezed his hand well i forgive you ben he leaned over kissed her soft and gentle but not tentative not the lips of the boy she had kissed at seventeen not the boy she had given her own virginity to but a man surer and wiser with his touch he broke the kiss first kissed her closed eyelids now im really glad stoney didnt come plus his girlfriends are all idiots she wondered what it would be like to make love on the deck of the boat out here in the middle of nowhere the sun their only blanket ill fix us sandwiches open a nice wine he said you made lunch yesterday ill do it naw youre my guest just relax ill be back in a sec claudia nestled deeper in the lounge chair letting the breeze of the gulf hum over her really happy to be with ben and she thought with a degree of rationality about love she rarely allowed ben vaughn was a known quantity the kind of guy her family would embrace even though they had adored david her mother who considered being over twentyfive and single a sign of social leprosy would surgically attach claudia to ben to bolster the chances of marriage but do you like ben or just the idea of ben are you just lonely and hes familiar someone you know wont hurt you ben brought homemade chicken salad sandwiches on thick sourdough bread potato chips and sliced fruit you slaved over this she said yeah opening containers stoneys housekeeper stocks the boat when we take it out i was thinking maybe we could cruise over into port aransas later eat at the tarpon inn if you like but ben didnt give her a chance to answer the invitation his gaze going past her his eyes crinkling that boats in trouble he said along the wavebroken cobalt of the waters claudia spotted a bertram sportfisher in the distance a single man at the bow waving a red blanket like a flag dumb ass ben said seventyfive miles out and he doesnt bother with enough fuel maybe thats not the problem claudia waved back at the man he was now hoisting a baseball cap bright red well see ben hurried up to the flying bridge tried to call the boat on standard channel no response ben whipped the wheel about hard and closed the distance between jupiter and the drifting boat claudia stood on the deck in front of the bridge as ben steered toward the bertram within minutes they pulled close to the sportfisher its name miss catherine was written in faded blue script on its stern with new orleans la beneath in smaller letters claudia moved up to the bow smoothing her windwhipped hair the man standing at the bow of miss catherine was in his forties a little heavy and rosycheeked his skin tanned he wore dark sunglasses and a baggy white tshirt with a tampa bay buccaneers logo on the front and faded orange shorts he gave claudia a sunsquinted smile full of straight teeth hello the boat claudia called you in trouble my alternators busted lost power for the engines and the radio youre a ways from new orleans ben called oh thats old i live in copano now the man said this is what i get for hauling around my mother shes down in the galley bitching a blue streak at me he shrugged tossed the red blanket down im danny i suppose you need a tow ben sounded polite but unenthusiastic copano was ten miles up coast from port leo and claudia knew giving a tow would mean no candlelit dinner in port aransas wed be happy to take you in claudia said if i could just borrow your radio i can summon my tow service danny gave claudia another apologetic smile and maybe my mom can borrow your head ben came down from the flying bridge squeezed along the narrowness between the rail and the cabin on the deck sure not a problem he tossed one end of a docking rope to danny im ben this is claudia thank you so much yall are lifesavers youve got a beautiful boat thanks ben said you fish today some ling danny shrugged toward the empty reel mount on his boat sharks nabbed the tuna i got yeah theyll rob you claudia said danny gave her an agreeing grin he slid bumpers over the edge of his boat finished fastening the rope tethering jupiter to miss catherine vaulted lightly over both railings and pulled a sig sauer pistol from under his tshirt from the band of his baggy shorts the smile stayed in place the gun aimed at ben sharks sure do rob dont they just be calm and no one gets hurt ben paled under his sunburn and took two steps back for gods sake man you want cash ive got maybe a hundred in my wallet what i want danny said is for you to be cool and hush he blasted a sharp twofingered whistle and two men bolted out onto the deck of miss catherine guns in hand beading them on claudia and ben nylon stockings stretched over their faces contorting their features into doughy lumps jesus ben said lets just put those guns down claudia said stern danny stared at her dont we have big balls for a he began and ben charged ben barreled into danny and the sig barked splinters erupting from jupiters deck as the two men slammed into the railing the two other men from miss catherine jumped aboard jupiter claudia swung at the first one a thin rail of a guy surprising him her fist connecting with his cheek knocking him down but the other attacker built big and brawny hammered her on the jaw she hit the deck landing on her side and the barrel of an automatic pistol gouged into her temple cool it the thin one with what appeared to be electricred hair underneath his nylon mask screamed stay the fuck still or we see if your brains match your pretty little outfit ben was down too a gun pressed to the back of his head eyes wide with shock dont tell them im a cop she mouthed unsure if he could read her lips ben barely nodded the big bruiser frisking him with all the gentleness of a wrestler i got some cash just take it okay bens voice steadied no need to get rough okay no need for trouble danny came and knelt by claudia you okay miss in a gentle tone like he cared yeah claudia said the thin kid said love boats over babe danny leaned over ben now wheres our buddy stoney what ben said hes at home danny stared down at him he glanced at the bigger of the two thugs gar go below find stoney dont kill him hes not aboard he canceled coming with us claudia said the skinny redhead jabbed his gun barrel into the small of her neck dont contribute to class discussion unless youre called upon sweetness stoneys not here ben said were not lying to you danny didnt look at him they waited gar the big guy returned no one else is aboard man well said danny then i guess i better come up with a new plan shouldnt i he leaned down close to ben and claudia lets start with your names kids just who are you and why are you on stoney vaughns boat im stoneys brother ben this is my friend claudia bens voice remained steady ah a brother fucking poetic justice claudia saw danny lean close to bens face pivot the gun barrel against bens forehead stoney stole from me killed to do it i want whats mine and youre gonna help me he smiled at ben smiled at claudia with a grin that said his mouth wasnt quite moored to the brain a brother is something i can use thursday afternoon whit drove out to black jack point the police dig was done but an officer remained parked near the tented site and another officer looking bored out of her mind sat in a patrol car up where the private road met the highway maybe to keep the curious or the indiscreet away she waved whit through the house reflected the gilbert fortunes over the years in the center was the old house built in the s fashioned from sturdy oaks its clear craftsmanship designed to defy the bays cruel moments over the years prosperity dictated which additions had been made a room on the east side a new garage bright with white paint a work shed its foundation blanketed with a yellow explosion of wild lantana patch built the work shed himself stone by quarried stone whit remembered helping him mix the mortar the teenage boys who fished off the point all helping out a thankyou note to the man whod let them use his land lucy sat alone at the kitchen table drinking a glass of iced tea funeral arrangement papers were spread in a fan before her he saw patch in her now the same clear blue eyes the determined jaw but lucy for all her brass had a delicacy in her mouth her chin her hands and a gentleness like patchs that was well concealed she had not cried again since the bodies were found showing the steel whit knew was at her core i dont want to shop for a casket again anytime soon she said god forbid she rattled the ice cubes in her tea they wont be able to fix his face right will they hes all broke whit they broke him he sat down next to her have they arrested someone no but david says he has a suspect he took her hand i dont know who she drank her tea the sheriffs office took patchs answering machine his computer yesterday i wrote down his messages i thought maybe there were more people i should call but what do i say whit he cant meet you for lunch hes been murdered whit glanced at the messages an exterminator was due to spray the house tomorrow theyd need to cancel that three notes to return phone calls from suzanne the port leo library calling about an overdue book all the daily doodlings of a life moving steadily along its course when fate got mean and reared up and smacked his nose back into his brain whit called the port leo library asked about the overdue book lucy watched him with a frown whit who cares about a book right now she said when he hung up was he a regular library user lord no he didnt want to look at it unless it swam batted baseballs or might kiss him she sat back down next to him whats this book he checked out jean laffite pirate king lucy shrugged i never saw him reading anything but the newspaper and sports illustrated she paused you havent talked to suzanne yet have you no i told her id visit her later get a statement for the inquest lucy tore at her paper napkin under her tea glass she ripped it into thin shreds you said theyve got a suspect you making a bet im an unforgivable bitch lucy said yes who honey suzannes boyfriend roy krantz he and patch didnt get along too well you never mentioned that they never saw each other more than once a month lucy said fangs shouldnt be bared that often lucy this is serious you point at him its going to be taken pretty seriously at least by me and probably by david lucys voice went small you dont want to believe you know a person who could kill two people in cold blood but you think roy could bad vibes fairly explode from him lucy said and i know what you think of my vibes but im even being logical he was in prison once for drugs not a fact miss suzanne advertises drugs dont necessarily involve violent crime he said and she frowned but why would roy hurt patch and thuy suzannes in the will she gets half of this land the money in patchs accounts im sure its a fair amount cant she say the same about you but i dont have a bad relationship with money like suzy q does lucy cleared her throat patch told me and im not supposed to know but he wanted to be sure i didnt give her any money not like i got more than two bucks anyway gambling problems how deep is she in he asked real deep patch said nearly a hundred thousand in debt whit a hundred thousand the lucky number lucy kept on suzanne and roy drive up to bossier city or fly over to biloxi every few weeks or gamble on the casino boats out of rockport or galveston shes pissed away her money and patch wouldnt give her two cents to rub together i told david power this morning and how did david take your suggestion lucy he furrowed his brow very insightful aura hes a deep thinker maybe if hes thinking about wells and water and even then i wouldnt be too sure i know that suzanne wont be happy if she thinks im accusing her boyfriend clearly but dont i have a responsibility whit yes lucy took his hands in hers i should have stayed here to housesit for him ive done that before roy or anyone wouldnt have tried to break in if i was here you dont know that lucy im playing the what ifs its the worst game in the world its like a terminal game you secondguess yourself to death she wiped the back of her hand along her mouth if youre gonna break up with me thisd be a real bad time why on earth do you think id break up with you im just saying lucy said dont you break up with me for at least three months i dont want to break up with you because you love me right lucy stared at him im not trying to paint you into a corner whit trust me i feel a love vibe from you but youre not saying it and if youre feeling it thisd be a real good time to let me know that i love you oh christ lucy sure i love you you dont have a future in greeting cards i love you lucy im not going anywhere there said not so hard once the words bit into the air i love you too whit i do ive never loved anyone like i love you i want you to know that and this is all going to be all right isnt it baby yes its okay he got up kissed her she kissed shy at first and then she kissed him hard eagerly her palms pressing against his back the phone rang she broke the kiss hell she said she answered the phone he could tell by her tone it was a relative or a family friend calling distant somewhere who had just heard lucy sank into a chair by the phone started mumbling thanks a brief explanation of the tragedy whit put her tea by her she patted his hand in thanks and he went into the study the glenfiddich bottle hed poured from last night was still there he picked up the whiskey and noticed for the first time the tag entwined with a thin gold ribbon along the bottles neck handwritten to celebrate days of old stoney whit tucked the bottle back into the bar seeing suzanne gilbert wasnt going to be pleasant now and he decided he might as well get it over with i love you lucy had said he felt a little shiver of happiness of nervousness of new possibility opening before him lucy stood in the doorway pale again the flush from their kiss gone the sheriffs office called while i was getting off the phone with one of patchs army buddies they want me to come in for questioning the kidnappers slipped over claudias eyes a blindfold heavy chamois cloth reeking of boat polish hands clamped on her arms and yanked her to her feet steered her belowdecks she heard ben stumbling gasping next to her the air in the cabin lay hot and still against her skin hands pushed her to the main salons carpet they tied claudias hands in front of her the rope laced down to her feet and bound again the knots were thick as doughnuts she heard bens wet breathing like that of a tired heavy dog youre going to be so busted ben said doubtful danny answered a decided coldness in his voice that hadnt been there when he spoke to claudia she heard him pacing back and forth near their heads perhaps inspecting them like prize tarpon wheres the journal danny asked wheres the emerald i dont know what youre talking about ben said let me cut the bitch gar said his mouth close to claudias ear maybe an inch at a time start with the ring finger why dont you just calm down danny said tension edging his voice were not at that stage quite yet search the boat they ransacked jupiter cabinets torn open leather cushions ripped mattresses gutted this went on for at least a half hour the boat searched from stem to stern claudia pegged their positions from their voices she had already labeled them danny redhead a throaty giggling tenor and gar a low baritone she heard fabric rustle as one of the men dropped to his knees between her and ben then fingertips gentle against her shoulder the wrong place the wrong time danny touched her gently i want to be a better person than that truly im sorry for you miss leave her alone asshole you touch her ill kill you ben screamed shut up brother im not like some people i could name who slaughter the innocent we are gentlemen here arent we his partners made no answer lips smacked to her left juicykissy and the taste of copper tinged her mouth listen well be expected back within a couple of hours ben said we go missing my brother will have the coast guard looking for us theyll hunt you down texas is a long swim away let me tell

stoney doesnt have a liquid five million just hanging around hell its in stocks funds real estate its happening baby happaning the redhead giddy with putting the screws to people ben danny said its easy i want three things from your brother what he stole from me which is a document a journal a valuable artifact connected to that journal which is an emerald and five million to compensate me for killing my cousin who was a nice guy there isnt that simple youre fucking crazy my brother doesnt have what youre looking for and he wouldnt hurt your cousin or anybody else isnt your brother a little interested in treasure hunting hasnt he filled a goddamn library full of books on it just as a hobby jesus hobby its gone past that time for stoney to pay the piper cmon claudia heard ben yanked to his feet his shoes scuffing the carpet near her knees wetness landed on the back of her neck bens blood gar put claudia in the stateroom danny ordered hands hoisted claudia up in the air crushing against her breasts and her hips hurried her like a battering ram down the small flight of stairs and through the staterooms entrance heaved her onto the torn mattress she twisted as she fell rolling facing the ceiling give me a moment gar danny said the stateroom door closed but she heard gentle breathing nearby near her face claudia it was danny i am truly sorry you sound like a reasonable man claudia lied stop this let us go please if you and ben are innocent in all this well then im sorry but how much do you know of stoney vaughns life i dont understand daytoday living does stoney help old ladies across the street or knock them out of his way pet dogs or kick them i really dont know him she said do you think stoney could commit murder kill a man in cold blood her throat dried hes a respected businessman ah his money makes him a saint a sarcasm she didnt like at all tightened his voice no she said just as this mistake youre making doesnt make you a bad person danny please stop this long silence again the only sound the slap of waves against the hull whats done is done life doesnt offer erasers no it offers choices you can choose to let us go piracy is a federal offense piracy danny giggled a short sharp laugh tell me do you think of us as pirates because i love it claudia youve made my day let us go right now and the door opened again she behaving gars voice low or you just copping a feel save your crudity for your friend danny said i want to have a private chat with her gar said private about what dont get your dick in a knot man im not gonna hurt her go on claudia stayed very still you dont tell me what to do danny said you work for me you want to know where these goods are right i can get her to tell without hurting a hair on her head if she knows just give me a minute you need to go help with ben talking to stoney the bedsprings creaked as danny stood up ill be back later claudia youll be fine he said and then she heard the door shut a thick fingertip cruised along her scalp parting her hair the fingernail hard and uneven gouged into the tender nape of her neck you fought us gar cooed a little fishy like you that pisses me off sorry gar daubed his finger at the blood drop on her neck smearing it along her flesh like finger paint slow gentle suddenly he tangled his fist in her hair slamming her head hard against the beds headboard her teeth knocked together her jaw already bruised throbbed she winced but didnt cry out you dont mess with us okay fishy you dont fight us you dont talk unless youre talked to understand yes claudia said the end of the bed creaked under his weight he took hold of her bare foot shed lost her sandals during the fight and put a pincer grip on her little toe i dont like your answers i break it whered you learn to fight a defense class at the community center claudia lied she suspected the correct answer the corpus christi police academy might land her over the railing with a bullet in her head gar squeezed her toe she held her breath wheres your purse oh god her police department id she didnt have her gun in her purse she was on vacation and hadnt felt the need to carry today while fishing but her badge and id were in the purse in a separate wallet from her drivers license credit cards and cash i dont know around i dont think ive got five bucks in my wallet she heard him stand and walk around the stateroom she couldnt remember where she had put her purse when ben had given her a tour of the boat shed set it down along the way they were in the larger master stateroom outside it was a short hall leading to a small guest stateroom with bunk beds and a head then the small stairs leading to the main salon at the forward end of the jupiter more steps leading down to the small galley then a stateroom also with bunk beds a head and a separate shower she figured the purse was either in this stateroom or in the salon where they kept ben drawers opened and closed she heard an unzipping that filled her mouth with sourtasting fear until she realized it was the zipper on her purse keys jingled the keys ringed to her wallet did he see the id hed kill her if he knew she was a cop she had no doubt a wallet snapped open claudia marisol salazar of mimosa street apartment port leo texas gar said hed found her drivers license she waited for him to spot and open her police id wallet say oh shit and close his fingers around her throat instead gar pressed his thick wide hand into the small of her back so this nice fancy boat it stays at stoneys house yes anyone else there besides stoney staff for the rich man i think theres a housekeeper who comes when asked no one living there but stoney and ben he grabbed her little toe again gave it a hard twist lyings gonna cost you im not lying she said look piracy is a federal offense adding homicide to it isnt going to help you he snapped the bone of her little toe and she screamed into the pillow did i fucking ask for a lecture from you im sorry she managed to say the pain sharp as a blade he released the broken toe tickled and kissed the bottom of her foot took hold of the fourth toe i tell my buddy maybe i like you real good maybe i want to spend a little quality time with you hell stop laughing so much hell go green with envy he gets real jealous if i take an interest in a pretty girl like you hell break every bone in your body starting with the rest of your toes and then the fingers and working up to ribs collarbone major organs and no one out here to hear you scream so dont lecture me claudia bit the pillow the stateroom door opened again danny said i told you to leave her alone sounding a little uncertain trying to be in command i didnt do nothing gar said her nose is bleeding i wont tolerate you hurting her i got something for you to tolerate shes his puss man shes no better than he is price of the choices you make did he hurt you claudia danny asked claudia hesitated for a moment before choosing her answer i tried to kick him and he dissuaded me youre not to hurt her danny said unless she tries to escape and by escape i dont mean she mouths off at you or you feel like dishing out fists you understand i dont see no captains hat on your head gar said his weight pressed against her ribs his erection poking into her thigh be a good girl gar whispered in her ear and ill keep myself on a leash be bad and ill play with you for hours on end gar made a wet kiss against her ear then he left the room and shut the door silence danny must have walked out with him claudia lay in blindfolded darkness shivering theyre not gonna let us go theyre not even if stoney pays this ransom they knew this is stoneys boat knew he was supposed to be out on the water today didnt know he canceled how a journal a jewel treasure hunters crazy but she could not worry about that now the only thing that mattered was getting help or getting the hell out of here so how are you going to get you and ben out of this the kidnappers had the guns but they quarreled among themselves improvising since stoney wasnt here no backup plan in place so they were being stupid and she would be smart claudia twisted around on the mattress and managed by dragging her head down the bedding to nudge the chamoiscloth blindfold a hairbreadth off her eyes again again she could see below the blindfolds edge the stateroom was dark thin light filtered in from the oblong portholes above the bed cut into rods of black and white by halfopened shutters on the walls were reproductions of old sailing maps and a framed set of antique coins next to the closet hung another yellowed print a portrait of a man with flowing black locks wearing a rakish hat and a blue nautical jacket in an arrogant stance the print was vaguely familiar something shed seen in a tourist bar in port leo but she couldnt place it she looked at the picture as a focus point took calm steadying breaths first get loose she rolled across the bed her hands were bound in front of her and by lying on the beds very edge and inching forward she was able to reach and slide open a side table drawer no gun no pocketknife nothing inside but a weathered paperback and a selfwinding watch the bookshelf a small one didnt even hold a heavy bookend a closet stood on the opposite wall but she remembered it only held clothes and hangers she rolled up to kneel and look out the rectangular portholes above the bed the stateroom was directly beneath the salon where she and ben had fished in luxury and below the portholes was a small swim platform smash the glass in the frames cut the ropes theyd hear her and she wouldnt have time to free herself if she could ease out the porthole no guarantee shed fit she could wriggle onto the swim platform and then what more than seventyfive miles out at sea no way to call for help roasting in the sun until they found her or she fell off and drowned bound foot and hand as she was she could hardly wriggle up and across the main deck without them hearing her maybe she could ease into the water and slice her ropes on the propellers yeah just like a movie action hero one flick of the propeller switch and shed shred like cabbage assuming she didnt drown first she remembered the silky sharks plowing through the yellowfin school she might be too big for the silkies but sharks didnt measure their meals they just ate they would still take her make her a fivecourse meal a leisurely limb at a time she listened in the quiet roll of the waters she heard them threatening ben shoving him into a chair ben protesting she lay very still breathing through her mouth she heard a phone ring ring click on good afternoon this is stoney vaughn good afternoon stoney dannys voice was creamy as butter this is your friend danny from new orleans a pause then stoney annoyed i told you to quit calling me you fucking nut weve got your brother and his girlfriend silence you werent on your little boat today were you too busy killing people stealing ruining lives stoney ben said he says you took something of theirs silence again theyre lying is this some sort of sick joke the devils eye stoney give it to me along with the journal you stole and a big freaking wad of cash just to make up for all the grief youve caused me and well be even and ill let ben and his friend go then stoneys voice not much more than a whisper i dont know what the hell youre talking about claudia struggled to a kneeling position fumbled for the handle started cranking open the porthole see if you can slide through the porthole get up to the deck radio for help now while theyre occupied slowly the pane of glass began to rise so you havent seen jimmy since monday david power asked linda bird he didnt like to sit during questionings he liked to stand pace around the room a little like a lawyer because the interviewee was always nervous talking to the police guaranteed nervous even if they were as pure and innocent as a half dozen saints and him standing made them a little smaller that was the goal make them feel small and theyd crack the encina county sheriff randy hollis sat across from linda bird doodling interlocking circles on a legal pad jimmy birds wife looked up at david her hair was cut in a style last fashionable ten years ago frazzled from home dye jobs a small patch of acne scars badly camouflaged with makeup dimpled her cheeks yes i told you that already she wasnt feeling small enough yet he crossed his arms no need to get upset if you dont got anything to hide linda you either believe me or you dont linda bird said if hes gonna keep asking me the same things again and again like a fucking parrot im getting me a lawyer because then hes just trying to trick me she glared over at sheriff hollis ill call you a lawyer right now mrs bird sheriff hollis said he had a low pleasant voice the kind that made for good radio but no one is accusing you of anything except being jimmys wife and we just want to know where he might have gone to jimmy mention any places he might like to go wheres he got family david asked all his familys either in the cemetery or tivoli and none of em like him names of his family in tivoli she gave them an aunt and two male cousins patch fired jimmy what a year ago right before labor day why jimmy got mad that patch wanted him to work on a saturday and called him a motherfucker under his voice patch heard him and fired him on the spot jimmy begged him for another chance but patch said hed crossed a line and he wasnt getting even a toe back over it linda bird lit a cigarette without asking permission david glanced at sheriff hollis who let it slide did jimmy hold a grudge he really wanted that job back patch was a good man easy to work for most of the time and doing odd jobs for him wasnt too much hard work but jimmys pride got the best of him he talked about screwing patch over how flattening a tire sugaring his tank kid stuff she tapped ashes into a coffee cup he sure as hell didnt mention murder jimmy dont even like to spank our fouryearold ive never been afraid of him and if he could go off and kill two people just like that here she snapped her fingers then i dont know him and if hes gone dangerous i want police protection for me and my little girl a patrol officer stuck his head into the interrogation room david your other appointments here david nodded and the dispatcher shut the door you got a suspect linda asked its on another case david said arent you the busy bee hows the marriage sheriff hollis set down his pen a pause i filed for divorce last week he knew it was coming so he might have reason to leave town he might although hed hate to leave our girl britni he does love her i give him that even if he dont got the sense god gave a goose whyd you file david asked irreconcilable boredom randy hollis leaned forward if jimmy calls you linda what do you do tell him to stay the hell away if hes innocent in this then he should come forward if hes guilty give up for britnis sake is this all judge mosleys conducting an inquest he may call you for a statement hes okay she said with a contemptuous glance at david a judges robe aint the same as a uniform doesnt make a man turn mean david felt his temper rise you be clear on this linda your husband calls you you dont offer him any help you dont want to be an accessory i dont want to be charging you putting your little girl through that grief try it without proof she said this aint red china she wasnt going to get small david saw so he asked linda bird a few more questions he already knew the answers to and dismissed her she left and david had his hand on the door when sheriff hollis said david about lucy gilbert what are you just taking another statement or questioning her as a suspect asked like he didnt know the answer and david could tell he did questioning her why she and suzanne gilbert are patch gilberts only relatives they stand to benefit from his death that aside what you got on her she runs a disreputable business you talking about that psychic hotline thing hollis said hows that disreputable my mother calls it says the girls on the phones are real nice and insightful you like your mother pissing away her social security on phone psychics she can piss her money how she pleases i heard lucy gilberts dating whit mosley so his honors not a big friend of yours is he hollis capped his pen gave david an unexpected frown we get along fine no you dont youve never gotten along with him never made the effort far as i can see hollis stood wadded up his page of doodles you got a reason to suspect lucy gilbert a solid lead you go for it you questioning her because shes the girlfriend of a guy whos a pain in your ass forget it i wont have an officer of mine abusing his position i resent that deeply i wouldnt want you to resent it shallowly david hollis said we clear crystal david kept his voice steady i need clarification on some items in her statement thats all in fact my friend judge mosley and i are supposed to drive in together to corpus for the autopsy results and to meet with the forensic anth team good keep playing nice hollis left david power unclenched his fingers odd hollis was a democrat whit mosley had been elected on the republican ticket although whit looked more like a guy whod gotten lost and had wandered into a green party meeting and stayed for the fashions why would hollis take whits side but he saw it then both of them from old port leo families the old moneyed families of the coast that didnt include the powers old family allegiances meant more than political party lines it wouldnt buy you an inch with him he stepped out into the hallway lucy gilbert stood there along with an older woman he presumed was her attorney the lawyer gave david a predatory glare like a barracuda whod missed breakfast lunch and dinner no sign of whit it surprised him he thought whit would be here steam pouring from his ears perhaps david decided that was best for the moment but he turned his friendliest smile toward lucy gilbert you just make one teeny misstep bitch you had a thing to do with these murders youre mine miss gilbert thanks for coming in i just had a few questions on your statement you gave the police if yall will just step this way patch gilberts older niece suzanne lived in a grand development called castaway key a series of streets and private docks that few born and raised in port leo called home her house sat facing st leo bay and in the summer afternoon the bay hummed with craft sailboats slicing the waves jet skis buzzing like maddened bees a pleasure boat loaded with urban weekenders cutting near the shore extrabad eighties dance music drifting from its deck whit rolled up the window castaway key was not aptly named many houses went for a quarter million and higher whit supposed anyone dressed like robinson crusoe ambling along castaway keys resortnamed streets such as hilton head road or cozumel way would be summarily brought to him on charges of vagrancy suzanne gilberts house was white and modern and it glittered with windows large enough to drive a car through delicate palms and sprawling bougainvillea filled the beds near the curved stone driveway brightly painted mexican tiles spelled out the house number suzanne an artist seemed flush rather than starving or maybe suzanne was housepoor and this mansion was a symptom of her supposed financial woes his cell phone beeped as he parked this is judge mosley judge hi this is linda bird im jimmy birds wife i think you know who he is i know we want to talk to him maam well i just talked with that prick david power i dont want to talk to him no more and the sheriff said i might have to talk to you so im talking because she paused i find the deputy to be irritating yes maam new orleans i think if jimmy has run off hes gone there couple of times last month i hear him late at night on the phone talking saying alex i thought it was some drunk friend of his they love to get tight and phone each other like goddamned teenagers i see then the phone bill comes we dont know people in new orleans but theres three calls there late at night i pay the bills as i have the job i ask him about who hes calling he says its a mistake hes a bad liar i can tell hes lying she paused so then i think maybe alex is a girl in new orleans how he got a girlfriend in new orleans is beyond me but im telling you because i sure aint telling david power you want the number he called yes maam i do she gave it to him and he jotted it down you tell david power he better fucking treat me nicer next time he sees me or im filing a complaint i got a lawyer now what with getting the divorce and i am in a filing mood i sense your resolve mrs bird thank you you set bond on my brother last year she said an amount we could handle we appreciated it im voting for you next time he thanked her stared at the phone number nearly laughed suzanne gilbert opened the front door as he headed up the stairs she wore black jeans a black tshirt black sandals idiotic in this heat whit thought artist mourning clothes she was very fair attractive a good five or six years older than lucy her cheekbones and chin and nose were all precise and perfect as measured as an architects drawing she greeted whit with a brief hug so quick he wondered why shed bothered whit suspected that suzanne wanted to pat his blondish hair flat or put him in a suit tidy him up for lucy he saw her eyes take in his clothes with disapproval the faded polo shirt the rumpled khakis the sandals how are you holding up he asked barely am she said in a tone that meant anything but whit followed her into a highceilinged foyer and then to a living room the furniture was modern and expensive imported teak leather surfaces of tan and black the carpet a creamy white brave for a beachside house abstract art filled the walls lined the bookshelves but all painted with the same crude hand no eye for detail or form savagely mixed the colors selected to hurt the eye jackson pollock without the restraint whit sensed a sudden meanness in the pictures they were ugliness disguising themselves as talent he hated the pictures on first sight he followed her to an immaculate steeldominated kitchen a man who looked like he might drag his knuckles when he walked stood by the granite kitchen counter drinking a bottle of dos equis big thicknecked with a shavedbald head and wearing a black tshirt and faded denim overalls a bracelet of intertwining tattoos whirled around one melonshaped bicep i dont think youve met my boyfriend roy krantz hon this is whit mosley hes the coroner and the jp here and hes conducting the inquest into uncle patchs death no he hadnt met roy the few parties and events where lucy and suzanne crossed paths roy was always at home or sleeping or working on a sculpture roy shunned limelight it seemed to whit perhaps he had trouble fitting through the front door whit offered a hand roy shook it and didnt try to squeeze whits fingers into pulp the phone rang excuse me suzanne said news has spread and people want to bring over casseroles and cakes you know how it is when you have a death in the family everyone swarms over with comfort foods and you gain ten pounds as though weight gain were her biggest worry whit thought she needed a cheeseburger but he gave his solemn conductingtheinquest nod of course she left the kitchen scooped up a phone in the living room spoke in a low voice youre lucys guy roy krantz said his voice was low and flat and sounded like it had been honed in a prison yard yes hows she holding up shes talking to the police right now roy raised an eyebrow and whats she saying family secrets probably roy made a noise of thick beerswallow kept staring at him suzanne returned something to drink whit her voice glimmered a little too cheery a little too hostessbright no thank you may we talk now privately sure suzanne glanced at roy then led whit down a hall thankfully empty of abstract artpukings two doors opened off the hall one to a concretefloored room cluttered with small iron sculptures of gulls palm trees flamingos and assorted equipment the other to another studio bright windows framing the view of the bay a huge canvas leaned near one window covered with a stained dropcloth a worktable stood nearby dotted with oil paint in blues mustards venomous greens as though poison dripped on its surface finished paintings more of the obnoxious scribblings that hung in the living room decorated the walls in one corner a huge roll of paper lay unfurled with smears of bright acrylic paint dried on the paper whit glanced at it then glanced again two round magenta globes looked like theyd been pressed on the paper from small pert breasts a roll of lime paint looked like a hip multiple handprints lay in blue and pink other blobs resembled kneeprints footprints and one squat figure eight looked like applegreen testicles suzanne wore a bent little smile on her architectural face youre very prolific whit nodded toward the calmer paintings on the wall it was the only compliment he could think of i get bored working on a painting too long so i paint quickly but they sell quickly too an offhand shrug theyre very interesting interesting apparently didnt cut it she frowned she sat on a paintsplattered stool and he settled on its twin across from her youre probably wondering why i dont paint the bay with a wonderful view suzanne crossed her legs dangled a black sandal off one alabaster foot no but you want to tell me she gave a solemn smile everyone here paints the bay every stupid little dabbler who can barely hold a brush between their fingers and the required frisky gulls little boats swaying palms tiresome she pointed at one small painting framed in silver a violent swirl of purple spirals gray crosses and white froth that looked like nothing more than idle slapping of paint by an angry child thats the bay my interpretation of it no adorable dinghies no fishing grannies no endangered whooping cranes winging back to the refuge the bay as it is hard cruel like life is he didnt think she knew diddly about hard life in this grand house maybe he should have her call linda bird id like to know about your relationship with patch are you asking as a judge or because lucys said an unkind word or two now that was interesting as a judge i loved patch who didnt she tucked her sandal back on her foot artists live up to our stereotype now and then get moody and mean when the work sucks patch always pulled me out of the blues gave me a slap on the fanny when i needed it she spoke with the air of the artist playing out each nuance until it wasnt a nuance anymore but he saw in the dusky light how brittle her eyes and mouth looked under the fresh makeup she had cried and cried hard did he ever help you in other ways say financially you ask that like you know the answer already whit shrugged you know lucy doesnt make it easy to love her sometimes does she she does have a mouth she lit a cigarette a thin ladylike coffin nail in a pink pack then offered him one he declined she told you garbage about me with great reluctance right much wringing of hands she got a vibe right whit said nothing lucy was born with a finger pointing at someone else artists see patterns honey and ive seen plenty of this one she said you asked patch for a large loan i was a little short on cash between paintings and asked patch for help he said no i said fine we were fine hes not a bank i understood you asked for a hundred thousand her eyes went wide good lord no i asked for ten thousand i got it from a friend its being paid off no problems she tapped ashes into a crystal ashtray on the worktable her mouth thinned a hundred thousand she ought to use that imagination for noble causes she said its what patch told her shes dead wrong she and patch seemed to have a good relationship lucy likes people who have things and will give them to her im not one of those people patch was he doted on lucy just a bit too much can you think of anyone whod want patch or thuy dead he only dated widows and he was successful at it i could see he might make another man jealous thuy lord no gentle and kind as a lamb retired teacher loaded with patience i adored her you and roy were here in town on monday night yes i already gave a statement to the police we were here watched the news turned in she paused tilted her head gave him a melty smile we fucked twice so we were awake until midnight or so thats not in the police statement but i dont mind total honesty with you her smile shifted his skin prickled in a bed or on the canvas the smile widened you have a good eye yeah its real tough to make out painted squashed boobs he saw the perfection of her face created a sense of emptiness like a house with no curtains in the windows roys what to you social engineering radio lucy strikes again she shrugged it was a minor drug conviction ten years ago hes clean she exhaled a cool little stream of smoke he was here all monday and tuesday with me okay working hes an artist too his studios across the hall sculptures in metal gulls lighthouses coastal art for the gift shop crowd hes not an artist at my level but he has potential whit glanced at the body prints on the paper on the floor and thought he saw roys rather limited potential at work its a lot of land at stake with patch gone she frowned as though he had dragged a dirty finger across one of her artworks well the gilberts have owned most of black jack point since before texas was texas it totals about three hundred acres fifty acres is mine fifty is lucys uncle patch owns another two hundred she shrugged again ive no idea of the details of uncle patchs will i would suppose lucy and i inherit but we never discussed it but if you needed ten thousand dollars why not sell some of your land weve always had an unspoken agreement not to sell except as a group patch wanted to hold on to the family land even when solid offers came in lucy and i always deferred to him have you gotten many offers on the land considering the value of waterfront property in parts of texas whit wondered if the land provided a hard motive one oh a month ago i got a phone call from a real estate investor in corpus i wasnt interested but i did refer him to patch because he was so persistent who was that stoney vaughn hes got a bigass house up on copano flats tedious type i met him once at a port leo art center function and another offer about a year ago from a company in houston we just say no we dont want to sell i dont know if that will change now with patch gone the bottle of glenfiddich had been from a stoney maybe interesting maybe not he thought of the skeletons patch ever mention any archaeological value to the land suzanne didnt answer for a second and he wondered if she knew about the bones david and the dps team had kept it out of the papers thus far but a freakish detail like that was hard to muzzle with so many people now involved she stubbed out her cigarette glanced up at him through the trail of smoke an archaeologist wouldnt find anything except old dead gilberts and their junk no earlier settlement on the land indians must have passed through or hunted there i guess black jack points always been wild country though i dont think anyone else ever built there but us crazy gilberts she lit another cigarette speaking of crazy gilberts what do you see in lucy do you mind me asking yes shes very pretty but shes very contrary and a bit too highmaintenance she drives me nuts she makes me laugh she makes me think for me thats pretty good laughing is good sexy her voice went a little lower i bet roys a real giggle factory he can be very sweet she said letting her smile grow but i do bore easily im allergic to paint he said id like to talk to roy now her smile more carefully crafted than her paintings went flat sure they returned to the den roy lay sprawled on the couch drinking a fresh bottle of dos equis watching jeopardy he didnt look up at whit roy whit needs to talk to you suzanne said i barely knew patch what is the tower of pisa he said to the television playing architecture for he was right it took a lot of strength to beat a man like patch to death whit said roy krantz didnt take his eyes off the screen probably not what is photosynthesis you dumb asses whit leaned down grabbed the remote cut off the television in the middle of botany for pardon me im speaking to you as part of a death inquest if you dont want to answer questions here you do it in a courtroom roy stood whit was tall but this guy was an oak i told you i dont know shit and i dont like to miss my program roy suzanne shook her head im sorry baby for the first time whit saw tenderness in roys sunhardened face sorry okay he crossed his arms i never got to know him judge he decided in the first ten seconds of our acquaintance i was trash so we declined to occupy the same place at the same time lets talk prison records roy walked into the kitchen got another beer offered a bottle to whit whit shook his head i ran some dope for a school buddy i got caught i cut a little deal school buddy didnt i did a short stint and ive been spotless now i got my life back together here with suze doing my art and people just want to piss in my beer yall do much gambling whit asked roy glanced at suzanne and she said lucy he glanced back at whit with a smirk actually we do and we have the means to and were not in over our heads i dont suppose its occurred to anyone that maybe mrs tran was the target not patch you grilling her family like this i couldnt say you come after me just because i got a record thats the easy thing to do just as easy to get yourself sued for false arrest for reporters to get a call to say some poor excon whos become a model citizen is getting hassled you cant fucking bully people man i didnt realize you felt bullied by me whit said please dont cry roy took a step forward suzanne put a hand on his thick forearm roy dont let him bait you im not baiting anyone whit said thanks for your time i can see myself out ill let you know if youre needed to testify at the inquest whit drove out of castaway key he remembered the time the land had been developed this thin sliver of nearisland when he was a teenager once this was rough country not too different from the gilbert land thick with salt grass jutting out into shallow water with a handpainted sign that read please dont pet the rattlers and how much is this land worth now whit wondered millions so how much is that family land really worth to suzanne gilbert or maybe to her waysmarterthanhelooks boyfriend he didnt want to think about how much it might be worth to lucy claudia wriggled her head through the open porthole attempted to snake her body through she eased one shoulder out she turned trying to navigate her head and the other shoulder out but the opening was too narrow and the ropes tight already chafed hard gouged her legs she was angry enough to cry hot tears and she hated to cry the heavy blindfold slipped around her neck like a loose scarf shit no getting that back over my eyes thats probably worth a whole foot of broken toes she pulled herself back in a knot of rope caught on the porthole crank not good not good she caught her breath eased herself free and fell back against the bed she tried to maneuver the blindfold back into place but she couldnt her hands couldnt push it up far enough to cover her eyes and all her wriggling had loosened the knot too much she heard stoneys shocked drawl over the speakerphone ill give you the money okay but these other items youre asking for i dont have please gar said number one and ben screamed that was finger number one gar said broke it a pinky you keep arguing ill cut it off i dont have what you want stoney said lets accelerate i vote to cut off the brothers dick redhead said with a giggle where did i put those scissors no leave him alone stoney yelled we will danny said claudia could hear the distaste in his voice if you play along first the five million oh christ oh christ stoney moaned got your pen ready sunshine redhead said put a half million in this account in grand cayman he read off an account number thats at the great commerce bank of grand cayman move that first will you stoney made a noise of unhappy agreement dont whine redhead said then another half million in this bank in anguilla heres the account number more accounts more banks the slow carving of stoneys fortune claudia gritted her teeth now the journal and the devils eye danny said youre going to take them to staples mall in corpus tomorrow at eight am when the mall opens for the elderly mall walkers go to the carousel at the middle of the mall leave the journal and the emerald in a sears bag each wrapped in plain brown paper and covered with a couple of paperbacks youll put the bag underneath the gray horse with the white mane the red saddle and the bright blue ribbons if the police are there or i dont like how anything looks your brother and his girlfriend die and i report the murder you committed to the new orleans police we get to that point i dont care what happens to me but you youre finished there was a long silence stoney vaughn finally said i dont know how long this transfer will take after it goes through the banks in houston we may not have immediate confirmation and im not at my office right now we check with grand cayman here shortly and you better hope that moneys streaming in redhead said we cant control how long the transfer takes once it leaves my bank you know that stoney said lets say i do what you want how do i get my brother back well drop off ben and claudia in a safe place after weve got the journal and the emerald danny said well call you let you know where theyre at thats not good enough stoney said our beefs not with them its with you were not into killing innocent people and dont call the police or the coast guard or the navy or anybody we see choppers coming we see boats coming looking for us theyre dead in two seconds danny didnt seem to notice the contradiction in his words which made claudia cold all over you fucker stoney said yes but im the fucker in charge danny said okay okay please i want to talk to my brother here he is you got five seconds stoney ben said he didnt sound scared or hurt to claudia more mad yeah do what they say how did they get you i dont understand boarded us please sto five seconds up no more talk danny said start the money transfers well be checking on you im calling you back in fifteen minutes thats not enough stoney started and then his voice was gone cut off progress said redhead but ill just keep these scissors handy okay ben claudia heard footfalls on the steps outside the master stateroom oh god the portholes still open she hadnt shut it the stateroom door flew open hard slammed against the wall gar with the stocking off his head a heavy round face brown eyes dirtyblond hair askew from the stocking full mouth he noticed her blindfold was off goddamn it he yanked the chamois cloth back over her eyes with angry roughness that better not come off again you understand well play this little piggy if it does he grabbed at her foot twanged her broken toe a bolt of fire shot up her leg she kept her voice steady im sorry it slipped off while i was trying to get comfortable comforts not in your immediate future he leaned down close to her licked her ear with a pizzagreasy tongue im not like danny boy who plays nice with you i dont believe in being in the wrong place at the wrong time i think fate brought us together so we could have us a little fun he picked claudia up threw her over his shoulder and carried her out the door stoney vaughn sat in dismal shock in his home office overlooking st leo bay staring at the banks and account numbers danny had given him he lit a cigarette fired up his computer and tried to order his thoughts danny had his idiot brother and that girlfriend of his somehow on his boat and that lunatic wanted the journal that had led stoney and alex to the treasure and the devils eye and five million in pain money fuck that he abandoned thinking how did this happen because he quickly decided that was pointless he started thinking of how the cards might play out bad hand number one he transferred the money turned over the goods got his brother back wouldnt work no way he could surrender the eye even the fake one in the storage unit without alex going nuclear no way they could let danny walk free that went for ben and his girlfriend too especially because she was a cop and god only knew what danny had told her alex wouldnt stand for it and if he even tried to cut a separate deal with danny alex would kill him bad hand number two he transferred the money but didnt turn over the journal or the eye fool danny make him think theyd give up the goods and let alex eliminate danny during or after the drop but then he was out five million bucks and he didnt have that much sitting around he had maybe a million and then he had clients who were generous but didnt know it he sometimes borrowed money and moved it back in when he got new clients most of his clients carefully selected were elderly rich from birth and patient regarding small losses this creative accounting had bought him the boat and helped with the house but he couldnt swing five million not all at once moved overseas no way to cover that up bad hand number three he picked up the phone and called the police and danny turned him in for murder hell a murder he didnt do but danny didnt know different too much death the guy in new orleans the old couple in port leo he wasnt a killer but he was an accessory prison no more golf no more deals no more treasure hunts no more luscious coastal social climbers in his bed or alex would kill him to keep him quiet bens dead no matter what i do he thought if danny doesnt kill him alex will he got up paced in front of the plate glass they would be calling back in fifteen minutes and he had a decision to make danny thought stoney had stolen the journal from him killed his cousin in louisiana that meant he didnt know about alex didnt know alex existed but alex couldnt do much about danny while danny sailed freely in the gulf so he had to get alex and danny both there and let alex solve it but first hed cover his ass stoney accessed the internet opened up a connection to his network management software that monitored and controlled the investment counselors activities in his corpus christi office he typed an administrators code entered some commands pressed ok hed had this as a timebuyer a backup plan in case his clients or the police got too curious about his records stoney dialed the phone alex answered on the first ring we have a problem yes we sure do alex said i need you um at my house now that would be my pleasure clicked off stoney decided a boulder in his throat he didnt like the sound of that at all whit had called the tran family from his cell phone reluctantly acknowledging that roy had a point about thuy being a possible target more than patch and dat thuys son had suggested meeting him behind the family restaurant the tran family worked close to old leo harbor the older and smaller shrimping harbor whit waited on the dock watching one shrimper hosing down his boat a flock of hungry gulls swarming above the decks inspecting it for morsels cong ly the trans restaurant was only a hundred feet from the harbor and hustling from the back of the restaurant was dat tran irritated and looking sick and puffing away on a cigarette as though it were his only solace you dont mind if i smoke while we talk dat said the cigarette merrily burning away of course not whit said again im sorry for your loss he had visited the trans briefly the day after the bodies were found thuys two daughters and son knew nothing they said this was beyond imagining for them the talk had been quiet factual and brief i just came from suzanne gilberts house dat answered this with a stream of smoke youre having to work today whit asked given the family tragedy he thought the restaurant might be closed dat licked his lower lip tourist season we cant afford to close other families theyre running it for us im just here for the dinner rush i wanted to ask you how your mother and mr gilbert met introduced by my nephew sam how sam was working on an oral history of the county prepping for his senior thesis hes at rice doublemajoring in history and economics wants an mba never wants to see shrimp again dat blew out smoke you know what the kids are like these days he interviewed patch for this county history said he was funny and charming invited him to sunday lunch at the restaurant patch met mother there called her asked her out for coffee he frowned and whit wondered if dat was gripped by that insidious illness of grief the if onlies if only sam hadnt chosen that history topic if only he hadnt called patch gilbert if only his mother had said no to coffee it could drive you mad whit thought did you approve of them dating he asked usually its the other way around dat said his voice tense the anglo disapproves of the vietnamese im not asking from a racial standpoint whit said im just asking what you thought of them seeing each other dat flicked his cigarette into the harbor it fizzed for a moment was gone patch was a nice man but not a serious man everything a joke everything a party my mother was a teacher very serious about life she took his interest seriously i expected her to be hurt by him he lit another cigarette his hands shaking youre dating his niece right so i heard yes maybe patchs family didnt like him dating a vietnamese theyve said nothing but fond and respectful words about your mother dat glared at him through the veil of smoke of course shes dead now being nice costs nothing he stared out for a moment over the flat of the harbor that investigator mr power he said maybe it was a racial killing whit chewed his lip of course david would like the racial angle he was politically minded hungry for the sheriffs office and solving a racially motivated crime would stick him firmly on the white steed of morals and justice but there was no reason yet to think that race played a role and he felt annoyed with david perhaps needlessly putting the trans through this subtle mental torture their mother dead was horrible enough their mother dead simply because of the color of her skin and the shape of her eyes seemed far worse i dont believe they were killed because they were dating i can why not most people are blindstupid no other reason yet you give us another reason and ill listen to it his faith in humanity seemed badly shaken another byproduct of violent death did your mom ever mention patch needing money dat whit asked a large amount of money raised quietly dat looked surprised no never my mother was a very discreet woman judge if patch needed money and told her she never would have betrayed his confidence was he in some sort of trouble i dont know perhaps he wasnt good enough for her dats voice trailed off and for an instant the mask of polite calm fell and whit saw the mans grief naked and cruel in its intensity sorry i know you like the gilberts but that family their charms escape me my mother made a poor choice there was nothing to say to that but whit tried were all so sorry for your loss i know lucy and suzanne grieve for your mother too dat thumbed his second cigarette into the water thats just so enormously comforting to me he stared at whit why does a woman nearly seventy need to date huh why couldnt she just stay home and watch tv like other old ladies i suppose having survived so much hardship whit said carefully she valued life each day of it yeah well look where that got her people said we were lucky to have survived the fall of saigon survived the boats gotten to texas lucky lucky thats us he turned away from whit heading back to the restaurant his luck all gone this is the plan whit said can you go to new orleans find this alex that jimmy bird was calling i can leave tonight be back tomorrow or the next day gooch said he and whit stood in the shade of the courthouse whit waiting for david to come out so they could go to corpus christi i tried the number whit said its a motel bayou mee i also gave the number to the sheriffs office hollis or david will probably call the motel but theyre not going to send someone to check it out ooh let me gooch said he stretched popped his knuckles its been a boring summer because david is targeting lucy and i want to find out where jimmy bird is hes a disgruntled employee of patchs so this is actually more about protecting lucy than about justice dont go if you dont want whit said no need to snap gooch said sorry gooch be careful i almost hope jimmy boys hiding out there gooch said the flip side of hiding is that someone might find you and keep you where youre at you dont hurt him gooch i cant arrest him cant bring him home i just dispense justice as i see fit that was a scary thought no you make another anonymous tip whit said no vigilante shit gooch howm i ever supposed to have interesting memoirs someday you keep cramping my style gooch turned and left and a moment later david emerged from the courthouse he straightened his stetson watched goochs retreating back your friend always looks guilty of something david said so do you whit said they walked along the grass of the courthouse yard two news vans from corpus christi affiliates sat like squat little vultures on the opposite side of the square whit hardly gave them a glance grateful that his evercasual attire made him look more like a latecomer paying an overdue fine than the countys jpcoroner david slowed as though wanting to stop and linger and talk to them already baking in the heat were two competing journalists electrifying their audiences with overwrought prose port leo remains rocked by the brutal double homicide a tragic end for elderly lovers leaves unanswered questions horror neatly filed into worn phrases to boost ratings those reporters had never heard patchs booming laugh watched thuys delicate hands move while she told a story smelled the soft jasmine of her perfume big story david said as he started the engine what we do is going to be watched carefully you should bone up on your preening whit said you might want to get a white shirt and tie david said he pulled the car past the reporters giving them a friendly little wave whit saw him wince as he powered up the window favoring the shoulder that had been shot months ago as he always did whit wondered if the shoulder still troubled him or if david used it as a merit badge youre not going to ask me about how my questioning of your girlfriend went david asked as they headed out of port leo along highway no whit said im not worried did you know she inherits the whole shebang david changed lanes whipped around a slowmoving pickup he said it as easily as asking if whit wanted the radio on whit was silent a moment too long all of patchs money land all of it he cut out his other niece i just talked with his attorney in corpus patch made the changes less than a month ago i dont think lucy knows she told me theyd each get half so she said she looked like she pissed her pants when i told her david said man i love driving even in this traffic wish i had a bmw something sweet to point down the road lucy can afford one now that estate with the land its gonna be many pretty pennies he glanced over at whit maybe she can spring for that shirt and tie your honor all right heres the skinny on your bones dr parker sat across from david and whit in a borrowed office at the morgue where the forensic anthropology team had set up temporary shop when im looking at bones i can only tell you so much i dont have a way from visual inspection to tell you this man died in or or what have you unless maybe it was in the past three years and these boys been dead way longer than three years you want more specific you call ut and get in the long line for carbon dating but thats real expensive and you dont need it he cleared his throat moved aside a stack of photos from the dig you got three skeletons at the site three skulls three partial rib cages six tibia and an odd number of finger bones and teeth all died of bullet wounds sam got shot between the eyes tom and uriah got shot in the back of the head the fracture patterns you name them david asked sure i name em parker said helps me to remember they were once breathing people happy sad hauling all the same baggage we carry around right now rotate through the alphabet like hurricanes up to s now lets see he shuffled papers now i can look at the skeletal remains and tell quite a bit but because the disarticulation was so severe were making some guesses here sam was male five six european ancestry about twentytwo at his death righthanded tom was male five five european ancestry about twentyeight at his death lefthanded uriah was male five eight european ancestry about thirty at his death righthanded i could be off in that we might have matched the wrong long bones to the wrong skulls but hell you got to start somewhere so they werent karankawas or comanches whit said his own voice sounded too quiet still processing what david had told him about lucy no parker opened another file now these other relics the nails iron latches and locks i sent those to my friend iris dominguez over at a ampmcorpus she has books to help identify historical implements lots of latches were distinctive being handmade back then used to mark the work of a craftsman dr dominguez says two of the latches come from a spanish furniturebuilder olivarez in barcelona active from until the late s the latches date from a design made around another latch comes from a new orleans furnituremaking concern laborde active from until the american civil war the nails and the locks dont offer so much less room for distinction this olivarez and laborde they made coffins whit said not to our knowledge they made chests containers furniture chests whit thought so some point after is a reasonable guess if our three boys have been dead so long no one should have known about them being there david said maybe not we even found a smaller bone chip in the grass near the surface the bones therefore have to have been dug up first then dumped back into the hole covered some then your murder victims were dumped on top it really is strange what if sam and tom and uriah had been buried with something else whit said slowly the latches the locks he thought dr parker was quiet for a moment i dont know what you mean you said these latches and locks could have come from chests what do buried chests suggest to you david gave a short little laugh what buried treasure thats ridiculous dr parker whit asked is it parker gave a thin smile under his yankees cap i dont know if theres a historical basis for it im an anthropologist not an archaeologist your honor david said with great patience in his tone dont go off on a wildgoose im just saying how do you explain these relics david you grew up on the coast too youve heard the legends sunken treasures off the coasts from spanish ships caught in storms or jean laffite he pirated in the gulf patch used to tell stories about him and buried treasure that crazy old hermit black jack that lived out on the point and claimed to be one of laffites men he thought then of the book patch had borrowed from the library jean laffite pirate king but theyre just stories david said nothing more maybe these guys got buried with their belongings that seems far more reasonable to me they werent pharaohs whit said if they were killed and robbed the robbers would have taken the chests with them david rubbed his face these men could have been buried in the chests themselves we didnt find anything that suggested buried treasure at the site i mean honestly do you hear yourself ill send you a complete report when im done dr parker said he seemed eager to be away from this argument what do you want done with the boys when im finished the county will bury them properly whit said you can send them all back to my office david stood shook hands with parker parker clapped a hand on whits shoulder buried treasure parker said wouldnt that be something wouldnt it though whit said ive got your autopsies dr elizabeth contreras gestured them to seats across from her metaltopped desk she looked tired as she tucked a lock of hair behind her ear thanks for the fast turnaround whit said their times of death were between midnight and four am on tuesday morning mr gilberts wound patterns are consistent with your typical gardenuse shovel i thought as much david said his nose both cheekbones and his jaw had multiple breaks his collarbone and skull badly fractured he would have died quickly there are a number of postmortem injuries to the body including four broken ribs and a hard shovelpoint blow to the forehead the killer kept whaling on him after he was dead did he suffer whit asked i think not did you know him yes he was a family friend a good one im so sorry judge thanks anything else of note with mr gilbert no just that it was a very brutal attack mrs tran was shot to death a caliber i think they shot her because the shovel broke so she probably died after mr gilbert she has defensive wounds on her hands and arms splinters from the handle dps can probably identify the handle manufacturer from the wood traces the resins she cleared her throat dps also did fingernail swipes on them both you may bear fruit with mrs tran more likely that she scratched or grabbed at the killers during the assault killers plural liz contreras steepled her fingers it just seems more likely lets say gilbert gets attacked first and its a surprise whoever killed him either didnt have the gun or didnt have time to draw before deciding to attack mr gilbert mrs trans got bruising on her upper arms maybe one attacker held her while another attacker killed mr gilbert then with the shovel broken and their composure regained they shot her so they were digging one might assume whit gave david a stare and patch and thuy surprised them maybe the killers were camping liz said camping illegally campers sometimes carry shovels no signs of a campsite but there were heavy truck tracks whit said so lets say theres noise from the truck and they dont hear patch and thuy approach until its too late the two of them were supposed to be over in port aransas but they werent so maybe the killers knew their plans expected them to be gone liz said knew their plans so who knew about them going to port aransas hell patch might have told any of a thousand people in town what his plans were not a shy man or maybe not assume not so whit knew lucy suzanne and therefore roy thuys family if youre right the killers wouldnt have been worried about making noise noise liz said i mean youre saying noise above and beyond a regular truck right maybe the truck was doing more than revving its engines maybe it was loading something whit said loading what out in the middle of nowhere liz asked judge david said liz glanced at the two of them gauging the tension whit stayed quiet i wont ask youve got my report the families can have the bodies back tomorrow they walked into the parking lot got into davids police cruiser david started the engine but didnt shift into drive the treasure idea its interesting but until i see something more its not relevant you cant ignore those relics im more interested in modernday motives the killers had shovels and trucks david do you think they were digging for oil im not jumping to a whackedout conclusion judge the skeletons could be old gilbert family members that seems far more likely than buried treasure in my mind surely you see that david eased out into corpus christi traffic headed for the harbor bridge i mean i understand this treasure ideas interesting to you because it takes lucy out of the equation shes got the prime motive for the murder she benefits the most he clicked his tongue against his teeth lucy had nothing to do with this she didnt even know about the will you one hundred percent sure she didnt i am certaintys a nice thing you dont see it often you want to grab dinner the unexpected olive branch made whit suspicious why christ thats nice we work together im making an effort here make the effort by not accusing lucy well talk about it you eat barbecue there was a nasty calculation whit thought in the smile and he wanted to know what was behind it sure i do lets go gar carried claudia out onto jupiters deck she was still blindfolded and the heat of the sun touched her face and legs he lurched and for a freezing moment she thought he was throwing her overboard but then he settled her feet on deck held her by her shoulders and she realized hed crossed the railing to the miss catherine we havent really moved claudia realized she wondered how cold a watery grave would feel the sky forever denied your flesh drifting off your bones over the weeks your leg bones and hipbones and ribs settling into the ooze like artifacts for the slow dissolve into muck itself dont do this she said please she balled her hands into fists but she knew with a sick sinking feeling he was much stronger than she was she needed a weapon to even the odds hes not going to hurt you dannys voice came from behind her i just want to talk to you a minute so this wasnt about rape at least for the next five minutes gar steered her walking made her broken toe throb even worse into a galley that reeked of burned pizza with a thin odor of rum and sweat souring the air he steered claudia into a vinyl booth and pushed her into the seat now claudia danny said we can talk for a few minutes while we wait to be sure stoneys cooperating breath tickled claudias ear if this deal sours gar whispered im gonna have fun with you pour some wesson oil between your legs and have us a little marathon her heart struck her ribs like a hammer hitting piano wire let her be danny said go back to the other boat behave gar said presumably to her claudia heard a door close the smell of the rum moved closer vinyl crackled as danny slid into the booths other side she put her hands still bound in front of her on the table the linoleum was sticky dont be afraid danny said yeah right gars threat wriggled in her ear like a worm i dont think hell rape you hes all talk those two boys well they slept in the same stateroom last night and i heard groaning dont think they had upset stomachs the barest hint of moral outrage colored his voice he broke my toe because he didnt like what i said and frankly youre not in control of him or what he does i am youre not she said i can hear it in their voices those two freaks are just using you to get at this cash youre too gentle you dont have the stomach for this or what it might take youre as dead as me and ben if this doesnt work out im sorry youre in this mess but you picked your friends badly you thirsty hon want some water please a tap gurgled then he pushed a glass into her hands she drank he moved against the vinyl making it squeak trying to get comfortable tell me what you know about stoney nothing i know ben i barely knew stoney in high school high school before he was a millionaire yes he much different now he has more lunch money a match scratched she smelled the flash of fire cigarette paper crackled its whisper and silky smoke brushed her nostrils so in high school did he run roughshod over people kill anyone who got in his way talk is cheap she said what proof do you have he killed anybody because only he knew about the journal danny said i told him about it he decided he wanted it and he killed to get it the journal the emerald shed heard him refer to both before but this was about more about stealing millions of stoneys cash forget that for a minute since he says he doesnt have it yall cant get away with stealing his money electronically transactions leave electronic trails youll get caught within days she leaned a little toward danny and smelled rum having a little liquid courage she asked you want some sure for medicinal purposes i get seasick when im uncomfortable these ropes really hurt and my foots aching let him think she was delicate and helpless a dribble of rum trickled into her glass where you work claudia danny asked as though he were a bartender making conversation im a secretary she lied i work for a justice of the peace in port leo judge whit mosley you didnt work today today was thursday she had taken wednesday today and friday off she would not be missed at the police department until monday but the pirates didnt know that i took off today she said just today because fridays we have juvenile court its always a zoo damned kids she heard the soft puff of his cigarette how about i call this judge tell him yall ran into motor trouble down near padre youll be out another day ill say im the mechanic fixing it im sure hell understand she prayed silently that if danny made the call whit would have the presence of mind not to blurt what the hell are you talking about she doesnt work for me maybe this wasnt a good idea he wont accept a stranger calling and making excuses for me id have to talk with him well discuss that with my colleagues colleagues thats generous ten seconds of silence she couldnt see his face frown of anger smile of indulgence scowl of disbelief or maybe ready to stub that cigarette out on her forehead they breaking a deal with you she asked they care about the money not about punishing stoney or this emerald or whatever it is you care about hush now maybe i can help you why would you help me honey because i want to live ill get you what you want if youll get us out of this alive she heard only the hard rasp of his breathing youre not like those guys are you youre a little older a little wiser theyre in this for the money youre in it because you want the money and you hate stoney thats a big and now the silence stretched for half a minute she couldnt stand it so her words came out in a flood look all i know about stoney is hes got a bigass house full of security and i can get you past that security ben showed me the codes for the house last night cause i might do some housesitting for him and his brother when they go out of town but ill only help you if you dont hurt me or ben or stoney she wished she could tear the blindfold off see his reaction to this lie how did the blind navigate the emotions of the world gauge human reaction she listened for the quickening of his breath for nervous tapping fingers against the table for uneasy shifts in posture but there was only the silence then he said do you know why stoney vaughns boat is called the jupiter because he thinks hes a god she spiced a little bitterness into her tone figuring she might as well play into his resentment of stoney by faking anger she heard him tap ashes she sensed him leaning his head close to hers his breath smelling of garlic rum tobacco what do you know about jean laffite who laffite the pirate laffite the words were so unexpected she didnt answer for a moment well uh he was a famous pirate in the gulf a long time ago i guess the last of the great pirates theres all sorts of legends that he buried a lot of gold along the coast jean laffite had a schooner in his fleet called jupiter stoney named his boat after laffites he even has that picture of laffite in his stateroom not nearly as good as the paintings i have but still an okay one she remembered the print yes laffite the pirate confident and cocky and do you know why this boat is the miss catherine tell me laffites great love was a woman named catherine villars she was a new orleans quadroon part black mostly white a legendary beauty skin like yours claudia perhaps a bit darker he ran a finger along her hand but it didnt scare her so you and stoney are pirate wannabes claudia said rent an errol flynn movie and get it out of your system this talk of pirates made her nervous pirates cut throats pirates made victims walk planks pirates raped and killed do you know what happened to jean laffite i dont imagine he ended up in a rest home no one knows terrible and beautiful the not knowing his voice took a strange tone one of slow sickened anger that goose pimpled her skin heres the basics laffite used barataria bay in louisiana as a base made his fortune attacking spanish shipping he sold his booty mostly slaves and luxury goods in new orleans his pirating kept new orleans fat and happy in blackmarket merchandise except laffite didnt pay taxes they had irs agents then laffites the social god of new orleans but hes an outlaw to the american government so during the war of the british navy makes laffite an offer help the english capture new orleans and theyll give him gold land a high commission in their navy think how different our history might have been if the british had taken louisiana yorkshire pudding with jambalaya but laffite tricks the british he warns the governor about the british plans know what the americans did to repay him what the americans attacked laffites base burned his operations to the ground all for warning them theres a goddamned sweet thankyou note well that wasnt very nice claudia said but laffites a patriot a man of honor the heat in his voice rose when andrew jackson arrived to defend new orleans laffite offered his pirates to help defend the city jackson badly needed experienced fighters and weapons so laffite armed new orleans he still had more guns than the government even after they destroyed his camp with jacksons blessing laffite and his pirates took charge of key positions as the british attacked and laffite helped win the day claudia guessed he fucking dominated the day for them danny corrected battle in his own voice his cannons shredded an overwhelming british force the pirates became national heroes president madison pardoned laffite and his men of their past crimes maybe laffite just didnt want to lose his market claudia thought but instead she said and they all retired to club med well he wasnt gonna take a ninetofive job once a pirate you know eventually he left new orleans for texas and ended up on galveston island this part of the history claudia knew standard lore of growing up on the texas coast imagine a thousand pirates on galveston working all the waters of the gulf bringing laffite their booty funneling the goods to louisiana but one of his ships attacked an american merchantman laffite hanged the captain responsible on a beach gallows so that the american navy from their ships off galveston could see the body dangling but the us government wasnt appeased they ordered laffite out of texas out of the gulf laffite sounded like ninetypercent asshole to her barely a hero but claudia sensed jean laffite burned as real as the sun for danny the man had saved new orleans but they forgot about that typical american arrogance but laffite obeyed in spring of he sailed away leaving galveston burning to the ground he stopped as though picturing the scene a fading shot of an old blackandwhite movie in which the cutthroats were the gallant heroes then what claudia asked wanting to slap him to shake him to say this happened almost two hundred years ago why am i gonna get killed over this the stories vary some say he went to yucatan and died of fever some say he went to cuba and died in a sea battle some claim he tried to rescue napoleon from st helena one man a supposed descendant of laffites claimed laffite returned to america under an assumed name and lived out his life in smalltown missouri this last option was pronounced with sarcasm dripping from every word but no one knows of course so many say that he buried a treasure worth millions somewhere in texas or louisiana treasure she repeated thinking of ben talking yesterday at lunch about stoney hes financed some treasure dives in the florida keys crazyass way to risk your money imagine the scene claudia the government laffite served so well in a time of need has completely betrayed him he left as he promised but the american navy shadowed and harassed him all the way down the coast he would have had reason to believe the navy might board or attack him at any time or the british or the spanish might attack him remember he was being evicted leaving his base leaving nothing behind nothing a pause his only option to keep his treasure from falling into others hands would have been to bury it so he could return when the heat died down and retrieve it it seems risky she said laffite knew the shallows and reefs in getting through the barrier islands and the bays the american navy couldnt follow him there danny cleared his throat the proof was in the journal real actual documentation that laffite buried a fortune near st leo bay before stoney stole it from me like you said you help me maybe i help you hes inviting you in the trickle of sweat began between her breasts down her ribs it was the only chance she saw stoney knew who danny was which meant a trail could be followed back to gar and redhead she and ben were guaranteed dead unless she could make herself valuable make it good girl tell me more about this journal maybe i can figure out where stoney hid it im pretty familiar with his house looks like an old diary brown leatherbound small pages written in the s by dr john fanning he was the ships surgeon on the navy schooner lynx according to fanning lynx detained laffite after he left galveston boarded his ship outside st leo bay searched it for traces of loot from a spanish treasure ship santa barbara which had been lost barely a week before lynx escorted laffite to mexico dumped him there penniless pardoned his crew one of laffites crew a drunk told fanning laffite went ashore with a few other men and buried a trove from santa barbara at black jack point but that only laffite returned of course the historians have it wrong the fanning journal rewrites laffites history and i had it it was mine claudia bit her lip if the journals right the treasure might be worth several million now on todays market the historical value alone would be astonishing actual provable buried pirate treasure think what the museums would offer claudia the smithsonian for instance millions and there was supposedly a great emerald aboard santa barbara a huge colombian gem called the devils eye it would be of particular value so you approached stoney about helping you find this treasure and stoney stole this journal from you so he could locate this treasure himself yes he sounded completely serious for a moment completely sane if you ignored the words but stoney has money he doesnt need a bunch of old gold that might not even exist he has money that anyone else can have but a treasure thats one of a kind his ego cant resist it and i dont think its buried anymore i think hes got it you think he dug it up i dont think hes been waiting around with his thumb up his ass danny said he came to new orleans where i live when i was out of town and he took the journal he killed my cousin who was housesitting for me a bullet to the brain a cowardly way to kill im sorry your cousin was killed she said truly but what happens to me if i help you if i can get you this journal or this treasure well claudia ill let you go easy like he was suggesting they grab an ice cream cone down at the beach right but she pretended to believe him what about ben oh ill let him go too i dont have a quarrel with either of you i have a sense of honor yes she snapped your sense of honors why im tied up and blindfolded with a broken toe a silent minute passed then there was a gentle downward tug on the chamois blindfold it slipped down to her shoulders like a scarf the light in the cabin was dim and she blinked but now she saw danny sitting across from her his thick dark hair was shot with salt combed back from his temples his eyes an earthy brown but feverish and bloodshot a drunkards eyes crazyman eyes in his hand aimed at her heart he held an automatic pistol if were gonna help each other i gotta trust you you gotta trust me right he said thats true and i would like to trust you which is hard for me if i think youre going to kill me or ben or even stoney even if hes a killer and a thief im not the monster stoney is claudia i wont kill him i just dont want him to have the treasure its mine it belongs to me in every moral way heat colored his voice his hand slapped down on the tabletop emphasizing the last three words ill let him live if i get the treasure i swear on my familys name then that makes it all just fine buddy you dont know me why would you trust me i dont trust you you dont trust me either i know but i dont want to have to kill you i want the treasure i want to be shed of these two assholes now and i dont want to go to jail you get me into stoneys house you live its your choice she said nothing for a minute the hunger in his eyes made her skin crawl fine its his weakness use it against him to save you and ben so we got us a deal he asked claudia nodded im begging you not to hurt my brother stoney vaughn said over the speakerphone please let me explain we just called the banks aint no money streaming in redhead said no giggle now wherere those scissors jesus stoney please ben yelled give them what they want stoneys throat cleared i cant the transfers couldnt go through the computer systems at my investment firm are down we got a virus they arent going to be up until tomorrow a moments silence stoney jesus ben said his voice barely above a whisper a virus you know like that anna kournikova picture that got emailed around it wasnt a picture it was a virus our servers are down gar sprung up from the couch pacing angry little hums coming from him so move it via another bank i cant this servers got to work first my accounts are all locked and accessed through here please you got to give me more time wrong answer redhead said ben felt the tickle of scissors moving along his jaw his throat downward along his chest stoney please theyre gonna kill us give them what they want stoney gar said quietly you understand our position its not negotiable let me talk to danny stoney said let me suggest an alternative hes not here right now redhead said you can talk to us were all partners oh well i dont have this journal or this emerald hes talking about okay that whole idea thats just fucking crazy man i dont have it ill give you the money but you got to give me time he paused as a sign of good faith i raise the pot were listening redhead said the scissors stopped their wandering poised above bens stomach get danny to forget about this imaginary jewel hes asking for eliminate it as a condition let my brother and his friend go ill pay you an extra half million wait a minute redhead said he jabbed the speakerphones mute button what do you think ben heard gar let out a long breath ill take a half mil in cash over bullshit but he still ait wired no money yet so that could be a fucking lie too redhead jabbed the button again how do you get us the extra money is danny there no redhead said ive got a half mil in a separate account a pause but you get rid of danny you can have the money but not him we cant access the accounts without him gar said thats your problem ill send it when hes done and gone you understand and then the rest stoney what the hell are you doing ben said holy shit im saving your ass stoney said now just hush ben and you just take our word weve gotten rid of him redhead said after a moments hesitation no you bring him to me at my dock at my house at copano flats ill give you the money as cash when you turn over his body and my brother his girlfriend whatever shes a cop do whatever you think is best fuck gar said stoney for gods sake ben screamed shut up ben stoney said leave claudia alone dont you dare fucking hurt her ben said in a low voice please you could have the place swarming with cops gar said but i wont stoney said because ive just asked you to kill danny for me i have no reason to invite the cops to our meeting take the money and forget you ever heard of danny okay well call you back in five redhead said be there he clicked off the phone interesting turn of events she a cop gar grabbed bens arms brought him off the couch fuck you ben said ill take that as a yes gar said this could be a delaying tactic i dont buy that about the computers being down redhead said but he wants danny dead gar said and we get a half million as a bonus for what were gonna have to do anyway play it this way get rid of the woman dont take the risk shes a cop redhead said his voice was cool and firm ill set up new overseas accounts for us then let stoney hear danny die strangle him youre strong enough make stoney move the money then then we just see about whether or not he gets his brother back little brother might be mad about girlfriend getting offed and might talk to cops huh you gonna talk little brother ben made no answer ill take care of the girlfriend gar said have a little fun first though i always wanted to fuck a cop no youre not redhead said his tone went peevish hurt dont worry youre my favorite stay here just watch him ben heard gar move heavily up the steps claudia ben yelled claudia christ no a gun barrel jabbed hard into his testicles one more word redhead said and i shoot them off you ben started but he didnt finish there christ you happy stoneys hands shook as he set down the phone wasnt so hard now was it alex sat on the corner of the desk pissed as hell when he got here but then hed calmed when stoney explained it made stoney nervous my brother well worry about him later first we got to make sure danny cant tell what all he knows you see that now he put two and two together he cant live to testify you screwed up stoney said goddamn it you should have killed him our paths didnt cross in new orleans alex said is that my fault but my brother stoneys voice faded hey man you could have done what they said sent the money flying along the cables you didnt dont lay this on me alex stood looked out over the bay they ought to be here soon assuming they call back and alls well stoney leaned over and vomited into a wastebasket thats nasty yuck alex handed stoney a tissue now problem number two the emerald thats in the storage units a fucking fake stoney can you explain that to me so we gonna kill them danny whispered no killing anybody claudia said not if we dont have to if youre gonna chicken out if push comes to shove i need to know right now she raised one eyebrow dont worry about me fine then i got a plan lets hear it she said he had loosened the rope on her wrists a little and her hands prickled with returning sensation i got chloroform on the boat thought we might need it to subdue stoney he said when one of em comes back over here you distract him mouth off to him and i slap im with the chloroform cloth maybe something simpler claudia said maybe you putting your gun at the back of his head and making him drop his gun what if he dont surrender what if he shoots you or me hes not likely to do that with a gun at the base of his skull and if youre behind him he cant shoot you he might shoot you danny said then you need to press that gun hard against him so he knows you mean business if i shoot one the other will hear you got a fire extinguisher here in the galley she asked danny nodded toward the cabinet under the sink you put the gun on him get him to freeze ill belt him in the head with the extinguisher knock him out that means you got to be untied yes danny chewed his lip now that she could see his face clearly study it she didnt like the flat shine in his eyes not clever but cagey you begged me to trust you you got to trust me claudia said i cant be much help to you tied up you punched me he said youre the toughest little cookie in the jar you might try to take the gun from me well i wont claudia said you can trust me its your call he put his gun down and loosened the ropes from around her hands she kept her hands very still if i take the ropes off all the way hell notice ill tuck my hands under the table what about your blindfold he asked hell be suspicious if its off you leave it off she said if we lose hell kill me anyway danny took his sig and got up from the galley booth do you have any other guns claudia asked no danny said im for gun control actually then give me the gun youll shoot me danny said yes i will she decided then but later and in the leg this is ridiculous im not going to shoot you he still seemed to think working the inside of his cheek she played a cautious card yes youre just like your hero laffite heart of a warrior you cant make the simplest decision his eyes narrowed you dont understand im this close after what all ive lost i cant lose the devils eye or the journal its what ive lived for honey his stare and his sad confession made her queasy you gonna trust me or gar and the redhead more i got a plan you get down in the stateroom lay down on the bed like youre sleeping he comes down there to check on you hes got to go down those narrow stairs i put the gun behind his ear then make him drop his in a stateroom theres not much cover she said youre nice and safe behind him and im not its just a variant on your original idea he sounded peeved with all due respect i dont think you have the nerve for this she kept her voice calm i was in the army right out of school give me the gun and let me handle him im not giving you the advantage claudia if i were you id shoot me maybe not kill me because you seem like a real nice lady then get on the radio and call for help wheres your radio up on the bridge it doesnt make sense for me to shoot you and then try to call for help your buddies might spot me up on the deck and open fire he didnt say anything rubbing his thumb along the sigs handle but they wont think anything of you being up there danny can you go up there call the coast guard on channel sixteen was the regular monitoring channel on which boats hailed each other in short order before moving their communications to another channel a lifeline connecting all sorts of boats on the water channel was monitored by the coast guard call a mayday tell them its a kidnapping situation request help and then i get arrested no way youre going to get caught anyway my plans the only safe way out for you i promise danny stared at her but garll have jupiters radio tuned to theyll hear us or theyll see me using the radio and theyll go nuts then call on a thats the coasties liaison channel go up there crouch down low and get us some help he shook his head if they see me theyll kill me theyre going to kill you anyway and youre a moron if you dont see that he suddenly but gently pressed the barrel underneath her chin listen youre not the boss here if you kill me stoney wont give you what you want she felt calmer than she could have imagined with a gun held to her head by a clearly unstable man but his finger wasnt on the trigger he was playing with her and the idea of death and she stared back at him get down to the stateroom danny pulled her to her feet gave her a little push lay down like youre sleeping or crying my planll work she didnt argue the stateroom on miss catherine was tiny the bedspread worn smelling of cheetos and beer like a cheap motel room on a side table was a stack of books all about jean laffite and early texas history little bits of neoncolored paper sticking out from the pages like bright plumage clothes lay in an untidy heap on the floor danny prodded her with the gun grazing the back of her head and she clambered onto the bed her foot throbbing at least untie me so i can fight him if i have to she said he hesitated so am i help or just bait she snapped im deciding he said i thought you were a gentleman youre just an asshole shut up no she said i wont you want my help you better start helping me untie me or youre going to have to shoot me because im not cooperating with you anymore he made a sigh of exasperation this is why they didnt have women on ships of old you told me before i picked my friends badly you picked yours worse you get to pick again at least for now danny gars voice rumbled from the deck danny shoved her onto the bed pretend we dont got time for your plan and he hurried back up the stairs she heard the galley door smack open heard gar demand in a low voice wheres she at heard danny answer in a mumble that claudia was scared downstairs hed let her try to take a nap keep her out of the way she tried to wriggle her hands free from the rest of the rope the rope gouged her skin she heard danny saying i dont think so claudia yanked her right hand free screw being bait she jumped up from the bed huddled in the closet wire hangers jangled above her head tangled in her hair she needed a weapon she clawed the hangers free from her head the hanger make it into a loop of wire a garrote grab him from behind choke the air out of him she grabbed one twisted it hard unraveling the spiral of wire at the top another twist another heavy footsteps pounding on the stairs danny screaming to wait a goddamned minute fists hitting flesh hard the unmistakable pop of knuckle against jaw not enough time she dropped the hanger looped her hand around the length of rope hanging down from her wrist maybe not long enough nothing she had nothing the stateroom door flew open smacked against the closet door she saw gar shirtless his back a scrimshaw of gaudy tattoos a mass of muscle moving underneath the faded inks you ready for he stopped for a second seeing the empty bed but she couldnt spring out at him the open stateroom door jamming up against the closet door she was trapped gar glanced around saw the sliver of her in the closet smiled with half his mouth hidin dont help claudia took a step sideways in the closet nothing in here nothing to help her her fear tasted like smoke in her mouth change of plan officer but youll like it gar slid the closet door open grabbed claudia by the hair yanked her out of the dark narrow space shoved her to the bed his pale chest looked wide as a door his arms like pile drivers she wriggled away from him you dont fight me you make it nice ill protect you from my boy hes not gonna be happy you gettin what he likes oh no he might cut your eyes out when were done so you be a good girl and fuck nice and ill claudia punched him hard across the jaw he blinked frowned and blood welled up in the corner of his mouth he cussed and backhanded her the knuckles of his hand like rocks against her jaw little black flowers blossomed in front of her he held down her throat pressed his weight into her legs im gonna fuck all the fight out of you honey he grabbed her head and started pulling her up from the bed when the shot rang and she heard a sound like a hard thump on a melon blood exploded from gars nose his mouth spraying claudia she screamed he fell on her and she kicked out from under him wriggling along the headboard tumbling to the floor off the bed danny kept the gun pressed to the back of gars head he stared at claudia oh he said oh thats done then he grinned at her proud of himself the dragon slayer are you all right her vocal cords turned to ice you killed him danny pulled the gun away from the blasted back of gars head sure i did danny seemed to not quite believe his new badass status staring at gar as though the big mans shoulders would suddenly hitch with breath she stood her jaw aching her foot hurting from the broken toe the redhead will come or maybe he heard the shot oh god hell kill ben danny turned the gun toward her you could at least thank me thank you she said dont shoot me he tilted his head at her and she didnt like the dead flat look in his eyes no shuddering shakes over having just killed a man the fact was done filed out of mind i wont leave ben at his mercy she said she moved toward the door he followed her with the gun stop claudia she stopped what are you doing he asked im going to radio for help she expected him to argue with her order her to stop but there was only the silence of the waves brushing the hull of the boats then the rev of an engine not theirs jupiters oh no claudia said stay danny said she heard jupiters motor rev again and miss catherine swayed if were still roped to them she started and he lowered the gun she ran up the stairs through the galley and peered through the galley doors window out onto the deck jupiter was free from them the lines cut gunning away from them she could see redhead in the flying bridge hunkered down low steering hes running hes taking ben she said claudia turned to face danny and the foam hit the side of her face hard cold and sharp and pain knocked her down with an iron slap she moaned then liquid dribbled onto her face smelling of stale air and medicine and she was gone dinner was the vengeance is ours special grilled hammerhead with little plastic cups of melted butter for dipping drippy corn on the cob and french fries thick as a finger whit mosley and david power sat in the canopied shade of the oaks bending over stubbys the food was excellent but the locale was not gourmet rather stubbys was a trailer with a walkup window and a barbecue in the back that offered up pork ribs and brisket except this morning stubbys son had snagged a hammerhead on the edge of st leo bay and the unlucky shark debuted on todays menu the tables were old cable spools upended each one surrounded by stumps weathered smooth from the rubbing of a thousand butts clouds filled the evening sky and it was still too warm and sticky for comfortable outside eating but david wanted stubbys plus fewer people meant it was less likely they would be overheard david bit into his shark which made whit think it was truly a dogeatdog world lets get one thing clear im not gunning for lucy because youre involved with her you could give me some credit i cant not consider lucy you understand that but you do have this other suspect jimmy bird howd you know his wife hates your guts she called me i called hollis about it she got an idea that jimmy ran off to new orleans let him talk to sheriff hollis about it whit decided well why didnt you tell me you were too busy telling me about lucy he said and mrs bird asked me not to talk to you shes just a drunk i got an anonymous tip today david lowered his corn butter dripping from his mouth arent you popular i heard patch gilbert asked around town about quietly raising a hundred thousand dollars for what that i dont know i assume the tip didnt come from a loan officer at a bank no hence the anonymous whit said with a thin smile but dont you think it would be wise to check patchs finances maybe see if he owed debts gambling i dont know what but this had to be big were already on that david said jesus a hundred thou according to lucy his other niece suzanne asked for a loan in that amount suzanne denied it to me said she asked for ten thou patch said no she got the money from a friend lucy claims she and her excon boyfriend have gambling problems lucys sure wellinformed patch had money whit said ignoring the jab at least he was landrich i dont see why he would need to be trying to get a private loan you sure you dont know who this tip came from was this a phone call its just anonymous okay whit said he owed gooch his life if gooch wanted anonymity whit gave it to him the lie felt slick and unpleasant on his tongue but he didnt change his mind you know who it is dont you david wadded up the wax paper that had held his grilled shark thats all right im not going to bust your chops over it judge i mean youre an officer of the court a public official you sure dont owe anything to law and order no sir treat it like any other tip you sure this didnt come from lucy it wasnt lucy david mopped at his mouth with a napkin picked shark from between his front teeth uhhuh it wasnt lucy i mean its one family member pointing the finger at another right maybe just a little a little david held up his forefinger and thumb a centimeter apart i know you dont actually suspect lucy whit said and made his tone sure was she with you monday night yes what did yall do monday night you already questioned her im asking you your honor stress on the final two words as an officer of the court whit tore a french fry in two we had dinner at my place watched a movie what for dinner what movie asshole he thought gazpacho grilled trout a salad some australian white wine she brought i cooked the fish the movie was shakespeare in love she rented it didnt think you did and she didnt spend the night he could argue but decided not to they had nothing to hide we both had busy mornings scheduled she went home about eleven and you i went to bed when did you see lucy next judge when she showed up at the courthouse to tell me patch was missing shes in big debt that psychic network thing well you got lots of kids calling it parents bitch charges get cut or the folks that charge up on their credit cards they default dont pay but that dont mean lucys staff her expenses get cut too shes gotten in deep financially she tell you about getting sued by a couple of creditors in the past month whit was silent i thought not david said after a moment he licked butter and shark from his fingers that is still a real long road from murdering people the way patch and thuy died i found your button now didnt i the smile was coldly amused miffed whit saw over the tips over mrs bird calling him over the idea of whit having an advantage i suppose claudia was the same button for you whit said knowing as soon as the words were fired theyd hit like bullets david didnt blink im over claudia you can tell her that the next time you see her you want to make trouble for lucy fine but watch where you step be very careful david because you take a misstep im going to be on your ass like white on rice i think ill have a talk with your boss about these skeletons since you dont seem to think they matter very much i didnt say that david stood im keeping every angle open thats what an investigator does but ill give you a piece of advice judge i dont think you can afford lucy gilbert the press wont be kind and they love a little funky twist like her maybe killing two old folks to get the money to salvage her psychic hotline business i think you love the funky little twist more than finding out the truth whatever david said but you keep telling me to lay off lucy gilbert im telling the press i got the perfect phrases already in mind and youre gonna be in front of a judicial review board or facing a recall election in two seconds flat dont threaten me dont worry if she did it i wont ask you to sign her arrest warrant after david dropped him off at the courthouse whit drove home to the guest house behind his familys grand victorian to do chores on his computer and gather some clean clothes before heading back over to patchs to stay the night with lucy his father babe and his russian mailorder stepmother irina werent at home and he felt a tickle of relief he didnt feel like talking to anyone in his small kitchen whit poured himself a glass of ice water then flopped on the couch wanting to get back to lucy but grateful for the peaceful quiet of the moment he propped his feet up on the table hed head over to lucys in a few get to bed early if lucy let him tomorrow was friday the long annoying haul of juvenile court his least favorite judicial chore and then hed his bedroom door was shut he never left it shut in the little house in the summer the window units froze a closed room into a miniature antarctica and left the other rooms stickywarm you had to be careful sometimes the door old and a little warped closed on its own if he brushed past it the wrong way whit went to the door and listened to the rattle and hum of the overtaxed window unit he opened the door his bedroom was as hed left it when hed last slept in it the night patch died books stacked next to the bedside phone bed made in haste dirty clothes in a tidy pile ready for his saturday laundry duty closet door shut he went to the closet opened it clothes hung in neat lines a cavalcade of uglybright tropical print shirts in the corner was his computer and a small desk he used for work at home with a few file folders and the texas civil practice books nothing gone but the room felt subtly shifted as though every item was just a hair out of place he went through his files his drawers glanced under the bed nothing was missing but the files on his desk were in two stacks instead of one the books on his desk were leaning and he hated that the room had been searched he felt the odd tingly linger of an intruder in his space he went back to his front door the lock appeared whole and unscratched he checked his spare key still hidden under the porchs neglected potted fern he inspected the windows a back window wasnt locked and he couldnt remember when if he had unlocked it he locked the window went back to the den refilled his water glass he tried calling claudia salazar at home wanting a shoulder to bitch on about david power no answer he tried goochs cell phone no answer either gooch was still presumably en route to new orleans so who was in your house he checked every room maybe he had bumped the door the last time he left and it had shut on its own maybe david talking to him about lucy about what he didnt know her inheritance her debts made him paranoid christ what else about her life didnt he know maybe she was embarrassed maybe she was ashamed it was time to get david off lucy time to find evidence that would point elsewhere david was competent but not imaginative he might dismiss patch wanting secret funding of a hundred thousand or the skeletons found with the bodies they could be little fringe elements that had nothing to do with the heart of the case and gooch looking for this alex in new orleans might lead nowhere fast so what else did he have the name on the bottle the guy suzanne mentioned as interested in buying black jack point whit took his drink and sat down at his computer he logged onto the internet opened a search engine and did a search for stoney vaughn results were few a couple of articles in the corpus paper an article in some highflier financial magazine whit had never heard of hed risen fast in the investment world the kind of quotable grandstander the press loved scrappy son of shrimpers killed when he was at the university of texas where hed gone on a full scholarship economics and history degree mba from stanford worked for a venture capital firm in silicon valley for a while took a hit in the dotcom bust came back to texas and apparently started phoning the social register to get clients the newspaper article included a picture averagelooking confident hair a shade too glossy a hint of gut cool confident the kind of young man the numerous wealthy old ladies of the coast liked to have handle their money not much else another link on the corpus christi callertimes site when hed opened his office another when hed built that monstrosity of a mansion out on the copano flats a link to something called the laffite league he clicked on the link a simple web site opened with an old portrait of a rakish man who wore a broad mustache and looked every inch the gentleman robber underneath the portrait was the text the laffite league explores and celebrates jean laffite the great pirate of the gulf one of the most unusual and mysterious figures in american history membership is open to all at dues of year we have chapters in new orleans galveston and corpus christi with a total membership over we are academics historians teachers students businesspeople jet pilots nurses retirees anyone interested in the days of old we sponsor trips to galveston grande terre and other sites to explore laffite history and also offer a quarterly newsletter on all matters laffiterelated below the statement were links to newsletter archives an online forum for laffite discussion and sites for historical research and below that a list of officers of the league with stoney vaughn as president of the corpus christi chapter he searched through the rest of the site no mention of patch gilbert a fan club for a dead pirate an overdue book about laffite skeletons arid stoney vaughn giver of whiskey buyer of land whose name kept sidling into view whit clicked back to the newsletter articles wondering if there was much discussion about buried treasure he found none this was all straight wellfootnoted history the articles ranged from detailed analyses of the battle of new orleans during the war of where laffite played a key role to speculation of laffites ultimate fate several of the articles were attributed to a writer named jason salinger and the short bio at the end of each minutely researched piece indicated jason was a freelance writer working in port leo texas he looked up jason salinger in the phone book not listed he could track him down tomorrow he saw through his window his father moving in the soft glow of the kitchen lights in the big house and headed up there you want me to change the locks babe mosley said after whit explained just as a precaution daddy why on earth would anyone be breaking in and then not taking anything babe sipped from a cup of decaf still a big man at sixty his face creased and handsome i dont know but id feel better if you changed the locks ill call the locksmith tomorrow he lowered his cup you staying out with lucy again yes come stay here she wants to be at patchs house and i dont want her to be alone i wish yall would just stay here babe said id sure sleep better were fine halfway up toward black jack point he thought why wait see if stoney vaughns at home tonight ask him about the gilberts he drove past the point toward copano flats looking for a bigass mansion stoney had only managed to keep alex from shooting him outright by saying i dont know what youre talking about with the emerald but these guys are going to be here soon and we got to deal with them first i looked at it closely its not real alexs voice was low and precise and getting impatient the eyes looking a little bloodshot i didnt know you were an emerald expert where is it youre not supposed to have a key for both locks we agreed you fucking stole from me and youre going to chide me alex his tone disbelieving shook his head the gun in his hand pointing at the carpet for the moment i didnt steal from you stoney glanced back out at the bay oh god here they come but it wasnt jupiter it was a smaller fishing trawler idling along the near edge of the bay the eye please im not helping you with danny and his boys if you dont cough it up listen i took it to protect it really hows that like he couldnt wait to hear the details danny look he knows weve done the dig hes in the area hes seen the papers about black jack point and the murders he knows weve got the eye he might find out where wed hidden it he took refuge in outrage listen you had a key i didnt know about were even we are so fucking not even alexs gun came up centered on stoneys chest if anything happens to me stoney said there are tape recordings of our conversations over the past couple of months about patch gilbert about the laffite treasure the devils eye your little fuckup in new orleans multiple copies hidden in multiple places in multiple forms tape sound file a couple of ways you might never guess but sure to be found if i go missing or die alex im not jimmy im not dumb youre bluffing you wouldnt take that chance of fucking yourself over i might for insurance ive always been overinsured alex put the gun down turned and walked out of the office where you going stoney said he followed alex down into the big white living room full of old nautical maps on the walls thick leatherbound tomes of history alex knelt by the stone fireplace opened a decorative cylinder of long matches next to the equally decorative stone fireplace the match was about nine inches long it could burn for a while and you wouldnt singe your fingertips he took the cylinder back to where stoney stood at the bottom of the steps punched him hard in the mouth stoneys lip split he fell back a little dribble of blood and snot smearing on his chin uhhhng stoney said alex grabbed the front of his shirt shoved him back onto the stairs insurance alex said can be fucking expensive stoney spat blood i cant believe you hit me you shit but a little quaver in his voice gave him away alex slapped stoney lightly almost playfully you steal the eye from me you call me tell me dannys got your brother and wants to make a trade for the eye so what we give them the fake eye to save your brother and i never know the real eyes gone its sort of half clever like youd let me give danny the eye im not that stupid you never would he mopped at his nose you heard dannys friends on the phone i did im not impressed you could have friends i dont know about stoney playing a phone prank of sorts all designed to fool me he grabbed stoney by the throat wheres the eye i wont alex ran the match tip unlit underneath stoneys eyebrows along the rim of his ear does it tickle oh god no stoney said please i dont want to burn you alex struck the match along the wall it flamed into life but i will start with this then ill drag you down to your dock get some gasoline worked in good on you kick it up a notch oh mary mother of god no stoney sobbed where is it stoney watched the fire the eyes on the boat my boat thats where i hid it dannys got it he dont even know it and theyre coming here yes please you can get it then alex blew out the match it was now close to eight i dont think the bad guys are showing up stoney alex watched the empty dock from the kitchens bay window the stars had begun to glimmer in the dying summer twilight i think weve been stood up jesus they said they would bring my brother for the money after they killed danny you dont look good man christ stoney reached for the whiskey bottle took a tiny sip alex watched tiny sips didnt hurt until youd taken a hundred of them i think stone man you need to prepare yourself for bad news i think these guys killed your brother and this girl of his thats why theyre not showing up cant get the cash for a corpse stoney let out a blubbery sigh now danny hes out there somewhere stoney looked up at him his face as blank as a new blackboard lets say dannys still alive but hes lost his bargaining chips cause maybe these fuckheads killed your brother and his girl so hes got to go somewhere hes gonna try to get at you again hed rather have the treasure than you in jail if its one or the other he can hardly accuse you of murder if hes done the same now so where would danny go i dont know hes got friends around here you know him stoney no no one i can think of other folks in the laffite league some in corpus maybe hes not wellliked people think hes nuts ah you start making some phone calls the doorbell rang stoney froze by the phone not a word alex pulled his gun from the back of his pants pressed the barrel beneath stoneys eye or i will kill you and whoevers on the porch you understand not not a word stoney said in a broken voice alex hurried to the front door quietly he peered through the peephole some guy blondish tall standing on the porch looking around his head a little rounder from the distortion of the glass wearing a bright orange tropical shirt alex moved back from the peephole the doorbell rang again a knock followed alex waited he peeked through a living room window barely edging back the closed curtain and saw the guy in the driveway talking on his cell phone then clicking off the phone a knock again on the door doorbell ringing mr vaughn whit mosley im the jp here i can tell youre home would you please open up alex waited a few more knocks after about five minutes whit mosley climbed into a ford explorer and roared off stoney walked back into the foyer alex put the gun on him a jps a judge right whys he here probably to tell me my brothers body has been found stoney said his voice sounded a lot more even theyd call and it wouldnt be a judge i dont know and i dont care stoney said put that gun down i cant talk to you with it in my face youre not in a position to make demands youve lied to me we agreed wed rebury the treasure on the land you bought out at the point discover it together as laffites treasure make a mint get famous alex said you dont give a shit about that alex stoney said not about the fame you just want the treasure but we can both get what we want we need to work together stop fucking each other over between the murders and now danny everythings gone south im making a drink and we can talk he turned and went back into the kitchen alex lowered the gun and followed him wheres the courage coming from alex asked stoney poured a thin film of bourbon into a glass topped it off with ice water from knowing im going to make a great deal with you so deal alex never enjoyed killing but he thought he would really like killing stoney even if it was one bullet and quick like snapping your fingers first we have to find danny and find my brother this whole kidnapping shticks not a fake i swear alex it isnt you cant take the risk that its not he gulped at his drink danny could screw us both over end it for us easy hes nuts hes not going to behave like a normal human being alex took a deep breath so we sit and wait i dont start calling around to laffite leaguers showing an interest in him theyd remember that later so get patient hes going to call no way hes not going to see this through we wait here together you can kill him when he shows up me why not you its your fucking brother he took because youre good at offense im better at defense stoney put down his drink and heres how we both stay happy im willing to give you threequarters of the gold and silver you can melt it down or sell the coins on the market i keep the rest and the eye that i rebury on the land dig back up have my glory as the only discoverer of actual buried pirate treasure in history were both happy and we dont commit mutually assured destruction trying to fuck the other over stoney said alex tented his cheek with his tongue what about your brother and this cop girlfriend theyll have killed her my brother he can be reasoned with your brother might talk alex said my brother will never have to work again if he doesnt want to stoney said you dont worry about him now you can play tough try to rough me up some more and completely fuck yourself over or you can crash here with me and see if danny shows up tonight and then were home free whats it gonna be alex crossed his arms i dont sleep on couches gooch thought the bayou mee was appropriately named as the two girls near its parking lot might say buy you me the tulane avenue opencourt motel was grimy the dive more residence than family fun stopover it was a few blocks from the new orleans criminal courts building and nearby were several bail bond businesses and gooch wondered if maybe the bayou mee catered to those recently released from jail hed seen two women go from the darkened parking lot to rooms with new friends and return in a half hour but they werent shimmying hotpanted rears on the street corner rather the two looked more like regular girls tshirts and denim shorts just hanging out in the motel lot gossiping and maybe if you knew the password youd get a date gooch spotted one police cruiser go by not even tap on its brakes late thursday night the girls not too busy yet hed paid for his room and said im looking for a friend of mine whats her name alex dont know an alex you know a man named alex gooch laid a fifty on the desk you know any alex at all whats he look like the clerk was a bony kid dirtyblond hair sullen his nose pierced with a thin hoop of gold he scooped the bill into his jeans pocket alex was here about a month ago but whats he look like names dont matter much here he might have had some phone calls back to texas on his bill does that ring a bell you a cop do cops give money for answering questions sure sometimes im not a cop or a pi alex dont ring a bell most of the guys here have classier names than alex like bubba or hoss or john he laughed thanks gooch said think about it he went back to his room started watching the girls a truck pulled in the taller girl leaned down chatted laughed the shorter girl walked over to a plastic crate two doors down from gooch sat lit a cigarette gooch opened the door walked past her she glanced at him made a little frown he fed coins into a decrepit coke machine its broke she called to him his coins rattled in the machine works good enough to take money he said my friend told me this was a real nice place to stay and here you cant even get a sody pop he glanced at her grinned she grinned back whos your friend she asked you know alex i dont believe ive had the pleasure she flicked ash off her cigarette how about a guy named jimmy bird nope you sure have a lot of friends she said dont you ive always been popular because i see the best in people he stood near her she glanced at his face which wasnt ever going to make a girl smile she looked at his worn jeans his gray tshirt scuffed boots trying to make if he was a cop the alex im looking for might be in texas now better than here she was looking down at the ashes at her feet stubbing at them with her sandal any alexes ever work here no she said alex might have stayed here a month ago for at least two days maybe more i said i dont know an al but her voice broke off and she looked back up at him with fear and a bit of confusion as though shed just understood a joke she stood whats your name he asked i got to go alex isnt a friend hed seen fear in her face now but i want to find him or her baby i love chatting but any more of my time you pay how much for an hour of your time seventyfive i just want to talk to you gooch said costs the same he nodded we should go to my room i got some comfort there i could use a drink her room was on the opposite side of the court the window missing plywood up in its place she said her name was helen and she made them both drinks sprite and southern comfort in little plastic cups she didnt have ice cubes and the sprite was a little warm youre quite the hostess gooch said he gave her the seventyfive bucks all of it she counted it and sat down i said something that scared you he said alex i dont know but i know an albert exley that was the name he used here i called him al cause i dont like albert as a name thats close to alex isnt it he was here about a month ago whats he look like wiry way stronger than he looks wears glasses brown hair about six one i saw him come in here i figured all i need another social worker trying to get me to work at popeyes chicken or a jesus freak helen sipped from her cup gooch thought she couldnt be more than twentyfive already faded her skin pale and her hair a dark lank yeah hes a social worker like hitler was what did he do you a cop no im a concerned citizen someone needs to concern albert exleys ass off the street she pointed at the plywood he put me through that window she raised her arm and he could see a web of healing scar threaded along her skin tore up my arms my back bad and im practically his girlfriend explain hes here for four or five days i cant figure him out why a guy looks like a professor is here he hires me a couple of times a day like hes passing the time she shrugged i kept feeling he wasnt just hanging out here he was in new orleans on important business of some sort but i know better than to ask just keep my mouth shut well open but you know what i mean she laughed gooch wanted to give her a greyhound ticket say just go somewhere else and start over and dont do this anymore shed look at him like he was one of the jesus freaks were getting along fine one day hes gone most of the day most of the night comes back in a bad mood i think hes been nice ill see if i can relax him this was his room then not mine so i do him how he likes and he gets in the shower he says i can watch tv if i want cause theres not a tv in my room and he knows im not gonna bother his wallet his cell phone rings when he shuts off the shower and so i click it on thinking ill just hand it to al be cute and a guy calling starts yelling all panicked im telling the guy to calm down and suddenly albert yanks the phone out of my hand listens then throws me through the window im lying there naked bleeding like nobodys business he grabs his stuff jumps in his car hes gone she shook her head cops looked for him but i guess not too hard i dont pay taxes so i dont pay their salaries jerry the owner he makes me move into this room says it was my fault the window got busted cheap asshole wont put in a new window yet and its too hot helen looked ready to cry ill speak with jerry youll have a new window gooch said she stared up at him the caller what was he upset about she shrugged i wasnt sure i had trouble remembering real clear after i went through the window i lost too much blood but when i think about it i think he was saying something like you dumb fuck you got the wrong guy she finished her drink you dont want to mess with albert hes nuts hed kill a person over answering the phone when i find him gooch said ill put him through a window for you thats sweet but you better grab him from behind helen said and despite the sticky heat she gave a shiver dont let that man see you coming you dont get no second chance with him whit left copano flats driving through the soft scrubby land turning back onto the main highway as night took real hold heading south again toward black jack point stoney vaughn was either shy or rude whit was sure someone was at home the lights on in the house the porsche and the beige van in the driveway just the sense hed gotten of an eye behind the door maybe thered been a girlfriend over hed try again in the morning hed tried gooch again while waiting to see if someone came to the door no answer all problems for tomorrow he decided too tired and jumpy to think go to lucy have an honest talk about davids claims go to sleep when he walked into patchs house lucy was sitting in a fat armchair her knees pulled up to her chin suzanne gilbert sat across from her an empty wineglass at her elbow roy krantz lounged on the couch hi suzanne said hi judge roy said no warmth not surprising you took a while lucy said im sorry i had court business whats wrong what isnt lucy mopped at her face with her sleeve suzanne and i are discussing the land selling it i think its a bit too early for that patch isnt even buried yet oh god he thought lucy hasnt told them

to upset you he stood cmon suzanne whit walked them out to their car i forgive her suzanne said the innuendo she wasnt thinking straight sure whit said theres not going to be any more silly accusations right roy said weve got it straight now thats between you and lucy whit said to suzanne ignoring roy they left he went back inside sat on the arm of lucys chair slid his arm behind her thin shoulders she leaned into him turned her face up for a kiss one then another the glue is gone she said with patch gone suzy q and i are not quite so sweet to each other did you argue with them no she said but suzanne feels betrayed she doesnt understand why i mentioned her money troubles but she didnt yell at me i wish she wouldve thrown a vase at me this will get better with time lucy he sat on the ottoman at her feet took both her hands in his is there anything you want to tell me im not up for another firing squad tonight lucy said i rode in to corpus with david for the autopsy reports oh her voice went small he and i had a talk about you do you want to tell me anything whit asked again his voice soft no im too embarrassed about your debt or the lawsuits lucy im not mad but i sure wish you had told me she didnt move do you bring your hearings home whit not unless theyre funny well i keep my business separate from our time together too i knew i shouldnt have mentioned suzannes gambling this is just bad karma piling up on me how bad is your debt lucy im okay business picked up last month how bad fifty sixty thousand i can get a bridge loan phone entertainment is a growth industry have you really been sued david power needs a doughnut in that mouth she said yes a woman whose old mother called all the time she was nutty but she had a nice aura and so the girls helped her no one was trying to take advantage of her but i had to settle out of court its fine she stared at him im sorry i didnt tell you but whit youre a politician barely youre still an elected official i didnt want you to be embarrassed dump me thanks for the vote of confidence he said he kept her hands in his david says you inherit everything thats what he says she shook her head you dont know theres a message in there to call patchs lawyer but theres a ton of calls i havent called them back yet apparently suzanne gets nothing no that cant be right patch probably didnt want his money gambled away and he loved you lucy she made a noise in her throat covered her face with her hands that makes me look worse though to the police davids blowing smoke right now you ever hear of a guy named stoney vaughn she blinked the rich guy with the big house up the bay i dont know him just heard of him patch ever mention him she blinked again i dont think so whit what you believe me dont you i didnt know about the will patch never said i believe you lucy she leaned into his arm and they stayed that way silent for several minutes the ticking of the den clock and the soft hum of lucys breathing the only sounds could you make love to me she said in a quiet whisper im a wreck and youre all that makes me feel good right now if you dont mind making love to wrecks he kissed her slow and she kissed him back tentative at first then harder surer they went up to the guest bedroom lucy stripped him first opening his shirt sliding off his pants kissing his mouth neck shoulders chest pausing just long enough for him to ease her out of her tshirt and shorts her bra and little red panties they slid onto the cool of the sheets and when he entered her she clung to him fingers and mouth and nails and toes with a fierceness that made his skin sing they rested in each others arms for a while then she kissed him deeply her fingertips exploring the length of him seeing if he might stir again whit yeah he said in a thick voice lying against the sheets while she took his measure how much is the estate do you know if showing an interest in the money doesnt make david power indict me automatically i dont know lucy if its enough i think ill shut down the coastal psychics network she said its been nothing but a headache so what will you do this all day she straddled him and guided him into her the second time was even better they were less tense and they rode the wave together is that a job offer he said when he had his breath back laughing liking the feel of her warm breath against his chest im so the boss of you already she said love you love you im safe with you arent i always babe finally she slept whit stared at the ceiling tired spent ashamed for the millisecond of doubt hed allowed himself to feel he drifted off into heavy sleep and it seemed two seconds later the phone rang whit grabbed it trying not to shift and wake lucy the digital clock on the bedside gleamed i hello whit whispered judge mosley david yeah we found jimmy bird dead part two here there be dragons there are few things as powerful as treasure once it fastens itself on the mind joseph conrad the raw smell arose near a thick growth of oaks whit stood upwind of the grove it was twothirty friday morning a couple of summerhouse kids looking for a less crowded makeout spot had found the battered winch truck nestled at the edge of the live oaks just beyond the western city limits of port leo away from the busyness of the beaches and the harbor jimmy birds body lay curled on the seat the bullet hole in his temple surrounded by a directcontact mottled bruise from the gun the gun a caliber lay on the truck floor below jimmys dangling hand the dps crimescene crew pulled the body from the truck after their initial photographing and scene work whit filled out an authorization of autopsy form david finally came up to whit to countersign the authorization i suppose this wraps things up judge david scribbled his name across the sheet below whits signature yeah whit said get the doubt out of your voice theres a note in jimmys shirt pocket reads im sorry for what i did monday broken shovel in the back of the pickup and these were in his pants pocket david pulled a plastic baggie from a paper bag laid it flat on his palm turned his flashlight onto his hand a half dozen coins roughly cut clearly old a shield capping one a mans head crowned with laurels decorating another one silver the rest gold these look old whit said holy shit i was right lets not jump to conclusions your honor maybe patch had a coin collection we dont know jimmy might have stolen these from the house lucy never mentioned patch collecting coins neither did he found cash and patchs credit cards in the glove compartment hes got to be the guy who did the breakin this doesnt have to be complicated whit leaned in examined the coins through the plastic theres a date see this ones good god yeah and i know where youre going back to this buriedtreasure horseshit whit lowered his voice to a whisper david look dont think of this as buried treasure see it from another angle its archaeology if there were professors out on black jack point doing a dig for artifacts and they got killed and dumped there youd have to consider people stealing those artifacts as a possible motive right david nodded well maybe this was just a dig we didnt know about that no one knew about david didnt nod just shook his head so david maybe jimmy had accomplices and if these coins are part of a treasure wheres the rest of it david spat into the grass why are you resistant to this im not about to go in front of the press or let sheriff hollis go in front of the press and say those people got murdered over buried treasure david said christ if that wasnt the case wed be fucking laughed out of town no way are we going public with this lets just be real quiet about it right now see what else we learn it was as much as whit could hope for but well find out how much these coins are worth right yes obviously i suspect they may be worth quite a bit whit said jimmy couldnt have been depressed over being broke maybe dr parkers colleague the one who identified the other relics her name was dominguez right she might know about coins you let me worry about that i want to confirm if birds tire tracks match the tracks we found on the gilbert property and i want to see if theres any extra fingerprints on that truck or gun lets go wake the widow judge he shook his head much as i dont like linda bird i dont want to tell her that her husbands dead when he got back to patchs lucy was awake curled on the couch in a robe watching the bargains unfold on the home shopping network he told her what had happened but i dont think jimmy bird killed them he said at the end she sat up christ whit david powers been breathing down my neck he finds the killer and now youre going to debate him what the hell is it between you two he told her about the coins in jimmys pocket they look old very rare gold and silver why would he have those lucy folded her hands in her lap and said after a moment patch had some old coins you never mentioned that well we dont usually discuss my uncles heirlooms i didnt know he was a coin collector he wasnt he got them from his dad i think i dont really remember he said once they were valuable he didnt keep them out in the change plate whit he had them in a drawer in his study how would jimmy know where they were i have no idea maybe he made patch tell him where they were maybe he knew from when he worked here before i dont know her voice rose got an edge okay lucy okay did he have them insured she stared i dont fucking believe this whitman you dont believe me i do i dont know if he had them insured jesus that jimmy goddamn him uncle patch never should have hired him in the first place she got up went into the kitchen whit followed her watched her pour a glass of water pick at a cookie from the many comfort plates on the kitchen table he killed them then im glad hes dead theres nothing more to be done tonight lets go back to bed fine okay she gulped down her water in bed he spooned next to her his arm over her listening to her breathe he could hear she wasnt falling asleep whit yeah im sorry i snapped at you this has all been upsetting im sorry too i thought finding out who did this to them would make me feel better probably not right away hon i just need you to not be trying to oneup david power its not about a competition im trying to help you do you think david sucks as an investigator no i really dont but i think he abuses his power i think hes hurt about his life hes mad at the world and hes a spoiler he knows how to push my buttons only works if you allow them to be pushed she rose up on one elbow youve got a confession from a dead guy with a motive please stop pushing please i cant take it anymore i want this over and done okay i can tell when youre not sincere and it has nothing to do with vibes im serious whit i want you to stop okay she settled back into his arms he didnt give an answer and finally he heard her sleep only then did he close his eyes and let himself drift away and in his sleep his breathing matched hers lucy decided to put in a day at work and whit not due at court for two hours followed her into port leo early friday morning was not phonejamming rush hour at coastal psychics network the little office was squeezed in between a grimy doughnut shop and a grimier liquor store in an old strip shopping center that had never seen better days two bored college students sat on duty at the phones a black woman reading a physics textbook chewing on the end of her highlighter and a white woman watching today hi yall slow night lucy asked as they walked in yeah the first woman looked up from her textbook people just dont have problems like they used to she slipped a tarot card into her textbook shut the book itll pick up the other psychic said were moving into the bored housewives hours there was an embarrassed silence were sorry about your uncle lucy thanks amanda you dont want to talk amanda said its okay i sensed that in your aura let me know if you want a reading later she glanced at whit oh dear isnt someones aura a little thin today the two phone psychics looked at him looked at each other then back at whit youre the disbelieving boyfriend amanda said in more ways than one lucy said but not sounding mad anymore man ditch your negativity the black woman said its an anchor on your soul i think i like being weighed down whit said its not insurmountable negativity amanda said you have a beautiful spirit you just need a cleansing influence some healing crystal treatments should clear you up people pay a buck twentynine a minute to hear this crap he thought but he smiled and gave the peace sign the two psychics frowned cmon back to my office whit lucy said she hustled to the back to a small office she had a foil mobile hanging from the ceiling an assortment of thick multicolored crystals and sculptures on a shelf above the desk books on esp the tarot and guerrilla marketing on a table she shut the door baby after everything else i dont need you upsetting the employees they started it they did not they read you like a book these are very sensitive sweet girls and there you stand thinking how stupid all this is they can tell you know you didnt read my mind i know you think this is bullshit but it isnt to me to amanda and lachelle to our customers okay she was being loud and for a minute he wondered if it was for the womens benefit okay he took her in his arms i love you does my aura show that yes actually it does she kissed his cheek i love you too tons beyond tons she hugged him hard thisll all be over soon wont it yes can we go away then for a week just us maybe mexico hawaii disney world i dont care sure lucy you pick no she said you pick and then ill read it in the cards ill prove this works deal he said he left letting her think he was headed to court jason salinger at first glance reminded whit of a lawn gnome he was short bearded with apple cheeks and fat pink lips surrounded by a thick beard he wore a tshirt that read footnote fetish jason said dont knock over any of my books easier said than done whit followed jason into a dingy living room converted into a library books tottered against a computer desk more books covered the sofa and lay scattered across the floor youre a big reader then whit stepped over a smaller stack of books and took a seat on the corner of jasons sofa jason looked at whit as though he were mentally damaged why yes i am any books on social skills whit nearly asked but instead he smiled excuse him hes a bear in the morning jasons wife said cute and plump dressed in faded jeans and a blue tshirt she was as sweet as he was dour arent you sugar pop jason made a strangled noise of agreement would you like some coffee judge mosley no maam thank you ive already filled the tank for the day whit said ill have a cup please jason said you know what the doctor said about you and caffeine she patted jasons shoulder gave whit a maternal wink although he guessed she was six or seven years younger than he was ill let you boys talk then whit noticed the headless pirate in the corner not headless but an old tailors mannequin just the bodys form with a fancy blue coat a red sash under the jacket grayish pants a sword and a revolver they looked genuine hung off the mannequin jason swiveled a chair away from his computer desk and sat facing whit the salingers house was in an older slightly untidy section of port leo the lawn looked untended the furniture in the house fresh from the consignment store but the books in jasons work area were fat expensive hardbacks lots of them and his computer system was a topoftheline model what can i help you with judge i understand youve done a lot of research on jean laffite i do freelance magazine writing substitute teaching some book editing for a couple of very small presses but laffites your own particular interest sure gonna go to grad school in another year or so write the definitive book on laffite one day probably get a doctorate with a focus on gulf history be able to teach anywhere from texas to florida that way i dont do cold winters well im interested in the laffite league this has something to do with patch gilbert right why do you ask well he came to the last chapter meeting in corpus in may i figured he was interested in joining sorry to hear about him getting killed you knew patch no i just met him that one time at the meeting he was a friendly guy introduced himself to everyone you dont forget a name like patch lets talk about the league first what exactly is it i can slice the laffite league into three groups for you the vast majority are people with a strong interest in history perfectly nice and respectable then there are those who are interested in the legends of buried treasure although theres never been anything other than old rumor to say laffite buried his gold instead of spending it but those folks have seen the movies like the buccaneer and they think laffite is yul brynner as a romancenovel swashbuckler he swiveled on his chair then there are the very small but fascinating subset of wackos a few have claimed to be laffite descendants and have forged journals and documents to sell to the gullible or to try to live off the name dangerous wacko or amusing wacko amusing theres a guy who calls himself danny laffite its not his real name nutcase in louisiana says hes laffites greatgreatgreatgreatgrand whatever but harmless he tricked some guy in houston into paying ten thousand for letters supposedly written by laffite to andrew jackson fakes obviously he ended up giving the money back and avoided prosecution hes in the laffite league was they revoked his membership forgers dont make for trustworthy historians what about all these legends of buried treasure whit asked jason shrugged theres no evidence laffite buried an ounce of gold along the coast but the rumors persist treasure means glamour adventure instant wealth attained in an interesting way as opposed to the boredom of work romantic money sure we all read or saw treasure island as kids we all want to be jim hawkins outwitting long john silver and finding the gold jason said long john silver the only fictional murderer i can think of with a fastfood chain named after him the truth is less romantic than the fiction whit said jason jerked his head toward the mannequin every year i dress up in that costume pretend to be laffite go to the schools and tell them the stories the kids want to hear about laffite being a moviestyle pirate storming ships cutlass in hand saving fair damsels on bloodsoaked decks thats all crap laffite dodged taxes sent out other captains to capture ships dealt more in slaves and cotton than in gold was careful not to attack american shipping because that meant trouble so he preyed on everyone else more administrator than swashbuckler and coldblooded a few months before he left galveston a hurricane devastated the island not enough food for the thousand people living there laffites solution was simple round up every black on galveston slave and free and sell them in the underground louisiana slave market even the free black women who were married to laffites men all hauled onto ships the wives screaming for their husbands to save them laffite shot anyone who resisted fewer people to feed fresh money in the coffers to rebuild after the storm simple and brutal but you admire him i admire his decisiveness jason salinger said were a much less decisive world now we analyze we agonize we secondguess laffite never had that luxury maybe one day ill write a book for business managers business by laffite you know you find different avenues to make your money these days as an academic got to go mainstream so where did laffite keep all his money there were no banks in galveston then and presumably a legitimate bank wouldnt touch him he probably laundered money and gold back into the banks in new orleans he had the best lawyers in new orleans working for him and he and his brother pierre filed bankruptcy saying they had very little but of course mobsters today have hidden under that same cloak but any accounts would have always been in danger from the us government if they suspected an account was laffites theydve seized it right jason frowned but nodded a large map of the texas coast was pinned above the computer whit stood and studied it indulge me lets just say over the years laffite amasses a tidy fortune in gold at least enough to get him started over if he abandons galveston or his new orleans accounts get seized or maybe he makes a few big captures right before hes forced out of galveston he cant go into port in new orleans hell be arrested as a pirate if he steps on us soil right yes jason said hed have been arrested if he set foot in america his forces had already annoyed the navy by attacking an american merchant ship although hed executed the captain responsible what finally empowered the american government to kick him out of galveston was the capture of one of his ships le brave during an attack on a spanish ship le braves captain had papers that outlined the division of booty written in laffites hand with his signature it was the smoking gun the navy needed so laffites on the run hes got no place to go if hes transporting gold he stands to lose it if hes stopped or attacked right he was given a document guaranteeing safe passage by the us navy to leave the gulf they wouldnt have bothered him but that wouldnt protect him from the spanish right or any other country whose ships he attacked jason frowned no it wouldnt but pirates really didnt bury treasure very often thats way more treasure island than common practice i mean its accepted that captain kidd buried a treasure up in new england but its never been found but maybe laffites got a better chance for longterm survival burying this treasure just for a few weeks or months than hauling it around a gulf sailed by navies who are pissed at him and risk losing everything hes a man without a country put yourself in his shoes where would you bury it jason stared at him as though wanting to ask a question but didnt he ran a finger along the curve of the coast on his wall map not galveston or bolivar far too risky to be caught by an american patrol making sure he didnt return to the area to set up shop again maybe further south or north his finger moved south along the map laffite had camps up and down the coast for sure in matagorda bay and on st joseph island did he have a camp on st leo bay jason glanced at him then back at the map legend says that he did but no trace has ever been found maybe he wanted to erase the trace of himself here whit said if i had buried gold i wouldnt have my name right over it in big letters his camps werent fancy just shelters if he or his men needed to get ashore say in a storm or to hide from other ships just four walls and a spare cannon maybe and one assumes if he buried the treasure he would mark it or come back for it quickly if he could sure so what happened to laffite after he left galveston no one knows there were a variety of reports he might have died might have gone to cuba or to mexico recently its been theorized he died in south america as a freedom fighter he smiled people are always trying to redeem pirates we like them too much to remember theyre murdering thieves so possibly he could have been kept from retrieving a treasure killed or imprisoned possibly sure we dont know with complete certainty what happened to him do the legends get specific about where this st leo bay camp might be whit asked some say copano flats some say black jack point obviously old black jack believed laffite had been there you know about him just that he was a crazy old hermit lived out on the point from the civil war until about i dont know if he was black or his name was jack i think the point mustve gotten its name from the blackjack oaks that grow there and maybe the name stuck to him too he claimed hed sailed with laffite as a boy and laffite was coming back to the point gonna kill everyone in port leo because theyd taken his gold loony he sure thought there was a treasure he dug up enough of the point i guess the gilbert family theyve had that land for ever tolerated him sad though a whole life dedicated to greed wouldnt you say that was laffites life as well yeah youre right except for saving new orleans which was pretty cool jason raised an eyebrow again you going to tell me about why youre asking all these semiloaded questions im trying to get a feel for patchs life in his final weeks everything we discuss jason remains confidential im conducting an official death inquest man youre covering your ass whit shook his head we have no indication that patch had found any antiquities or relics of any sort that was true patch hadnt maybe others had i would hate for a bunch of rumors to get started have people stampeding around on that land like a bunch of black jacks when the gilbert and tran families are grieving of course not jason said i dont get off on rumors ill keep my mouth shut but if theres a story theres not i asked about treasure pretty much out of curiosity its what people first think of with laffite and i knew patch had this new interest in him nothing more jason didnt look convinced so whit shifted gears again you know stoney vaughn sure hes the president of the corpus chapter of the laffite league friend of yours no cat litter has more brains than stoney hes all into the treasure hunter mystique hes financed treasure dives in the florida keys where a lot of the spanish galleons wrecked over the years tried to finance a partnership to dive on galleon wrecks down off padre but the state blocked him the texas historical commission they hate treasure hunters any treasure in state waters or buried on public land is theirs by law and they make sure you dont dive without their approval he finances treasure hunts whit kept his voice flat yeah well in florida lot more wrecks there in the shallows along the keys i think he might have been in the group that financed barry clifford diving on whydah up off cape cod thats the only sunken pirate ship ever recovered they got a shitload of gold silver and jewels off it at least stoney likes to talk big about it he paid for a trip for about a dozen of the leaguers last year to go to yucatan see the town where laffites brother died were stoney and patch buddies dont think they knew each other but they probably met at the meeting jason said okay now you got me hooked you ask about laffites treasure and then you ask about a guy who does treasure hunts if theres anything to say ill give you the exclusive story but dont hold your breath and if you say a thing too early no story jason raised an eyebrow okay are there any other treasurehunter types around here or in the laffite league stoney did have a friend who came along on the yucatan trip a guy he knew from florida allen eck i think his name was yeah looked like a professor comes across as very cool but jesus what an asshole we were taking a tour of merida a small town down there the tour guide was telling about laffite history but got a couple of really minor details wrong i mean most people would never know allen told him he was wrong very quietly and the guide firmly said no he was right maybe just thinking allens some dumb tourist ill never forget the look allen gave him just beyond cold like this poor stupid guide wasnt worth a roachs ass but he didnt say anything more next day they find the tour guide in an alleyway both arms broken face a solid bruise nose broken guy wouldnt say who attacked him either he didnt see or he was too scared jason shook his head i know its crazy but i kept thinking maybe allen beat up that man stoney tossed all night like he slept on rocks lying on a blanket in front of the big french doors leading to the dock hed switched all the lights on along the dock waiting no boats came out of the night alex got comfortable at the dinner table gun in front of him reading a thick book on seventeenthcentury asian piracy hed found on stoneys shelves making noises of agreement and disapproval as he scanned the pages finally hed fallen asleep he awoke once to hear alex talking quietly on a cell phone he heard alex say fine i agree then nothing more but the sound of alex clicking off his phone he played possum felt alexs gaze go along his back stoney didnt go to sleep again for a while but the whiskey hed drunk earlier caught up with him and he drifted off he awoke at seven his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth his back a solid ache along the dock the lights still gleamed no boat no danny dead or alive he got up went into the kitchen no alex he should have felt relief he knew alex wanted to kill him last night wanted to burn his face instead he felt panic at alexs absence where the hell was he and if danny or his gang showed up while alex was gone he went to the phone no messages he called the satellite phone system on jupiter no answer he turned on the television watched the friday morning local news no reports of a millionaires brother kidnapped at sea nothing on a missing boat or ben and claudias bodies washing ashore he heard the front door open hurried to the foyer saw alex coming in closing the door behind him where the hell have you been they show no where were you attending to some business alex dusted his hands you can cook right eggs bacon black coffee i need some protein what business alex alexs mood seemed ominously good he patted stoneys cheek they may not be coming danny and his friends must have lost their nerve or maybe danny killed his buddies or he killed ben stoney said hes got nothing to bargain with except an accusation against me that wont hold up alex went into the kitchen washed his hands this girlfriend of bens the cop yes maybe she took them all out shes one person and a woman a gun and the knowledge and will to use it are a great equalizer call your boat again i already tried there wasnt an answer danny laffite he has a boat presumably they had a boat to board jupiter with yes you remember the name miss catherine after catherine villars alex rolled his eyes start hailing that boat on the radio maybe theyre trying to figure out how to trick us maybe theyre playing it safe maybe they didnt want to come in at night he gave a wicked smile maybe they found the eye hidden on your boat and theyve sailed off to china the smile wry like he didnt care stayed in place it made stoneys stomach sink i got an extra marine radio in my office highend longrange lets see if anyone wants to talk to us alex said claudia awoke slowly because waking meant pain hard throbbing pain that pulsed in her head like a heartbeat each pupump a double shot of eyeclenching agony the pain roared hard enough for her first cogent thought to be dont move because your brains will leak out your ears she opened her eyes coldness from airconditioning prickled her skin morning light soft in color but a slap against her eyes a slow awareness of the rest of her body not welcome everything hurt crept along her nerves she was tied again hands behind her this time wrists raw foot a dull ache a coppery sour taste made her want to spit out her tongue bed sheets smelling unwashed and of suntan lotion lay greasy against her skin tied up and tucked into bed danny claudia called weakly danny the door cracked open light hit her eyes like a fist youre awake danny said you worried me you wouldnt wake up before what what happened i hurt youll be fine a pause its good you didnt die because then how could you help me he sat by her on the bed put a moist cloth dispenser next to her head plucked a cloth free gently wiped her face and her hands moist towelettes help you stay clean you should wash each day he said as if by rote it sounded like a rule mentioned in a hospital a mantra of nurses his tone was a little different today she didnt like it she stayed still while he wiped her face cleaning her skin and hair of dried extinguisher foam and her own spittle and blood he brought her a glass of cold water the water tasted bitter but her mouth craved the wetness he held her head up gently and she gulped the glass dry good girl he said untie me no you you hit me her mouth tasted like it was crammed full of wool just a little love tap he said youll be okay his jaunty confidence made her skin crawl he smiled shook a finger in her face she wanted to bite to the bone remember were going to stoneys house ben i wouldnt worry about him anymore theyre gone gone where sailed off im certainly not looking for them now he mustve heard the gunshot decided to take off zack the redhead hes basically a coward without gar around probably dump ben in the gulf ditch the boat close to shore find a rock to hide under less likely hed go to stoneys house cut a separate deal but you just never know about people do you youre a smart guy danny she managed to say but you know the police are looking for me and ben by now and i need medical attention she put the edge of a whine in her voice please you hit me hard in the head im sick how about some delicious aspergum i have regular and cherry flavors i might have a fractured skull for gods sake youre blinking okay danny said he frowned gar called you officer why she stared at him ive no idea i think youre a cop claudia you think a lot of things danny more than most people he laughed i suppose i do he ran a thumb along her lip i wish we could be friends dont have a lot of those he sounded regretful we can be untie me no youll nap for a while i put a little of my meds into your water i dont need em no more im feeling awesome i want you calm till we get to stoneys house i didnt want to go at night i want to see clear and lets say hes gotten his brother back from zack the brother being there hell make stoney trade for you stoney wouldnt give a shit about you on his own if he hasnt gotten ben back then i tell him ive got ben with you down below see he smiled at his own cleverness she closed her eyes because im gonna call him when we get in close to shore tell him hes got to meet us out on the dock with the devils eye and the journal claudia was silent then im gonna shoot him from the boat make his head go boom like a ol melon like gars did then im getting my stuff cause hell have it there at his house i figured his house is big hell want the treasure where he can see it know its okay danny said with a smile touching his fingers to her throat taking the measure of her breath savoring the moment flush with success at having bested gar she saw suddenly that danny probably hadnt had a lot of success in his life if he doesnt have this emerald there youre screwed okay ill shoot after he gives it to me or tells me where it is the journal she said tell me again what it looks like danny maybe i saw it at stoneys danny studied her for a moment touched her jaw which ached still with tenderness then he went to the cabinet in the staterooms corner unlocked it with a key from around his neck from a drawer he pulled a piece of paper bleary with photocopy streaks he held the paper above her face she wriggled into position where she could see the page written in the flowing scrawl that passed for nineteenthcentury penmanship sorting the words was a struggle in late may a small force led by the schooner lynx chased laffites little fleet being two schooners and a brigantine down the texas coast feeling ran high that laffite might simply move south onto other texas islands and reestablish his pirating base captain madison was ordered to ignore the safe passage that commodore patterson issued to laffite which made me uneasy our word in the navy should matter but in vera cruz madison received reports of a spanish ship the santa barbara carrying a trove of gold and jewels sb vanished in the western gulf in fair weather in the weeks before laffite abandoned his privateering and i suspect the government thought him involved i fear no one informed mr laffite of this change in the governments attitude we fired on laffites ships south of matagorda bay but he turned into the maze of bays and shoals guarded by the thin strips of barrier islands and we could not give chase without running aground we caught him coming out of st leo bay the next morning there was scant loot on his ship some silks madeira a few handfuls of coins at most little enough for the great pirate his crude stupid men were hungry and beaten there was no sign of the spanish treasure offers of immunity from prosecution won the crew over we escorted laffites ship to vera cruz i do not know what happened to him afterwards we were all sworn and paid in bonus not to discuss this operation since it had disregarded a legal safe passage and the navy wanted no embarrassment i left lynx in new orleans and tragically lynx and all her hands were soon lost in a storm on a cruise to jamaica to fight piracy in the caribbean so i alone remain to give witness but i cannot bear to dishonor captain madisons memory by confessing what the navy did in public here i can write my thoughts without fear for those who recall laffites heroic service to new orleans and to america during our late war with the british it seems particularly scandalous and unfair to have broken a promise even one made to a pirate ample discussion followed that laffite had buried his booty along the coastline where he had evaded the task force and one of the younger pirates spoke of a nighttime expedition at widows point in st leo bay where only laffite out of four men returned but this fellow jack was both simple and a hopeless drunkard whose story changed with the level of rum in the bottle i think that the idea makes an excellent story and my grandchildren enjoy it so at their bedtime i record it here simply as a matter of interest who wrote this claudia stared at danny as he lowered the paper from her face john b fanning ships surgeon aboard lynx he wrote this journal years later i guess his descendants found it in a family trunk and they put it up on an online auction site simply mentioning it talked about laffite and navy operations in the s they had no idea of its value so i bought it widows point see thats what they call black jack point now black jack point where those two old people had been murdered davids case he didnt say anything for a minute not looking at her putting the copy back into the cabinet locking it up you should understand why this is all mine by inheritance my last name is laffite daniel villars laffite claudia watched him finally she said youre descended from jean laffite she tried not to laugh and catherine villars his great love so that money that hidden gold its mine mine his voice fell to a whispering mumble he was used she saw to talking to himself telling himself what he wanted to hear no one elses i got the best claim on it imaginable she gathered herself tried to stay calm at first she thought his grudge against stoney was a battle between one treasure hunter versus another but this jesus you dont believe me danny said a low rumble in his voice sure i do she said why wouldnt i people laugh at me not much longer though not much longer his voice rose spittle flying from his lips hitting her cheek she didnt move didnt react put a gentle calm smile on her face danny it was sweet of you to share your meds with me really but maybe you should take them again just because you want to be at your best when he leaned down and slapped her hard she stared past his shoulder he rubbed her cheek his fingertips smelling of the moist towelettes no no more of those keep me from being me the radio beeped she heard its call through a little speaker in the cabin a hail for miss catherine maybe stoneys voice hard to tell danny rushed out of the cabin without giving her another look she heard his feet pound on the stairs she had to get loose fight him there had to be a way the stateroom was dark now with the door closed and the shades lowered thin slices of light lying in lines on the bed but she inched over a bedside table stood on each side of the narrow bed with her hands tied behind her she pried open one drawer with her fingers rolled around to see what was inside a pair of reading glasses stubby blue pencils a notepad she eased the drawer shut with her foot wriggled to the other side of the bed and slowly forced the other table drawer open she rolled again inside lay a pack of gum a ballpoint pen missing its cap a scattering of pennies dimes and quarters a set of nail clippers clippers she turned her back to the drawer easing around and carefully leaned backward her fingers wiggling trying to close around the little plastic case of the clippers her fingertips brushed the dimes the foil of the gum pack her fingernails tapped the plastic and she leaned back too far her exhausted muscles in her back and arms cramping she fell off the bed the drawer smacking hard against her neck and shoulder she hit the thin carpet hard teeth jarring together one of her fingers jamming and she cried out in pain she raised her feet shut the drawer her back straining her muscles begging for mercy the door opened he stood there watching her the sig in hand and she wondered whos steering this boat he gently put her back on the bed pulled the sheets over her like he was tucking her in for sleep what were you doing trying to stretch a little im cramping everywhere please untie me i just spoke with stoney hes agreed to the trade he asked to speak to his brother but i said no he thinks i got ben he grinned so this will be over soon and he shut the door behind him her hand hurt like the devil her head felt like it was full of sand tears of frustration stung her eyes she blinked them back not much time she rolled back toward the drawer whit was going to be late for friday morning juvenile court but that hearing was his least favorite chore lecturing kids who ought to know better while their impatient or embarrassed parents arms crossed stood there as the county doled out the discipline he pressed stoney vaughns doorbell the same cars a porsche and a beatup van were still parked in the oversize curve of the driveway he waited no answer he tried the doorbell again still no answer whit walked around the front of the house around a corner across a lawn so manicured golf could have been played on it and down to the sprawling homes back a metal fence enclosed the back fancy wroughtiron curlicues at the posts tips but the gate was unlocked the back wasnt a yard so much as a multitiered deck he climbed up wooden stairs at the top he could see two more platforms below him a nice long private dock with no boat in residence lights still on like theyd been left on all night a pool set into the deck expensive patio furniture a restaurantstyle grill built into the brick the french doors opened behind him a man whit knew he was stoney vaughn recognized him from the pictures in the articles on the internet stepped outside the guy looked like hell rumpled clothes unshaven like hed slept on the street lip split and puffy excuse me stoney said this is private property i know whit said but you didnt answer your door yeah i sure didnt did i im judge whit mosley im the jp and county coroner id like to talk to you about two recent homicides call my office make an appointment stoney shut his mouth as though reconsidering this as an initial reaction im here now you dont appear to be busy i had a late night working stoney said sorry to be gruff he shut the door behind him came out onto the deck in full light glancing toward the stretch of the bay and im afraid i have a business appointment in corpus that i need to get ready for i dont know how i can help you you knew patch gilbert though didnt you the names vaguely familiar you sent him a bottle of glenfiddich after talking to him at a laffite league meeting whit said stoney shut his mouth smiled wiped his eyes oh yeah i do remember him charming guy was you probably heard he got killed monday night along with his girlfriend stoneys eyes widened youre kidding me mr gilberts dead you dont watch the news a pause not lately and im deep in putting together a new business deal so ive been working twentyfour seven more financing for treasure hunts whit gave a look of angelic purity stoney stared again um no but you sure seem to know a lot about me mr mosley judge please i prefer the formal title whit folded his arms across todays shirt limegreen with waltzing bugeyed pineapples uh sorry judge im out of the treasurehunt game too expensive a hobby may i ask how you know about me im conducting the inquest into mr gilberts death im trying to get a picture of his life in the months before he died well i met him the one time we chatted a pause i was interested in his land asked him about selling he said no and the other gilbert family members you approached them am i suspected of something here do i need a lawyer i dont know do you do you have some id because you sure dont look like a judge whit handed him a laminated card showed his drivers license i dont have a lot of time either mr vaughn but your name cropped up more than once and i wanted to know your connection to mr gilbert vague at best judge now stoney smiled yes i think i met another gilbert suzanne right and asked her about her land she also declined to sell not everyone wants every inch of the coast developed true enough stoney said is there anything else im sorry i couldnt be of more help yes where were you monday night stoneys smile faded came back on um i was here at my house anyone with you my brother ben lives here with me id like to talk to him if i may hes not in at the moment when do you expect him back whit asked you know hes taken my boat out for some fishing and r and r and im not sure when hes going to be back the smile again i dont even have time to play with the toys but my brother does okay whit glanced toward the french doors he thought hed seen someone behind the glass but with the glare from the sun maybe he was wrong please ask him to give me a call is this really necessary sir honestly am i in some sort of trouble i mean the police havent questioned me or contacted me thanks for your time whit said oh since youre a treasure buff maybe you can help me uh sure you got any books on old coins the cutting was going slowly too slowly on claudias second try for the clippers shed managed to slide open the large file she found after experimentation that she could hold the file in her right hand and saw at the knots binding her hands together but the file was too dull jabbing her wrist every third stroke and the rope unyielding her hands and forearms cramped she lay on her side keeping the tedious cutting motion going the ropes deathgrip tight no progress she stared at the ceiling thirsty hungry trying to think straight stoney hadnt since yesterday called the coast guard otherwise helicopters screaming out of corpus christi would have spotted miss catherine from the air radioed her position and heading to cutters who would have intercepted danny laffite shed be off the boat by now danny in custody wheeled in front of eager psychologists who could mine a dozen papers out of his obsessions does a man like stoney vaughn selfmade into millions let a guy like danny laffite order him around did he tell gar that youre a cop if police were with stoney helping him lure in danny theyd say dont say anything about her dont risk panicking him maybe it was a stupid mistake or maybe stoney hoped gar would kill you she had to get free because danny was going to kill her if stoney didnt have this emerald and if there was one bit of truth to dannys story stoney might not wish her well either claudia pulled herself along the bed her feet and hands still bound and the purr of the engines the full throttle of miss catherine told her danny had abandoned caution and now was in a tearass hurry to get to stoneys bayside house danny was up on deck leaving her below but that might not last long she hopped across the floor the closet door was a slider one pane covered with a mirror on the closet floor she found a pair of flipflops oversize for her feet she put them on the toe gar broke was purpled and sore and she was about to make it feel worse with her shoulder she inched the closet door shut she eased herself onto the floor feet toward the mirror now either hell hear you and come down and shoot you or the engines and the wind will mask the noise time to find out she thought of her mother and her gentle nagging for a moment her father so proud of her as a police officer her sisters and brothers all good people that she loved dearly david on their wedding day smiling hugely whit crazy sweet whit in a loud shirt and windblown hair that hed forget to smooth down after he put on the judges robe the odd little twist he always put in her heart while knowing he wasnt really the one for her ben poor ben smiling at her the nice boy grown into a better man probably dead now thanks to danny she aimed her feet and kicked hard against the mirrored door it shook wobbled in its cheap frame the engines still thrummed and hummed the glass webbed on the third hard smack cracks in the mirror distorting her reflection her foot throbbed she kicked again again two big slivers of mirror fell out of the frame one a crescent the other a triangle she stopped breathing listening to the engines the roar stayed steady now the trick is to not lose a finger or all five claudia turned wriggled her back up against the bed grabbed a corner of the cheap bedspread on it dolphins and mermaids cavorted in tacky glee but the fabric was thick and she covered her fingers and her palms with it she took a deep breath eased back toward the splinters tried to lift the crescent of mirror her covered fingers closed around it no grip it shifted and fell from her hands try again dont rush sweat dribbled along her ribs the third try she got ahold on the sliver she steadied with her right hand and slowly slowly gripped it until she was sure it wouldnt cut through the bedspread to her flesh she leaned to one side stretching turning a sharp edge toward the ropes there she moved the glass felt it slice into the meat of the rope not too fast and dont dare slip or youll cut your wrists open that would be hysterical yes lie here on the floor tied up bleeding out into the dingy carpet while danny sailed them home she made a little noise in her throat as the first loop in the knot broke under the mirrors edge slowly find the rhythm feel the rope against you so you dont cut yourself she sliced deeper into the big knot fashioned around her hands forcing herself not to rush the knot began to unravel she steadied her hand now the remaining rope was a thick strand right around her wrists covering the tender lace of veins careful the deck began to pitch danny was in a hard turn a sudden turn the crescent slipped in her grip an edge bit into her skin she let the fragment go rolled away from the closet the deck pitched again crazily why wouldnt he steer like a maniac he is a maniac the deck settled the engines resumed their hum a little ooze of blood tickled her palm she pulled on the ropes and her left hand uncut came free she pulled her right hand around to her front saw a cut in the fleshy part of her palm blood welling odd that it didnt hurt much then as feeling crept into her numb hands it stung like the devil she unraveled the rope off her hand grabbed the bedspread stanched the bleeding not bad but worse than it looked claudia cut through the ropes on her feet she wobbled as she stood sensation ebbing back into her feet arms hands and the small of her back she ached everywhere she bandaged her hand with a tshirt she found in the bureau tearing off a sleeve and wrapping the fabric around twice she tried the door locked a deadbolt locked from outside above the knob she cussed under her breath glanced around for a way to smash the door although danny would hear that and come running gun in hand the porthole salt and oily stains grimed over the glass it was secured with four twisting locks she began to undo them so what do you do bail out over the side and hope someone picks you up you dont even know where in the gulf you are maybe the cops are there at stoneys house waiting and youre running away from a rescue but her gut said that wasnt the case she couldnt be far from the bay he couldnt have wandered or waited too far away she unscrewed the final lock yanked the panel free from the porthole wind and cold spray hit her face salt stung her lips she saw two sailboats in the far distance go go she prayed danny laffite didnt see her launch herself into the water didnt run over her and crush her or chop her into floating mincemeat with the prop or didnt stop to shoot her five times in the back as she tried to swim away but hed shoot her for sure she thought when he found her untied maybe she could take him surprise him when he opened the door but maybe not danny had the gun his muscles werent aching from having been tied for hours and he had the strength of the crazy on his side there were other boats on the water someone would see her god yes and if she waited shed lost one chance before aboard jupiter he could stop the boat at any time to come fetch her and she wouldnt be able to fight back seize the moment she told herself she turned and dug through the closet no life preserver jacket nothing flotational and no flares nothing but musty clothing she found a big pair of blue jeans and remembered a news story about a young american girl who survived hours in the sea after a ferry in the philippines capsized and sank by fashioning her blue jeans into a crude float fine she pulled on the jeans over her shorts she saw a bright red pillow on the bed small easy to see claudia grabbed it shoved it under her tshirt claudia pulled herself through the porthole she threw herself into the deep green pushing away from the boat with all the strength left in her legs she hit the water like a stone wall air smashed out of her lungs water closed over her head like six feet of packed dirt the roar of miss catherine slicing through the waves sounded above her churning like gods rolling dice she kicked down down down into the endless green stay down dont let him have seen you please god give me a chance she felt the gulf close its cold fist around her and when she could no longer hold her breath claudia kicked hard again and broke the surface a wave roiling into her chest knocking her back down she emerged salt burning her hand her face her eyes she coughed keeping her head clear turned toward the widening wake miss catherine roared away from her danny standing on the flying bridge steering through the crests not stopping not turning back he hadnt seen her she shivered a wave picked her up in its swell and settled her back down her arms and legs ached like theyd been braided on a rack sharp stinging pain hit in the hollow of her hand and the tshirt bandage shed fashioned turned pink in the water she thought of the silky sharks from a lifetime ago yesterday tearing through the chum drawn by the blood she tried to get her bearings from the sun looked toward where she thought the shore would lie secondguessing yourself already she thought but she saw in the distance two sails unfurled the dot of a cruiser cutting through the waves hes racing toward shore you cant be that far out in the gulf you cant be right claudia pulled the bright red pillow from her shirt and began to wave it back and forth every ten seconds facing the boats then she trod water wave tread repeat repeat repeat repeat the boats headed away from her as claudia began to swim the fatal heaviness of exhaustion began its terrible creep i dont like a judge sniffing around alex said he was harmless stoney stood in front of the bay window hes been here twice hes talking to everyone who knew patch gilbert its not an issue not an issue look he hardly asked me anything except where id met patch that was it said nothing about a land buy nothing about laffite nothing okay and i had to get rid of him we couldnt have him around when danny sailed up or have him coming in and seeing you could we no alex took his wirerim glasses off cleaned them on his shirt put them back on if dannys killed your brother how are you going to explain the motive my boats gone he was on the boat i wont have known what happened dannys a freaking nutcase he finally snapped he had a grudge against me no one could explain why do i have to explain anything youre a cold bastard stoney i have to say i didnt want my brother to get hurt you didnt lift a finger to help him alex said family doesnt matter to you you kill people and you lecture me about family i didnt have a thing against gilbert and mrs tran alex said old and theyd had good lives probably jimmy was too dumb to live i didnt want them messing up my life but shit man i wouldnt kill family i didnt kill my brother sure you did you stole from me you probably let your brother die instead of parting with one red cent youre a real honey alex unwrapped a stick of gum offered the pack to stoney who shook his head heres what happens when danny gets here we meet him down on the dock if ben and claudia are still alive shes got to go man sorry the kidnappers and danny are dead too your brother you think he can be trusted then fine you kill his girlfriend hes not going to be happy hell be less happy dead dont kill him alex please stoney glanced out into the curve of the bay that fed the flats a boats coming not mine a sportfisher danny boy alex said lets go say hi he tucked his gun into the back of his pants closed a light jacket of stoneys above it youre wearing a jacket in summer that looks suspicious would you like to go shoot him stoney stoney opened his mouth closed it again they headed down the deck stairs toward the dock the boat chugged along kept correcting course as though the pilot was a bit unsure of his bearings the morning had turned windy the bay degrading into white choppiness stand behind me alex said just a little are you going to shoot him right away stoney whispered no im not alex said just do what youre told the bertram in need of paint hovered in close to the dock but it didnt dock staying about ten feet away stoney saw danny hair blown wild by wind and speed standing in the shadow of the flying bridge alex raised both hands palms out showing they were empty the sportfisher cut its motors whore you danny called im here to facilitate the transfer alex said stoney danny said this some thug you hide behind you mean like youre hiding behind my brother and his girlfriend stoney said wheres the journal and the devils eye danny asked inside the house wheres my fucking boat stoney said you ask about your boat before your brother danny said nice we want to see that ben and claudia are safe before the exchange alex said this is a business transaction its not quite like going to the atm danny said you show me the eye and the journal you toss them to me on the boat i pull out a little further i let ben and claudia swim into the dock no alex said you dock and you show us that our friends are fine first my way or no way danny said fine alex said sail off into the sunset danny frowned ill call the cops tell them what you did stoney here and in new orleans call them alex said youre a kidnapper and you dont have any proof the guy who killed your cousin in new orleans is dead his name is jimmy bird he shot himself earlier this week he used us he used you stoney didnt hurt your cousin stoney couldnt even look at alex danny stared at alex shook his head i dont believe you you got to work with me here danny to get what you want otherwise youre going to lose who the hell are you im your only hope for getting what you want alex said now dock or we walk away and you have nothing dock and you can have the eye we keep the rest of the treasure deal stoney could see it play out on dannys face the wanting the obsession the need to win be right not be the laughingstock anymore im supposed to check in with my associates on stoneys boat in ten minutes i dont they kill ben you dont have ben with you stoney said his voice rose hes safe i got claudia thats fine alex said see were willing to trust you we dont want ben or claudia hurt jimmy birds the one who screwed you over i can show it to you in the paper danny well give you the eye and trust you that youll give us ben he slowly pulled out of his jacket pocket the fake emerald stoney had left in the storage unit let it glitter in the light see yours just give us claudia and ben danny chewed his lip for a moment then turned the wheel slowly in toward the dock alex kept the fat emerald aloft holding it in his fingertips danny hovered into position pulled up against the dock stoney tossed bumpers against the dock to protect the boat tossed a line onto miss catherines deck stoney quickly fed the rope around and through the dock cleat danny kept his gun trained on alex we dont have a gun on you alex said put that down or i drop the eye in the drink toss it up here danny said alex smiled stoney saw it thought oh no youre not tossed the fake eye high toward dannys reaching hand danny grabbed at the stone onehanded his eyes widening as alex pulled his revolver from the back of his waist and fired once blood burst from dannys shoulder and he fell backward onto the deck screaming stoney climbed aboard alex following danny lay on his back sobbing in pain you shot me jesus he sounded shocked go see if your brother and his girlfriend are aboard or not alex said ill stay here with danny he knelt by danny steadied him by putting a hand on his chest its okay man calm down oh please danny said dont kill me i wont alex said he glanced up at stoney what the fuck are you waiting on the guys that were with him stoney said they might be below are they danny alex asked no no danny moaned theyre gone go ahead stoney do some constructive work alex said and he motioned with his gun stoney swallowed and hurried belowdecks he checked the galley a small stateroom an empty head ben buddy claudia stoney called in a low voice at the stateroom its okay its over he unlocked the door pushed it open with his fingertips he saw the loops of cut rope the broken mirror the open porthole someone had been here someone was gone now he looked out the porthole to see if maybe ben or claudia was swimming away right now but the water in the little cove was empty stoney went back up to the deck blood still pulsed from dannys shoulder alex kneeling by him no ones there someone was tied up but they cut themselves loose and mustve jumped ship claudia danny said i had claudia i didnt hurt her what did you tell her danny alex asked danny blinked tell her nothing she doesnt know anything he winced as he moved wheres ben alex asked gar tried to rape claudia asshole i shot him dumped his body overboard zack took off with the other boat with ben aboard you know who hes talking about alex asked i dont know any gar or zack stoney said okay alex said his voice went gentle danny who else knows about the treasure no one i didnt tell just wanted what was mine thats why you didnt tell the cops who you thought murdered your cousin you didnt want anything getting in the way of you getting the eye you were gonna dig up illegal same as us where is my brother you asshole stoney demanded i dont know after you wouldnt transfer the money it all went south danny closed his eyes opened them it hurts i know please dont kill me danny said i promised i wouldnt alex said he stood offered the gun to stoney you do it what stoney said your turn ive done all the risky work youve stolen from me lied to me hes your problem um really no thats okay you do it stoney took a step back if you dont shoot him ill shoot you stoney gulped then you wont get the eye i dont think its on your boat buddy i think thats a little lie you cooked up so id stick around to clean up your mess you wouldnt let your brother take off on your boat if the eye was on board i know you he smiled last night i evened the playing field moved the rest of the treasure while you slept on your fat ass stoney stared you couldnt have oh but i did alex said shoot him please no danny said you cant im a laffite no youre not alex said fuck you i am danny screamed i wont stoney said alex aimed kidneys or heart your choice stoney id pick heart if i were you yeah shoot him danny said hes the asshole stoney took the gun from alex he thought it would be heavy but it was light as air and pointed it at danny who started to scream i cant stoney thought then the gun pulsed and the top of dannys head blew off sending a red spray across the deck danny stared up at him eyes full of dismay and surprise drops of blood clouding the irises there not so hard was it alex said like he was giving back a test with a b plus when a failing grade had been expected stoney thought now shoot alex do it just do it and all this is over but he thought of the rest of the treasure the hundreds of silver and gold coins and he handed the gun back to alex without a word now we got two problems the girlfriend maybe he killed her i dont think so i think she got away so shes out in the bay creates new risk man changes everything we gotta hurry i need your help i stoney stared down at the body i just killed a man he thought his knees would go weak hed vomit nothing he waited for his hands to start shaking but now he felt pretty good if claudia knows what danny knew if shes out drowning in the gulf she may not be a problem alex said my brother maybe we should go look for him take dannys boat and no not much we can do there bens either dead by now or theyll contact us we got to deal with the problem at hand help me below in ten minutes it was done the deck hosed the bilges partially opened the pumps undone the engines going full steam miss catherine headed back into the bay shed be sunk in a few minutes into the deeper reach of the bay but probably not entirely submerged but a mess without a body they wrapped danny laffite in doublethick garbage bags like a giant plastic burrito alex taped the ends closed neat as christmas wrapping they put him in the back of the van locked up the house climbed into the car stoney alex said take a good look at danny here you try to fuck me over youre burrito boy the sequel but im like you ive killed a man now stoney thought and suddenly im not so scared of you because i have the eye the trump card and maybe youre gonna be the next burrito but he played safe i understand you completely alex you got a good idea where to dump him stoney nodded they both sat into the van and roared away from copano flats down the dirt and oystershell road now alex said i got a new plan just in case this claudia shows up miss catherine never a proud ship sputtered and gushed down into the muddy bottom of st leo bay in a fairly shallow twenty feet water poured in flooding the belowdecks covering the bed where gar died the shattered glass that claudia used to cut herself free miss catherine tilted hard to port as she sank and the back stateroom flooded entirely including the armoire holding the photocopied excerpt of john fannings journal that danny had showed to claudia the seawater covered the paper as the armoire canted over smashed through the closet doors and rested on its side little spot croakers and hardhead catfish swam down the stairs and through the portholes and began exploring this new world whit said gooch id like you to meet helen dupuy gooch back earlier than whit thought hed be by one in the afternoon on friday stood in whits courtroom as the last juvenile case wrapped up and a boy chronically truant and his embarrassedtothebone parents left whit still was in his robe sitting at the bench gooch had an arm around a young woman a slight thing hair a little too frizzed a hard worn look to her but pretty if maybe she ate a little more slept a little more wearing faded jeans and an old blue tshirt with a little rip in the shoulder that needed mending hello helen whit said im whit mosley he shook her hand they were alone now in the courtroom gooch biting his lip helen looking like she didnt know why she was here i brought helen back with me from new orleans gooch said i see we caught the first flight out this morning gooch said you mustve whit said you didnt tarry long in new orleans i felt we ought to be back here asap he glanced at helen helen i need to talk to his honor privatelike for a minute if you dont mind he gave her some change theres a coke machine down the hallway take a left get yourself something to drink and ill be there in just a minute nice to have met you sir she said to whit you dont have to call me sir i know better than to mouth off at a judge helen gave gooch a smile went out of the courtroom whit waited until the door shut after her who is she gooch shes a whore gooch said but not a crack whore thats good whit said why on earth did you bring this young woman back from new orleans with you albert exley ring any bells it did sound familiar it sounds like allen eck whit told gooch about the crazy treasure hunter described by jason salinger of the laffite league and that jimmy bird was dead albert exley allen eck alex gooch said his names seem to be shrinking so whos albert exley the name used by the man who paid cash and stayed at the motel jimmy bird called and nearly killed that nice girl that just left gooch explained what helen had told him if hes the same guy that stoney vaughn took to mexico then stoney knows allenalbertalex triple a triple a i aint calling him by all his aliases gooch said triple a was in touch with jimmy and jimmy used to work for patch theres your connection but no proof nothing to give to david albert exley and allen eck could be two entirely different people i dont think so gooch said names too similar one guy triple a so why was he in new orleans from that phone call helen heard and got shoved through the glass for i think he was there to kill someone im gonna do some hunting today get helen to help me see if who all in new orleans went missing or turned up dead during the time he was there shes a quick learner ill bet dont you be that way whitman shouldnt you have stayed in new orleans to do this gooch shook his head triple a is here man here if hes this guy that jimmy was in contact with and hes the same treasure hunter stoney knew hes either been here or hes still here most of what i was going to look for is in newspaper archives i can do all that via the internet he raised an eyebrow i sure as hell wasnt leaving you alone here sniffing around this guys a freak whyd you bring helen gooch i could use some help and lets just say shes motivated to find this alex he hurt her pretty badly and second well she needs a vacation whores dont get vacation time least not paid and plus she knows the guy we dont have a picture i thought maybe she could find an artist in town describe this guy get a sketch for us like a police sketch artists dont do that generally gooch its very specialized work whatever gooch said the key is finding this guy whit if the three different guys are all one and the same you got your man im telling you take her to see jason salinger whit said let them compare notes that should help us know if triple a is one person or not maybe he has a photo from mexico then maybe later gooch said i might take her to a movie if were not tracking down this fuck gooch you arent sleeping with her are you yeah we slept together last night didnt screw just slept just slept yeah she snores a little that doesnt bother me i think in short youre screwed suzanne gilbert said whit had thought he was done with the juveniles with teen court ended and gooch gone but suzanne was waiting for him in his office arms crossed still wearing black shirt black pants despite the hazy heat that had broiled port leo pouting pissed as a spoiled teenager being told no dont you feel like a solar panel whit said dont fuck with me she said her tone was still pleasant im not whats wrong he pulled the robe off over his head he hated wearing black even in the airconditioned comfort of the courthouse she watched him smooth out his lime shirt and hang up the robe shut the door this conversation is private he did gave her an indulgent smile thought you have about five seconds to turn nice lucy she is apparently the sole heir of patchs estate legal news traveled fast he wondered who told her maybe lucy maybe the lawyers maybe david so ive heard i havent seen a will though and her lover is in charge of the inquest lover i dont know if ive ever been called that before dont most people say boyfriend he sat behind his desk its going to make a nasty headline in the paper suzanne said you should recuse yourself from the case lucy is not officially under suspicion and shes not a blood relative of mine or a relative by marriage i dont have grounds to recuse myself of course shes not a suspect not with you working hand in hand with the police david power is not exactly president of my fan club whit said they dont listen to me as to who they suspect they handle the evidence they make the calls jimmy bird is the guy they think did this suzanne so why are you pitching a hissy fit she was mad about all that land and money not coming to her and whatever he said wasnt going to placate her jimmy bird has a wife and family and he just suddenly turns to burglary i dont buy it suzanne said lucy somewhere has her hand in this that wills going to get a hard look too and for you abusing your position to protect her ill go to the papers you know go and do what you please suzanne whit said quietly youre mad because patch cut you out youre a disgruntled relative the papers will give you the tenth of an inch you deserve your career as a judge will be over ive been threatened with that before whit said itd work if i got found screwing a goat and even then its only a maybe i screw up the judicial boardll spank me and ill take it you and the papers can try what you please he smiled and he meant it before being elected hed run an ice cream shop taken pictures for the newspaper run a messenger service all were decidedly less stressful than sitting on the bench and taking crap from this notalent whiner bet im more popular in town than you are dont make that bet whit her tone softened we can deal cant we i wont make a scene in the papers i wont take your career down which you seem to think is invincible but isnt but we need to reach an agreement on what lucy can afford to be generous to me share a little whit stared youre unbelievable im very believable youll make trouble and contest the will unless youre paid off he shook his head go paint your butt and roll yourself another bad mural shes not worth it whit not worth your career shes a phone psychic for gods sake do you think shes at heart anything more than a con artist con artist thats good coming from you youre better at working the cocktail party crowd than you are the canvas its the only way to explain why anyone would buy your shit she stood my paintings hang in the houses of lots of really really good lawyers around here whit tell lucy i wont contest the will if you withdraw from the case and shes willing to share oh lets say thirty percent i wont be greedy you sure as hell wont be because youre not getting one red cent now thats up to lucy to decide suzanne said isnt it the people claudia salazar had known in her life hovered around her as though they could step on the waves and not dampen their feet her abuelitas one stern the other smiling her parents her mother chiding her as though the boat she leapt from was the same as a good man why would you leave a perfectly good boat silly girl david reaching a hand down toward her then vanishing whit with his badboy smile he didnt know he had ben sweet folding his arms around her letting her rest her head against his shoulder she knew she was hallucinating hunger and exhaustion and the salt water she couldnt keep from her mouth in the rolling waves working their toll her skin felt like it might slide off her organs her bones she had wearied long ago of alternating between treading water swimming and waving the electricred pillow of riding the waves up and then down again into the swells the jeans tied into knots of air pockets didnt float and she finally let them sink into the emptiness below her if she thought too long about the water beneath her its depths with bull sharks and jellyfish and the dissolved bones of sailors lost long ago her breath caught in panic she forced herself to stare at the sky the vastness above more comforting than the vastness below the clouds could not hurt you she had tried to swim toward the coast maintaining a steady pace but it seemed to grow no closer she wondered if the distant smudge of coast really was coast or maybe a trick of the light and the water put there to tease her she swam waved the red pillow swam some more she thought she saw a sailboat briefly in the distance but it seemed to vanish in the haze you can quit now a voice she didnt recognize piped up its okay just stop give up sink shut up she croaked through cracked lips no shame in lying down the water is only cold for a while some instinct made her stop for a moment in the chop wave the little red pillow with leaden arms there are things worse than being dead better drown yourself before the sharks get ahold of you i wont taste good claudia said she swam again toward the smudge she thought was coast and wondered about danny about ben if ben were alive or dead the sky had been empty of planes and choppers and a cold ripple of grief in her belly and between her shoulder blades said no one is looking for you they dont know where to look she figured it was now past noon and she used the sun as a guide to find west to swim toward land she wondered if this was the last time shed see the sun felt the hollowing sting in her eyes of having looked at it too much in trying to check her bearings maybe the next time the sun rose she would be lost for ever under the waves bones never found her flesh broken apart by the salt water her atoms scattered by the tides over the next century or so shed get to thailand australia india sweden all the places shed dreamed of traveling a little bit of her in the grains of sand in the foaming curl of the surf just let go let go let no claudia screamed between her and the everdistant smudge was a dot moving with a crescent of sail getting bigger she screamed with all her might rose up out of the water waving the tattered sodden red pillow waving waving waving and screaming her throat raw lucy was getting ready to leave patchs house purse in hand dressed in jeans a plain white tshirt fatlensed sunglasses and a baseball cap whit pulled up parked his explorer to the side so she could move her chevy out she opened the car door tossed in her purse stood by the car waiting how was afternoon court slow glad to finish a little early where you going he asked a few errands she said i havent gotten a thing done since patch died i can do that for you she forced a smile its okay id rather go myself i need to stay busy he told her about the conversation with suzanne behind the sunglasses she gave no sign of emotion but she crossed her arms tapped her feet in anger well what do you want to do she said if i recuse myself the press might make an issue of it think that youre more of a suspect than you are but this is really your decision lucy at least about the will mine you mean ours she gave him a smile the thin kind that is barely meant were a team arent we yes then forget suzanne spoiled little bitch she crossed a line shes never going to be able to step back over okay she gave a sick little laugh i have no family left whit patch and suzanne were it and now im not going to be able to forgive her never say never shes upset so are you shes greedy i hate greed in people its corrosive did you know that most of the callers at the psychic hotline want to know if theyre going to get rich or win the lottery she shook her head they never ask if theyre just going to be happy find love thats not enough for people anymore forget the errands lets go inside just be alone no itll be good for me to get out a little alone time okay lucy ill cook us some dinner no need the church ladies and patchs friends brought a ton of food heat yourself up some dinner theres salad too open wine if you want dont wait on me i may be out for a while he watched her pull out of the driveway i have no family left shed said ill be your family lucy and he nearly laughed the odd way love kept sneaking up on you the fishing cottage was small on a couple of private acres on the south edge of laurel point fifteen minutes away from port leo it was owned by one of stoneys widowed clients who lived in san antonio and rarely bothered with fishing shed given him a key a few months ago asked him to get the real estate appraised and hed made and kept a copy for himself it was empty of course neat as a pin decorated badly with nautical motifs starfish lightswitch plates a mobile of crustaceans fake compasses mounted on the walls like clocks but very comfortable a television in the corner old bourbons and whiskeys in the bar what the fuck good is a compass mounted on the wall alex said its decorative stoney said it must be nice to have a house you dont even need the old woman who owns it her husband invented an important valve on oil pumps shes so rich she doesnt have to wipe her own ass if she doesnt want to alex had inspected the cottage took a deep breath said itll do the cottage was isolated quiet not a place anyone would look for stoney earlier hed outlined the plan sooner or later your brother and his girlfriend are going to be missed people come looking for them they want to talk to you but youre gone sos your boat so youre presumed missing too like ive been kidnapped stoney said slowly yeah at least until we see whats happened they turn up alive your brother might not be real thrilled with you since you wouldnt pay and told them to kill his girlfriend i never said that listen but if the gang that kidnapped them had operatives that also kidnapped you to get the money they couldnt get before stoney said yeah so he thought for a moment told alex about the cottage and theyd headed over after burying dannys body in a thick grove of oaks twelve miles inland it had been hot even in the shade and both men were grimy and sweaty alex washed his face off in the cottages sink now that ive done the thinking to save your ass wheres the devils eye i told you you can have the rest of the treasure man take it and go with your share you want to come back when im ready to stage the dig on the gilbert land help me fake it thats cool too i trust you and ill pay you well cool confidence in his voice now hed killed a man and his hands werent shaking his stomach wasnt in knots no youre telling me now remember anything happens to me your name surfaces immediately why should i believe that i managed to take down my investment firms computer by remote control alex i kept a virus executable file i could run on the servers one the servers werent protected against in case i needed to freeze up my computers if the feds wanted to look too close at my records i dont keep real backups its all insurance im just a big believer in it you are fucking pissing me off tough stoney said feeling tough himself i needed insurance you wouldnt off me like jimmy bird and ive been very careful about how i set it up you want to leave with your share of the treasure go ahead but the emerald its mine alex stared stoney made himself not blink not move he thought alex might say well screw the eye and just shoot him stoney wondered what it would feel like to have the bullet tear into your skin explode through organs come out the back hed lie there dead for god knows how long until old mrs mayweather in san antonio decided to go fishing again and showed up at the cottage alexs frown tightened like he wanted to shoot stoney but decided not to instead of going for his gun alex tucked his hands into his pockets ive got some business to attend to alex said stoney felt a little shock of pleased surprise he thought alex would stick to him like glue he felt relief at the idea of being alone some business he wondered what that was alex said you need to stay out of sight keep the lights off dont attract attention here youve been kidnapped remember shit that whit mosley saw me he knows i wasnt kidnapped this morning if hes a problem alex said ill handle him you cant go kill a judge stoney theres probably a good marathon on cable try the cartoon network knock yourself out after alex left stoney made a phone call poured a shot of jack daniels downed it like medicine lay on the froufrou pillows of the mayweather couch drowsily replaying in his mind killing danny it wasnt so bad he hadnt liked danny begging for his life that bothered him but what was done was done he decided hed rather think about danny than about ben theyd never been particularly close as brothers especially since stoney made his money not ones to sit and talk about life he quit thinking about ben got comfortable dozed the knock on the door woke him from his drowse and for a second he thought well theres ben back from fishing no he was in the cottage waiting for a friend stoney stood opened the door come on in he said lucy gilbert stepped inside glanced around are we alone yeah stoney said and as soon as he said it she pulled a gun from her purse a big old revolver that mustve been her uncles but cleaned and oiled and she aimed it squarely at his chest you bastard lucy said you killed them whats this he tried to keep an easy tone in his voice he hadnt expected sweet ditzy lucy to be armed you killed patch and thuy no i didnt he said wow three times today hed had a gun aimed at him and he nearly laughed except lucy looked a little ragged and the third time might not be the charm she was far more likely to shoot him i didnt kill anyone lucy i called you because i wanted to be sure you were safe im supposed to fucking thank you no one was supposed to get hurt you were just supposed to dig up the stuff i sell you my land you rebury it end of story i didnt kill them he said again but if you want the guy who did i can give him to you but just you not the police though thatd be a mess for both of us i hate you lucy said and the barrel trained right on his chest steadied do you know what you might cost me what youve already taken from me if you feel so righteous pick up the phone and call the police ill just sit on the couch while you explain to them how you knew who killed your uncle and his girlfriend and didnt lift a finger he went and sat crossed his legs dont think i wont lucy said phones right there he waited she waited she lowered the gun just a bit down toward his crotch tell me what happened stoney did quietly saying how alex had freaked when thuy and patch surprised them as they were finishing the dig killed them both and who killed jimmy bird far as i know hes a suicide stoney watched her lower the gun the barrel pointing at the floor im not asking any more questions about it neither should you this alex she said does he know about me he knows youre patchs niece he doesnt know we know each other he cleared his throat im really sorry about your uncle and his friend lucy truly i am no one was supposed to get hurt if its comforting it was very very quick they might have been afraid for a moment but it was as painless as could be painless my ass he beat patchs head in with a shovel i know first blow killed the poor guy alex just wanted to be sure that is not comforting to me in the least stoney she said she sat across from him in the heavy armchair closed her eyes i cant believe this has happened this had a bad vibe from the beginning and i ignored it she opened her eyes youve fucked up my aura stoney you still have the emerald yes where is it safe alex wants it hes not going to give up i told him one lie about where it was but he didnt buy it she gave a little shudder why did you get involved with this guy a truly legit contract archaeologist wouldnt have agreed to do the dig alex did and hell do the redig on your land make all the records and processes look clean he paused you know your boyfriend came to see me oh god he knew id met patch those couple of times oh god i said patch was just an acquaintance he believed me i want you to stay away from whit she said he got up sat on the armchairs arm next to her put his arm around her she felt good he liked lucy her pert little nose blue eyes little barely visible freckles on her cheeks nice tits beneath the blouse he thought wondering if maybe those little kissable freckles were down there too hed thought about what itd be like to bed her if she ever got over that judge and gave him a real glance its gonna be okay he said patting her i sure dont have a thing against him she stiffened under his hand so now what alex might be a problem not just for me for you or for your boyfriend he said he had to be careful not panic her overmuch she might crack and run to whit or to the police even if it cost her everything he ran a thumb along her shoulder blade she shrugged his hand off sorry just trying to be a help he leaned back i know youre upset you got every right i dont want you to ever touch me stoney you understand sure lucy i love whit i know you do im sorry im just trying to be a friend you let alex kill my uncle and thuy and you want to be my friend i couldnt stop him he said and then he had an idea not a bad one at all to solve his problems it might work lucy that gum you really know how to use it she narrowed her gaze why like i said alex might be a problem you said you need him for the fake dig sure but hes gotten real unpredictable maybe if he doesnt want to do the fake dig on your land just wants to take off well he might decide to hurt me or you if he finds out someone else has the devils eye and he knows whit talked to me he might hurt whit i dont know she stared you want me to shoot alex i want us to be careful sweetheart we get through this we both get what we want you get your money you get out of your debts you get whit i dont know i want to sell you my land anymore stoney and i think i have whit until he finds out about what youve done then hell be gone lucy i want out this isnt what i signed on for stoney cant lucy train left the station he went back to the couch smiled at her thinking and i will fucking touch you when i please when all this is done im not suggesting you kill alex lucy clearly not just want you to be careful i mean he thinks whits a threat to him hes going to come after him were kind of pretending that ive been kidnapped right now what just calm down i dont want to go into the why but the last person who saw me was your boyfriend alex considers him a threat lucy stared at the gun in her lap you know how to use it he asked again patch showed me she said when i was a lot younger alex is staying at a little motel on the outskirts of port leo the sandspot you know it yeah room she didnt say anything looked down at her fingers closed around the gun well now you know where hes at sweetheart stoney said the rest is up to you the little prostitute was sitting on the flying bridge of dont ask munching an apple apparently enjoying the lateafternoon breeze and the shade wheres gooch whit called as he came aboard he said he had to hunt down someone helen dupuy said hunt down not a good sign who i dont know he said hed call in a bit he said it was okay for me to be here she had decided he was an enemy he sat next to her kicked his sandals off im sure it is youre his guest she finished her apple wiped her hands do you normally get on planes with men you barely know thats a really stupid question she said she seemed a little less intimidated by him out of the robe what do you think youre either very trusting or youre very naive or or maybe i just want to help gooch get the guy who hurt me okay you think im not good enough to be his friend i can tell he told you what i do you changed the way you look at me gooch has the widest range of friends of anyone ive ever known hes nice really nice when he wants to be dont get on his bad side i bet i seen more bad sides than you have so how long are you staying i dont know i dont have to rush back you dont have a pimp i have a manager gooch explained to him i had a civic duty to come help oh lord im not a streetwalker she said she drank from a glass of water i got a regular clientele bluecollar guys most of em arent even married they just cant afford to spend a ton of money buying drinks for stuckup girls who wont give em none more civic duty you want my help or should i just leave now i want your help helen we talked with jason salinger he didnt have a photo but my description of albert and his of allen eck are both pretty much deadon except for albert having black hair and allen having brown both of em got a little partmoon scar on the corner of their mouths how did you explain to jason what you wanted to know just told him i was your secretary and you needed some more questions answered and like she was his secretary she handed him a file here gooch and i got on his laptop and went into the back issues site for the timespicayune we looked up all the crime stories from between june first and june fourth and a couple of days each way past that gooch said youd be interested in the top story as he started reading she gave him a summary some rich guy up off st charles named danny mouton but he goes by the name danny laffite claims to be descended from jean laffite got a history of mental problems it says someone killed his cousin who was staying at his house single shot through the forehead close range they dont say the caliber in the paper like thuy tran was this danny laffite a suspect jason salinger had mentioned danny laffite too the supposed forger kicked out of the laffite league nope visiting relatives in south carolina at the time place was vandalized pretty heavily apparently a tv a vcr missing a burglar but danny laffite seems to have dropped out of sight afterward no arrests made he scanned the rest of the article and a brief followup that was more about the checkered career of danny laffite than about the poor cousin whose name was phillip villars no we printed out all the stories about homicides theres always more in the summer in new orleans but gooch said he thought only this one mattered she sipped her water gooch says alex thats what im calling him now is a treasure hunter yall think and might have a connection to this danny laffite guy possibly a loose one they have a mutual acquaintance named stoney vaughn so that call alex got that hed offed the wrong guy maybe danny laffite was supposed to get killed not his cousin would you hand me the phone please whit said he dialed asked for a new orleans listing for daniel mouton on first street a message said the phone had been disconnected he clicked off a hazy shape was starting to form but with jimmy bird dead by his own hand would david or anyone else give a crap im going below and taking a nap helen said i had a long night and a long day and im tired helen thank you he hesitated i want you to know i dont have a thing in the world against you helen dupuy stood im real aware im not good enough for gooch i know it he doesnt maybe you could let me have a couple of nice days before he sees it and gives me a plane ticket home then she went belowdecks whit went back to his car and his cell phone rang in his pocket he answered within a minute he was roaring out of the marina parking lot speeding toward the port leo hospital jesus you look good whit said touching claudias hair lotion covered her skin bandages wrapped her hands an iv dripped into her arm her lips were swollen like jelly candies her face blasted red with sunburn youre the worst liar on the planet i look like hell i feel like i ran a marathon on my knees she had spent nearly eight hours in the gulf treading water waving her as she told him goddamned red pillow until a sailboat with a retired michigan couple aboard spotted her and pulled her from the water theyd hurried her into port aransas even before they reached mustang island she was wrapped in heavy blankets and on the radio with the coast guard telling them about the kidnapping giving them details on jupiter and miss catherine and saying that danny was headed to stoneys house at copano flats off the bay danny laffite whit said christ but his boat didnt make it apparently it sunk earlier in the day a bit off the flats no sign of danny and no one is at stoneys house theyve sent people looking for him i saw him today whit let go of her hand sat on the edge of her bed when hed arrived shed scooted her hovering parents out and asked a worried david to give them a moments privacy which had been granted with a frown but not an argument shed been talking with the coast guard command the sheriffs office and the fbi had been summoned in from houston why she asked he told her the complete story then all of it from the discovery of patchs and thuys bodies the links he kept finding between stoney vaughn and patch the connection to the laffite league triple a and helen dupuy the murder a month ago at danny laffites house the suicide of jimmy bird and the coins found in his pocket his theory about a treasure dig she told him dannys story whit sat its davids case he said i wasnt sure there was enough evidence about these connections but based on what youve said we need to find stoney vaughn find ben she closed her eyes danny and his thugs were demanding ransom for us right after the kidnapping at least as of this morning stoney thought danny had his brother which suggests to me that stoney paid no ransom or the redhead danny says his name is zack never picked up the ransom david stuck his head back into the room pardon me whit but we need to talk to her some more actually claudia said we all need to talk an hour later claudia said goodbye to whit gave a feeble wave david watched him go i mean you and him you can just take the fucking case yourselves david no one could know that it was a much more involved case than anyone she started but he was mad his skin flushed christ youre both gonna make me look like an utter fool all this other stuff it still doesnt change the fact that jimmy bird killed himself left a suicide note pretty much admitting he killed gilbert and tran the fbis handling the kidnapping theyll take it from me quick and if all this is mixed up together the fedsll take that case from me too what the hell am i supposed to do claudia he stared at her wobbled on his feet you could have been killed christ im okay im okay david he sat down on the edge of the bed find stoney find ben stoney vaughn seems to be the driving force behind all this mess yall find him hes the key to this whole case he nodded it was like they were still married she thought he knew what to do on a tough case but he had trouble delving to the heart of the matter letting himself get distracted too easily stoney vaughn yes youre right he went and poured them each a cup of ice water he brought her hers she wasnt so thirsty now with the iv hydrating her but she took a sip on her sore lips i need some more information from you if were to find your boyfriend he said the last like he had a roach in his mouth david she said gently this clearly upsets you why dont you let me talk to another investigator it doesnt upset me she let it be he sat on the edge of the bed had a notebook out but didnt open it what else did you want to know um because im exhausted david im really really exhausted id like to get some sleep sure he stood sure ill be back soon you rest and awkwardly he leaned down and kissed her forehead quickly chastely she watched him step out of the room tomorrow tomorrow shed be out of the hospital shed check herself out help in the search for ben and stoney the fbi she knew would be poring over the vaughn house looking for jupiter up and down the texas coast maybe ben still breathed shed find him if he did and if he didnt shed find the bastards whod killed him she fell asleep the elderly couple had lived near encina pass for nearly seventy years close to the bay in an old small house made of heavy cypress when the knock came on the door both were nearly asleep having dozed off during a particularly boring cable movie the old woman nearly jumped out of her skin with fright touched the rollers in her hair in case one had worked loose the old man rose from his recliner and answered the door the young man standing on the front stoop was sopping wet with a heavy bruise marring his nose and cheekbones like hed been in a crash smelling of the bay shivering in the night heat a broken pair of handcuffs dangling from his wrist one finger was purpled clearly broken could you could you please call the police the young man stammered my name is ben vaughn and i was kidnapped by some crazy people i think they killed my girlfriend alex black returned to his motel room friday night tired frazzled in need of a shower he stood in the showers hot spray for nearly twenty minutes until the water began to cool he scrubbed soap hard into his skin and scalp until his body tingled then he toweled off with a vengeance put on shorts and a tshirt his cell phone rang he picked it up glanced at the readout his father calling from south florida at least it wasnt that dumb shit stoney him he couldnt deal with any more tonight hello hey son how are you big berts voice was dry with cancer but optimistic like always you chasing the ladies tonight taking a breather to call me it was an old game between them pretending an active romantic life was barreling ahead at full steam suddenly alexs throat felt thick i chase em but they run fastern me these days a pause sure would like to see you soon probably another few days he said ill be there soon dig keeping you busy clients a big pain but its okay a dry click in his fathers throat find anything interesting well not as interesting as gold alex said trying to cheer the old man up what you getting big bert asked pottery shards bones arrowheads not much junk to keep you from your old man alex didnt like his tone not telling something skirting an issue you feeling okay his father gave a soft burp and alex figured one of big berts friends had sneaked him beer into the hospice again dont you get thrown out of all saints having a party that was from a pepsi thank you kindly im glad youre feeling okay alex said i never said i was well okay i got to go dad i got an early early morning yeah you got pottery shards calling your name okay then im gonna be there soon promise dont take too long christ what did that mean dad are you worse i just want to see you soon goodbye son i love you yeah back at you he did not want to think of his father wasting away in a hospice bed the cancer hed ignored for too long seeping through his body like rot big bert belonged on a boat diving for galleon treasure hauling up lost spanish coins but always just to have florida bureaucrats snatch them out of his hands bureaucrats had ruined him slowly with promises while breaking him on the rack of their antiquity laws here go get yourself an ice cream big bert would say to alex as a little boy handing him a piece of eight from or a doubloon from knock yourself out with a double scoop funny yes but then the state government would take most of the gold the irs would sniff around big berts boat squatters would try to maneuver their boats over his dive spots the treasure would be nibbled away by a thousand grasping hands more clever than goodnatured big berts his way was better alex knew but he didnt want to discuss it with big bert let his father think he still scrabbled through the loam for pottery and beads and crap hed sell much of the treasure quick hed go to that hospice such a nice crisp word for a death place grab big bert fly off to costa rica let him die in blue splendor under a bright forgiving sun die happy every day you waste with stoney is a day you dont have with your dad tomorrow hed get it sorted out find the eye eliminate stoney screw stoneys threats of posthumous exposure he was tired of this game he needed his money he needed it now hed made new identities before he could do it again no one in costa rica would give a crap about him and he could stay there for ever alex clicked on the television waited for the ten oclock news out of corpus christi first story was a dramatic hostage standoff at a church in dallas two people killed then the news was all port leo a boat wreck in st leo bay a port leo police officer rescued from out in the gulf ben vaughns face on the screen as a kidnapping victim then stoneys face also described as possibly missing at the least the authorities wanted to ensure he was well considering his brother had been kidnapped shit claudia salazar was alive but there were no other details offered no mention of a connection to the deaths at black jack point at the end of the newscast the pearltoothed anchor broke in to say that ben vaughn had been found in encina pass alive and well no details yet on his missing brother financier stoney vaughn he picked up his cell phone called stoney at the fishing cottage your brothers alive alex said congratulations i just saw on the news stoneys voice sounded a little funny like he was surprised to hear from him where you at he suddenly didnt like the question just around keeping a close eye on you so how long do i need to lay low i cant stay holed up here for ever i suppose that depends on what your brother says alex said he accuses you of anything youre fucked ben would never do that to me you just fucked him over royally stoney you might have lost that old brotherly love bens not like that you mean hes a better person than you alex said i think you want to stay there a couple more days stoney let them get good and worried about you maybe well make a fake ransom demand to your brother just for show then you can crop up no worse for wear yeah right dream on ill call you tomorrow stay low i will alex got up packed his bag he liked knowing where stoney was but didnt like stoney knowing where he was he checked out of the sandspot drove across town to a smaller motel the surfside did every coastal hotel have to have an s in the title checked in got settled on the way over alex didnt notice the little chevy gold and violet and amber crystals dangling from the rearview mirror following him whit awoke early saturday morning lucy shaking his shoulder she still hadnt been home when he returned from the hospital but he was exhausted so he ate a sandwich curled in under the sheets felt her arrive next to him and spoon into him felt her kiss on the back of his neck and fell back asleep phone call she whispered into his ear he hadnt even heard the phone ring guy sounds like hes squeezing coal into diamonds using his ass whit picked up the phone listened said uhhuh and okay a couple of times hung up rolled under the covers who was that the fbi the fbi lucys voice rose an octave hoover doesnt run it anymore you dont have to be afraid he wriggled his face deeper into the pillow they want to talk to me about stoney vaughn i guess i really was one of the last to see him before he vanished or took off or whatever he told her a highly abbreviated and edited version of claudias kidnapping he sighed as she ran her hand along his back what do they think happened to this guy i dont know maybe the kidnappers that took his brother went after him he didnt want to talk about danny laffite or goochs trip or any of the rest of it with her lucy couldnt keep her mouth shut he thought and all of it might upset her needlessly so was this stoney guy involved in patchs murder or what whit she was whispering into his ear running a hand along the flat of his belly i thought it was jimmy bird stoney knew your uncle that was the only reason i went to see him his brothers kidnapping it may have nothing to do with your uncles death she ran fingernails along his ribs he loved that he wriggled and smiled no time babe i got to get showered for the feds okay she said he opened an eye looked at her you okay yes im fine tired your errands took a long time no i got back and you were gone so i ate a quick dinner and then went back over to my apartment to get some fresh clothes okay he got up from the bed started up the shower whit lucy stood in the doorway in a tshirt and thin little white panties yeah babe youre doing an inquest what next week tuesday why if it was jimmy bird hes dead its just a formality i guess and maybe by tuesday well know more but i dont think he acted alone that might be where david and i differ davids the cop though hon that he is whit shucked his boxers stepped into the hot spray an inquest is just a format for determining if one person caused the death of the other if i put it on jimmy it still doesnt explain the why of what happened she kept standing in the bathroom watching him shower you find any insurance on those coins he asked i havent had time to look she said and as he shampooed he heard a brief flash of anger in her voice maybe they werent patchs i really dont know could i look at the coins ill see what i can arrange i didnt mean to piss you off conflict is bad for your aura whit youre basically a peaceable guy i get a bad vibe from you as long as this investigation is going on whit rinsed his hair youre not saying anything smart back to me lucy said you said conflict was bad for me baby i know you dont believe in my psychic powers thats okay youre scientific in nature and we dont have the imaging technologies to show auras like i wish we did you could get it done like getting a cat scan lucy if you say youre psychic i believe you because i love you end of story she said nothing and he finished washing and when he turned off the water she was standing there sobbing quietly baby he said im such a big fucking fake i dont see auras i dont see the future i get hunches like any other person and thats it well i never get a hunch so youre ahead of me but im a fake how can you love a fake i dont say its the intuitive hunch hotline she pulled toilet paper off the roll dabbed her eyes blew her nose lucy whit wrapped a towel around his waist youre not a fake youre like well a counselor without a license like im a judge without a law degree you were elected you dont need one people elect to call you get a little tarot get a little advice he pulled her close gave her a warm peck on the mouth i want to get out of the hotline business she said i want to make you proud im proud of you he said love you just as you are youre not proud of me whit she said i am no trust me i am he said toweling off rummaging in the little duffel bag hed brought he found boxers stepped into them found a shirt electricyellow with sashaying whorered crabs dancing across it pulled on khakis and stepped into his sandals dont wear that to meet the fbi she said wear a suit youre putting me in a crabby mood he said with a smile whit dont joke im serious i dont want to be an embarrassment to you is this about suzanne no me whatever you want to do ill support you want to keep the psychic hotline great you dont want to do it anymore great but you could never be an embarrassment to me he waved the shirt in front of her slipped it on began to button it way more likely ill embarrass you i think youre wrong lucy said quietly they kept him waiting twenty minutes and as far as he could see from the chair in stoney vaughns expansive living room the two federal agents were just sitting and talking drinking stoney vaughns coffee and not offering him a cup making incessant short calls on their cell phones he wondered no he knew david had already talked to these men painted an unkind picture of whit and that was why he was thumbtwiddling when one started a refill whit got up and stood in the kitchen excuse me saturday may be your day to suck down hazelnut but i have work to do either yall talk to me now or make an appointment with my office they both looked at him like he had a big streak of piss down his pants but one smiled and the other one pulled out a chair at stoney vaughns kitchen table whit thought maybe lucy was right that he should have worn the suit and that made him even madder but he sat they both had g names grimes and gordell whit immediately dubbed them the g men grimes was muscular and spare all throat and shoulders and arm muscles with skin the color of teak gordell was chunkier not fat wideset and blocky grimes had a southern drawl gordell spoke with the nasal clip of new england the g men wore suits nice summerweight blends still far too hot for the texas coast in july whits shirt seemed to irritate agent gordell like a thumbtack in his seat he kept glancing at it in disbelief judge mosley grimes said in his slow friendly cadence you visited mr vaughn yesterday they always had to waste time asking what they already knew yes in conducting an inquest into a double homicide this past week i found that there was a slight connection between stoney vaughn and one of the victims i wanted to ask mr vaughn about it so i came out here yesterday morning about eightthirty mr vaughn looked like shit warmed over like hed slept in his clothes and i could smell whiskey on him his lip looked split like maybe hed had a stressful evening he certainly didnt mention his brother and claudia had been kidnapped he knew didnt he were not at liberty to discuss that judge grimes added the title with an embarrassed smile like it was an afterthought like they even knew for sure claudia salazars an old friend of mine we work homicides together i wouldnt take it well if stoney knew she was in danger and didnt help her the g men smiled politely what he took well mattered not a bit but there had already been a suspect identified in this double homicide right gordell said a suicide as coroner i havent officially ruled that death a suicide yet whit said and you just decided what the sheriffs office was wrong and youd keep pressing other angles gordell said a little presumptuous wouldnt you say david must have poured on the charm i dont believe i have to justify my actions to you sir whit said politely excuse me gordell said grimes glanced up from jotting on a legal pad his face blank excuse me your honor whit corrected he smiled your honor gordell amended he didnt look repentant for one second no offense meant meant taken whatever whit said if i feel additional information is warranted for an inquest i go get that information youre not a lawyer are you i mean youre not one of those judges thats required to be formally trained in the law gordell said with polite snideness no im not a lawyer im an elected official an unpleasant light glinted in the back of gordells eyes im sure the voters might take offense at you not cooperating with the fbi how have i not cooperated cocky you dont see that much in politicians gordell said jim grimes said a little weary you didnt answer my question whit said lets not get into a turf war judge mosley youll lose and lose badly we ask the questions you answer them whit counted to ten its good i came here yesterday as i can tell you stoney vaughn was alive and well then if hes been kidnapped since then or hes run off at least ive narrowed the time frame considerably for you thank you grimes said what id like to know is why whit said why what gordell said why were ben and claudia kidnapped mr vaughn is a wealthy man mr stoney vaughn is mr ben vaughn isnt they thought stoney was aboard why did they think that they knew his schedule we dont know yet judge grimes cleared his throat quite possible the perps had been watching the house waiting for his boat to go out maybe they just assumed his boats out hes out on it so stoney vaughn has a vague connection to my murder case and he gets smackdab in the middle of a kidnapping now hes gone it just doesnt seem coincidence to me youre the one on this buried treasure kick right gordell said i prefer to think of it as archaeological relics whit said this whackedout supposed treasure hunter albert exley or allen eck or alex i want yall to find out who this guy is grimess lips tightened were appreciative of the information you gave officer salazar and to the other local authorities but please understand these various threads that may tie to a case those are for us to sort out and prioritize your honor let me tell you why this matters this alex this certifiable nutcase was in new orleans when danny laffites cousin got murdered he put a poor woman through a window because she might have heard someone telling him he got the wrong guy i think danny laffite had been in touch with stoney vaughn in the weeks before trying to cut a deal to finance a dig for this treasure but stoney got greedy and sent alex to steal dannys evidence about the treasure and kill him only alex killed the wrong person at dannys house danny must have phoned stoney after the new orleans breakin and stoney freaked at the thought danny was still alive he stopped looked at the two agents so if i were you id be looking really hard at stoney vaughns phone records see if he called the bayou mee motel in new orleans see if he had incoming calls from new orleans or from south carolina where danny laffite was when his cousin got killed weve heard this is your style gordell said not sticking to your judicial duties but grimes was looking at him head tilted slightly with interest you shouldnt listen to rumors whit said has there been a ransom demand made for stoney thank you for coming by judge mosley gordell stood didnt offer a hand to shake im thinking stoney didnt want to pay five million did he not have it maybe yall are checking his finances finding some holes i could see him taking off judge grimes blinked at him like he couldnt believe the words i wouldnt buy a single share of a penny stock from that guy and he had someone in the house here with him im pretty sure did you see someone gordell asked no but i felt watched stoney didnt want me in the house i asked him to lend me a book and he said no he didnt have one looked back three times at the windows in a twentysecond period but you didnt see anyone no i didnt but there was a beige van here thats not here anymore a chrysler i think i didnt notice the license plates and that made him feel stupid that if hed been so suspicious he should have made a note of it i dont think stoney vaughn has acted alone in this and i think this alex guy may be helping him we have a description of him we want people to be looking for him too thats fine grimes said give us the info well see if theres anything to it thank you judge gordell said well call you if since ive answered your questions while youve looked at me like i was a urine sample whit said maybe youll defrost slightly and help me id like to speak with ben vaughn and im guessing hes under your protection at the moment speak with him why for the inquest into the gilberttran murders hes recuperating probably not up to questioning gordell said he stood signaling the interview was complete and we have certainly not treated you like a urine sample sir he gave grimes a glance this is a judge i just need five minutes with him well ask him for you grimes said after a moments hesitation thank you whit said and stood judge mosley gordell said i understand youre a big fish in a little pond here but we think for a second youre interfering or fucking around with us youll be the smalltown magistrate in front of a federal magistrate you understand me sir i understand you sir whit said and if you dont take me seriously and follow up on this alex guy im going to call every television station in corpus christi houston and san antonio and tell them that the fbi is purposely ignoring findings presented by the encina county coroner me whit smiled it may only be news for a few minutes but itll be news gordells mouth worked like he had a bee lodged in his gums claudia saw ben saturday morning after the fbi and the police had questioned him further a guard stood outside his door watching the nurses she came into his room and he opened his eyes he looked pale a thick bruise on his face his dark hair littleboy tousled on the pillow thank god ben said and she came to the bed crawled in next to him hugged him he hugged back winced a little are you hurt they said you were okay the ribs a little but not bad his voice was throaty face hurts jesus im glad youre okay gar said he was going to he didnt danny shot him thats what your ex told me you spoke with david she sat up yeah ben said i mean he questioned me last night for about an hour around three in the morning or so once they really couldnt find stoney anywhere please be kidding he didnt sure claudia its fine if it helps them find my brother did david behave perfect gentleman thats somehow worse she touched his chest tell me what happened everything gar was furious about not getting the money he said he was going to rape you the other guy his name is zack she said zack then he freaked i wanted to reason with him tell him to call gar off but he belted me across the face with his gun he touched at the livid bruise on his battered nose his cheek when i woke up he had me tied and handcuffed in the forward cabins head where did he take you i think in circles he didnt know much about boats sweetie ben said then he panicked tried to call danny on his boat didnt get an answer danny never mentioned that he told me zack would probably kill you the dumb shit probably couldnt operate the radio right asking on the wrong channels but he did figure out the phone i heard him make a call asking someone to come and get him he was stuck out on the gulf in a big fucking boat he couldnt drive with a hostage crying about his boyfriend cussing stoney for not being on the boat and it all going down wrong you wouldve thought his car had broken down and he was calling roadside assistance but zack left gar he cut the lines i dont think so claudia from what i heard i think gar cut those to keep his boyfriend from interfering with him going after you claudia let out a long breath so someone came and rescued him not exactly he told me hed gotten the boat in close to shore and he didnt know how to drop the anchor but he was gonna swim in said all this to me through the closed door of the head i kept thinking hes gonna open it up shoot me then he says he doesnt want to face a murder charge says hell let me be if i just say gar and danny were behind it all maybe do him a favor not mention him im saying sure not a problem thinking hes just going to shoot me when it comes time for him to leave but then he was gone i didnt hear another boat draw close and i started hoping he didnt set the anchor we might be drifting into the intracoastal i was hoping to be a threat to navigation jesus itd mean people found me howd you get out of the handcuffs i found a little wrench under the sink had to pull it to me with my toes stoney probably left it there the last time he fixed a faucet he never puts up his crap so i used it to hammer the lock finally broke it and while im trying jupiter went aground im sweating bullets im thinking god am i sinking i smash the cuffs get out see that ive run aground on a little oystershell beach on a little strip of island not far off the intracoastal i could see a freighter in the distance heading down toward corpus zack tore all the wires out of the satellite phone and the radio i was so ready to be off that boat thinking maybe you could still be rescued i just got into the water and swam halfway to shore im thinking maybe i could have stayed on the boat set off a flare i was just mental reached encina pass he squeezed her claudia i thought for sure i know she kissed him then and he was gentle like he couldnt quite believe she was there he let the kiss linger and then said my brother theyll find him she sat up i want to talk to you about your brother zack or his friends they must have gone after stoney for the money your brother knew we had been kidnapped ben he didnt call the police he didnt tell anyone they said they would kill us claudia did he or did he not refuse to pay ransom bens mouth worked my brother wouldnt do that to us danny said the next morning that stoney had agreed to a trade thinking you were with danny and me so im assuming he hadnt paid a ransom the day before stoney said his computer systems were down he couldnt do the transfer claudia my brothers not some coldblooded monster you cant believe this of him i know you love your brother ben you heard him didnt you you heard him repeat back the account numbers for the transfer claud but he didnt have this imaginary emerald that danny wanted danny was fucking nuts you know that yes she said softly but your brother didnt call the police at any point the kidnappers took him before he could a judge my friend whit mosley saw him friday morning at his house looking like hell what if theres no virus ben he didnt want to move the five million no he couldnt move the money he mustve been waiting to hear from the kidnappers again zacks friends grabbed him its the best explanation you dont believe what danny said do you i honestly dont know what to think about stoney my brother bens voice broke if im wrong im sorry i hope to god im wrong stoney loves me she said nothing he was afraid they would hurt us if he called the police trying to convince himself convince her ben gar knew i was a cop he called me officer ben stared down at the sheets covering his lap did you tell them i was a cop no did your brother i dont want to talk about this anymore please my brother isnt a bad guy claudia we dont know the truth yet he moved slightly away from her on the bed he was too deep in denial i care about you she said i dont want you hurt he didnt look at her and she felt the little gap grow ben he let go of her hand she took his hand in answer squeezed hard dont say these things about my brother okay she said you need your rest she kissed his forehead im going to go for a while so you can sleep all right you need sleep ben said nothing and she went to the door claudia bens voice small low yeah if he didnt refuse to pay the ransom they came and took him didnt they they just dont give up on five million not when theres another option to get it i hope not ben i mean did he not think we were worth five million he could have made it back in a few years the way he worked the deals he cut god im his brother maybe they took him ben odd her tone of hoping that a guy got kidnapped that it could be a remotely positive thing but if he cant get to his money ben said wont they kill him ben was staying at the hospital at least through the day claudia tired but hating the sterile walls and wanting her own bed checked herself out around noon her mother tina accompanied her home fussing the whole way fluffing pillows fixing a pan of chicken enchiladas and a plate of chocolate chip cookies that claudia uncharacteristically had no appetite for claudia went to go lie down on her bed trying not to think about how stoney could betray ben so completely she was still exhausted and she catnapped loving the feel of her own pillows sheets the solidity of the bed she didnt like thinking about the water with nothing but the depths beneath her feet a knock on the door woke her tina entered with a thick envelope something from work the officer said you asked for it sweetie i dont want you working tiring yourself out thats okay mama claudia sat up put it on the bed ill look at it in a minute her mother did doused the lights again claudia waited mama was exhausted worn out from staying up most of the night fretting over her fifteen minutes later she glanced into the small den tina salazar lay on the couch snoring softly claudia covered her with a light blanket went back to her room and opened the file shed asked the port leo pd to get her what they could find from the new orleans pd on danny laffite and his suspected associates in the kidnapping she began to read alex had stayed away from stoney for the morning sleeping a little later in his new nobetter motel room dreaming of his dad the two of them diving for treasure in the shallow waters off the keys he hadnt slept well someone had knocked on his door at some point near midnight waking him instantly and hed crept to the door with his gun in hand finally peering through the peephole no one there he could hear teenagers laughing down the hall probably just kids but it unsettled his sleep and he didnt go back for a while wondering how to best get his sick father to costa rica without attracting too much attention he got up showered dressed turned on the local saturday morning tv news all stoney the missing financier nothing on danny laffite though nothing on the murders at black jack point but still he needed to get moving and he needed to take some precautions he drove the van over to the big grocery near the port leo harbor it was a chain superstore an heb the megachain in texas and the store was pink coral pink the whole building like all they sold was peptobismol he slipped on sunglasses and a marlins cap and went inside it was busy full of retirees and young babies families mexicans vietnamese anglos sunburned yankees asking where the juice was in their nasal whines he bought some doughnuts a coffee a small milk and a box of hair coloring time for a change go punkish blond cut the hair short dump the van at the corpus airport the cashier looked a little funny at him a guy buying blond hair coloring but bagged it up with the food and took his money alex was halfway across the parking lot when he saw helen dupuy she was walking toward the store just out of a truck an old beatup red truck walking with a monster of a guy bigbuilt freakugly face military burr of dark hair and he thought she might have seen him just two rows over if she hadnt been looking up all goggleeyed at this freak cant be helen he thought and he took a hard left heading away from his car asking himself what the hell he was doing stepping behind an suv peering at her maybe not helen it couldnt be her the two of them walked into the grocery now forty feet ahead of him and he turned and followed them thinking no way its her no way he kept his sunglasses and his cap on as he entered the store scanned the register lines the crowd of shoppers going their separate ways into the aisles didnt see them he looked to his left over at the bakery section clogged with morning pastry buyers and saw them the guy pulling helen through the maze of carts and screaming kids and tables of pies and doughnuts he followed hanging back trying to keep at an angle where the woman couldnt see him it was helen jesus she was wearing a halter a plain blue one not slutty it was a hot morning above the top of the halter on her back was a discolored hatch of lines the scars he mustve put on her skin when he flung her through the glass window big ugly and helen stopped a roundfaced man greeting big ugly with a call of gooch big ugly starting to chat introducing helen to the old man now ten feet away helens back still to him alex stood at the corner of the aisle where the bakery fed into the beerandwine section trying to hear the old man mustve been part deaf or just one of those old guys who likes to talk loud alex heard him say you take me out next week i got two buddies from dallas want to come down and get tight lines you open on wednesday morning might be busy let me check big ugly had a low rumble of a voice two kids arguing over a chocolate doughnut passed their mother chiding them and he missed what was said but then big ugly gooch said i got a hot spot for red drum over on the south side of the bay ill take you there but you got to keep it secret fred fred roared yeah im your man for keeping secret fishing spots i call you tomorrow we set it up and think about where maybe we land some big tarpon fine big ugly said a fishing guide alex thought he heard the conversation end held his breath glued to the floor waiting for helen and this gooch to turn into the beerandwine section and see him ten seconds he risked a glance around the corner they had moved past the baked goods helen holding a big bag of bagels moving off into the milk and dairy sticking close to gooch turning to smile up at him he knew the line of her jaw the slant of her smile her what to do suddenly the huge grocery store felt cramped as a cell he moved past the registers out into the lot he hurried back to his car scrambled inside how think it through someone made a connection to helen dupuy and brought her to port leo how who jimmy bird jimmy had called him twice at that motel when he was in new orleans in his room nervous about the several nights they planned to spend on patchs land searching with the metal detectors to find the buried cache giving him the motel number in new orleans was a mistake jimmy dead his phone records must have been searched for some reason found the calls to his room at the bayou mee why would a fishing guide bring helen to port leo he fumbled for his cell phone dialed stoney at the fishing cottage theres a whore i met in new orleans here at the freaking grocery stoney so so i met her when i was taking care of danny you dumb shit she knows what i look like get rid of her shes got a sixsix musclebound bodyguard with her i think hes a local fishing guide you mustve made a mistake she blew me nine times in four days alex said i know what she looks like man what exactly do you want me to do about it alex dont take that tone with me asshole i got my own problems they have got my picture all over the news this morning christ what ben must think of me like you care hes my brother but he was too heavy wasnt he stoney youre not funny stoney said if i were your brother id shoot you in the knees for what you did alex said im coming over there i got a couple things i need to do but ill be there soon he hung up weighed the options run the mess had gotten deeper it was now time to get the hell out of the entire situation he thought about following this gooch and helen and risk shed see him she might be even more dangerous than stoney no it was too much right now he needed to act but go on the defensive he waited saw them return to the truck holding cups of coffee and a small plastic bag they pulled out of the lot drove down the street past the harbor to the curve of port leo beach he followed four cars behind big uglys truck turned in parked alex drove by did a uturn drove by again big ugly and helen walked to one of the picnic tables near the beach sat down pulled bagels out of the bag a little plastic knife cream cheese a breakfast picnic by the bay he couldnt get closer without parking near them and he couldnt risk it he turned and drove off from the park scared now for the first time and feeling mad stupid stoney stupid jimmy bird alex went back to the motel scarfed down his breakfast without tasting it he went through the encina county phone book going through the yellow pages for the fishing guides most had pictures of sunsquinting men smiling next to gargantuan fish no picture of big ugly but one ad small in the corner was for dont ask fishing services just listed a phone number and in little quotes below read go with gooch alex dialed the number a machine answered youve reached leonard guchinski and dont ask fishing im probably booked but leave a message and ill give you a call back alex hung up leonard guchinski now he had a name alex applied the blond hair coloring forcing himself to be consistent and careful and while he waited twenty minutes to shower it off before finishing the treatment he checked and rechecked the clips in his gun he suspected he would need several it was just shaping up to be that kind of day i got some business to tend to today gooch said whits arranged for you to meet a guy who does criminal sketches describe alex to him hes driving in from corpus then the folks on the boat next to us they invited you to sail with them while im gone he slathered cream cheese on his bagel theyre friends of whits too business about alex maybe gooch said do you know where alex is nope but you know something gooch she frowned it was a little crazy this girl could read him easier than most people whom he presented the blank page to and hed only known her a couple of days i just think youll have fun with duff and trudy on their boat for a few hours duff trudy dont hold their names against them theyre bankers they got to have names like that fdic requirement did whit tell them what i am what are you helen im a she stopped as though the word had gotten harder to say see its a blank fill it in with what you like do you not want to have sex with me because you think youre gonna fix me i havent known you long enough to have sex with you he said she shook her head youre a strange man gooch youre not the first to notice this fake kidnapping isnt going to work stoney thought he had hardly slept and he picked up the phone once to call home to talk to ben but then he thought the phones might be tapped and maybe ben was at the hospital facing the walls of the cottage he wondered if prison would be so very different he thought of his friends the little socialclimbing debs he got to bed his house he was a deal maker it was how he made his money and the long night made him think that perhaps he should cut a deal the odds were shifting lucy was unstable alex was cracking and if there was a woman in town who knew alex from the time in new orleans well he thought alex was jumping at shadows he tried to construct a series of lies that would cover his ass more thoroughly but could stitch nothing credible together that left him clean enough he picked up the phone to call the police no he couldnt do it not the police they werent deal makers a lawyer yes a lawyer to negotiate the deal a highpowered lawyer he paced back and forth trying to work up the courage the worst was danny if he could convince people alex had killed danny well then but the thought of not haying the gold the eye made his chest hurt take it for the value maybe just leave the country and the knock at the door made him jump alex the door had no peephole and the small windows meant you couldnt easily peek out of the curtains without giving yourself away so stoney vaughn opened the door not alex a big ugly hulk of a guy stood there and he belted stoney hard in the chest landing him on his back on the floor breathing was a memory he stared up at the ugly guy mr vaughn how you doing no dont get up dont talk the man closed the door behind him catch your breath you gonna puke thats a nice rug let me find a bucket no you okay he picked stoney up by the neck like a schoolboy hauled by the scruff to the principals office dumped him on the couch pulled a wicked fat black foreign gun out of the back of his pants and let stoney see it puh puh please i admire politeness are you asking me to please not shoot you stoney managed a nod i wont at least not yet not for the next two minutes but were gonna talk you understand me the ugly man leaned down close my names gooch i think youre trying to fuck around with friends of mine you see this gun that kills you in a second easy you see this fist gooch held up a big thickfingered closed hand that looked more like an oversize hammer than a fist that kills you slow it takes its time after about oh twenty or thirty punches when the bones are all broken up and starting to stick out the skin and im still pounding on you and my knuckles get abraded and i get in a fucking foul mood gooch smiled you dont want the old fist of death do you stoney shook his head got the force of his breath back with a shudder how how did i find you thats what i want to talk about you and lucy gilbert stoneys mouth moved and why youre holed up in a cottage when lots and lots of folks are missing you right now i i didnt do anything wrong he managed who knows youre here lucy thats all how about a guy who likes first names beginning with a what alex albert allen whats his name this week asshole i dont know what youre talking about gooch cocked the gun jammed it into stoneys temple this is a sovietmade shootyadickov very sensitive it misfires a lot he pressed it harder as if trying to reach stoneys brains are you willing to put that much trust in soviet engineering alex his name is alex black oh christ stoneys eyes bugged is the treasure here no where is it i i dont know alex has it wheres alex he moves around a lot stoney said i dont know where he is i dont believe you stoney the shootyadickov doesnt believe you i dont have it please mister gooch studied him seemed to think about it he dragged stoney over to the phone placed a call waited hung up called another number waited said its gooch call me hung up he pushed stoney back to the couch cmon were leaving you cant kidnap me dont whine youre already kidnapped right gooch hauled up stoney pushed him through the door he pulled him away from the cottage into a dense grove of twisted live oaks beyond the thick grasses above the beach a beaten red pickup a big ford was parked there this is how it is gooch said i have absolutely no compunction about shooting you you bug me im firing youre going to sit on the floor hands where i can see them you behave youre going to be fine im kind of the opinion youre not the big bad shark in the sea is that right alex alex is bad stoney said hell fucking kill you he wanted to say yeah well i killed a man but suddenly saw it wouldnt intimidate this guy wouldnt make him blink gooch shoved him into the truck revved the engine tore out of the grove of oaks onto the road he was a quarter mile from the highway when a beige van turned in hard headed toward them what does alex drive gooch asked stoney still crouched on the floor beige van stoney said hello there gooch said he leaned out the window opened fire gravel and crushed shell exploded from the road near the tires sparks flew from the end of the van jesus stoney yelled gooch floored the truck and despite its beaten appearance the engine roared into sweet precise power the road was rough part of the rustic charm and gooch left the highway tearing through a grassy field taking a hard right careening down a rocky swath of weed and stone and roaring out onto a thin strip of beach itself did you know its legal to drive on the beach in texas gooch said fascinating against the law most places yes stoney managed he wondered if he could grab the steering wheel wrench it stop this guy long enough for alex to shoot him gooch gave him a long glance i can smell stupid thoughts man dont do it ill kill you stoney stayed put his face buried in the worn upholstery of the truck feeling it rumble off the beach back onto grassland then back onto the smooth road the van couldnt navigate down the long spill of rock to the sandy wet of the beach and alex drove back to the road the van heaving like a horse and peeled back toward the main highway his only hope of cutting the guy off gooch in that same red truck leaving stoneys hideaway shooting at him the gun in the hand rocksteady he worked his own gun out kept it in his left hand steered righthanded the van rumbled onto the main highway narrowly missing a mercedes with an older couple the driver laid on the horn the woman lifted a manicured middle finger in salute and alex nearly shot it off instead he swerved around them bolted south to where the beach came closer to the main road he kept glancing at the rearview mirror thinking the red truck might burst from the trees or from another feeder road he drove all the way down to where a curve of beach came close to the road no sign of the truck he patrolled up and down the stretch of highway for a half hour but the only red truck he saw was new and had two women in it pulling a horse trailer finally he returned to the fishing cottage front door closed but unlocked no sign of stoney no sign of a struggle so stoney had been kidnapped for real maybe gooch was a partner danny laffite had that no one knew about or maybe stoney had switched sides decided to get out from under alexs thumb gotten himself a new partner to take care of alex he swore screw worrying about getting the emerald he should have killed stoney the moment he figured out stoney betrayed him he felt the sting of his own greed where the hell do i start looking for them he tried to calm his thoughts say stoney decided to bolt decided to hire muscle to cut out alex hed have to call did stoney have a cell with him alex went to the cordless phone in the cottage there was a redial button he pressed it an answering machine clicked on a low comfortable drawl hi youve reached the office of justice of the peace whitman mosley office hours are nine am alex clicked off whit mosley that young judge in the loud shirt who came looking for stoney to ask about the murdered old people so what the hell did a gunhappy gooch have to do with a judge he paced the floor for a minute maybe stoney cracked decided to cut a deal and called the judge no police cars and sirens and miranda rights would have been involved judges didnt hire mercenaries to kidnap people but maybe it was even worse maybe they knew about the emerald the treasure maybe the judge and gooch were just chasing it for themselves alex could see it stoney babbling that he knew where a fat emerald was and knew a guy whod hid millions in rare coins and could they help him cut a deal maybe a cop or a judge would think well id like me some of that even assuming stoney hadnt cracked gooch had already found stoney here at the cottage they must know enough and nothing on the news yet about the treasure no one else knew but they had stoney who had the eye and could completely ruin alex part three the edge of the world for thirty years he said ive sailed the seas and seen good and bad better and worse fair weather and foul provisions running out knives going and what not well now i tell you i never seen good come o goodness yet him as strikes first is my fancy dead men dont bite thems my views amen so be it the life philosophy of israel hands pirate in robert louis stevensons treasure island the lunchtime heat wasnt unbearable the breeze a cool comfort whit met dr parker and a bookish attractive woman on the waterfront dock of a small restaurant near the port leo harbor for saturday lunch dr parker introduced the woman as dr iris dominguez with texas a ampm corpus christi pronounced her name the spanish way eeres the bones from the dig are in iriss car trunk dr parker said i can sign custody of them back over to you after lunch if you like whit saw the waitress approaching for the drink order keep her smile frozen in place at the mention of bones hes really not a maniac whit told her the day is young iris dominguez said she had a beautiful voice soft but forceful and a cool unfussy elegance whit liked her immediately they ordered hamburgers and onion rings parker asking for a salty dog iris and whit ordering beers so you want to know about the coins and youre bribing us with lunch parker scooped a tortilla chip with salsa and popped it into his mouth yes sir why not just ask the sheriffs office i could but im not popular with law enforcement right now i just insulted the fbi iris dominguez raised an eyebrow parker laughed and why did you think that was productive ill see if it gets the results i want whit said plus i wanted to thank you and dr dominguez for your help he smiled at iris you identified the relics that was extremely helpful to me youre welcome youve made my weekend interesting the waitress arrived with their drinks parker licked the salt from the glass rim sucked down half the grapefruit juice and vodka in a hard swallow dr dominguez waited until the waitress had departed okay what do you know about coins they dont stay in my pocket long enough whit said let me give you a quick primer these kinds of coins werent treated like how we treat quarters and pennies and dimes they were created to make it easy to move massive amounts of wealth from mexico to spain they might be struck in mexico shipped and then immediately melted down in europe she sipped at her beer these are called milled bust coins the last produced spanish colonial coins the gold coins come in denominations of eight four two and one escudo the silvers are reales obviously the gold coins are worth more she dug in her purse pulled out a file of photos i took some pictures of the coins nice big blowups so i can show you why these coins are particularly unusual she spread the photos out one group to one side the other by parkers dwindling cocktail these all have a typical reverse side she said see the pillars and shield typical of many spanish colonial coins and these have double rosettes under the pillars very unusual she pulled the other section of photos into the center of the table the obverse sides of the coins often have either a monarchs shield like british paper money having the queen on it or a design of the emperors head which you can see these have most of these are ferdinand vii dont you think he had a weak chin she pointed with a pencil tip yes whit said iris flipped the picture back over to the pillars to the letters encircling the design you see the mo that means monteblanco next thats the denomination this is an eight escudo and next are the initials of the assayer here thats et esteban torres the official of the monteblanco mint the other side has a date here this coin was minted in monteblanco was at that time the newest mexican mint just opened freshly minted you could say iris doesnt get out enough parker said does it show i think youre brilliant whit said she smiled and parker said hey just friends whit thought right iris tapped the photos with her fingernail so i dove into the historical archives called a professor friend of mine in mexico city to run some local checks down there for me a large cache of the original silver and gold coins minted at monteblanco with this unusual doublerosette design was being shipped to spain right after being minted aboard a schooner called santa barbara but according to the records santa barbara was lost at sea in march of somewhere south of cuba i see whit said again jean laffites time his heart neared his throat this would make jason salingers day but the records of the time indicate that the weather was fair throughout that time in the caribbean so santa barbara probably didnt fall victim to a gulf storm whit cleared his throat i will embarrass myself a little now but what if the coins were buried as part of a treasure yeah i didnt tell iris that part parker said i didnt want to influence her data you couldnt have iris said dryly youre talking about the locks the latches i identified theyre from the same period as the coins you think the coins were originally buried with those relics and skeletons whit lowered his voice leaned forward yes i do i think jean laffite took santa barbara as his last prize and he had no time to take and bank it under a false name in new orleans he was forced out of galveston in the spring of navies from britain spain and the us would have been hunting him in the gulf he had no base to hide nowhere to run so you think he buried the santa barbara stash hoping to reestablish later iris said he just never got reestablished whit said is this too big of a jump iris dominguez sipped at her beer the coins have to have been somewhere for the past one hundred eighty years theyre worn but not from human handling he thought of lucy her claim the coins were patchs you dont think theyve been in a collection all these years no judge considering what else youve discovered i dont think so she closed her eyes oh my god the historical significance enormous an actual buried pirate treasure whits throat felt dry more valuable than the monetary significance i dont know ill see if i can locate a copy of the manifest from santa barbara from the archives see how much gold and silver it carried but even manifests didnt always represent an accurate count there was a lot of corruption theft in the financial system then sometimes up to forty percent of the treasure on a ship wouldnt even be on the manifest to minimize taxes and the monteblanco mint was destroyed in a peasant uprising in coins from monteblanco are exceedingly rare it could be quite large then it could be millions whit the accounts of santa barbara i found also mentioned that the ship carried a noted colombian emerald no emeralds in mexico its not a gemrich geography but lots of incredible emeralds out of colombia this one was particularly noteworthy the catholic priests nicknamed it the devils eye oh lord whit said he thought of claudias story of danny laffites demands the archives in mexico do they have any information on this emerald they could send to me ill ask dr dominguez said judge what is it whats wrong dr parker asked you dont happen to know the value of the emerald do you i should imagine it to be worth a few million and of course if its become laffites treasure and its provable then the value probably triples dr dominguez said iris whit said can you help me find out how someone might try to sell this devils eye or these coins sure she shook her head in pleased amazement actual pirate treasure actual pirates parker said can i keep those bones for a while they just got way more interesting to me they must have been the unlucky bastards who helped laffite bury the treasure then got killed for their trouble dead men tell no tales and so on so youre the famous whit ben vaughn sat on the edge of the hospital bed dressed in loose khakis and a tshirt i didnt know i was famous to claudia and the fbi claudia thinks the world of you he didnt say what the fbi thought i think a lot of her too whit said and it didnt quite come out right and ben glanced up toward him thanks for agreeing to see me what did you want to talk about whit sat on the edge of the rooms institutional recliner your brother i saw him so i heard ben sat up the fbi told me wheres he at ben i think the same gang that was after us took him he was the initial target so danny laffite kidnapped your brother and sank his own boat i dont know maybe stoney hid so this same gang couldnt find him maybe ben sounded less sure but he what leaves you and claudia to die not very brotherly ben said nothing the bruise on his cheek had gotten nastier with the passing hours turning black and lemonyellow i told claudia he wouldnt abandon us he just didnt want to tell the police he didnt want to endanger our lives whit sat next to him i have five older brothers two of them im extremely close to two im not so close to but i love them very much one i practically hate but i still love him at the same time hes a primegrade asshole but hes still and always will be my brother he matters to me ben said nothing youre not helping him ben if you know where he might be tell us we all need some answers from him listen stoney was in a panic for all the swagger hes not good with situations hes not firmly in control of or cant get control of all his brokerage firms computer systems were down well see but stoney took them down ben he sabotaged his own network from his home pc i just saw the computer forensics report the corpus police sent copies to the sheriffs office here he broke the systems so he couldnt transfer the ransom funds ben stared at his bare feet that still doesnt mean he hasnt been kidnapped your brother financed treasure dives in florida id like to know more about those and youre here exactly in what capacity ben said tuesday im conducting a formal inquest a hearing into the murders of patch gilbert and thuy tran you heard about that yeah the guy whos the number one suspect and who apparently killed himself had some rather rare and valuable gold coins in his pocket theyve been identified as being from the same time period as jean laffites pirating bens eyes widened i dont think danny laffite sounds quite so crazy now do you listen danny laffite was a nutcase ask any of stoneys friends who are in this laffite league stoney was the big fish in that pond lot of money wellknown popular he was the leader and thats who a loser like danny gloms on to i think if theres any truth to this danny laffite had some delusion about stoney knowing where this treasure was and thinking stoney wouldnt tell him he stood a little shaky whit steadied him im fine ben flinched slightly at whits touch on his elbow sorry i know youve been through an ordeal i i know my brother a lot better than you do judge youre claudias friend and i know you both mean well but youre wrong my brother wouldnt risk my life like you say he walked into the bathroom splashed cold water on his face did you ever hear danny or gar or zack mention a guy named alex no how about albert exley no allen eck no ben dried his face i think yall find out who the other two kidnappers are youre not going to find they got any kind of treasure or archaeological connection they didnt give a shit about what danny raved about they used him thought he was nuts he had the boat and hed given them a good target in my brother they just wanted cash pure and simple and they thought they had a lowrisk way to get it he paused maybe danny laffite killed those people on the point with the dead guy you mentioned what a freak your brothers lucky having a defender like you whit wondered just what ben knew how far he would go to protect his brother ben tilted his head thank you ill let you rest whit said judge yeah you and claudia was there ever anything there the question surprised whit no were just friends good ben said claudia thought a good police file on a major case should contain not only the pertinent data but read like a wellcrafted short story or novel the motivations the fears the human failings should all be subtly suggested between the lines of forensic data and witness statements david thought her attitude nuts when they were married told her if she wanted that from a file she needed to take a creative writing course the new orleans police made a guess that the redhead called zack was one zachary james simard so the investigators thoughtfully sent his record along the photo was indeed zack sallow face pouty lips calculating glare degree in finance from lsu from a family from lake charles suspected of handling money and accounts for a drugandprostitutionfueled crime ring based in new orleans that stretched eastward to pensacola and over to beaumont five years ago hed done two years in a state pen in louisiana on a marijuanapossession charge hed stayed clean since or at least clean enough to avoid charges thus far and therefore avoid the pressure to testify to make a deal with the feds he had dropped out of sight two weeks ago gar johnson aka gary paul jackson born gerald paul jones suspected of being a hired gun suspected in a slaying in biloxi and a double homicide in new orleans the victims were all drug dealers who the police suspected skimmed profits the pair in new orleans had been a young married couple both mediocre jazz pianists tapping a living out of the secondtier club scene dealing coke to the wellheeled on the side every finger on the couples hands had been broken before they were shot both the man and the woman had been raped and then their bodies dumped in a ditch in algiers a tough neighborhood claudias stomach roiled gar had served two stretches one for armed robbery and hed been at angola prison during zack simards time there they had been released within a month of each other and both headed for new orleans maybe theyd been sweeties in prison she turned the page daniel villars mouton from an oldmoney family he was the last of the moutons living in a grand house in the garden district but danny had a record petty theft shoplifting history books from a bookstore then the charge of forgery she knew about that had been dropped a brief stint in a pricey mental clinic in metairie apparently checked in and then checked out by his only cousin the villars middle name was real a family name handed down with pride and dannys reading about the great love of laffites life apparently fueled the delusion he was descended from the pirate one diagnosis of schizophrenia another diagnosis of bipolar disorder a charge of marijuana possession that had been pleabargained into nothing maybe the drug connection was how hed met gar and zack beneath these papers were notes and reports compiled from the investigation into the murder of dannys cousin less than a month ago the man had died in a burglary gone wrong a back window had been forced phillip villars age fifty and a widowed antiques dealer in the french quarter staying at his cousin daniels house during the remodeling of his own home had apparently surprised an intruder and been killed with a single gunshot to the forehead left dead in a downstairs hallway his cousin daniel villars mouton found the body later that evening after returning from a trip and phoned police danny was questioned extensively given his background but he had an ironclad alibi visiting friends in charleston south carolina for the past week every hour accounted for and neighbors and friends said for all his eccentricities danny got along well with his cousin the last two members of a faded family note on the file that the new orleans police had no further leads just a report that danny mouton quickly dropped out of sight after his cousins funeral hed gone into hiding she thought running and hiding from stoney maybe not everything danny had said was a lie she covered her face thought of his odd mix of earnestness gallantry he had saved her life when he could have let gar rape and murder her and absolute craziness there might have been a decent person in there someone who wanted to accomplish much derailed by psychosis and drugs a wasted life she closed the folder fingers tapped at the bedroom door claudias mother stuck her head in davids here she said brought brownies your favorite tina retained a great fondness for david thanks claudia followed her mother into her little living room david stood there in fulldress uniform sweaty patches under his arms his stetson in his big freckled hands tina salazar disappeared into the kitchen with the brownies where she could still hear but pretend not to i just wanted to see if you were okay david said you phoned this morning david im still the same but still you had such a horrible ordeal hon hon like they were still married still tethered to each other he hadnt wanted the divorce at times she had wondered if parting was the right thing if perhaps she had sold him short maddening one minute sweet the next and she finally tired of the inconsistencies theyre still searching the bay for danny laffites body david said assuming hes dead in the first place or that he drowned when his boat sank but nothing have they raised dannys boat yet probably tomorrow where do you think he is i dont think danny would give up she said its entirely possible he killed stoney vaughn he might have killed him dumped the body somewhere but he thinks this jewel and gold are in port leo he wont be leaving she turned back to david i absolutely dont see him sinking his boat for any reason though i guess i think hes dead she wondered for a moment and if hes not you think maybe he might try to find you maybe he grabbed stoney the boat wrecked and their bodies are in the bay maybe david said glancing at tina im going for a walk tina salazar announced just down to the store for some milk to go with the brownies she kissed claudias cheek patted davids shoulder scurried out of the apartment she wants us to be alone david said i think you might be overanalyzing she said although she knew he was right can i ask you how long youve been seeing ben vaughn she owed him no answers but since he was involved in the case there was no point in arguing she wished though hed sent another investigator to talk to her of course he wouldnt not long a couple of weeks very casually is he nice to you very nice and pleasant did you expect he would be an asshole his brother sounds like a prime one i only met stoney once she said except for maybe back in high school i think stoney vaughn got scared and he ran to protect his money and now he cant surface i also think your boyfriends protecting him if he blocks this investigation in any way hes going to be in serious trouble wouldnt that just be perfect how disappointing for you it wouldnt be your case stoney vaughns house is in county jurisdiction just might be mine he sat down in the reading chair next to the sofa so what does that mean david youre going to make trouble for ben you could help us claudia find the brother get ben to talk she said nothing oh gee would that ruin your shiny new relationship if you helped us out dont be this way i really hope youre not protecting ben yourself claud know anything about your boyfriends brother youre not sharing places he might go resources he might have absolutely not she stood i told you the fbi everything danny laffite told me and thats being followed up on david said especially whatever grudge danny had against stoney vaughn danny laffite did have a cousin murdered in new orleans last month he was telling you the truth were determining if stoney vaughn was in new orleans those days oh dont let this be true she thought it will kill ben if your boyfriend the term said like he had mud in his mouth knew anything about his brother committing a murder hes an accessory youre correct she said quietly but if you start an unfounded witchhunt against ben im going to have your badge for it promise you david whoa passion havent seen that from you in a while dont bait me i wont bite he hesitated the last thing in the world i want is to see you hurt unless you can do the hurting im going to tell you something no one knows its not to make you mad or to try to win sympathy or to gain advantage he crossed his arms i still love you claudia said nothing so i dont want you hurt by anyone including me he stood i get around you my mouth starts running because im mad still im trying my best not to be enjoy the brownies ill call you if we hear anything about vaughn or danny laffite all right she didnt know what else to say she watched from the window as david went down the stairs putting his stetson back on heading to his sheriffs department cruiser she watched him pull out of the parking lot she picked up the phone wanting to hear bens voice but knowing he needed his rest instead she went back to the bedroom and opened the file from new orleans phillip villars the wrong place the wrong time single bullet in the middle of the forehead thuy tran died in a similar way if stoney had been involved where was this journal now the one phillip villars had been killed for if danny was right stoney had it or knew where it was she had access to the house to ben that might help her and she could do it to protect ben yes do that find the evidence against his brother and ben may hate you her mother came back with the milk and out of duty claudia ate two brownies nice of david to bring these tina said yes claudia said he says he still loves me tina stopped a brownie halfway to her mouth hes full of crap claudia said she told her what david said davids all angry and hopeful at the same time tina said maybe he loves you but he wants you to squirm a bit sweetie feel as torn as he does and if he can get you to sabotage your relationship with ben better for him he thinks youre not taking his side this was a change today im taking your side tina said rolling her eyes enjoy the moment but davids right she said i could get to ben faster than anyone else could if hes holding back you cops you can never let anything be tina ate her brownie claudia kissed her mothers cheek i think ill go by the hospital see ben but she didnt instead claudia drove to copano flats toward the big vaughn house i dont think lucys very interesting as a suspect anymore david said hed run into whit at the coke machine in the courthouse hallway whit in the office to use the faster internet connection than what he had at home david doing whatever he did on a saturday he had duty you got a new mouse to play with whit could guess where this was going jimmy bird killed those old folks no question his tire tracks match the tracks found on the gilbert land same gun killed him as killed mrs tran i just made your inquest real easy thank you now whats interesting to me is your theory about how maybe stoney vaughn had a connection to old jimmy whit fed quarters into the machine selected root beer waited for the can to drop or wow even better if ben vaughn did now wouldnt that get your nipples hard be grateful for small mercies im leaving your girlfriend alone he handed whit the saturday edition of the port leo mariner the semiweekly local paper nasty letter to the editor in there about you you pissed off the other half of the gilbert family bring that back when youre done would you i got a new puppy im training whit didnt open the paper wouldnt give david the satisfaction david got a coke from the machine given whats in that paper you might have a crowd at your inquest with a recall petition david may i give you a friendly word of advice what youre never getting her back whit said ever and i dont think itd make you happy anyway so you might as well get over being mad at claudia and all her friends you have to work with you ever want to be sheriff its never going to happen as long as you keep pissing on people he turned and walked off ill bring your paper back when im done whit took the paper back to his office shut the door hed been searching for information on the devils eye emerald and santa barbara on the internet impatient to wait on what iris dominguez and her colleagues might find hed found one site devoted to famous lost jewels that included a description of the devils eye there was no photo of course and the actual existence of the eye was questioned by the article the emeralds supposed weight estimated by modern standards to be just shy of two kilograms was listed its story told as part of the billions in mineral and gemological wealth mined from the new world and dispatched to fill the spanish treasury estimated value of the devils eye named by a disapproving priest of the viceroy who claimed the weakwilled stared at it as though hypnotized ranged from a million to four million us dollars having been lost for so long its legend and value had grown his phone rang whit mosley its iris listen i talked with the gemologists in mexico you asked how you might sell an emerald like the devils eye not in a pawnshop right dont joke my friends say there is an underground market for emeralds and its controlled by emerald traders in colombia you know colombia suffers much violence and corruption prominent emerald traders there have been accused of sponsoring rightwing paramilitary groups these are dangerous men and these men would be the buyers for the devils eye if one wished to get the maximum amount of profit yes for a stone like the devils eye thered be much competition so our seller has to have the balls to deal with rich colombian extremists how reassuring i thought you should know ill let you know what else i learn as soon as i hear anything he thanked her hung up the phone his stomach felt a little unsettled hed tried to imagine disposing of a treasure how exactly would you go about doing this the coins could be melted down or sold in small batches to collectors but the emerald if it was as grand as he thought it must be colombian rightwingers how many guns bombs bribes could the devils eye buy that the case could move into international crime rings and violent politics made his throat go dry he thought i bet triple a and stoney are gone they got that emerald and took off to bogota and well never get them he opened the newspaper to the letters to the editor suzanne gilbert was a better painter than writer but the letter still stung the rant was adverb heavy accused judge mosley of malfeasance in ignoring the beneficiary of patch gilberts death and asked for an investigation into judge mosleys inquest and finances perhaps suggesting a bribe had been paid he glanced at his phone the message light blinked no doubt the outraged voters of encina county calling for his head maybe he clicked the phone on one hangup four messages from voters asking for an explanation about suzannes letter not angry but now curious his cell phone beeped and he answered it hoping it wasnt another voter wanting a oneonone explanation youre not going to be happy with me gooch said im afraid to ask could you get me a legal definition of kidnapping because i dont think i technically kidnapped stoney vaughn i prefer to think of it as protective custody whits mouth opened then closed you asshole that other guy triple a although since i shot at him im thinking were on a firstname basis this alex guy he drives a beige chrysler van by the way i think he might have meant harm to poor stoney here i found stoney at a fishing cottage in laurel point weve moved on how did you know stoney was at this fishing cottage that will upset you like im not already upset i followed lucy i absolutely do not understand i followed lucy whits stomach lurched why gooch ive never trusted her sorry where are you if i tell youre in trouble with the law and i think i should keep you free and clear im already an accessory to kidnapping if i dont report you stoney went with me willingly hes sure willing now arent you stoney hey stoney calling to him loud an echo in the room yeah hes nodding bigtime hes a happy guy gooch where are you see you cant always take the direct approach judge stoney and i are going to have an extensive chat here shortly were going to find out who exactly alex is what he knows where hes at and then how lucys involved in all this find out what he knows about poor patch and thuy its gonna be fun and educational gooch dont then ill call you and fill you in i wont say its me then you do what you think best consider it an extended anonymous tip gooch you asshole dont do this helens out boating with duff and trudy smith so she should be out of harms way take care of her okay shes a good kid she can stay on my boat long as she wants bye whitman dont turn your back on lucy he hung up whit dialed goochs cell phone no answer he called the marina where gooch docked dont ask the marina master said yeah goochs boat was there just fine did he want to leave a message at least gooch wasnt out on the water conducting a floating inquisition he cursed gooch he cursed stoney vaughn no idea where they could be but there had been that brief echo when gooch called to stoney so a big space covered roof a big space but private so gooch could have his extended perhaps violent chat with stoney now where might that be could be the old high school gym awaiting a teardown in a month or so there was a soundstage at an old television studio now empty and for sale on the edge of town possibly or there was a marina on the north edge of the county past the flats abandoned since being the part of the docks burned a year ago but the big metal covering and high roof of the old marina were still there no one used it and gooch had talked about buying it from the uninterested unmotivated owners in houston whit grabbed his car keys he had to stop this reason with gooch the thought was nearly alien the fbi had the vaughn house but the agents knew who claudia was and let her in im getting the house ready for ben to come home from the hospital she said and the two agents nodded and went back to their phones and laptops she searched carefully and as inconspicuously as she could ignoring the nagging feeling that said she had no right to do this first stoneys bedroom she found nothing of interest except a wad of a thousand dollars in cash tucked in the back of the underwear drawer she left the cash alone the bathroom produced nothing but a daunting cache of toilet paper fourteen different scents of highdollar cologne a nearly empty box of condoms and expired cold medications she went to the top of the staircase and glanced downstairs she could hear the drift of the agents voices from the kitchen talking on their phones discussing the coordinated search for stoney vaughn there had been a sighting in san antonio a couple of hours away of a man who looked like stoney the most promising lead thus far she went to the study at the end of the hallway books lined the shelves stoney had not struck her as a book person and many of the books looked too pristine to have been read lots of recent hardcover bestsellers crime fiction investing and finance biographies of business leaders but one whole wall on the history of piracy on archaeology and nautical salvage on jean laffite and texas history she browsed through them but decided as a hiding place it was too obvious he wouldnt hide the journal here maybe a safedeposit box see if the fbi had access to that or ben if he could be convinced there was a pc on stoneys desk shoved to one side the desk was in disarray she suspected the fbi had sat down and copied the hard disk to see if there were any clues as to who had stoney or where he might have gone easier than going through the rigmarole of getting actual custody of the hard drive claudia sat down powered up the pc and opened stoneys email application what are you doing ben said from the doorway what are you doing out of the hospital she said i couldnt stay there not with my brother missing i checked myself out im okay he leaned against the doorway what are you doing on stoneys computer she took her hands off the keyboard sending an email she said coolly with a smile is that okay she had wanted to see if there had been an email from danny laffite or other laffite leaguers or patch gilbert or anyone connected to the case maybe stoney made online reservations to go somewhere maybe his browser had a history suggesting travel sites hed visited sending an email from here i just remembered something from when i was on dannys boat she said its better to get it down in writing than give a statement she stood turning off the system as if sending the email was no big deal claudia you were spying no its not my case i dont have a warrant i really was just logging on okay the first lie to him how does it taste in your mouth he turned and walked away she followed him to his bedroom watched him lie down on the bed put his arm over his eyes im sorry ben its in your nature to pry pry is an ugly word im trying to help you and im trying to find your brother please dont get involved in this you know where hes at not with certainty he said in a low voice you think theyve bugged my room of course not ben so im supposed to tell you and betray my brother he betrayed you innocent till proven guilty the authorities find that stoneys involved in any crime and they think youre protecting him theyre going to come after you wholehog your life could be ruined babe he closed his eyes opened them if i think i know where hes at and i tell you youll tell them she made the decision no i wont right claudia youre a cop you have to whys he hiding i think hes ashamed of not paying maybe he doesnt have the five million to pay so hes humiliated and he ran then he didnt commit a crime so this is a private matter between the two of you ill take you to him ben if you know where hes at you can work it out then he can come forward would you let a guy who wouldnt pay his brothers ransom handle your finances claudia thats what hes afraid of the public response his clients will dump him hell be ruined hell lose this house everything its not the publics business he sabotaged his own computer systems to keep his money safe ben said itll get out hell be ruined because he panicked ben finding him is the only way to help him he cant hide for ever where do you think he is let me sleep on it he said ill give him another day so youve given up this hewaskidnapped thing we would have heard a ransom demand by now ben said dont you think as a kidnapper goes youre okay stoney said jesus at least the foods tasty he had his nerve back once he saw that gooch wasnt going to take a pair of pliers or a blowtorch to his feet or his balls right now they were eating chinese takeout sitting at a metal desk in the back of the warehouse after they had driven out of port leo the truck ambling along stoney still crouched on the floorboards gooch had said your choices are two you either help me or you end up dead in the gulf tough call ill help you stoney said from the floorboard of the car i expect complete honesty i dont get it youre dead you understand yes first chance for honesty did you kill patch gilbert and thuy tran no i didnt thank god he could say that and be honest do you know who did yeah alex a pause no one could have stopped him a person of conscience would have stopped him but we wont judge you on your obvious deficiencies gooch said youre right i didnt but it wasnt planned they werent supposed to be there give a little ground he thought dealing with gooch was a negotiation not so different from the deals hed cut when he worked in venture capital he thought suddenly that yes he could handle this how comforting how deep in is lucy gilbert she knew we were getting the treasure off patchs land because he refused to sell to me i offered him too much for his land he checked on me found out i was into treasure hunting and he started wondering if maybe there was something valuable hidden on his land what with me offering a price i thought hed never say no to he made the connection about laffite although he didnt have any proof it just dug his heels in that he wouldnt sell wed used metal detectors to find the cache on his land but there was no dealing with him so i found out lucy gilbert needed money approached her she was going to sell her acreage to us and let us rebury it on her land alex wanted to rebury it not anymore maybe he never did he gets a cut i get the rest you said gooch are a fucking piece of work man it seemed like a good idea at the time everyone would have been happy no one hurt yeah if patch got his hundred thou together and conducted a legitimate dig you or alex would have had to kill him anyway right no stoney said quietly no jimmy bird he helped us alex shut him up he prayed gooch wouldnt ask if hed killed danny laffite maybe he would just assume alex did you need a new hobby gooch said wheres a place you and me can go and not be bothered what i get to pick my place of execution im not killing you i want a place where you and i can go and call alex set up a negotiation with him so i can kill him youre going to kill him the chances are fairly good gooch said i dont like him why dont you just call the police they like courtrooms those take time im taking a simple blunt approach to a complicated situation its a public service stoney took a deep breath maybe this would work get gooch to lure in alex someplace private gooch could kill alex then he could cut a deal with gooch or maybe get rid of gooch he was afraid of gooch but there was a bit too much cockiness in the big guy and maybe he underestimated stoney he thought of blowing off dannys head and his confidence returned you afraid of this alex gooch asked stoney was silent you say hes got the treasure he says he does or hes lied and its still in the storage unit over in laurel point but knowing alex hes definitely moved it so he and i are at a stalemate wheres the devils eye stoney took a deep breath now he needed to lie he was going to lie because that emerald wasnt up for negotiation it was his i hid it on my property buried it deep in a flower bed where the earth was already turned its safe alex wants it bad well use that as our bait then if you want a good place to talk to him stoney said i got one i own a couple of warehouses down at the port in corpus christi its quiet down there alex could meet us there stoney yeah no tricks its a death sentence so what happens to me after you kill alex how much are you worth stoney gooch said finally money the universal language gooch could be bought this was a sudden warm comfort about two million i guess i can think of any number of local charities who need about a twomilliondollar donation his gut tightened thats extortion fundraising you can rebuild your fortune but you let people die theres a price to pay for that you can pick prison poverty or pine pine as in box buddy i would pick poverty then stoney said carefully and so they had crossed the high harbor bridge in corpus the port to their right the retired aircraft carrier uss lexington docked to their left grabbed takeout chinese in downtown corpus the warehouse in the heart of the port of corpus christi was quiet on a saturday the streets deserted the businesses mostly closed stoney unlocked the door with an electronic code the warehouse was big but cluttered a maze of tall boxes and crates and wrapped pallets and now they sat finishing the chinese at a metal desk what do you keep here gooch asked around a mouthful of garlic chicken one of my companies buys up furniture and equipment from failed businesses sells it at discount stoney shoveled in moo shu pork he wasnt sure when hed get to eat again youre just a fulltime vulture arent you i am sorry about your friends i am dont worry you will be stoney ignored him eating the last of his moo shu he searched his memory for any weapons that might be in the warehouse he couldnt remember whether the old foreman kept a gun in the desk he slid the metal drawer open a bit the drawer was loose came out too quick no gun just pencils and postit notes and a thin little flask of crown royal he pushed the drawer back but it didnt quite want to go that drawer would come right out in your hands stoney thought heavy metal what do you know he nudged the drawer back into place gooch stood a ways off talking on a cell phone calling to stoney if he were happy yeah im delirious with joy he wanted to answer but he played along said he was happy nodded the room echoed slightly with their voices gooch said lets discuss how we get your friend alex a freaking useless wildgoose chase alex thought he had been following the honorable whit mosley from the courthouse square alex earlier ditched the beige van in the port leo walmart parking lot and walked along the rows of cars until he saw keys dangling in a ford taurus windows slightly lowered to dissipate the midday heat a bumper sticker announced carpenters have better wood he drove the taurus to a quiet apartment complex quickly but calmly switched license plates with a lonely little red hyundai at the back of the lot tore off the offending bumper sticker and drove to a dairy queen for a soda and a burger there he found whits address in a local phone book and headed straight for the big victorian house thinking ill just take him here his buddy took stoney ill take him the woman who answered the door was blond and pretty in a meltyourknees way and alex thought or ill just take you honey hi im looking for judge mosley his place is out back the guest house the woman said she looked to be a little younger than whit blue eyes wide enough to drown in and her noticeable accent sounded funny russian maybe but hes not here right now im his stepmother irina may i help you stepmother jesus he wished his dad had bothered to remarry well um maam i had information for him on a case its kind of private ah he was here but went to the courthouse his office is on the first floor if the buildings not open you could knock on his window fifth window on the left from the entrance if hes not there hes probably with his girlfriend thank you maam alex let irina mosley live and headed for the courthouse he waited for forty minutes running the ac in the taurus until he saw whit mosley come out of the courthouse run in this heat running to a white ford explorer and get in and roar off he pulled out after him staying two cars back blending in with the busy summer weekend traffic the judge had driven past the old marina an old forsale television studio the high school auditorium like he was checking out real estate to buy following him was becoming more difficult if not impossible he was looking for something and he wasnt getting out of his car where alex could grab him and run he was hanging so far back he was not always keeping whit mosley in sight worried he would be noticed and finally the judge turned around and drove through port leo and north toward black jack point alex followed next to him on the car seat his cell phone rang alex kept his eye on whits car hello hello asshole gooch said want to deal we need to talk whit said lucy lay across patchs fat leather couch a cool cloth on her forehead a bottle of aspirin and an opened can of ginger ale on the floor okay she didnt open her eyes about you and stoney vaughn she didnt open her eyes but she folded her hands across her stomach lucy jesus look at me she opened her eyes turned her head you know him he kept his voice steady yeah you knew stoney was hiding at a fishing cottage a long silence did he turn himself in no gooch has him now she sat up has him stashed somewhere he said gooch grabbed him hes using him to get at the guy who killed patch and thuy gooch found him by following you shit lucy said this alex guy do you know him know his real name she hesitated and whit said quietly answer me lucy right now christ who are you he thought she raised her chin dont speak to me that way you knew who killed patch and you said nothing no baby i didnt know not when it happened i found out later you sure know how to keep a secret he said thats a new one i did it to protect you she said now she tossed the washcloth on the floor protect me youre one great shield lucy youve just destroyed my career everything your cousin said about me in the paper today is going to be considered holy writ you lied to me to the police whit stopped sat down forget being a judge i could care less youve destroyed us were done thats a thousand times worse she reached for him he moved away from her as though her touch might scald i said nothing because i didnt know for sure and i knew if i came forward id lose you youve lost me jesus you thought id stay with you so much for true love her jaw quivered but her eyes were dry i love you whit thats why i did this stoney came to me when patch wouldnt sell the land to him said hed buy my land i didnt even know about the treasure he wanted to move but before the dig he told me wanted me to be sure patch was out of town i was scared hed do something to me if i said anything right i gave thuy and patch that trip to port aransas to get them gone baby i didnt know hed changed his will i swear i swear whitman this isnt a courtroom yes it is its the court of whit and youre judge jury and executioner who killed them she swallowed stoney says alex jimmy bird alex probably the coins in jimmys pocket theyre not patchs i guess theyre from the dig i guess jimmy swiped them and alex didnt know it where is alex stoney he told me where he was hiding i went to the cottage with patchs gun ready to kill him for what hed done but i couldnt just shoot him not even him in cold blood he asked me to shoot alex alex knows about you was there when you came to stoneys house i followed alex to the surfside motel hes staying there at least he was she stared at him i thought of killing him make it look like a random shooting i even knocked on his door in the night just shoot him and run nothing to connect me with him because he might hurt you but i chickened out im scared he saw she was rough tough lucy breaking under the weight he wanted to hold her wanted to scream at her his chest felt like it might explode where is this gun in my purse he went to the purse pulled out the gun with a tissue checked the bullets put on the safety stuck it into the back of his pants you running around with a gun he shook his head is there anything else i should know lucy i love you he covered his eyes with his hands i love you too i did why did you do this i thought i was doing the right thing for you screw patch screw thuy if i turned on stoney i was afraid of what would happen to you she crossed her arms tell me something whit you being all high and mighty you say gooch grabbed stoney have you called the police no i have reason to think stoney went voluntarily with him reason to think her voice went low angry bullshit stoney wouldnt dont tell me that lunatic gooch gets a free pass and i dont this isnt a double standard the hell its not you lecture me you tell me that were done that loving each other doesnt make a fucking difference but gooch commits a kidnapping and you dont turn his ass in fine ill call the police right now he picked up the phone ill tell them about you too thisll make david powers day for the next year then ill resign and she grabbed the phone from his hand listen i did this because i needed to make a lot of money fast i got debts whit a lot of them i didnt want you to know just like david said i didnt want to beg for help but i didnt know all this would happen i swear please she put the phone back in its cradle he let her okay stoney might have gone with gooch voluntarily stoneys scared shitless of alex i dont want gooch in trouble just because youre mad at me mad at you the understatement of the year mad doesnt quite cover what i feel she swallowed reached for him again he stepped away and a hard hurt light came into her eyes where is this treasure lucy stoney had it but he said alex took it from him most of it is coins most of it theres a big emerald the devils eye she took a deep breath ill make a deal with you no deals let me finish my sentence please she sat down lets say gooch goes after alex but gooch doesnt win maybe alex comes after you or me i dont know if he knows about me or not im thinking he doesnt otherwise you would be dead okay she said a little shudder in her voice so alex doesnt know about me i know where hes at we just call the police with an anonymous tip about alex just say he killed patch and thuy and jimmy give them the room number and what hope hes got evidence hanging around maybe he does maybe he can be tied back to the crime scenes but it takes him out stoney wont say anything if gooch has saved him from alex then were home free home free what about patch and thuy alex killed them she said hes the one who pays it works until alex points at stoney and stoney points at you whit said i dont care about free and clear and pardon me if i dont believe stoney vaughn he could have killed them you see that hes not lying because why lucy you sense his aura his voice rose thats exactly why i wanted to sell the land she said because you sneer at me you think running a psychic hotline is tacky borderline dishonest even when im just trying to help people im never quite good enough for you am i i loved you like no one else lucy and it still wasnt enough for you your selfesteem problem is in your head not mine lucy opened and closed her mouth she went and sat on the couch so go turn me in i dont care he resisted the urge to hold her to make her care again his throat ached his hands trembled it couldnt be over but it was if you love her truly you forgive her right he steadied his voice right now we need to find stoney and gooch what about turning me in isnt that at the top of your todo list im giving you a chance to cooperate lucy where is this cottage stoney hid out at why because i want to see it i want to see if theres a sign of struggle if gooch really kidnapped him then my path is clear will you show me yes she said and he saw the hope flash in her eyes it had taken guts to hang up but alex did it as soon as he heard guchinskis voice and figured out who other than stoney would be calling him let gooch wait he stayed in his car parked a bit down the highway from the turnoff to black jack point the phone rang again alex clicked it on do you want to deal or not asshole gooch again im busy at the moment give me a number to call you back on dont think so then you call me back in ten minutes mr guchinski and clicked off let him sweat that alex knew his name but deal how the hell was he supposed to deal the only leverage he had left was the treasure and maybe gooch didnt care about that what the hell did gooch want the treasure in exchange for stoney fat chance just go go get the stash rent a truck get the hell away from the coast feel out your buyers get the money go get your dad go to that big blue sky in costa rica sit on the beach pretend hes not dying for a while forget the emerald but no emerald the biggest prize the one worth millions in one fell swoop after he made carefully placed calls to bogota and all these loose ends helen guchinski that judge and stoney insufferable stoney getting the better of him claudia ben and hed spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder no way he rubbed his face and when he brought his hands down headlights flashed in his mirror a car turning and heading south whit mosleys explorer if you dont have leverage grab it and take it alex shifted into gear and tore out after them the cottage was dark no lights spilling along the beach or along the small private road the sun retreated below the horizon whit kept his headlights pointed at the cottages small door it was closed not hanging off its hinges lucy said thats a good sign whit said nothing so im getting the silent treatment no i just have nothing to say stay here he got out of the car she followed he tried the door it opened he flicked on the lights the room was a mess not good she said no its not from a fight its been searched or robbed isnt this trespassing oops you broke a law lucy shut up do you think i dont have guilt thats eating me alive but i didnt kill them i tried to protect them im not blaming you for their deaths although it seems to me you could have warned patch about them stealing the treasure off his land she shook her head i hope to god youre never afraid danny laffite is he dead did stoney or this alex kill him i have no idea he blamed stoney for a murder and for stealing an antique journal from him do you know where thats at no i just cant figure stoney didnt know his brother and claudia were going to be kidnapped and that he would need to go hide himself that old journals the key to everything if he wanted to rebury the treasure right it validates that jean laffite was involved makes the treasure more valuable for stoneys purposes yeah so he has to pick a place to hide quickly why not where he had already hidden what was of great value to him alex doesnt give a crap about the journal stoney has access and no one would suspect him putting it here his house yeah maybe a safedeposit box but not a clients house maybe the journal is what someone was looking for alex maybe to close a loose end gooch no or danny laffite how or maybe alex was looking for the eye thats what alex wants she straightened a couch cushion its not here though i hid it well whit youd be proud of me he turned to stare at her you have the emerald stoney gave it to me for safekeeping her tone went defiant tell me where it is no she said it was on patchs private property they stole it now its mine again according to his will it and the rest of the treasure should have been mine all along stoney was never quite smart enough to look at it from that angle she gave him a smile but not a warm one so the eyes my property and i dont have to tell you a goddamned thing about it i swear i dont know you he shook his head but you dont want to know me whit were finished you dont love me so why shouldnt i say whatever crosses my mind do you want to look for this journal or do you want to call the police and turn in gooch lets look for the journal you and your double standard he didnt argue with her and they began to comb through the house the cottage was small but elaborate and whit went upstairs to look through the two bedrooms they were small but had been searched thoroughly and he decided this was pointless if anything was to have been found it had been taken already he had just opened a closet door when he heard lucy cry out no lucy he called no answer for a moment then a crash and she screamed whit another crash silence whit moved quietly down the stairs pulling patchs old gun hed taken from lucys purse cocking it stopping just above the corner where the stairs met the kitchen judge mosley a mans voice called gentle calm you need to step down with your hands up im armed whit called and if you hurt her ill kill you the answer was a single shot whit froze shes unconscious the voice called so she didnt feel that but i just shot off a couple of fingers on her left hand you have five seconds to come out moving the gun to her forehead now no whit stepped out of the stairwell hands up gun held between forefinger and thumb a man knelt by lucy a mm glock in his hand aimed squarely at whit he was rangy tall hair dyed cheap blond round wirerim glasses he looked like a professor turned punk rocker drop it the man said whit did on your knees hands on your head whit obeyed he could see lucys hand all five fingers there not shot i lied alex black said i really hate messes ben had kicked the fbi out or rather claudia thought he had asked them to leave he politely told them that he appreciated their help he felt safe with claudia around she blushed at that but he wanted to be alone and have some time to recover and there was no proof after all that stoney had committed a crime or actually become the victim of a crime the phones were tapped in case stoney or danny laffite or the boogeyman called the agents gave him thin smiles in answer but they left and from the window claudia watched their cars cut through the flats after agents grimes and gordell left the house seemed too quiet ghost empty she wondered if david might drive by on the pretense of checking on ben but the road stayed empty ben clicked on the stereo soft vivaldi filled the room a whisper of violins and flutes she stood by the fireplace studying a nautical map drawn in an ancients hand that hung above the mantel he came up behind her put his hands on her shoulders im glad youre here claudia id be nuts in this house alone i like this old map she said its a reproduction although if stoney has too much to drink he tells people its an original long ago a big chunk of the world was unknown see theres europe badly drawn they didnt see the known world like it really was you leave it you reach the middle he pointed at a giant serpent in the waves its head thrown back and tongue extending like fire they say here there be dragons if that doesnt scare you off go all the way and you sail past the edge of the world lost for ever the point of no return i think this map is more accurate than a real map he kissed her neck would you like some wine or some beer you want me to fix you a michelada a michelada sounds good he went into the kitchen filled two tall glasses with ice a dash of tabasco and worcestershire a sprinkle of pepper and a dollop of lime juice then he poured a cold dos equis lager in each glass the beer darkened to the color of maple he brought a glass to her and they sat down on the mexican tile floor watching the sunlight die over the bay they sat side by side their shoulders barely touching claudia sipped the michelada tasted like a perfect steak but cold and smooth when will they bring jupiter back she asked the fbi had it treating it as a crime scene god only knows i dont care not sure i ever want to set foot aboard that boat again i suppose if somethings happened to stoney the boat is mine she said nothing he seemed mildly surprised at the thought you hungry i can grill up some amberjack he said they finished their micheladas and then he cooked them dinner pouring cold sauvignon blanc and fixing salad fish scented with herbs risotto sliced kiwis deftly moving from pan to pan she could see he was making a strenuous effort to shove the darkness of the past few days behind them they ate her appetite suddenly ravenous she drank two fat glasses of the new zealand white and mellowness tiptoed over her he was opening a fresh bottle when she began to shake standing by the counter she set the wineglass down suddenly afraid it would break between her fingers she felt cold as ice hey hey now ben took her in his arms held her close her breathing grew ragged somethings wrong she said de de delayed shock i dont know he steered her toward the couch sat with her warmed her with his arms he said nothing kissed her jaw her throat gently she held him tight its okay sokay a few moments later the shivers subsided well what was that she said embarrassed arent i the big baby you know how much braver you are than i am he said he tipped her jaw looked into her eyes i cried locked up on that boat afraid of what theyd done to you afraid of what he was going to do to me she took his face in between her palms and she kissed him first on his giant bruise gentle as a feather then on his lips he kissed back a little tentative like she might still be shaky she wasnt after five long kisses ben eased open the buttons on her blouse touched the lacy edge of her bra nuzzled the top of her breasts lets make love he whispered he took her hands led her upstairs to his bedroom she undressed him he undressed her from head to feet kissing the wrap that bound her broken toe the bandages on her hands she kissed the horrid bruise on his face again the broken finger he kissed her in her middle and they moved the sheets into a slow tangle claudia finally surrounding him with her heat our first time in what thirteen years she whispered lucky thirteen he laughed he was confident with her more sure of his touch she was more relaxed worth waiting for she said eager for the touch of his skin against hers i always cared for you claudia always he said closing his lips over her throat his hands cupping her breasts she felt the life in his mouth his hands and suddenly life seemed far sweeter than she had known thinking of lying on that boat bobbing in the waves the sun a glaring remorseless eye now she gasped now afterward his breath warmed the back of her neck and she fell asleep she didnt hear him rise from the bed doesnt hurt too bad does it alex leaned down patted whit on the cheek hed taken four steps toward whit after whit laid down the gun smashed the butt of his glock twice across whits face knocking him nearly cold opening his cheek whit sat halfpropped against the refrigerator blood splattered all over his dancing pineapples shirt lucy was still out breathing shallowly a trickle of blood oozing from her hairline and meandering down her forehead alex black squatted down in front of whit the gun aimed at whits stomach your friend guchinski he said wheres he at i dont know whits face felt broken the cheekbone might be fractured god it hurt his voice sounded thick and dopey alex cocked the gun aimed it at lucys head try again its the truth please dont hurt her i dont know where he is right now so whats his angle i dont know bullshit your honor can i call you that your honor i feel so privileged i didnt know he was grabbing stoney i didnt know he even knew where stoney was howd he find out the stone man was here whit paused no way hed point to lucy he must have followed you out here no i dont think so alex said he closed his hand fingers hard from digging whit thought they felt like steel springs around whits windpipe alex wormed the gun in between whits legs pressed the barrel against his testicles whit quit breathing heres my theory your honor stoney wanted to get rid of me he got himself a new partner he gave the devils eye to new partner who has a guard dog mentality i think new partner was guchinski and hes cutting you in too whit risked a very small shallow breath the barrel didnt ease its pressure now guchinski has gotten stoney hidden away and is calling my ass up wanting to deal but i smell a trap what do you smell gooch doesnt have the eye who does stoney you think hes gonna trust anyone with a multimilliondollar emerald whit breathed again cleared his throat god let this lie work i cant believe you fell for what he said giving it to someone else so youve chatted with stoney just that once when you were hiding in the house alex smashed his fist across whits face whit tried hard not to cry out to groan i wasnt hiding alex shook his head ran his tongue along the little scar at his mouths corner gave a little annoyed laugh i give you this judge you got balls big ones i pull the trigger here theres gonna be what sixty percent of your balls left if you kill me or lucy you dont get the eye whit said gooch has stoney under his thumb and hell never give it to you goochll hunt your ass down and kill you an inch at a time alex picked up a cell phone from the kitchen counter he keyed in a number dialed mr guchinski you answering stoneys phone now whit could not hear goochs reply alex stood let the gun slide along whits bruised face took a step back on the floor lucy stirred moaned whits name no you listen i got my own trump cards fuckhead he held the phone close to whits mouth speak to him say hello say more than hello and i kill the woman hello whit said alex yanked the phone back i got the judges woman too so you got stoney man i dont care get rid of him now hes nothing but trouble a pause you want these two youre gonna give me the eye he glanced at whit shit whit thought he believed me or i just confirmed what he already thought that stoney has the eye alex listened winked at whit give me directions he said okay well meet there in an hour or so pause we make the trade then he clicked off people are fucking predictable what whit asked alex stared at whit tell me how come a judge is friends with a crook like gooch we have a lot in common yeah alex said lots of judges in florida are crooked too trust me whit saw a shift in his face amusement hardening into contempt he cocked the gun kept it aimed at whit and stood over lucy she was trying to surface back to consciousness the amber necklace around her throat was broken the jewel loose on the floor he wanted to reach over fix it for her hold her tell her it was okay her eyes fluttered open looking at him but not quite registering him whit could see two little trails of blood from her hairline where alex had pistolwhipped her her right ear bloodied i dont think shes in any condition to travel do you alex said with a crooked smile what whit said again okay i can be the hostage we dont need her the grin widened the gun moved to lucy no please whit yelled devotion thats nice alex said then he fired three times claudia awoke in complete darkness the night surrounding her felt as solid as glass and panic tightened her stomach thrummed between her shoulder blades she felt tied danny danny still had her gar waiting nearby the tattooed arms ready to force the life out of her hungry to force himself inside her she sat up in bed blinking easing out of the snarl of sheets no danny no gar no ben in bed she glanced at the digital clock ten fortysix pm shed drunk too much the michelada and the wine too early in the evening she wasnt used to it she had a little headache not bad she got up went to the bedroom balcony that faced onto the bay the heavy curtains were pulled closed and she parted them an inch st leo bay lay calm in the night the moon a wafer in the wash of the milky way she closed the curtains found her clothes on the floor she stepped into panties pulled her khaki slacks up over her legs she groped for her bra and blouse and put them on she started down the stairs toward the spill of light in the kitchen heard ben say all right ill be there when she entered the kitchen he was standing by the granitetop counter a cell phone in his hand he set it down on the counter ben that was my brother babe hes alive thank god she said where is he in corpus christi he wants me to come see him right now he decided to come out from under his rock he didnt react to her sarcasm hes ashamed embarrassed that he panicked but hes alive he took claudia into his arms hes at a warehouse he owns down by the port you know a guy named leonard guchinski yeah hes nuts how the hell is he involved stoneys with this guchinski guy and im not quite sure why so what are you going to do ben i should call the police ben said in a tone that said he actually didnt want to do that let them know he at least is all right you want to wait until you talk to him i kind of think i should he tucked the cell phone into his front pants pocket you want to go with me maybe this should be a private meeting claudia said id like it a lot if you came he owes you an apology and an explanation maybe you can help us figure out how to deal with the authorities help him avoid embarrassment hes probably going to need a lawyer too hes going to need a pr firm claudia said she wasnt worried about stoneys embarrassment let me run upstairs get my purse and well go the trunk was dark so dark that when whit shut his eyes he could not tell the world had gone darker the rattle and bump of the taurus shook him back to full consciousness as they sped down the highway im going to kill you he thought if he simply lay here prone with grief alex won he had no doubt alexs goal was to kill him gooch stoney whoever got in his way a clean sweep if he thought too much about lucy a sickening paralysis crept into him he had hardly moved since alex punched him again for good measure and dumped him into the trunk he felt in his pocket for his cell phone gone he groped in the dark trying to find anything that could be used as a weapon alex had been at stoneys when whit stopped by but this car hadnt been so either a rental or maybe stolen maybe alex hadnt paid enough attention to what was in here if it was stolen and the trunk seemed cluttered with junk his fingers found the rim of the spare soft material that felt like silk maybe some clothes destined for the dry cleaners a small wrench probably left out for the lugs of the spare a book a wilting paperback a cool plane of metal with three hinges on the side tool box whit slowly turned the toolbox around found its opening closed but not locked he managed to open it heard the clatter of metal tools as the car hit a bump in the highway waited for the car to slow pull over to the side if he made too much noise if alex thought he were anything but griefstricken and broken now alex would kill him taking his time forcing himself to be calm whit let his fingers explore the tools a tape measure a hammer which would be great to swing at alexs face a baggie with what felt like an assortment of screws nails and lug nuts inside a small ball of twine pliers his fingers found a bar in the space above the tools a handle the tool box had a liftout tray with another compartment beneath he eased the top compartment out his fingers fumbled inside the deeper well of the box more baggies with nails or hooks screwdrivers with hard plastic handles two or three a ball peen hammer the better to break alexs teeth with if he got a chance masking tape a roll thinned from use electrical wire he pricked his finger on a long v of sharp metal with wicked little teeth on each side a carved wooden handle he gently explored the tool with his fingertips a wallboard saw the kind used to slice through sheetrock to make cutouts for light switches and electrical outlets but with that nice pointed blade for plunge cuts into walls all it takes is one mistake whit thought and you murdering bastard you just made it youre gonna sit here real quiet gooch said you mess this up so that whit or lucy gets hurt youre the mess and i thought wed gotten to be friends stoney said yeah im going to be godfather to your kids so what i sit here and you negotiate with alex no you sit here and i get rid of him if i have to gooch said then i give you to the judge and he figures out what to do with you talking to him like he was a kid be nice gooch or ill press charges and youll go to prison are you quite so eager to get more in the public eye that way stoney sit your ass down gooch said and stoney said nothing he eased down into the chair behind the desk and gooch turned to douse out the lights now stoney thought he grabbed the handle of the desk drawer gave it a heavy yank the drawer slid out fast and stoney swung it as he bolted around the desk connecting with goochs skull as he turned gooch went down stoney brought the drawer down again goochs eyes went white fuuu stoney took the heavy end of the drawer and smacked it down hard on goochs head again twice gooch sprawled across the concrete floor my god that was fast stoney thought he picked up the gun groped goochs thick neck for a pulse after a moment he found it but gooch seemed to be out cold stoney considered whether or not to shoot him easier than shooting danny at least he wasnt looking at him with a wet face and a horrible blubbering pleading look he pressed the gun against the back of goochs head but then headlights gleamed against the shuttered warehouse windows a car turning in and stoney vaughn threw a tarp over gooch took the gun doused the last light and stepped back into the shadows into the maze of unopened crates and equipment in the clutter stoney knelt down by a section of crates in the back he checked goochs gun by flashlight a full clip he sat back raised the flashlight its little circle of light spilling along the crates five feet in front of him he froze that bastard he whispered whit felt the car come to a stop heard the engine turn off he had reloaded the toolbox closed it tucked the wallboard saw into the waist of his khakis tightened his belt he hoped he could pull the blade out fast without slicing himself open he closed his eyes thought of lucy her asking im safe with you arent i and him saying always babe jesus shed wanted reassurance shed wanted to know he loved her no matter what he was crouched shoulders against the trunks lid cmon cmon he thought i want you the drivers door slammed he heard footsteps against concrete judge alexs voice called low quiet even gentle yes i want you to lay facedown hands laced on your head you yell for help you kick the trunk or me you fart too loud i empty this clip into you you understand me yeah whit said he lay down as alex ordered the little wicked saw sharp against his hip a key slid into the lock the trunk door opened the muzzle of a gun pressed into the back of whits neck up slowly not a sound youll be in hell in less than ten minutes whit said you dont have a prayer against gooch he got up felt the saw hold in its place against his leg you got in over your head your honor i dont hold greed against you but you took on too much he didnt want gooch to kill alex he wanted to do it himself he stepped out of the trunk the gun still firmly at the back of his head and the two men walked to the warehouse door an electronic keypad was by the door and alex entered in a code the electronic locks on the door clicked open you first judge alex said whit stepped inside the darkness guchinski alex called put the lights on now or the judge dies chill alex its all right stoney vaughn a little rasp of voice in the blackness wheres your new buddy alex called barely breathing on the concrete floor i bashed his head in alex waited i dont believe you come in and see stoneys voice shook fear anger whit wondered what are you pissed about jesus he kidnaps you i try to save you alex said youre quite the hero stoney said from the dark you coming in or not do you have the eye stoney alex said right here in my pocket okay were cool right im coming in now and alex did pushing whit along in front of him not closing the door after him in case he had to barrel out fast no light on in the warehouse just the smell of dust and machinery and oddly enough the reek of greasy chinese food alex stoneys voice called shut the door turn on the lights whats with this fucking darkness act alexs hands fumbled for the switches couldnt find them the lights clanged on stoney standing ten feet away a gleaming pistol in his hand nice gun alex said its a shootyadickov stoney said i got it from gooch hello judge sorry about this jesus alex you beat the crap out of him whits heart sank the wallboard saw was a stupid stupid idea gooch down him stuck between these two assholes each with a gun he kept his hands down by his untucked shirt he shot lucy he said stoneys lips clenched together in a toughguy sneer parted what shes dead alex said i didnt want to bring them both that wasnt necessary i stoney said you what alex said you need her land to rebury the gold so you can discover it and what get your picture on the fucking cover of national geographic man give it up i liked lucy stoney said yeah she seemed real nice a shame i hate what i have to do sometimes wheres the eye whit kept waiting for alex to say well gooch is out of the game dont need you and shoot him dead but instead alex kept whit in front of him still a shield dont worry about the eye stoney said i promised you could keep most of the coins id get thirty percent and the eye thats more than fair lets just settle our accounts now alex i can get the coins for you tomorrow jesus i kind of had my hands full tonight youll get them tonight stoneys face reddened i cant alex said sure you can theyre just about thirty feet away in crates over there stoney said what i want to know alex buddy is how the hell you got the treasure into my own warehouse dont know what you mean the coins they are all over there in that corner crated just as we left them in the storage unit stoney said the silence hung in the air now whit thought alex whit said stoney doesnt have the eye hes lying he said it was in his pocket make him show the eye to you stoney thats not a bad idea ive missed seeing the eye over the past couple of days alex said but slowly i was not speaking literally when i said it was in my pocket stoney said that means he lied whit said you were right he gave it to gooch but now hes betrayed gooch you think hes gonna play clean with you alex took a step toward stoney keeping whit close in front whit took a step forward in response moaned as though the pain of the beating had caught up with him he closed his hand over his shirttail and around the handle of the wallboard saw i didnt give it to gooch stoney said he kidnapped me alex you seem to have suffered mightily we have to stick together stoney said do we alex said latenight traffic was light heading into corpus christi claudia drove finished a cup of hot coffee the warm effect of the wine fading ben said he was too nervous to drive so they took her pickup truck i think i would feel better if hed actually apologized ben said on the phone he sounded so cryptic give it time maybe he thinks he didnt do a thing wrong how could that thought even live in his brain youve gotten angrier during the drive she said knowing hes okay im finally feeling mad i dont let myself get mad enough not me said claudia im sort of comfortable with getting pissed off youre way too evenkeeled the port area was aglow with lights as they reached the harbor bridge arching two hundred thirtyfive feet above where the nueces and corpus christi bays joined claudia saw the blue lights centered on the uss lexington retired in the calm of corpus christi bay the texas state aquarium the soft glow of downtown ahead of her she barreled onto the harbor bridge the traffic in front of her thin ben squirmed in his seat as though trying to get comfortable and suddenly she felt rather than saw the gun hovering close to her head what itll help if youre evenkeeled right now im sorry her breath caught and ben said just keep driving okay youre losing speed pick it up tell me what the fuck youre doing or im going to drive the car off the bridge she said no you wont he said i know you his voice quiet now bled of the earlier anger ben this isnt the way to help your brother he can rot in hell for all i care ben said he would have gotten us both killed you think i give a shit about him now his tone softened you im sorry about i couldnt help myself never quite got over you if we hadnt been kidnapped if you hadnt learned about all this i wish you werent a cop the lights of the bridge flashed by them his voice toughened take the port exit then a hard right then two more lefts until we get where were going hadnt learned about all this are you saying you know where this treasure is just be quiet talking is only going to make it worse what youre going to kill your brother and me im not going to kill stoney ben said even now im not sure i could my partner will take care of that partner she said ben no please dont do this take the exit he said or ill shoot you and ill shoot whoevers in the first car that stops the bridge began its downward slope toward corpus christi beach and the port and claudia took the port street exit it was a very short exit forcing a hard right turn and she thought of letting the car just go straight crash although she couldnt risk the life of anyone else who might stop to help i really respect that youre not crying right now or calling me names im waiting for an explanation ben money jealousy of your brother money you know what its like to be ten times smarter than stoney and not have a hundredth of what he does he sighed i wish you could come with me but thats not possible turn left here then the next left she turned onto a side street dominated by one large warehouse the lot by it empty except for a battered red pickup she recognized it as goochs and a nondescript ford taurus she parked on the other side of the truck away from the taurus turn off your headlights claudia thumbed the switch and the little lot went dark now what she said her own service revolver was in the compartment between them she couldnt possibly reach it without him blowing her head off he opened the compartment fished out her gun put it in his lap you know ben said im grateful we made love truly were going inside so no one will hear you kill me he started to reply but gunshots sounded inside the warehouse three of them in rapid fire shit the gun wavered for a second and claudia flung open the door threw herself out onto the asphalt the driversside window exploding above her she crabbed under the car as ben scrambled out of the truck as alex fired his arm outstretched past whit whit slammed hard into his arm pinning him into the wall and trying to pull the gun from his hand he got his fingers around the grip gouged alexs wrists but alex grabbed the back of his head smashed it hard into the concrete wall whit went down thinking stupid stupid alex pressed down on him knee in his back and whit saw stoney lying on the floor bone and blood and shredded jaw showing that was fucking stupid alex said you missing your girl you want to see her i know where gooch hid the eye dumb shit shoot me and youll never get it bullshit he screamed you would have told me to save lucy i didnt think youd really shoot her his right hand closed over his shirttail and the hidden saws handle but he couldnt pull it free not with alexs weight on him let me up and ill tell you youll tell me now alex grabbed whits left hand flattened it on the concrete jammed the hot barrel of the gun against the back of whits hand ill show you whit said show alex froze its here let me up and ill show it to you dont shoot off my hand whit let out a scream a sob just dont shoot off my hand man please ill show you please he began to mumble and cry alex hesitated for two seconds okay he eased up into a squat by whit get up you pussy his voice was thick with contempt whit got to both knees holding his side lips quivering fresh blood smearing his broken cheek then slowly to his feet his hand under the tail of his shirt like his side ached please please whit said unsteady on his feet like standing was an ordeal please ill show you and then in one swift motion he slashed out at alex with the little wicked blade claudia had counted on ben running around the car to finish her hoping hed think shed try to put distance between her and his gun so instead she rolled under the car she heard his feet pound around the trucks back trying to get a sight on her seeing if she was hit or running she saw his feet tennis shoes bright white in the dark she let him race past her peering into the dark of the lot and the loading docks listening for her running feet and looking for her moving shadow she rolled out from under the truck as he started to curse the broken glass crunching under her shoulders ben turned and she barreled toward him in a flying tackle his gun blazed and she felt the devilish whisper of a bullet sear past her head she slammed hard into him smashing her forearm into his throat driving her knee into his groin he went down heavy his head cracking against the pavement she piled on top of him one hand yanking his hair back and the other hunting his eyes he screamed and elbowed her hard shoved her down onto her back it was dark a dim gleam of lights from the warehouse and the port blocks away and she saw faint shine on a guns barrel hed had both guns he mustve dropped one when she kicked his feet out from him the shine was a half foot from her hand and she seized the gun prayed the safety was off swung it toward his face and fired missed he stumbled to his feet turning and running for the warehouse freeze ben he didnt freeze and she fired twice in the dark she heard the wetmeat sound of a bullet striking him heard him sprawl along the steps leading to the warehouse she ran to where ben lay in the thin light from the shuttered windows she saw the wound in the lower part of his back blood a black spurt he breathed in sharp hitches groaning holy god claudia breathed holy god gunshots inside and shed just shot a man gooch in there maybe in trouble she ran back to her truck fumbled for the cell phone missed whit thought in that split second the blade missed and alex would shoot him before he could stab again but then alexs eyes went wide shocked his hand went to his throat and the blood fountained alex trying to scream and nothing coming but blood alexs eyes flashed with rage and fear and horror and he brought the gun back up toward whit but then he dropped it the other hand going to his throat to stem the flood he fell to his knees whit grabbed the gun stood there how does it feel whit said his voice breaking how does it and he saw alexs lips forming the word please the organic coppery smell of rupture filled the air overpowered the scent of gunfire gooch claudias voice called whit saw her coming through the stillopen front door her service pistol out in a firing stance he tried to speak as silent as alex claudia ran to him seeing alex bleed out his life toppling to the floor grabbing at whits shoes she gasped at the sight of stoneys body whit didnt let go of the saw its handle felt burned to his hand claudia tore alexs shirt off him pushing the fabric around his throat trying to stanch the flow of blood apply useless pressure telling him help was on the way whit said without looking at her gooch is here help him whit claudia started whit set alexs gun on a table he dropped the saw on the floor let him die claudia just let him die alex paled stared up at him then through him im going to find gooch whits voice didnt sound quite right jesus whit claudia said jesus claudia went with whit to the coastal psychics network on sunday afternoon not having slept that night he had a spare key lucy had given him two weeks ago and he opened the doors the business was closed the psychics mourning at home i didnt think straight didnt think about where shed hide it he said we dont have to do this now whit claudia said she loved this place and i dont want it here whit said if im right her office is this way jean laffites treasure was finally confirmed to consist of twenty thousand dollars worth of gold bars ten thousand in silver bars and a cache of rare minted monteblanco coins worth in numismatic and historical value five million dollars scattered among the coins and bars in the crates used by alex and stoney were fragments of bone and soil from the gilbert dig site including a finger bone the corpus christi police kept the treasure in the warehouse under heavy guard while they processed the shooting scene and called the texas historical commission but the devils eye was yet to be found in her office whit glanced at the small foil mobile the scattered books on esp and phone marketing still with their little neon postits as bookmarks worn from her thumbing on the mantel above her desk were the crystals amber and yellow and clear and green and red arranged just so for the healing powers they emitted he didnt feel healed there he said oh whit claudia said i dont think so these are too small no look he said he inspected several then ran his finger along the largest green one it was the muddy green of a riverbed he scraped paint off the stone with a thumbnail and the soft green glow came through the color of time the seductive green of envy jesus its really sort of ugly he handed it to her iris dominguez can tell us if this is it or a gemologist right now i dont know where else to look hiding it here is classic lucy plain sight she he stopped whit i never want to see it again okay claudia okay she said listen im worried about you we need to talk he stared at her the way you shot your boyfriend i meant to say that was well done what with it being so dark a day later four gemologists said the devils eye was worthless the right size but not the valuable emerald a nicely done copy not worth millions not worth anything at all at some time either by a thief in mexico before santa barbara sailed or by jean laffite or by stoney the eye was replaced with a worthless hunk of green crystal claudia stopped by his house and told whit about the report he was silent she wondered if he had slept whit she said after the silence grew too long finally he said people will keep looking for it wont they i suppose they will after all the news coverage dig up stoney vaughns yard or the rest of black jack point davids mentioned theyve already chased some folks off stoneys land thinking he hid some of the treasure there he turned away from her whit i figured out the person who snooped through my house was lucy she knew where my key was under the fern on the porch i guess she wanted to know if i had notes on the murders if there was any way she could be implicated or if stoney was implicated whatever might lead back to her maybe lucy came here waited for you to come home wanted to tell you the whole truth then she lost her nerve left its nice to think that he said isnt it when claudia got home david was waiting there in shorts and a tshirt he sat on the stairs leading to her apartment with a cold twelvepack of shiner bock whats this she said i think we should get drunk david said im more likely to apologize when im drunk thats a good reason someone finally put you through more hell than i did david said jesus that sucks im sorry claudia she let him in and they drank the beer her sitting on the couch him on the floor she drank the first one fast too fast and made herself promise to take longer for the second so ben was in it with alex black from the beginning i wasnt the only seduction in bens life claudia said david raised an eyebrow ben got seduced himself living with a wealthy brother who was living on the edge of the law in more ways than one and wasnt paying a price for it of course ben is not talking and hes using stoneys money to hire some fancy defense lawyer from houston she sipped her beer i wont get a chance to say this on the stand at bens trial unless we find evidence but i think ben found out about stoneys plan to steal treasure from patch gilberts land and fake an archaeological dig on lucys land and if hed gotten to know alex black through stoney he would have seen that alex was more interested in the treasures financial value than in the fame of discovery ben didnt have stoneys blind spot for glory so he must have cut a separate deal with alex they would have grabbed the treasure and then alex would have eliminated stoney but then they didnt plan on patch and thuy tran showing up and having a double murder complicate their whole deal and they sure didnt count on danny laffite coming after them with a gang and a vengeance she finished her beer david handed her another you know what pisses me off she asked what honey that fucker she said he abandoned me with danny and gar maybe he even cut a deal with zack simard to get him to leave us behind on the other boat he knew gar would kill me kill danny im sure he killed zack simard at some point dumped the body ran the boat aground he looked like the poor little victim the whole time he was in with alex black im pretty sure stoney never called ben that night apologizing and asking him to come to the warehouse that was alex and bens plan get rid of stoney get rid of me since i was pushing on ben to help the cops leave the country with the treasure he should have stuck with teaching ben molding young minds i may puke she downed more beer wiped her mouth with the back of her hand i dont think it would surprise me if he and alex had planned on getting rid of each other in the end greedy bastards claudia its not your fault david rested his chin on his knees gave her a sad smile what i know you youre pissed at yourself for not having seen through this guy listen his own brother didnt see through him im smarter than stoney vaughn ever was please she shook her head i think my career at the pd just flatlined jesus hes ruined a couple of major league pleasant high school memories for me memories he was my first david back when we were in high school he opened another beer you mean i wasnt i never told you you were you were my second well said david you werent my first either i think ill wear a red dress to bens trial she said a little drunk that asshole im sorry david said for you for whit you cant stand him im gonna try to stand him claud she smiled for the first time now youre drunk they drank too much both of them and they ended up kissing but she wasnt drunk enough to sleep with him she wouldnt let him drive so david slept on her couch and at one point in the night dehydrated and hungover she got up for water and she watched him sleep and to her surprise a little part of her missed him then she went back to bed hoping it was just the beer lucy was buried next to patch in port leos big grand catholic cemetery afterward whit felt as hollow as though his bones had been plucked from beneath his skin he took a month off from court got a retired county judge to fill in for him he did not have to rule on lucys cause of death or see the autopsy papers he let gooch take him out on the waters each day after the funeral the summer roaring into its hottest days sat and stared at the flat of the bay watching the waves live and die in their brief existence the third week gooch invited claudia and she sat with whit on the stern of the boat in chairs designed for deepsea fishing gooch stood on the flying bridge steering out into the gulf helen dupuy had gotten work in port leo cleaning at a bedandbreakfast and could not join them whit drank a coke not talking much only saying how the astros were bound to disappoint again this summer lucy enjoyed baseball didnt she claudia said whit didnt look at her yeah she touched his hand i didnt love ben i hadnt quite gotten past the infatuation point we hadnt been together very long but you loved lucy yes dr claudia i did sounding a little irritated with her now but you havent grieved for her of course i have tell me did killing alex make you feel better whit he stared at her turned away this is going to be a damn long day fishing it was selfdefense but you killed him you even told me to let him die not that anything could have saved him then her words unsaid in the long quiet of the past weeks came in a rush claudia let it go are you worried youre like him in some way he killed lucy you killed him you think youre on his level no he said after a pause i dont feel anything about killing him yet that bothers me he looked away but lucy i yelled at her i ended it with her i said terrible things to her you had every right to be mad at her at what shed done you can be mad at someone you love that only works if you get to say youre sorry claud she knows whit she knows she laced her fingers with his gooch stopped the boat dropped anchor called down that it was time to fish lets go swimming first she said you want to get in the water after you nearly died out here not the waters fault what am i supposed to do avoid the gulf for the rest of my life claudia stood took off her tshirt dropped her shorts she had a swimsuit underneath a navy twopiece not cut too brief is that a policeissue bikini gooch called she shot him the finger dove over the edge she surfaced come on it feels great she called to whit who stood at the rail he didnt move whit come on whit shucked off his shirt cannonballed over the railing like he thought hed better before he changed his mind broke to the surface let the gentle wave swell pick him up settle him back down claudia kicked away from him giving him space it feels okay he said she watched him dive down surface again and again swimming through the waves and if there were any tears on his face she could not tell they swam they fished gooch saying no more than two sentences about what a good job his washington lawyer had done in keeping his record clean they talked instead of baseball of books of perhaps a trip to austin for a long weekend to hear lyle lovett play the day was warm and sleepy the water fine and greenishblue the sky smooth as pearl on the way back in through the bay whit watched claudia doze in her chair and he wanted to reach out and touch her hand and say i know how bad ben hurt you i know and still you worry about me and i cant believe how you care but ill be okay given time ill be okay i will choose to be okay but whit didnt say any of these things he just closed his eyes and let the sun warm him knowing that here with these two people sacred to him on this boat he had a wealth to outshine rare gold or the most precious gem more than he could ever need
