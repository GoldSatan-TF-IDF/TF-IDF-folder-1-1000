excession iain banks prologue a little more than one hundred days into the fortieth year of her confinement dajeil gelian was visited in her lonely tower overlooking the sea by an avatar of the great ship that was her home far out amongst the heaving grey waves beneath drifting banks of mist the great slow bodies of some of the small seas larger inhabitants humped and slid jets of vapour issued from the animals breathing holes in exhaled blasts that rose like ghostly insubstantial geysers amongst the flock of birds accompanying the school causing them to climb and wheel and scream sideslipping and fluttering in the cool air high above slipping in and out of pinkrubbed layers of cloud like small slow clouds themselves other creatures moved dirigibles and kites cruising the upper atmosphere with wings and canopies extended warming in the watery light of a new day that light came from a line not a point in the sky because the place where dajeil gelian lived was not an ordinary world the single strand of fuzzy incandescence began near the far seaward horizon stretched across the sky and disappeared over the foliagestrewn lip of the twothousandmetrehigh cliff a kilometre behind the beach and the single tower at dawn the sunline would have appeared to rise from the horizon to starboard at midday it would be directly above the tower and at sunset it would seem to disappear into the sea to port it was midmorning now and the line lay about halfway up the sky describing a glowing arc across the vault like some vast slowmoving skipping rope forever twirling above the day on either side of the bar of yellowwhite light the sky beyond the real sky the sky above the clouds could be seen a solidlooking brownblack overpresence that hinted at the extreme pressures and temperatures contained within and where other animals moved in a cloudscape of chemistries entirely toxic to that below but which in shape and density mirrored the grey windruffled sea steady lines of waves broke on the grey slope of the shingle beach beating on shattered groundup shells tiny fragments of hollow animal carapaces brittle lengths of lightblighted seawrack watersmoothed slivers of wood pitted pebbles of foamstone like dainty marbles of porous bone and a general assortment of seaside detritus collected from a handfulhundred different planets strewn across the greater galaxy spray lifted from where the waves fell against the shore and brought the salty smell of the sea across the beach and the tangle of scrawny plants at its margin over the low stone wall providing some protection to the towers seaward garden and wrapping around the stubby construction itself and scaling the high wall beyond intermittently brought the seas iodine tang to the enclosed garden within where dajeil gelian tended raised carpets of bright spreadlingflowers and the rustling halfstunted forms of barb trees and shadowflowering wilderbush the woman heard the landward gatebell tinkle but already knew that she had a visitor because the black bird gravious had told her swooping from the misty sky a few minutes earlier to screech company at her through a writhing collection of beakheld prey before beating off again in search of more airborne insects for its winter larder the woman had nodded at the birds retreating form straightening and holding the small of her back as she did so and then absently stroking her swollen abdomen through the rich fabric of the heavy dress she wore the message borne by the bird had not needed to be any more elaborate throughout the four decades she had lived here alone dajeil had only ever had to receive one visitor the avatar of the vessel she thought of as her host and protector and who was now quickly and accurately pushing aside the barbtree branches as it made its way down the path from the landgate the only thing that dajeil now found surprising was that her visitor was here at this moment the avatar had attended her regularly entirely as though dropping casually by while on a walk along the shore for a short visit every eight days and habitually arrived for a longer more formal call at which they ate breakfast lunch or supper accordingly every thirtytwo days going by that schedule dajeil ought not to be expecting a visit from the ships representative for another five days dajeil carefully tucked a stray strand of her long nightblack hair back beneath her plain hair band and nodded to the tall figure making its way between the twisted trunks good morning she called the ships avatar called itself amorphia which apparently meant something reasonably profound in a language dajeil did not know and had never considered worth studying amorphia was a gaunt pale androgynous creature almost skeletally thin and a full head taller than dajeil who was herself both slender and tall for the last dozen or so years the avatar had taken to dressing all in black and it was in black leggings black tunic and a short black jerkin that it appeared now its cropped blonde hair covered by a similarly dark skull cap it took the cap off and bowed to dajeil smiling as though uncertain dajeil good morning are you well im well thank you dajeil said who had long since given up protesting at or indeed being bothered by such probably redundant niceties she was still convinced that the ship monitored her closely enough to know exactly how well she was and she was anyway always in perfect health but was nevertheless prepared to go along with the pretence that it did not watch over her so scrupulously and so had to ask still she did not respond in kind by asking after whatever might pass as the health of either a humanly formed but shipcontrolled entity which functioned as far as she knew solely as the vessels contact with her or indeed the ship itself shall we go inside she asked yes thank you the upper chamber of the tower was lit from above by the buildings translucent glass dome which looked up to an increasingly cloudy grey sky and from the edges by gently glowing inholod screens a third of which showed bluegreen underwater scenes usually featuring some of the larger mammals and fish the sea outside contained another third of which displayed bright images of softlooking watervapour clouds and the huge airborne creatures which played among them and the last third of which seemingly looked out on frequencies inaccessible directly to the human eye into the dense dark turmoil of the gasgiant atmosphere held compressed in the artificial sky above where yet stranger beasts moved surrounded by brightly decorated covers cushions and wall hangings dajeil reached from her couch to a low table of swirlingly carved bone and poured a warmed infusion of herbal juices from a glass pitcher into a goblet of hollowed crystal contained within a filigree of silver she sat back her guest sitting awkwardly on the edge of a delicate wooden seat picked up the brimming vessel looked around the room and then put the goblet to its lips and drank dajeil smiled the avatar amorphia was deliberately formed to look not simply neither male nor female but as perfectly artificially poised between maleness and femaleness as it was possible to be and the ship had never made any pretence that its representative was other than completely its creature with only the most cursory intellectual existence of its own however it still amused the woman to find her own small ways of proving to herself that this seemingly quite human person was nothing of the kind it had become one of the small private games she played with the cadaverously sexless creature she gave it a glass cup or goblet full to the brim of the appropriate drink indeed sometimes full beyond the brim with only surface tension holding the liquid in the container and then watched amorphia lift it to her mouth and sip it each and every time without either spilling a single drop or appearing to devote any special attention to the act a feat no human she had ever encountered could have performed dajeil sipped her own drink feeling its warmth make its way down her throat within her her child stirred and she patted her belly gently without really thinking the avatars gaze seemed fixed on one particular holo screen dajeil twisted on the couch to look in the same direction and discovered violent action in a couple of the screens displaying the views from the gasgiant environment a school of the habitats foodchaintopping predators sharp arrowheaded things finned like missiles venting gas from steering orifices were shown from different angles as they fell together out of some towering column of cloud and swept through clearer atmosphere down upon a group of vaguely birdlike grazing animals clustered near the edge of an upwelling cloudtop the avian creatures scattered some crumpling and falling some beating frantically away to the side some disappearing balled in fright into the cloud the predators darted and spun amongst them most missing their fleeing prey a few connecting biting slashing and killing dajeil nodded migration time up there she said breeding season soon she watched a grazer being torn apart and gulped down by a couple of the missilebodied predators mouths to feed she said quietly looking away she shrugged she recognised some of the predators and had given them her own nicknames though the creatures she was really interested in were the much bigger slowermoving animals generally untroubled by the predators which were like larger more bulbous relations of the unfortunate grazer flock dajeil had on occasion discussed details of the various ecologies contained within the ships habitats with amorphia who seemed politely interested and yet frankly ignorant on the subject even though the ships knowledge of the ecosystems was in effect total the creatures belonged to the vessel after all whether you regarded them as passengers or pets much like herself dajeil thought sometimes amorphias gaze remained fixed on the screens displaying the carnage taking place in the sky beyond the sky it is beautiful isnt it the avatar said sipping at the drink again it glanced at dajeil who was looking surprised in a way amorphia added quickly dajeil nodded slowly in its own way yes of course she leant forward and put her goblet on to the carvedbone table why are you here today amorphia she asked the ships representative looked startled it came close dajeil thought to spilling its drink to see how you are the avatar said quickly dajeil sighed well she said we have established that im well and and the child amorphia asked glancing at the womans belly dajeil rested her hand on her abdomen it is as ever she said quietly it is healthy good amorphia said folding its long arms about itself and crossing its legs the creature glanced at the holo screens again dajeil was losing patience amorphia speaking as the ship what is going on the avatar looked at the woman with a strange lost wild look in its eyes and for a moment dajeil was worried that something had gone wrong that the ship had suffered some terrible injury or division that it had gone quite mad after all its fellows regarded it as being halfmad already at best and left amorphia abandoned to its own inadequate devices then the blackclad creature unfolded itself from the chair and paced to the single small window that faced the sea drawing aside curtains to inspect the view it put its hands to its arms hugging itself everything might be about to change dajeil the avatar said hollowly seemingly addressing the window it glanced back at her for a moment it clasped its hands behind its back the sea may have to become as stone or steel the sky too and you and i may have to part company it turned to look at her then came over to where she sat and perched on the other end of the couch its thin frame hardly making an impression on the cushions it stared into her eyes become like stone dajeil said still worrying about the mental health of the avatar or the ship controlling it or both what do you mean we that is the ship amorphia said placing one hand on its chest we may finally have a thing to do a thing to do dajeil said what sort of thing to do a thing which will require that our world here changes the avatar said a thing which requires that at the least we have to put our animated guests into storage with everybody else well save for yourself and then perhaps that we leave all our guests all our guests behind in appropriate other habitats including me including you dajeil i see she nodded leaving the tower leaving the ship well she thought what a sudden end to my protected isolation while you she asked the avatar you go off to do what something amorphia told her without irony dajeil smiled thinly which you wont tell me about which i cant tell you about because because i dont yet know myself amorphia said ah dajeil thought for a moment then stood up and went to one of the holo screens where a camera drone was tracking a lightdappled school of triangular purplewinged rays across the floor of a shallow part of the sea she kpew this school too she had watched three generations of these huge gentle creatures live and die she had watched them and she had swum with them and once assisted in the birth of one of their young huge purple wings waved in slow motion tips intermittently disturbing little golden wisps of sand this is a change indeed dajeil said quite so the avatar said it paused and it may lead to a change in your own circumstances dajeil turned to look at the creature which was staring intently over the couch at her with wide unblinking eyes a change dajeil said her voice betraying her in its shakiness she stroked her belly again then blinked and looked down at her hand as though it too had turned traitor i cannot be sure amorphia confessed but it is possible dajeil tore off her hairband and shook her head setting free her long dark hair so that it half covered her face as she paced from one side of the room to the other i see she said staring up at the towers dome now sprinkled with a light drizzling rain she leant against the wall of holo screens her gaze fixed on the avatar when will all this happen a few small changes inconsequential but capable of saving us much time in the future if carried out now are happening already it said the rest the main part of it that will come later in a day or two or maybe a week or two if you agree dajeil thought for a moment her face flickering between expressions then she smiled you mean youre asking my permission for all this sort of the ships representative mumbled looking down and playing with its fingernails dajeil let it do this for a while then she said ship you have looked after me here indulged me she made an effort to smile at the darkclad creature though it was still intently studying its nails humoured me for all this time and i can never express my gratitude sufficiently or hope even to begin paying you back but i cant make your decisions for you you must do as you see fit the creature looked up immediately then well start tagging all the fauna now it said thatll make it quicker to round them up when the time comes itll take a few more days after that before we can start the transformation process from that point it shrugged it was the most human gesture she had ever seen the avatar make there may be twenty or thirty days before before some sort of resolution is reached again its hard to say dajeil folded her arms across the bulge of her fortyyearold selfperpetuated pregnancy she nodded slowly well thanks for telling me all this she smiled insincerely and suddenly she could not hold in the emotions any longer and looked through tears and black downtumbled curls at the longlimbed creature arranged upon her couch and said so dont you have things you must be doing from the top of the rainblown tower the woman watched the avatar as it retraced its steps along the narrow path through the sparsely treed water meadow to the foot of the twokilometre cliff which was skirted by a rough slope of scree the thin dark figure filling half her field of view and grainy with magnification negotiated a last great boulder at the base of the cliff then disappeared dajeil let muscles in her eyes relax meanwhile a set of nearinstinctive routines in her brain shut down again the view returned to normal dajeil raised her gaze to the overcast a flight of the boxkite creatures was poised in the air just under the cloud surface directly above the tower dark rectangular shapes hanging still against the greyness as though standing sentinel over her she tried to imagine what they felt what they knew there were ways of tapping directly into their minds ways that were virtually never used with humans and whose use even with animals was generally frowned upon in proportion to the creatures intelligence but they did exist and the ship would let her use them if she asked there were ways too for the ship to simulate all but perfectly what such creatures must be experiencing and she had used those techniques often enough for a human equivalent of that imitative process to have transferred itself to her mind and it was that process she invoked now though to no avail as it transpired she was too agitated too distracted by the things amorphia had told her to be able to concentrate instead she tried to imagine the ship as a whole in that same trained minds eye remembering the occasions when she had viewed the vessel from its remote machines or gone flying around it attempting to imagine the changes it was already preparing itself for she supposed they would be unglimpsable from the sort of distance that would let you see the whole craft she looked around taking in the great cliff the clouds and the sea the darkness of sky her gaze swept round the waves the seamarsh and the water meadows beneath the scree and the cliff she rubbed her belly without thinking as she had done for nearly forty years and pondered on the marginality of things and how quickly change could come even to something that had seemed set to continue as it was in perpetuity but then as she knew too well the more fondly we imagine something will last forever the more ephemeral it often proves to be she became suddenly very aware of her place here her position she saw herself and the tower both within and outside the ship outside its main hull distinct discrete straightsided and measured exactly in kilometres but within the huge envelope of water air and gas it encompassed within the manifold layers of its fields she imagined the force fields sometimes as like the hooped slips underskirts skirts flounces and lace of some ancient formal gown a slab of power and substance floating in a giant spoonful of sea most of its vast bulk exposed to the air and clouds that formed its middle layer and around which the sunline curved each day and all domed with the long fieldcontained pressure vessel of ferocious heat colossal pressure and crushing gravity that simulated the conditions of a gasgiant planet a room a cave a hollow husk a hundred kilometres long hurrying through space with the ship as its vast flattened kernel a kernel an enclosed world inside this world within which she had not set foot for thirtynine of these forty unchanging years having no desire ever again to see that infinite catacomb of the silent undead all to change dajeil gelian thought all to change and the sea and the sky to become as stone or steel the black bird gravious settled by her hand on the stone parapet of the tower whats going on it croaked theres something going on i can tell what is it then whats it all about oh ask the ship she told it already asked it all itll say is theres changes coming like as not the bird shook its head once as if trying to dislodge something distasteful from its beak dont like changes it said it swivelled its head fixing its beady gaze upon the woman what sort of changes then eh what we got to expect what we got to look forward to eh it tell you she shook her head no she said not looking at the bird no not really huh the bird continued to look at her for a moment then pivoted its head back to look out across the salt marsh it ruffled its feathers and rose up on its thin black legs well it said winters coming cant delay best prepare the bird dropped into the air fat lot of use she heard it mutter it opened its wings and flew away on an involute course dajeil gelian looked up to the clouds again and the sky beyond all to change and the sea and the sky to become as stone or steel she shook her head again and wondered what extremity of circumstance could possibly have so galvanised the great craft that had been her home her refuge for so long whatever after four decades in its state of selfimposed internal exile navigating its own wayward course within its soughtout wilderness as part of the civilisations ulterior and functioning most famously as a repository for quiescent souls and very large animals it sounded like the general systems vehicle sleeper service was again starting to think

of sharp impacts registered through the companionway shell walls with resonations in the crafts secondary and primary structure the atmosphere pulsed with impact echoes a breeze picked up then disappeared the shifting air brought with it a smell of burning and vaporisation aluminium polymers associated with carbon fibre and diamond film superconductor cabling somewhere the drone sisela ytheleus could hear a human shouting then radiating wildly over the electromagnetic bands came a voice signal similar to that carried by the air it became garbled almost immediately then degraded quickly into meaningless static the human shout changed to a scream then the em signal cut off so did the sound pulses of radiation blasted in from various directions virtually informationfree the ships inertial field wobbled uncertainly then drew steady and settled again a shell of neutrinos swept through the space around the companionway noises faded em signatures murmured to silence the ships engines and main life support systems were offline the whole em spectrum was empty of meaning probably the battle had now switched to the ships ai core and backup photonic nuclei then a pulse of energy shot through a multipurpose cable buried in the wall behind oscillating wildly then settling back to a steady utterly unrecognisable pattern an internal camera patch on a structural beam nearby awakened and started scanning it cant be over that quickly can it hiding in the darkness the drone suspected it was already too late it was supposed to wait until the attack had reached a plateau phase and the aggressor thought that it was just a matter of mopping up the last dregs of opposition before it made its move but the attack had been too sudden too extreme too capable the plans the ship had made of which it was such an important part could only anticipate so much only allow for so proportionally greater a technical capability on the part of the attacker beyond a certain point there was simply nothing you could do there was no brilliant plan you could draw up or cunning stratagem you could employ that would not seem laughably simple and unsophisticated to a profoundly more developed enemy in this instance they were not perhaps quite at the juncture where resistance became genuinely without point but from the ease with which the elencher ship was being taken over they were not that far away from it either remain calm the machine told itself look at the overview place this and yourself in context you are prepared you are hardened you are proof you will do all that you can to survive as you are or at the very least to prevail there is a plan to be put into effect here play your part with skill courage and honour and no ill will be thought of you by those who survive and succeed the elench had spent many thousands of years pitting themselves against every kind of technology and every type of civilisational artifact the vast spaces of the greater galaxy could provide seeking always to understand rather than to overpower to be changed rather than to enforce change upon others to incorporate and to share rather than to infect and impose and in that cause and with that relatively unmenacing modus operandi had become perhaps more adept than any with the possible exception of the mainstream cultures semimilitary emissaries known as the contact section at resisting outright attack without seeming to threaten it but for all that the galaxy had been penetrated by so many different explorers in all obvious primary directions to every periphery however distant enormous volumes of that encompassing arena remained effectively unexplored by the current crop of inplay civilisations including the elench quite how utterly that region and beyond was comprehended by the elder species or even whether they really cared about it at all was simply unknown and in those swallowingly vast volumes amongst those spaces between the spaces between the stars around suns dwarfs nebulae and holes it had been determined from some distance were of no immediate interest or threat it was of course always possible that some danger waited some peril lurked comparatively small measured against the physical scale of the galaxys present active cultures but capable through a developmental peculiarity or as a result of some form of temporal limbo or exclusionary dormancy of challenging and besting even a representative of a society as technologically advanced and contactually experienced as the elench the drone felt calm thinking as coldly and detachedly as it could for those few moments on the background to its current predicament it was prepared it was ready and it was no ordinary machine it was at the cutting edge of its civilisations technology designed to evade detection by the most sophisticated instruments to survive in almost unimaginably hostile conditions to take on virtually any opponent and to suffer practically any damage in concentric stages of resistance that its ship its own manufacturer the one entity that probably knew it better than it knew itself was apparently being at this moment corrupted seduced taken over must not affect its judgement or its confidence the displacer it thought all ive got to do is get near the displace pod thats all then it felt its body scanned by a point source located near the ships ai core and knew its time had come the attack was as elegant as it was ferocious and the takeover abrupt almost to the point of instantaneity the battlememes of the invading alien consciousness aided by the thought processes and shared knowledge of the by now obviously completely overwhelmed ship with no interval to provide a margin for error at all the drone shunted its personality from its own ai core to its backup picofoam complex and at the same time readied the signal cascade that would transfer its most important concepts programs and instructions first to electronic nanocircuitry then to an atomechanical substrate and finally absolutely as a last resort to a crude little though at several cubic centimetres also wastefully large semibiological brain the drone shut off and shut down what had been its true mind the only place it had ever really existed in all its life and let whatever pattern of consciousness had taken root there perish for lack of energy its collapsing consciousness impinging on the machines new mind as a faint informationless exhalation of neutrinos the drone was already moving out from its bodyniche in the wall and into the companionway space it accelerated along the corridor sensing the gaze of the ceilingbeam camera patch following it fields of radiation swept over the drones militarised body caressing probing penetrating an inspection hatch burst open in the companionway just ahead of the drone and something exploded out of it cables burst free filling to overflowing with electrical power the drone zoomed then swooped a discharge of electricity crackled across the air immediately above the machine and blew a hole in the far wall the drone twisted through the wreckage and powered down the corridor turning flat to its direction of travel and extending a discfield through the air to brake for a corner then slamming off the far wall and accelerating up another companionway it was one of the full crossaxis corridors and so long the drone quickly reached the speed of sound in the humanbreathable atmosphere an emergency door slammed shut behind it a full second after it had passed a space suit shot upwards out of a descending vertical tubeway near the end of the companionway crumpled to a stop then reared up and stumbled out to intercept the machine the drone had already scanned the suit and knew the suit was empty and unarmed it went straight through it leaving it flapping halved against floor and ceiling like a collapsed balloon the drone threw another disc of field around itself to match the companionways diameter and rode almost to a stop on a piston of compressed air then darted round the next corner and accelerated again a human figure inside a space suit lay halfway up the next corridor which was pressurising rapidly with a distant roar of gas smoke was filling the companionway in the distance then it ignited and the mixture of gases exploded down the tube the smoke was transparent to the drone and far too cool to do it any harm but the thickening atmosphere was going to slow it up which was doubtless exactly the idea the drone scanned the human and the suit as best it could as it tore up the smokefilled corridor towards it it knew the person in the suit well he had been on the ship for five years the suit was without weaponry its systems quiet but doubtless already taken over the man was in shock and under fierce chemical sedation from the suits medical unit as the drone approached the suit it raised one arm towards the fleeing machine to a human the arm would have appeared to move almost impossibly quickly flicking up at the machine but to the drone the gesture looked languid almost leisurely surely this could not be all the threat the suit was capable of the drone had only the briefest warning of the suits bolstered gun exploding until that instant the gun hadnt even been apparent to the machines senses shielded somehow there was no time to stop no opportunity to use its own em effector on the guns controls to prevent it from overloading nowhere to take cover and in the thick mist of gases flooding the corridor no way of accelerating beyond the danger at the same moment the ships inertial field fluctuated again and flipped a quarterturn suddenly down was directly behind the drone and the field strength doubled then redoubled the gun exploded tearing the suit and the human it contained apart the drone ignored the backward tug of the ships reoriented gravity and slammed against the ceiling skidding along it for half a metre while producing a coneshaped field immediately behind it the explosion blew the companionways inner shell apart and punched the drone into the corridors ceiling so hard its backup semibiochemical brain was reduced to a useless paste inside it that no major pieces of shrapnel struck it counted as a minor miracle the blast hit the drones conical field and flattened it though not before enough of its energy had been directed through the inner and outer fabric of the companionway shell in a fair impersonation of a shapedcharge detonation the corridors lining punctured and tore to provide a vent for the cloud of gases still flooding into the companionway they erupted into the depressurised loading bay outside the drone paused momentarily letting debris tear past it in a hurricane of gas then in the semivacuum which resulted powered off again ignoring the escape route which had opened behind it and racing down to the next companionway junction the offline displacer pod the drone was making for hung outside the ship hull only ten metres round the next corner the drone curved through the air bounced off another wall and the floor and raced into the hullwall companionway to find a machine similar to itself screaming towards it it knew this machine too it was its twin it was its closest siblingfriendlovercomrade in all the great distributed forever changing civilisation that was the blench xray lasers flickered from the converging machine only millimetres above the drone producing detonations somewhere way behind it while it flicked on its mirrorshields flipped in the air ejected its old ai core and the semibiochemical unit into the air behind it and spun around in an outside loop to continue down the companionway the two components it had ejected flared beneath it instantly vaporising and surrounding it with plasma it fired its own laser at the approaching drone the blast was mirrored off blossoming like fiery petals which raged against and pierced the corridor walls and effectored the displacer pod controls powering the machinery up into a preset sequence the attack on its photonic nucleus came at the same moment manifesting itself as a perceived disturbance in the spacetime fabric warping the internal structure of the drones lightenergised mind from outside normal space its using the engines thought the drone senses swimming its awareness seeming to break up and evaporate somehow as it effectively began to go unconscious fmam cried a tiny longthoughtout sub routine it felt itself switch to amplitude modulation instead of frequency modulation reality snapped back into focus again though its senses still remained disconnected and thoughts still felt odd but if i dont react otherwise the other drone fired at it again zooming towards it on an intercept course ramming how inelegant the drone mirrored the rays still refusing to adjust its internal photonic topography to allow for the wildly shifting wavelength changes demanding attention in its mind the displacer pod just the other side of the ships hull hummed into life a set of coordinates corresponding with the drones own present position appeared flickering in the drones awareness describing the volume of space that would be nipped off from the surface of the normal universe and hurled far beyond the stricken elencher ship damn might make it yet just roll with it the drone thought dizzily it rolled literally physically in midair light bursting from all around it and bearing the signature of plasma fire drummed into its casing with what felt like the pressure of a small nuclear blast its fields mirrored what they could the rest roasted the machine to white heat and started to seep inside its body beginning to destroy its more vulnerable components still it held out completing its roll through the superheated gases around it mostly vaporised floortiles it noted dodging the shape spearing towards it that was its murderous twin noticing almost lazily now that the displacer pod had completed its powerup and was moving to claspdischarge while its mind involuntarily registered the information contained in the blast of radiation and finally caved in under the force of the alien purpose encoded within it felt itself split in two leaving behind its real personality giving that up to the invading power of its photonic cores abducted intent and becoming slowly balefully aware of its own abstracted echo of existence in clumsy electronic form the displacer on the other side of the hull wall completed its cycle it snapped a field around and instantly swallowed a sphere of space not much bigger than the head of a human the resulting bang would have been quite loud in anything other than the mayhem the onboard battle had created the drone barely larger than two adult human hands placed together fell smoking glowing to the side wall of the companionway which was now in effect the floor gravity returned to normal and the drone clunked to the floor proper clattering onto the heatscarred undersurface beneath the chimney that was a vertical companionway something was raging in the drones real mind behind walls of insulation something powerful and angry and determined the machine produced a thought equivalent to a sigh or a shrug of the shoulders and interrogated its atomechanical nucleus just for good forms sake but that avenue was irredeemably heatcorrupted not that it mattered it was over all over done then the ship hailed it quite normally over its communicator now why didnt you try that in the first place thought the drone well it answered itself because i wouldnt have replied of course it found that almost funny but it couldnt reply the com units send facility had been wasted by the heat too so it waited gas drifted stuff cooled other stuff condensed making pretty designs on the floor things creaked radiations played and hazy em indications suggested the ships engines and major systems were back on line the heat making its way through the drones body dissipated slowly leaving it alive but still crippled and incapable of movement or action it would take it days to bootstrap the routines that would even start to replace the mechanisms that would construct the selfrepair nanounits that seemed quite funny too the vessel made noises and signals like it was moving off through space again meanwhile the thing in the drones real mind went on raging it was like living with a noisy neighbour or having a headache thought the drone it went on waiting eventually a heavy maintenance unit about the size of a human torso and escorted by a trio of small selfmotivated effector sidearms appeared at the far end of the vertical companionway above it and floated down through the currents of climbing gas until they were directly over the small pocked smoking and splintered casing of the drone the effector weapons aim had stayed locked onto the drone the whole way down then one of the guns powered up and fired at the small machine shit bit summary dammit the drone had time to think but the effector was powered only enough to provide a twoway communication channel hello said the maintenance unit through the gun hello yourself the other machine is gone i know my twin snapped displaced get thrown a long way by one of those big displace pods something that small oneoff coordinates too never find it the drone knew it was babbling its electronic mind was probably under effector incursion but too damn stupid even to know it and so gibbering as a side effect but it couldnt stop itself yep totally gone entity overboard onethrow xyzs never find it no point in even looking for it unless you want me to step into the breach too of course id go take a squint if you like if the pods still up for it personally it wouldnt be too much trouble did you mean all that to happen the drone thought about lying but now it could feel the effector weapon in its mind and knew that not only the weapon and the maintenance drone but the ship and whatever had taken over all of them could see it was thinking about lying so feeling that it was itself again but knowing it had no defences left wearily it said yes from the beginning yes from the beginning we can find no trace of this plan in your ships mind well narnarnefuckingnarnar to you then prickbrains illuminating insults are you in pain no look who are you your friends i dont believe this i thought this ship was smart but it gets taken over by something that talks like a hegemonising swarm out of an infants tale we can discuss that later but what was the point of displacing beyond our reach your twin machine rather than yourself it was ours was it not or did we miss something you missed something the displacer was programmed to oh just read my brains im not sore but im tired silence for a moment then i see the displacer copied your mindstate to the machine it ejected that was why we found your twin so handily placed to intercept you when we realised you were not yet ours and there might be a way out via the displacer one should always be prepared for every eventuality even if its getting shafted by a dope with bigger guns well if cuttingly put actually i believe your twin machine may have been badly damaged by the plasma implosure directed at yourself and as all you were trying to do was get away rather than find a novel method of attacking us the matter is anyway not of such great importance very convincing ah sarcasm well never mind come and join us now do i have a choice in this what you would rather die or do you think we would leave you to repair yourself as you arewere and hence attack us in the future just checking we shall transcribe you into the ships own core with the others who suffered mortality and the humans the mammal crew what of them are they dead or in the core three are solely in the core including the one whose weapon we used to try to stop you the rest sleep with inactive copies of the brainstates in the core for study we have no intentions of destroying them if thats what concerns you do you care for them particularly never could stand the squidgy great slow lumps myself what a harsh machine you are come im a soldier drone you cretin what do you expect and anyway im harsh you just wasted my ship and all my friends and comrades and you call me harsh you insisted upon invasionary contact not us and there have been no mindstate total losses at all except that brought about by your displacer but let me explain all this in more comfort look cant you just kill me and get it o but with that the effector weapon altered its setup momentarily and in effect sucked the little machines intellect out of its ruined and smouldering body iii byr genarhofoen my good friend welcome colonel alienbefriender first class fivetide humidyear vii of the winterhunter tribe threw four of his limbs around the human and hugged him tightly to his central mass pursing his lip fronds and pressing his front beak to the humans cheek mmmmww wah there ha ha genarhofoen felt the diplomatic force officers kiss through the few millimetres thickness of the gelfield suit as a moderately sharp impact on his jaw followed by a powerful sucking that might have led someone less experienced in the diverse and robust manifestations of affronter friendliness to conclude that the being was either trying to suck his teeth out through his cheek or had determined to test whether a culture gelfield contactprotection suit mk could be ripped off its wearer by a localised partial vacuum what the crushingly powerful fourlimbed hug would have done to a human unprotected by a suit designed to withstand pressures comparable to those found at the bottom of an ocean probably did not bear thinking about but then a human exposed without protection to the conditions required to support affronter life would be dying in at least three excitingly different and painful ways anyway without having to worry about being crushed by a cage of legthick tentacles fivetide good to see you again you brigand genarhofoen said slapping the affronter about the beakend with the appropriate degree of enthusiastic force to indicate bonhomie and you and you the affronter said he released the man from its grasp twirled with surprising speed and grace and clasping one of the humans hands in a tentacle end pulled him through the roaring crush of affronters near the nest space entrance to a clearer part of the web membrane the nest space was hemispherical in shape and easily a hundred metres across it was used mainly as a regimental mess and dining hall and so was hung with flags banners the hides of enemies bits and pieces of old weapons and military paraphernalia the curved veinedlooking walls were similarly adorned with plaques company battalion division and regimental honour plaques and the heads genitals limbs or other acceptably distinctive body parts of old adversaries genarhofoen had visited this particular nest space before on a few occasions he looked up to see if the three ancient human heads which the hall sported were visible this evening the diplomatic force prided itself on having the tact to order that the recognisable trophy bits of any given alien be covered over when a still animate example of that species paid a visit but sometimes they forgot he located the heads scarcely more than three little dots hidden high on one subdividing drapewall and noted that they had not been covered up the chances were this was simply an oversight though it was equally possible that it was entirely deliberate and either meant to be an exquisitely weighted insult carefully contrived to keep him unsettled and in his place or intended as a subtle but profound compliment to indicate that he was being accepted as one of the boys and not like one of those snivellingly timid aliens who got all upset and shirty just because they saw a close relatives hide gracing an occasional table that there was absolutely no rapid way of telling which of these possibilities was the case was exactly the sort of trait the human found most endearing in the affront it was equally just the kind of attribute the culture in general and his predecessors in particular had found to be such a source of despair genarhofoen found himself grinning wryly at the three distant heads and half hoping that fivetide would notice fivetides eye stalks swivelled waiterscum he bellowed at a hovering juvenile eunuch here wretch the waiter was half the size of the big male and childishly unscarred unless you counted the stump of the creatures rear beak the juvenile floated closer trembling even more than politeness dictated until it was within a tentacle reach this thing roared fivetide flicking a limbend to indicate genarhofoen is the alien beasthuman you should already have been briefed on if your chief is to avoid a sound thrashing it might look like prey but it is in fact an honoured and treasured guest and it needs feeding much as we do rush to the animals and outworlders serving table and fetch the sustenance prepared for it now fivetide screamed his voice producing a small visible shockwave in the mostly nitrogen atmosphere the juvenile eunuch waiter vented away with suitable alacrity fivetide turned to the human as a special treat for you he shouted we have prepared some of the disgusting glop you call food and a container of liquid based on that poisonous water stuff godshit how we spoil you eh he tentacleslapped the human in the midriff the gelfield suit absorbed the blow by stiffening genarhofoen staggered a little to one side laughing your generosity near bowls me over good do you like my new uniform the affronter officer asked sucking back a little from the human and pulling himself up to his full height genarhofoen made a show of looking the other being up and down the average fully grown affronter consisted of a mass the shape of a slightly flattened ball about two metres in girth and one and a half in height suspended under a veined frilled gas sac which varied in diameter between one and five metres according to the affronters desired buoyancy and which was topped by a small sensor bump when an affronter was in aggressivedefensive mode the whole sac could be deflated and covered by protective plates on the top of the central body mass the principal eyes and ears were carried on two stalks above the fore beak covering the creatures mouth a rear beak protected the genitals the anusgas vent was positioned centrally under the main body to the central mass were attached congenitally between six and eleven tentacles of varying thicknesses and lengths at least four of which normally ended in flattened leafshaped paddles the actual number of limbs possessed by any particular adult male affronter one encountered entirely depended on how many fights andor hunts it had taken part in and how successful a part in them it had played an affronter with an impressive array of scars and more stumps than limbs was considered either an admirably dedicated sportsman or a brave but stupid and probably dangerous incompetent depending entirely on the individuals reputation fivetide himself had been born with nine limbs considered the most propitious number amongst the best families providing one had the decency to lose at least one in duel or hunt and had duly lost one to his fencing master while at military college in a duel over the honour of the fencing masters chief wife its a very impressive uniform fivetide genarhofoen said yes it is rather isnt it the affronter said flexing his body fivetides uniform consisted of multitudinous broad straps and sashes of metalliclooking material which were crisscrossed over his central mass and dotted with holsters sheaths and brackets all occupied by weapons but sealed for the formal dinner they were here to attend the glittering discs genarhofoen knew were the equivalents of medals and decorations and the associated portraits of particularly impressive gameanimals killed and rivals seriously maimed a group of discreetly blank portrait discs indicated the females of other clans fivetide could honourably claim to have successfully impregnated the discs edged with precious metals bore witness to those who had put up a struggle colours and patterns on the sashes indicated fivetides clan rank and regiment which was what the diplomatic force to which fivetide belonged basically was a point not wisely ignored by any species who wished to have or just found themselves having any dealings with the affront fivetide pirouetted gas sac swelling and buoying him up so that he rose above the spongy surface of the nest space limbs dangling taking hardly any of his weight am i not resplendent the gelfield suits translator decided that the adjective fivetide had chosen to describe himself should be rendered with a florid rolling of the syllables involved making the affronter officer sound like an overly stagey actor positively intimidating genarhofoen agreed thank you fivetide said sinking down again so that his eye stalks were level with the humans face the stalks gaze rose and dipped looking the man up and down your own apparel is different at long last and im sure most smart by the standards of your own people the posture of the affronters eye stalks indicated that he found something highly pleasing in this statement probably fivetide was congratulating himself on being incredibly diplomatic thank you fivetide genarhofoen said bowing he thought himself rather overdressed there was the gelfield suit itself of course so much a second skin it was possible to forget he wore it all normally the suit was nowhere more than a centimetre thick and averaged only half that yet it could keep him comfortable in environments even more extreme than that required for affronter life unfortunately some idiot had let slip that the culture tested such suits by displacing them into the magma chambers of active volcanoes and letting them pop out again not true the laboratory tests were rather more demanding though it had been done once and it was just the sort of thing a showoff culture manufactory would do to impress people this was definitely not the kind of information to bandy about in the presence of beings as inquisitive and physically exuberant as affronters it only put ideas into their minds and while the affront habitat genarhofoen lived within didnt recreate conditions on a planet to the extent that it had volcanoes there had been a couple of times after fivetide had asked the human to confirm the volcano story when hed thought hed caught the diplomatic force officer looking at him oddly exactly as though he was trying to work out what natural phenomena or piece of apparatus he had access to he could use to test out this remarkable and intriguing protectivity the gelfield suit possessed something called a nodedistributed brain which was capable of translating with seeming effortlessness every nuance of genarhofoens speech to the affronters and vice versa as well as effectively rendering any other sonic chemical or electromagnetic signal into humanmeaningful information unhappily the processing power required for this sort of technical geewhizzery meant that according to culture convention the suit had to be sentient genarhofoen had insisted on a model with the intelligence fixed at the lower limit of the acceptable intellectual range but it still meant that the suit literally had a mind of its own even if it was nodedistributed one of those technical terms genarhofoen took some pride in having no idea concerning the meaning of the result was a device which was almost as much a metaphorical pain to live with as it was in a literal sense a pleasure to live within it looked after you perfectly but it couldnt help constantly reminding you of the fact typical culture thought genarhofoen ordinarily genarhofoen had the suit appear milkily silver to an affronter over most of its surface while keeping the hands and head transparent only the eyes had never looked quite right they had to bulge out a bit if he was to be able to blink normally as a result he usually wore sunglasses when he went out which did seem a little incongruous submerged in the dim photochemical fog characteristic of the atmosphere a hundred kilometres beneath the sunlit cloudtops of the affronts home world but which were useful as a prop on top of the suit he usually wore a gilet with pockets for gadgets gifts and bribes and a crotchcupping hip holster containing a couple of antique but impressivelooking hand guns in terms of offensive capability the pistols provided a sort of minimum level of respectability for genarhofoen without them no affronter could possibly allow themselves to be seen taking so puny an outworlder seriously for the regimental dinner genarhofoen had reluctantly accepted the advice of the module in which he lived and dressed in what it assured him was a most fetching outfit of knee boots tight trousers short jacket and long cloak worn off the shoulder and in addition to an even bigger pair of pistols than usual had slung over his back a matched pair of what the module assured him were threemillimetrecalibre heavy micro rifles two millennia old but still in full working order and very long and gleamingly impressive he had balked at the tall drumshaped much betassled hat the module had suggested and theyd compromised on a dressarmoured halfhelm which made it look as though something with six long metallic fingers was cradling his head from behind naturally each article in this outfit was covered in its own equivalent of a gelfield protecting it from the coldly corrosive pressure of the affronter environment though the module had insisted that if he wanted to fire the micro rifles for politeness sake they would function perfectly well sire yelped the eunuch juvenile waiter skittering to a stop on the nestspace surface at fivetides side cradled in three of its limbs was a large tray full of transparent multiwalled flasks of various sizes what yelled fivetide the alien guests foodstuffs sir fivetide extended a tentacle and rummaged around on the tray knocking things over the waiter watched the containers topple fall and roll on the tray it held with an expression of wideeyed terror genarhofoen needed no ambassadorial training to recognise the genuine danger to the waiter of any of the containers breaking was probably small implosions produced relatively little shrapnel and the affronterpoisonous contents would freeze too quickly to present much of a danger but the punishment awaiting a waiter who made so public a display of its incompetence was probably in proportion to that conspicuousness and the creature was right to be concerned what is this fivetide demanded holding up a spherical flask threequarters full of liquid and shaking it vigorously in front of the eunuch juveniles beak is this a drink is it well i dont know sir the waiter wailed it it looks like it is imbecile muttered fivetide then presented the flask gracefully to genarhofoen honoured guest he said please tell us if our efforts please you genarhofoen nodded and accepted the flask fivetide turned on the waiter well he shouted dont just float there you moron take the rest to the savagetalker battalion table he flicked a tentacle towards the waiter who flinched spectacularly its gas sac deflated and it ran across the floor membrane for the banqueting area of the nest space dodging the affronters gradually making their way in that direction fivetide turned briefly to acknowledge the greeting slap of a fellow diplomatic force officer then rotated back produced a bulb of fluid from one of the pockets on his uniform and clinked it carefully against the flask genarhofoen held to the future of affrontculture relations he rumbled may our friendship be long and our wars be short fivetide squeezed the fluid into his mouth beak so short you could miss them entirely genarhofoen said tiredly more because it was the sort of thing a culture ambassador was supposed to say rather than because he sincerely meant it fivetide snorted derisively and dodged briefly to one side apparently attempting to stick one tentacleend up the anus of a passing fleet captain who wrestled the tentacle aside and snapped his beak aggressively before joining in fivetides laughter and exchanging the heartfelt hellos and thunderous tentacleslaps of dear friends there would be a lot of this sort of stuff this evening genarhofoen knew the dinner was an allmale gathering and therefore likely to be fairly boisterous even by affronter standards genarhofoen put the flasks nozzle to his mouth the gelfield suit attached itself to the nozzle equalised pressures opened the flasks seal and then as genarhofoen tipped his head back had what for the suits brain was a good long think before it permitted the liquid inside to wash through it and into the mans mouth and throat fiftyfifty wateralcohol plus traces of partially toxic herblike chemicals closest to leisetsiker spirit said a voice in genarhofoens head if i were you id bypass it if you were me suit youd welcome inebriation just to mitigate the effects of having to suffer your intimate embrace genarhofoen told the thing as he drank oh were in tetchy mode are we said the voice i don it with your good self it is good by your bizarre criteria fivetide inquired eye stalks nodding at the flask genarhofoen nodded as the drink warmed its way down his throat to his stomach he coughed which had the effect of making the gelfield ball out round his mouth like silvery chewing gum for a moment something which he knew fivetide thought was the second funniest thing a human could do in a gelfield suit only beaten for amusement value by a sneeze unhealthy and poisonous genarhofoen told the affronter perfect copy my compliments to the chemist ill pass them on fivetide said crushing his drinking bulb and flicking it casually at a passing servant come now he said taking the human by the hand again lets to table my stomachs as empty as a cowards bowels before battle no no no you have to flick it like this you stupid human or the scratchoundsll get it watch affronter formal dinners were held round a collection of giant circular tables anything up to fifteen metres across each of which looked down into a baitpit where animal fights took place between and during courses in the old days at banquets held by the military and within the higher reaches of affront society contests between groups of captured aliens had been a particular and reasonably regular highlight despite the fact that mounting such fights was often hideously expensive and fraught with technical complications due to the different chemistries and pressures involved not to mention frequently presenting a very real danger to the observing dinner guests who could forget the ghastly explosion at the deepscars table five back in when every single guest had met a messy but honourable end due to the explosion of a highly pressurised baitpit domed to simulate the atmosphere of a gasgiant indeed amongst the people who really mattered it was one of the most frequently voiced objections to the affronts membership of the informal association of other spacefaring species that having to be nice to other lesser species rather than giving the brutes a chance to prove their mettle against the glorious force of affront arms had resulted in a distinct dulling of the average society dinner still on really special occasions these days the fights would be between two affronters with a dispute of a suitably dishonourable nature or between criminals such contests usually required that the protagonists be hobbled tied together and armed with sliverknives scarcely more substantial than hat pins thus ensuring that the fights didnt end too quickly genarhofoen had never been invited to one of those and didnt expect he ever would be it wasnt the sort of thing one let an alien witness and besides the competition for seats was scarcely less ferocious than the spectacle everyone desired to witness for this dinner held to commemorate the eighteen hundred and eightyfifth anniversary of the affronts first decent spacebattle against enemies worthy of the name the entertainment was arranged to bear some relationship to the dishes being served so that the first fish course was accompanied by the partial flooding of the pit with ethane and the introduction into it of specially bred fighting fish fivetide took great pleasure in describing to the human the unique nature of the fish which were equipped with mouth parts so specialised the fish could not feed normally and had to be raised leeching vital fluids from another type of fish bred specially to fit into their jaws the second course was of small edible animals which to genarhofoen appeared furry and arguably even cute they raced round a trenchtrack set into the top of the pit at the inner edge of the circular table pursued by something long and slithery looking with a lot of teeth at each end the cheering hooting affronters roared thumped the tables exchanged bets and insults and stabbed at the little creatures with long forks while shovelling cooked prepared versions of the same animals into their beaks scratchounds made up the main course and while two sets of the animals each about the size of a corpulent human but eightlimbed slashed and tore at each other with razorsharp prosthetic jaw implants and strapclaws diced scratchound was served on huge trenchers of compacted vegetable matter the affronters considered this the highlight of the whole banquet one was finally allowed to use ones miniature harpoon quite the most impressivelooking utensil in each place setting to impale chunks of meat from the trenchers of ones fellow diners and with the skilful flick of the attached cable which fivetide was now trying to teach the human transfer it to ones own trencher beak or tentacle without losing it to the scratchounds in the pit having it intercepted by another dinner guest en route or losing the thing entirely over the top of ones gas sac the beauty of it is fivetide said throwing his harpoon at the trencher of an admiral distracted by a failed harpoon strike of his own that the clearest target is the one furthest away he grunted and flicked snapping the piece of speared scratchound up and away from the other affronters place an instant before the officer to the admirals right could intercept the prize the morsel sailed through the air in an elegant trajectory that ended with fivetide barely having to rise from his place to snap his beak shut on it he swivelled left and right acknowledging appreciative applause in the form of whipsnapped tentacles then settled back into the padded yshaped bracket that served as a seat you see he said making an obvious swallowing motion and spitting out the harpoon and its cable i see genarhofoen said still slowly recoiling the harpoon cable from his last attempt he sat to fivetides right in a ybracket place modified simply by placing a board across its prongs his feet dangled over the debris trench which circled the perimeter of the table and which the suit assured him was reeking in the manner approved by affronter gourmets he flinched and dodged to one side nearly falling off the seat as a harpoon sailed by to his left narrowly missing him genarhofoen acknowledged the laughter and exaggerated apologies from the affronter officer five along the table who had been aiming at fivetides plate and politely gathered up the harpoon and cable and passed it back he returned to picking at the miniature pieces of indifferent food in the pressurised containers in front of him transferring them to his mouth with a gelfield utensil shaped like a little fourfingered hand his legs swinging over the debris trench he felt like a child dining with adults nearly got you there eh human ha ha ha roared the diplomatic force colonel his other side from fivetide he slapped genarhofoen on the back with a tentacle and threw him half off the seat and onto the table oops the colonel said and jerked genarhofoen back with a teethrattling wrench genarhofoen smiled politely and picked his sunglasses off the table the diplomatic force colonel went by the name of quicktemper it was the sort of title which the culture found depressingly common amongst affronter diplomats fivetide had explained the problem was that certain sections of the affront old guard were slightly ashamed their civilisation had a diplomatic service at all and so tried to compensate for what they were worried might look to other species suspiciously like a symptom of weakness by ensuring that only the most aggressive and xenophobic affronters became diplomats to forestall anybody forming the dangerously preposterous idea the affront were going soft go on man have another throw just because you cant eat the damn stuff you shouldnt let that keep you from joining in the fun a harpoon thrown from the far side of the table sailed over the pit towards fivetides trencher the affronter intercepted it deftly and threw it back laughing uproariously the harpoons owner ducked just in time and a passing drinks waiter got it in the sac with a yelp and a hiss of escaping gas genarhofoen looked at the lumps of flesh lying on fivetides trencher why cant i just harpoon stuff off your plate he asked fivetide jerked upright your neighbours plate he bellowed thats cheating genarhofoen or a particularly insulting invitation to a duel bugger me what sort of manners do they teach you in that culture i do beg your pardon genarhofoen said given fivetide said nodding his eye stalks rewinding his harpoon cable lifting a piece of meat from his own plate to his beak reaching for a drink and drumming one tentacle on the table with everybody else as one of the scratchounds got another on its back and bit its neck out good play good play seven thats my dog mine i bet on that i did me you see gastrees i told you ha ha ha genarhofoen shook his head slightly grinning to himself in all his life he had never been anywhere as unequivocally alien as here inside a giant torus of cold compressed gas orbiting a black hole itself in orbit around a brown dwarf body light years from the nearest star its exterior studded with ships most of them the jaggedly bulbous shapes of affront craft and full in the main of happy spacefaring affronters and their collection of associated victimspecies still he had never felt so thoroughly at home genarhofoen its me scopellafranqui said another voice in genarhofoens head it was the module speaking through the suit ive an urgent message cant it wait genarhofoen thought im kind of busy here with matters of excruciatingly correct dining etiquette no it cant can you get back here please immediately what no im not leaving good grief are you mad i only just got here no you didnt you left me eighty minutes ago and youre already on the main course at that animal circus dressed up as a meal i can see whats going on relayed through that stupid suit typical the suit interjected shut up said the module genarhofoen are you coming back here now or not not well then let me check out the communication priorities here okay now the current state of the bet humanfriend fivetide said slapping a tentacle on the table in front of genarhofoen eh a bet genarhofoen said quickly replaying in his head what the affronter had been saying fifty sucks on the next from the red door fivetide roared glancing at his fellow officers on both sides genarhofoen slapped the table with his hand not enough he shouted and felt the suit amplify his translated voice accordingly several eye stalks turned in his direction two hundred on the blue hound fivetide who was from a family of the sort that would describe itself as comfortably off rather than rich and to whom fifty suckers was half a months disposable income flinched microscopically then slapped another tentacle down on top of the first one scumpouch alien he shouted theatrically you imply that a measly two hundred is a fit bet for an officer of my standing twofifty five hundred genarhofoen yelled slapping down his other arm six hundred fivetide hollered thumping down a third limb he looked at the others exchanging knowing looks and sharing in the general laughter the human had been outlimbed genarhofoen twisted in his seat and brought his left leg up to stamp its booted heel onto the table surface a thousand damn your cheap hide fivetide flicked a fourth tentacle onto the limbs already on the table in front of genarhofoen which was starting to look crowded done the affronter roared and think yourself lucky i took pity on you to the extent of not upping the bet again and having you unseat yourself into the debrispit you microscopic cripple fivetide laughed louder and looked round the other officers near by they laughed too some of the juniors dutifully some of the others friends and close colleagues of fivetides overloudly with a sort of vicarious desperation the bet was of a size that could get the average fellow into terrible trouble with his mess his bank his parents or all three others again looked on with the sort of expression genarhofoen had learned to recognise as a smirk fivetide enthusiastically refilled every nearby drinking bulb and started the whole table signing the letsbakethepitmasteroveraslowfireifhedoesntgetamoveon song right genarhofoen thought module you were saying that was a rather intemperate bet if i may say so genarhofoen a thousand fivetide cant afford that sort of money if he loses and we dont want to be seen to be too profligate with our funds if he wins genarhofoen permitted himself a small grin what a perfect way of annoying everybody tough he thought so the message i think i can squirt it through to what passes as a brain in your suit i heard that said the suit without our friends picking it up genarhofoen the module told him ramp up on some quicken and excuse me said the suit i think byr genarhofoen may want to think twice before glanding a drug as strong as quicken in the present circumstances he is my responsibility when hes out of your immediate locality after all scopellafranqui i mean be fair its all very well you sitting up there keep out of this you vacuous membrane the module told the suit what how dare you will you two shut up genarhofoen told them having to stop himself from shouting out loud fivetide was saying something about the culture to him and hed already missed the first part of it while the two machines were filling his head with their squabble can be as exciting as this eh genarhofoen indeed not he shouted over the noise of the song he lowered the gelfield utensil into one of the food containers and raised the food to his lips he smiled and made a show of bulging his cheeks out while he ate fivetide belched shoved a piece of meat half the size of a human head into his beak and turned back to the fun in the animal pit where the fresh pair of scratchounds were still circling warily sizing each other up they looked pretty evenly matched genarhofoen thought may i speak now said the module yes genarhofoen thought now what is it as i said an urgent message from the gsv death and gravity oh genarhofoen was mildly impressed i thought the old scoundrel wasnt talking to me as did we all apparently it is look do you want this message or not all right but why do i have to gland quicken because its a long message of course in fact its an interactive message an entire semanticcontext signalset with attached mindstate abstract capable of replying to your questions and if you listened to the whole thing in real time youd still be sitting there with a vacant expression on your face by the time your jovial hosts got to the huntthewaiter course and i did say it was urgent genarhofoen are you paying attention here im paying fucking attention but come on cant you just tell me what the message is précis it the message is for you not me genarhofoen i havent looked at it itll be streamdeciphered as i transmit it okay okay im glanded up shoot i still say its a bad idea muttered the gelfield suit shut up the module said sorry genarhofoen here is the text of the message from gsv death and gravity to seddunbraijsa byr fruel genarhofoen dam ois message begins the module said in its official voice then another voice took over genarhofoen i wont pretend im happy to be communicating with you again however i have been asked to do so by certain of those whose opinions and judgement i respect and admire and hence deem the situation to be such that i would be derelict in my duties if i did not oblige to the utmost of my abilities genarhofoen performed the mental equivalent of sighing and putting his chin in his hands while thanks to the quicken now coursing through his central nervous system everything around him seemed to happen in slow motion the general systems vehicle death and gravity had been a longwinded old bore when hed known it and it sounded like nothing had happened in the interim to alter its conversational style even its voice still sounded the same pompous and monotonous at the same time accordingly and with due recognition of your habitually contrary argumentative and wilfully perverse nature i am communicating with you by sending this message in the form of an interactive signal i see you are currently one of our ambassadors to that childishly cruel band of upstart ruffians known as the affront i have the unhappy feeling that while this may have been envisaged as a kind of subtle punishment for you you will in fact have adapted with some relish to the environment if not the task which i assume you will dispatch with your usual mixture of offhanded carelessness and casual selfinterest if this signal is interactive interrupted genarhofoen can i ask you to get to the fucking point he watched the two scratchounds tense together in slomo on either side of the pit the point is that your hosts will have to be asked to deprive themselves of your company for a while what why genarhofoen thought immediately suspicious the decision has been made and i hasten to establish that i had no part in this that your services are required elsewhere where for how long i cant tell you where exactly or for how long make a stab at it i cannot and will not module end this message are you sure asked scopellafranqui wait said the voice of the gsv will it satisfy you if i say that we may need about eighty days of your time no it wont im quite happy here ive been bounced into all sorts of special circumstances shit in the past on the strength of a heycomeanddoonelittlejobforus comeon line this was not in fact perfectly true genarhofoen had only ever acted for sc once before but hed known or at least heard of plenty of people whod got more than theyd expected when theyd worked for what was in effect the contact sections espionage and dirty tricks department i did not plus ive got a job to do here genarhofoen interrupted ive got another audience with the grand council in a month to tell them to be nicer to their neighbours or were going to think about slapping their paddles i want details of this exciting new opportunity or you can shove it i did not say that i am speaking on behalf of special circumstances are you denying that you are not as such but so stop fucking around who the hell else is going to start hauling a gifted and highly effective ambassador off genarhofoen we are wasting time here we genarhofoen thought watching the two scratchounds launch themselves at each other slowly never mind go on the task required of you is apparently a delicate one which is why i personally regard you as being utterly unsuited to it and as such it would be foolish to entrust the full details either to myself to your module your suit or indeed to you until all these details are required there you are thats exactly what you can shove all that sc needtoknow crap i dont care how fucking delicate the task is im not even going to consider it until i know whats involved the scratchounds were in midpounce now both of them twisting as they leapt shit thought genarhofoen this might be one of those scratchound bouts where the whole thing was decided on the initial lunge depending entirely on which beast got its teeth into the neck of the other first what is required said the message with a fair approximation of the way the death and gravity had always sounded when it was exasperated is eighty days of your time ninetynine to ninetynine point nineplus percent of which you will spend doing nothing more onerous or demanding than being carried from point a to point b the first part of your journey will be spent travelling in considerable comfort i imagine aboard the affronter ship which we will ask or rather pay probably them to put at your disposal the second part will be spent in guaranteed comfort aboard a culture gcu and will be followed by a short visit aboard another culture vessel whereupon the task we would ask of you will actually be accomplished and when i say a short visit i mean that it may be possible for you to carry out what is required of you within an hour and that certainly the assignment should take no longer than a day then you will make the return journey to take up wherever you left off with our dear friends and allies the affront i take it all that doesnt sound too much like hard work does it the scratchounds were meeting in the air a metre above the centre of the baitpit their jaws aimed as best they could at each others throats it was still a little hard to tell but genarhofoen didnt think it was looking too good for fivetides animal yeah yeah yeah well ive heard all this sort of thing before d and g whats in it for me why the hell should i oh fuck what said the death and gravitys message but genarhofoens attention was elsewhere the two scratchounds met and locked falling to the floor of the baitpit in a tangle of slowly thrashing limbs the bluecollared animal had its jaws clamped around the throat of the redcollared one most of the affronters were starting to cheer fivetide and his supporters were screaming shit suit genarhofoen thought what is it said the gelfield i thought you were talking to never mind that now see that blue scratchound cant take my or your eyes off the damn thing effectorise the fucker get it off the other one i cant do that that would be cheating fivetides arse is hanging way out the merrygoround on this suit do it now or take personal responsibility for a major diplomatic incident up to you what but effectorise it now suit come on i know that last upgrade let you sneak it under their monitors oh look at that ow cant you just feel those prosthetics round your neck fivetide must be kissing his diplomatic career goodbye right now probably already working out a way to challenge me to a duel after that doesnt really matter if i kill him or he kills me probably come to war between all right all right there there was a buzzing sensation on top of genarhofoens right shoulder the red scratchound jerked the blue one doubled up around its midriff and loosened its grip the redcollared beast wriggled out from underneath the other and twisting turned on the other beast and immediately reversed the situation fastening its prosthetic jaws around the throat of the bluecollared animal at genarhofoens side still in slow motion fivetide was starting to rise into the air right d and g what were you saying what was the delay what were you doing never mind like you said times a wasting get on with it i assume it is reward you seek what do you want golly let me think can i have my own ship i understand that to be negotiable ill bet you may have whatever you want there will that do oh of course genarhofoen please i beg you say you will do this thing d and g youre begging me genarhofoen asked with a laugh in his thought as the bluecollared scratchound writhed hopelessly in the other beasts jaws and fivetide started to turn to him yes i am now will you agree time is of the essence from the corner of one eye genarhofoen watched one of fivetides limbs begin to flip towards him he readied his slowreacting body for the blow ill think about it but quit that signal suit tell the module not to wait up now suit command instruction take yourself offline until i call on you genarhofoen halted the effects of the quicken he smiled and sighed a happy sigh as fivetides celebratory blow landed with a teethrattling thud on his back and the culture lost a thousand suckers could be a fun evening iv the horror came for the commandant again that night in the grey area that was the halflight from a full moon it was worse this time in the dream he rose from his camp bed in the pale light of dawn down the valley the chimneys above the charnel wagons belched dark smoke nothing else in the camp was moving he walked between the silent tents and under the guard towers to the funicular which took him up through the forests to the glaciers the light was blinding white and the cold thin air rasped the back of his throat the wind buffeted him raising veils of snow and ice that shifted across the fractured surface of the great river of ice contained between the jagged banks of the rockblack and snowwhite mountains the commandant looked around they were quarrying the deep western face now it was the first time he had seen this latest site the face itself lay inside a great bowl they had blasted in the glacier men machines and draglines moved like insects in the bottom of the vast cup of shining ice the face was pure white except for a speckling of black dots which from this distance appeared just like boulders it looked dangerously steep he thought but cutting it at a shallower angle would have taken longer and they were forever being hurried along by headquarters at the top of the inclined ramp where the drag lines released their hooked cargoes a train waited smoke drifting blackly across the blindingly white landscape guards stamped their feet engineers stood in animated discussion by the winch engine and a caravan shack disgorged another shift of stackers fresh from a break a sledge full of faceworkers was being lowered down the huge gash in the ice he could make out the sullen pinched faces of the men bundled in uniforms and clothes that were little better than rags there was a rumble and a vibration beneath his feet he looked round to the ice face again to see the entire eastern half of it crumbling away collapsing and falling with majestic slowness in billowing clouds of whiteness onto the tiny black dots of the workers and guards below he watched the little figures turn and run from the rushing avalanche of ice as it pressed down through the air and along the surface towards them a few made it most did not disappearing under the huge white wave rubbed out amongst that chalky glittering turmoil the noise was a roar so deep he felt it in his chest he ran along the lip of the facecut to the top of the inclined plane everybody was shouting and running around the entire bottom of the bowl was filling with the white mist of the kickedup snow and pulverised ice obscuring the stillrunning survivors just as the icefall itself had those it had buried the winch engine laboured making a high screeching noise the drag lines had stopped he ran on to the knot of people gathering near the inclined plane i know what happens here he thought i know what happens to me i remember the pain i see the girl i know this bit i know what happens i must stop running why dont i stop running why cant i stop why cant i wake up as he got to the others the strain on the trapped drag line still being pulled by the winch engine proved too much the steel hawser parted somewhere down inside the bowl of mist with a noise like a shot the steel cable came hissing and sizzing up through the air snaking and wriggling as it ripped up the slope towards the lip loosing most of its grisly cargo from its hooks as it came like drops of ice off a whip he screamed to the men at the top of the inclined plane and tripped falling onto his face in the snow only one of the engineers dropped in time most of the rest were cut neatly in half by the scything hawser falling slowly to the snow in bloody sprays loops of the hawser smacked off the railway engine with a thunderous clanging noise and wrapped themselves around the winch housing as though with relief other coils thumped heavily to the snow something hit his upper leg with the force of a fully swung sledgehammer breaking his bones in a cataclysm of pain the impact rolled him over and over in the snow while the bones ground and dug and pierced it went on for what felt like half a day he came to rest in the snow screaming he was facetoface with the thing that had hit him it was one of the bodies the drag line had flicked off as it tore up the slope another corpse they had hacked and loosened and pulled like a rotten tooth from the new face of the glacier that morning a dead witness that it was their duty to discover and remove with all dispatch and secrecy to the charnel wagons in the valley below to be turned from an accusatory body to innocent smoke and ash what had hit him and shattered his leg was one of the bodies which had been dumped in the glacier half a generation ago when the enemies of the race had been expunged from the newly conquered territories the scream forced its way out of his lungs like something desperate to be born to the freezing air like something aching to join the screams he could hear spread around him near the lip of the inclined plane the commandants breath was gone he stared into the rockhard face of the body that had hit him and he sobbed for breath to scream again it was a childs face a girls the snow burned his face his breath would not come back his leg was a burning brand of pain lighting up his whole body but not his eyes the view began to dim why is this happening to me why wont it stop why cant i stop it why cant i wake up what makes me relive these terrible memories then the pain and the cold went away seemed to be taken away and another kind of coldness came upon him and he found himself thinking thinking about all that had happened reviewing judging in the desert we burned them immediately none of this sloppiness was it some attempt at poetry to bury them in the glacier interred where they were so far up the ice sheet their bodies would stay in the ice for centuries buried too deep for anyone to find without the killing effort we had to put into it did our leaders begin to believe their own propaganda that their rule would last a hundred lifetimes and so started to think that far ahead could they see the meltlakes below the glaciers ragged dirty skirt all those centuries from now covered with the floating bodies released from the ices grip did it start to worry them what people would think of them then having conquered all the present with such ruthlessness did they embark on a campaign to defeat the future too make it love them as we all pretend to in the desert we burned them immediately they came out in the long trains through the burning heat and the choking dust and the ones that hadnt died in the black trucks we offered copious water no will could resist the thirst those baking days spent amongst death had built up in them they drank the poisoned water and died within hours we incinerated the plundered bodies in solar furnaces our offering to the insatiable sky gods of race and purity and there seemed to be something pure about the way they were disposed of as though their deaths gave them a nobility they could never have achieved in their mean degraded lives their ashes fell like a lighter dust on the powderous emptiness of the desert to be blown away together in the first storm the last furnace loads were the camp workers gassed in their dormitories mostly and all the paperwork every letter every order every requisition pad stores sheet file note and memo we were all searched even i those the special police found hiding diaries were shot on the spot most of our effects went up in smoke too what we were allowed to keep had been searched so thoroughly we joked they had managed to remove each grain of sand from our uniforms something the laundry had never been able to do we were split up and moved to different posts throughout the conquered territories reunions were not encouraged i thought of writing down what had happened not to confess but to explain and we suffered too not just in the physical conditions though those were bad enough but in our minds in our consciences there may have been a few brutes a few monsters who gloried in it all perhaps we kept a few murderers off the streets of our cities for all that time but most of us went through intermittent agonies wondering in moments of crisis if what we were doing was really right even though in our hearts we knew it was so many of us had nightmares the things we saw each day the scenes we witnessed the pain and terror these things could not help but affect us those we disposed of their torment lasted a few days maybe a month or two then it was over as quickly and efficiently as we could make the process our suffering has gone on for a generation i am proud of what i did i wish it had not fallen to me to do what bad to be done but i am glad that i did it to the best of my capabilities and i would do it again that was why i wanted to write down what had happened to witness our belief and our dedication and our suffering i never did i am proud of that too he awoke and there was something inside his head he was back in reality back in the present back in the bedroom of his house in the retirement complex near the sea he could see the sunlight hitting the tiles of the balcony outside the room his twinned hearts thumped the scales had risen on his back prickling him his leg ached echoing with the pain of that ancient injury on the glacier the dream had been the most vivid yet and the longest finally taking him to the icefall in the western face and the accident with the drag line deep buried that had been in his memory submerged beneath all the dread white weight of his remembered pain as well as that whatever he had experienced had gone beyond the normal course the usual environment of dreams propelled there by the reliving of the accident and the image of fighting for breath while he stared transfixed into the face of the dead girl he had found himself thinking explaining even justifying what he had done in his army career in the most definitive part of his life and now he could feel something inside his head whatever it was inside his head got him to close his eyes at last it said it was a deep deliberately authoritative voice its pronunciation almost too perfect at last he thought what was this i have the truth what truth who was this of what you did your people what the evidence was everywhere across the desert caked in loam lodged in plants sunk to the bottom of lakes and there in the cultural record too the sudden vanishings of art works changes in architecture and agriculture there were a few hidden records books photographs sound recordings indices which contradicted the rewritten histories but they still didnt directly explain why so many people so many peoples seemed to vanish so suddenly without any sign of assimilation what are you talking about what was this in his head you would not believe what i am commandant but what i am talking about is a thing called genocide and the proof thereof we did what had to be done thank you weve just been through all that your selfjustifications have been noted i believed in what i did i know you had the residual decency to question it occasionally but in the end you did indeed believe in what you were doing that is not an excuse but it is a point who are you what gives you the right to crawl inside my brains my name would be something like grey area in your language what gives me the right to crawl inside your brains as you put it is the same thing that gave you the right to do what you did to those you murdered power superior power vastly superior power in my case however i have been called away and i have to leave you now but i shall return in a few months and ill be continuing my investigations then there are still enough of you left to construct a more triangulated case what he thought trying to open his eyes commandant there is nothing worse i can wish upon you than to be what you already are but you might care to reflect upon this while im gone instantly he was back in the dream he fell through the bed the single icewhite sheet tore beneath him and tumbled him into a bottomless tank of blood he fell down through it to light and the desert and the rail line through the sands he fell into one of the trains into one of the trucks and was there with his broken leg amongst the stinking dead and the moaning living jammed in between the excrementcovered bodies with the weeping sores and the buzz of the flies and the whitehot rage of the thirst inside him he died in the cattle truck after an infinity of agony there was time for the briefest of glimpses of his room in the retirement complex even in his stillshocked painmaddened state he had the time and the presence of mind to think that while it felt as though a day at least must have passed while he had been submerged in the torturedream nevertheless everything in the bedroom looked just as it had earlier then he was dragged under again he awoke entombed inside the glacier dying of cold he had been shot in the head but it had only paralysed him another endless agony he had a second impression of the retirement home still the sunlight was at the same angle he had not imagined it was possible to feel so much pain not in such a time not in a lifetime not in a hundred lifetimes he found there was just time to flex his body and move a fingers width across the bed before the dream resumed then he was in the hold of a ship crammed in with thousands of other people in the darkness surrounded again by stink and filth and screams and pain he was already half dead two days later when the sea valves opened and those still left alive began to drown the cleaner found the old retired commandant twisted into a ball a little way short of the apartments door the next morning his hearts had given out the expression on his face was such that the retirementhome warden almost fainted and had to sit down quickly but the doctor declared the end had probably been quick v tight beam m tra n xgcu grey area ogsv honest

micro rifles clattered to the absorber mat just outside the airlock door and the cloak fell just beyond them the guns glinted in the soft light reflecting off gleaming wooden panels the mercury gambling chips in his jacket pocket exposed to the humanambient heat of the modules interior promptly melted he felt the change happen and stopped mystified to stare into his pockets he shrugged then turned his pockets inside out and let the mercury splash onto the mat he yawned and walked on funny the module hadnt greeted him the pistols bounced on the carpeted floor of the hall and lay beading with frost he left the short jacket hanging on a piece of sculpture in the hall he yawned again it was not far off the time of habitat dawn very much time for bed he rolled down the tops of the kneeboots and kicked them both down the corridor leading to the swimming pool he was pulling down his trousers as he entered the modules main social area shuffling forward bent over and holding on to the wall as he cursed the garments and tried to kick them off without falling over there was somebody there he stopped and stared it looked very much like his favourite uncle was sitting in one of the lounges best seats genarhofoen stood upright and swayed staring through numerous blinks uncle tishlin he said squinting at the apparition he leant on an antique cabinet and finally hauled his trousers off the figure tall whitemaned and with a light smile playing on its craggily severe face stood up and adjusted its long formal jacket just a pretend version byr the voice rumbled the hologram put its head back and fixed him with a measuring questioning look they really do want you to do this thing for them boy genarhofoen scratched his head and muttered something to the suit it began to peel off around him will you tell me what the hell it actually is uncle he asked stepping out of the gelfield and taking a deep breath of module air more to annoy the suit than because the air tasted better the suit gathered itself up into a headsized ball and floated wordlessly away to clean itself the hologram of his uncle breathed out slowly and crossed its arms in a way genarhofoen remembered from his early childhood put simply byr the image said they want you to steal the soul of a dead woman genarhofoen stood there quite naked still swaying still blinking oh he said after a while not invented here hup and here we are waking up quick scan around nothing immediately threatening it would seem hmm floating in space odd nobody else around thats funny views a bit degraded ohoh thats a bad sign dont feel quite right either stuff missing here clock running way slow like its down amongst the electronics crap run full system check oh good grief the drone drifted through the darkness of interstellar space it really was alone profoundly even frighteningly alone it picked through the debris that had been its power sensory and weapon systems appalled at the wasteland it was discovering within itself the drone felt weird it knew who it was it was sisela ytheleus a type d military drone of the explorer ship peace makes plenty a vessel of the stargazer clan part of the fifth fleet of the zetetic flench but its realtime memories only began from the instant it had woken up here a zillion klicks from anywhere slap bang in the middle of nothing with the shit kicked out of it what a mess who had done this what had happened to it where were its memories where was its mindstate actually it suspected it knew it was functioning on the middle level of its five stepped mindmodes the electronic below lay an atomechanical complex and beneath that a biochemical brain in theory the routes to both lay open in practice both were compromised the atomechanical mind wasnt responding correctly to the systemstate signals it was receiving and the biochemical brain was simply a mush either the drone had been doing some hard manoeuvring recently or it had been clobbered by something it felt like dumping the whole biochemical unit into space now but it knew the cellular soup its final backup mindsubstrate had turned into might come in handy for something above where it ought to be right now there were a couple of enormously wide conduits leading to the photonic nucleus and beyond that the true ai core both completely blocked off and metaphorically plastered with warning signals the equivalent of a single lit telltale adjacent to the photonic pipe indicated there was activity of some sort in there the ai core was either dead empty or just not saying the drone ran another systemscontrol check it seemed to be in charge of the whole outfit what was left of it it wondered if the sensor and weaponry systems degradation was real perhaps it was an illusion perhaps those units were in fact in perfect working order and under the control of one or both of the higher mind components it dug deeper into the units programming no it didnt look possible unless the whole situation was a simulation that was possible a test what would you do if you suddenly found yourself drifting alone in interstellar space almost every system severely damaged reduced to a levelthree mindstate with no sign of help anywhere and no recollection how you got here or what happened to you it sounded like a particularly nasty simulation problem a nearlyworstcase scenario dreamt up by a drone training and selection board well there was no way of telling and it had to act as though it was all real it kept looking around inside its own mindstate ah ha there were a couple of closed subcores intact within its electronic mind sealed and labelled as potentially though not probably dangerous there was a similar warning attached to the selfrepair controlroutine matrices the drone let those be for the moment it would check out everything else that it could before it started opening packages with what might prove to be nasty surprises inside where the hell was it it scanned the stars a matrix of figures flashed into its consciousness definitely the middle of nowhere the general volume was called the upper leafswirl by most people fortyfive kilolights from galactic centre the nearest star fourteen standard light months away was called esperi an old red giant which had long since swallowed up its complement of inner planets and whose insubstantial orb of gases now glowed dully upon a couple of distant icy worlds and a distant cloud of comet nuclei no life anywhere just another boring barren system like a hundred million others the general volume was one of the less wellvisited and relatively uninhabited regions of the galaxy nearest major civilisation point the sagraeth system forty light years away with a stagethree lizardoid civilisation first contacted by the culture a decade ago nothing special there voluminal influencesinterests rated creheesil affront culture the normal claimed minimum the cultures influenceinterest equivalent of background radiation and a smattering of investigations and flybys by twenty other civilisations making up a nominal otherwise not a place anybody was really interested in a twothirds forgotten disregarded region of space never before directly investigated by the elench though there had been the usual deepspace remote scans from afar showing nothing special no clues there date n by the chronology the elench still shared with the culture the drones service log abstract recorded that it had been built as part of a matched pair by the peace makes plenty in n shortly after the ships own construction had been completed most recent entry ship leaving tier habitat for a standard sweepsearch of the outer reaches of the upper leafswirl the detailed service log was missing the last flagged event the drone could find in its library dated from a daily current affairs archive update so had that been just yesterday or could something have happened to its clock it scrutinised its damage reports and searched its memories the damage profile equated to that caused by plasma fire and from the lack of obvious patterning either an enormous plasma event very far away or plasma fire possibly fusionsourced much closer but buffered in some way a nearby plasma implosure was the most obvious example not something it could do itself the ship could though its xray laser had been fired recently and its fieldshields projectors had soaked up some leakthrough damage consistent with what would have happened if something just like itself had attacked it hmm one of a matched pair it thought it searched it could find no further mention of its twin it looked about itself gauging its drift and searching it was drifting at about twoeighty klicks a second almost directly away from the esperi system in front of it it focused all its damaged sensory capacity to peer ahead nothing it didnt appear to be aimed at anything twoeighty klicks a second that was somewhere just underneath the theoretical limit beyond which something of its mass would start to produce a relativistic trace on the surface of spacetime if one had perfect instrumentation now was that a coincidence or not if not it might have been slung out of the ship for some reason displaced perhaps it concentrated its senses backwards no obvious point of origin and nothing coming after it either hint of something though the drone refocused cursing its hopelessly degraded senses behind it it found gas plasma carbon it widened the cone of its focus what it had discovered was an inflating shell of debris drifting after it at a tenth of its speed it ran a rewind of the debris shells expansion it originated at a point forty klicks behind the position where it had first woken up eighteen fiftythree milliseconds ago which implied it had been drifting totally unconscious for nearly half a second scary it scanned the distant shell of expanding particles theyd been hot messy that was wreckage battle wreckage even the carbon and the ions could originally have been part of itself or part of the ship or even part of a human a few molecules of nitrogen and carbon dioxide no oxygen but all of it doing just of its own velocity odd that as though it had somehow been prioritised out of a sudden appearance of matter again as though it had been displaced perhaps the drone flicked part of its attention back inside to the sealed cores in its mind substrate with their warning notices cant put this off any longer i suppose it thought it interrogated the two cores past the first was labelled the other one was simply called uhhuh it thought it opened the first core and found its memories ii genarhofoen floated within the shower buffeted from all sides by the streams of water the fans sucking the water back out of the ag shower chamber sounded awfully loud this morning part of his brain told him he was running short of oxygen hed either have to leave the shower or grope for the air hose which was probably in the last place hed feel for it it was either that or open his eyes it all seemed too much bother he was quite comfortable where he was he waited to see what would give first it was his brains indifference to the fact he was suffocating suddenly he was wide awake and flailing around like some drowning basichuman desperate for breath but afraid to breathe in the constellation of water globules he was floating within his eyes were wide open he saw the air hose and grabbed it he breathed in shit it was bright his eyes dimmed the view that was better he felt hed showered enough he mumbled off off into the air hose mask a few times but the water kept on coming then he remembered that the module wasnt talking to him right now because hed told the suit to accept no more communications last night obviously such irresponsibility had to be punished by the module being childish he sighed luckily the shower had an off button the water jets cut off gravity was fed gently back into the chamber and he floated slowly down with the settling blobs of water a reverser field clicked on and he looked at himself in it while the last of the water drained away sucking in his belly and sticking out his chin while he turned his face to the best angle and smoothed down a few upstart locks of his blond curls well i may feel like shit but i still look great he announced to nobody in particular for once probably even the module wasnt listening sorry to force the pace the representation of his uncle tishlin said s all right he said through a mouthful of feyl steak he washed it down with some warmedover infusion the module had always assured him was beneficial when you hadnt had enough sleep it tasted disgusting enough to be either genuinely good for you or just one of the modules little jokes sleep okay his uncles image asked he was apparently sitting across the table from genarhofoen in the modules dining room a pleasantly airy space filled with porcelain and flowers and boasting a seemingly realtime view on three sides of a sunlit mountain valley which in reality was half a galaxy away a small serving drone hovered near the wall behind the man good two hours genarhofoen said he supposed he could have stayed awake the night before when hed first discovered his uncles hologram waiting for him he could have glanded something to keep him bright and awake and receptive and got all this over with then but hed known hed end up paying for it eventually and besides he wanted to show them that just because theyd gone to the trouble of persuading his favourite uncle to record a semanticsignalmindabstractstate or whatever the hell the module had called it he still wasnt going to jump just because they said so the only concession hed made to all the urgency was deliberately not to dream he had a whole suite of pretty splendid dreamaccessible scenarios going at the moment several of them incorporating some powerfully good and satisfying sex and it was a positive sacrifice to miss out on any of them so hed gone to bed and had a pretty good if maybe still not quite long enough sleep and uncle tishlins message had just had to sit twiddling its abstract semantics in the modules ai core waiting till he got up so far all theyd done was exchange a few pleasantries and talk a little about old times partly of course so that genarhofoen could satisfy himself that this apparition had genuinely been sent by his uncle and sc had paid him the enormous compliment of sending not one but two personalitystates to him in order to argue him round to doing whatever it was they wanted from him that the hologram might be a brilliantly researched forgery created by sc would be even more of a compliment but that way lay paranoia i take it you had a good evening tishlins simulation said enormous fun tishlin looked puzzled genarhofoen watched the expression form on his uncles face and wondered how comprehensive was the duplication of his uncles personality now encoded living if you wanted to look at it that way in the modules ai core did whatever was in there sent here enciphered with the specific task of persuading him to cooperate with special circumstances actually feel or did it just appear to shit i must be feeling bad genarhofoen thought i havent bothered about that sort of shit since university how can you have enormous fun with aliens the hologram asked eyebrows gathering attitude genarhofoen said cryptically slicing off more steak but you cant drink with them eat with them cant really touch them or want the same things tishlin said still frowning genarhofoen shrugged its a kind of translation he said you get used to it he munched away for a moment while his uncles program or whatever it was digested this he pointed his knife at the image thats something id want in the unlikely event i agree to do whatever it is they want me to do what tishlin said leaning back arms crossed i want to become an affronter tishlins eyebrows elevated you want what boy he said well some of the time genarhofoen said half turning his head to the drone behind him the machine came quickly forward and refilled his glass with the infusion i mean all i want is an affronter body one that i can just sort of zap into and well just be an affronter you know socialise i dont see what the problem is really in fact i keep telling them itll be a great thing for cultureaffront relations id really be able to relate to these guys i could really be one of them hell isnt that what this ambassador shit is supposed to be all about he belched im sure it could be done the module says it could but it shouldnt and says its asked elsewhere and i know all the standard objections but i think itd be a great idea im damn sure id enjoy it i mean i could always sort of zap back into my own body anytime this is really shocking you isnt it uncle the image shook its head you always were the oddest child byr i suppose i should have known what to expect from you anybody whod go out there to live with the affront in the first place has to be slightly strange genarhofoen held his arms out wide but im just doing what you did he protested i only wanted to meet weird aliens byr i didnt want to become one of them heck and i thought youd be proud of me proud but worried byr are you seriously suggesting that becoming an affronter would be part of your price for doing what sc asks certainly genarhofoen said and squinted up at the hammerbeamed ceiling i vaguely recall asking for a ship as well last night and the death and gravity saying yes he shook his head and laughed must have imagined it he finished the last of the steak theyve told me what theyre prepared to offer byr tishlin said you didnt imagine it genarhofoen looked up really he asked really tishlin said genarhofoen nodded slowly and how did they persuade you to act as gobetween uncle he asked they only had to ask byr i may not be in contact any more but im happy to help out when i can when they have a problem this isnt contact uncle this is special circumstances byr said quietly they tend to play by slightly different rules tishlin looked serious the image sounded defensive i know that boy i asked around some of my contacts before i agreed to do this everything checks out everything seems to be reliable i suggest you do the same obviously but from what i can see what ive been told is the truth genarhofoen was silent for a moment okay so what have they told you uncle he asked draining the last of the infusion he frowned wiped his lips and inspected the napkin he looked at the sediment in the bottom of the glass then glared at the servant drone it wobbled in the drone equivalent of a shrug and took the glass from his hand tishlins representation sat forward putting its arms on the table let me tell you a story byr by all means genarhofoen said picking something from his lips and wiping it on the napkin the serving drone started to remove the rest of the breakfast things long ago and far away two and a half thousand years ago tishlin said in a wispy tendril of suns outside the galactic plane nearest to asatiel cluster but not really near to that or anywhere else the problem child an early general contact unit troubadour class chanced upon the ember of a very old star the gcu started to investigate and it found not one but two unusual things genarhofoen drew his gown about him and settled back in his seat a small smile on his lips uncle tish had always liked telling stories some of genarhofoens earliest memories were of the long sunlit kitchen of the house at ois back on seddun orbital his mother the other adults of the house and his various cousins would all be milling around chattering and laughing while he sat on his uncles knee being told tales some of them were ordinary childrens stories which hed heard before often but which always sounded better when uncle tish told them and some of them his uncles own stories from when hed been in contact travelling the galaxy in a succession of ships exploring strange new worlds and meeting all sorts of odd folk and finding any number of weird and wonderful things amongst the stars firstly the hologram image said the dead sun gave every sign of being absurdly ancient the techniques used to date it indicated it was getting on for a trillion years old what genarhofoen snorted uncle tishlin spread his hands the ship couldnt believe it either to come up with this unlikely figure it used the apparition glanced away to one side the way tishlin always had when he was thinking and genarhofoen found himself smiling isotopic analysis and fluxpitting assay technical terms genarhofoen said nodding he and the hologram both smiled technical terms the image of tishlin agreed but no matter what it was they used or how they did their sums it always came out that the dead star was at least fifty times older than the universe i never heard that one before genarhofoen said shaking his head and looking thoughtful me neither tishlin agreed though as it turns out it was released publicly just not until long after it had all happened one reason there was no big fuss at the time was that the ship was so embarrassed about what it was coming up with it never filed a full report just kept the results to itself in its own mind did they have proper minds back then tishlins image shrugged mind with a small m ai core wed probably call it these days but it was certainly sentient and the point is that the information remained in the ships head as it were where of course it would remain the ships practically the only form of private property the culture recognised was thought and memory any publicly filed report or analysis was theoretically available to anybody but your own thoughts your own recollections whether you were a human a drone or a ship mind were regarded as private it was considered the ultimate in bad manners even to think about trying to read somebody elses or something elses mind personally genarhofoen had always thought it was a reasonable enough rule although along with a lot of people over the years hed long suspected that one of the main reasons for its existence was that it suited the purposes of the cultures minds in general and those in special circumstances in particular thanks to that taboo everybody in the culture could keep secrets to themselves and hatch little schemes and plots to their hearts content the trouble was that while in humans this sort of behaviour tended to manifest itself in practical jokes petty jealousies silly misunderstandings and instances of tragically unrequited love with minds it occasionally meant they forgot to tell everybody else about finding entire stellar civilisations or took it upon themselves to try to alter the course of a developed culture everybody already did know about with the almost unspeakable implication that one day they might do just that not with a culture but with the culture always assuming they hadnt done so already of course what about the people on board the culture ship genarhofoen asked they knew as well of course but they kept quiet too apart from anything else they had two weirdnesses on their hands they assumed they had to be linked in some way but they couldnt work out how so they decided to wait and see before they told everybody else tishlin shrugged understandable i suppose it was all so outlandish i suppose anybody would think twice about shouting it to the rooftops you couldnt get away with such reticence these days but this was then the guidelines were looser what was the other unusual thing they found an artifact tishlin said sitting back in the seat a perfect blackbody sphere fifty klicks across in orbit around the unfeasibly ancient star the ship was completely unable to penetrate the artifact with its sensors or with anything else for that matter and the thing itself showed no signs of life shortly thereafter the problem child developed an engine fault something almost unheard of even back then and had to leave the star and the artifact naturally it left a load of satellites and sensor platforms behind it to monitor the artifact all it had arrived with in fact plus a load more it had made while it was there however when a followup expedition arrived three years later remember this all happened on the galactic outskirts and speeds were much lower then it found nothing no star no artifact and none of the sensors and remote packages the problem child had left behind the outgoing signals apparently coming from the sentry units stopped just before the followup expedition arrived within monitoring range ripples in the gravity field near by implied the star and presumably everything else had vanished utterly the moment the problem child had been safely out of sensor range just vanished just vanished disappeared without trace tishlin confirmed most damnable thing too nobodys ever just lost a sun before even if it was a dead one in the meantime the general systems vehicle which the problem child had rendezvoused with for repairs had reported that the gcu had effectively been attacked its engine problem wasnt the result of chance or some manufacturing flaw it was the result of offensive action apart from that and the still unexplained disappearance of an entire star everything was normal for nearly two decades tishlins hand flapped once on the table oh there were various investigations and boards of inquiry and committees and so on but the best they could come up with was that the whole thing had been some sort of hitech projection maybe produced by some previously unknown elder civilisation with a quirky sense of humour or even less likely that the sun and all the rest had popped into hyperspace and just sped off though they should have been able to observe that and hadnt but basically the whole thing remained a mystery and after everybody had chewed it over and over till there was nothing but spit left it just kind of died a natural death then over the following seven decades the problem child decided it didnt want to be part of contact any more it left contact then it left the culture proper and joined the ulterior again very unusual for its class and meanwhile every single human whod been on board at the time exercised what are apparently termed unusual life choices tishlins dubious look indicated he wasnt totally convinced this phrase contributed enormously to the informationcarrying capacity of the language the image made a throatclearing noise and went on roughly half of the humans opted for immortality the other half autoeuthenised the few remaining humans underwent subtle but exhaustive investigation though nothing unusual was ever discovered then there were the ships drones they all joined the same group mind again in the ulterior and have been incommunicado ever since apparently that was even more unusual within a century almost all of those humans whod opted for immortality were also dead due to further semicontradictory unusual life choices then the ulterior and special circumstances whod taken an interest by this time not surprisingly lost touch with the problem child entirely it just seemed to disappear too the apparition shrugged that was fifteen hundred years ago byr to this day nobody has seen or heard of the ship subsequent investigations of the remains of a few of the humans concerned using improved technology has thrown up possible discrepancies in the nanostructure of the subjects brains but no further investigation has been deemed possible the story was made public eventually nearly a century and a half after it all happened there was even a bit of a media fuss about it at the time but by then it was a portrait with nobody in it the ship the drones the people theyd all gone there was nobody to talk to nobody to interview nothing to do profiles of everybody was offstage and of course the principal celebrities the star and the artifact were the most offstage of all well genarhofoen said all very hold on tishlin said holding up one finger there is one loose end a single traceable survivor from the problem child who turned up five centuries ago somebody it might be possible to talk to despite the fact theyve spent the last twentyfour millennia trying to avoid talking human human tishlin confirmed nodding the woman who was the vessels formal captain they still had that sort of thing back then genarhofoen said he smiled how quaint he thought it was pretty nominal even back then tishlin conceded more captain of the crew than of the boat anyway shes still around in a sort of abbreviated form tishlins image paused watching genarhofoen closely shes in storage aboard the general systems vehicle sleeper service the representation paused to let genarhofoen react to the name of the ship he didnt not on the outside anyway just her personality is in there unfortunately tishlin continued her stored body was destroyed in an idiran attack on the orbital concerned half a millennium ago i suppose for our purposes that counts as a lucky break shed managed to cover her tracks so well probably with the help of some sympathetic mind that if the attack hadnt occurred shed have remained incognito to this day it was only when the records were scrutinised carefully after her bodys destruction that it was realised who she really was but the point is that special circumstances thinks she might know something about the artifact in fact theyre sure she does though its almost equally certain that she doesnt know what she knows genarhofoen was silent for a while playing with the cord of his dressing gown the sleeper service he hadnt heard that name for a while hadnt had to think about that old machine for a long time hed dreamt about it a few times had had a nightmare or two about it even but hed tried to forget about those tried to shove those echoes of memories to some distant corner of his mind and been pretty successful at it too because it felt very strange to be turning over that name in his mind now so whys this all suddenly become important after two and a half millennia he asked the hologram because something with similar characteristics to that artifact has turned up near a star called esperi in the upper leafswirl and sc needs all the help it can get to deal with it theres no trillionyearold suncinder this time but an apparently identical artifact is just sitting there and what am i supposed to do go aboard the sleeper service and talk to this womans mimage thats the mindstored construct of her personality apparently the image looked puzzled new one on me anyway youre supposed to try to persuade her to be reborn talk her into a rebirth so she can be quizzed the sleeper service wont just release her and it certainly wont cooperate with sc but if she asks to be reborn itll let her but why genarhofoen started to ask theres more tishlin said holding up one hand even if she wont play even if she refuses to come back youre to be equipped with a method of retrieving her through the link youll forge when you talk to the mimage without the gsv knowing dont ask me how thats supposed to be accomplished but i think its got something to do with the ship theyre going to give you to get you to the sleeper service after the affronter ship theyre going to hire for you has rendezvoused with it at tier genarhofoen did his best to look sceptical is that possible he asked retrieving her like that i mean against the wishes of the sleeper apparently tishlin said shrugging sc thinks theyve got a way of doing it but you see what i mean when i said they want you to steal the soul of a dead woman genarhofoen thought for a moment do you know what ship this might be the one to get me to the sleeper they havent began the image then paused and looked amused they just told me its a gcu called the grey area the image smiled ah i see youve heard of it too yeah ive heard of it the man said the grey area the ship that did what the other ships both deplored and despised actually looked into the minds of other people using its electro magnetic effectors in a sense the very very distant descendants of electronic countermeasures equipment from your average stage three civilisation and the most sophisticated powerful but also precisely controllable weaponry the average culture ship possessed to burrow into the grisly cellular substrate of an animal consciousness and try to make sense of what it found there for its own usually vengeful purposes a pariah craft the one the other minds called meatfucker because of its revolting hobby though not as it were to its face a ship that still wanted to be part of the culture proper and nominally still was but which was shunned by almost all its peers a virtual outcast amongst the great inclusionary metafleet that was contact genarhofoen had heard about the grey area all right it was starting to make sense now if there was one vessel that might be capable of plundering and more importantly that might be willing to plunder a stored soul from under the nose of the sleeper the grey area was probably it assuming what hed heard about the ship was true it had spent the last decade perfecting its techniques of teasing dreams and memories out of a variety of animal species while the sleeper service had by all accounts been technologically stagnant for the last forty years its time taken up with the indulgence of its own scarcely less eccentric pastime the image of uncle tishlin bore a distant expression for a moment then said apparently thats part of the beauty of it just because the sleeper service is another oddball doesnt mean that its any more likely than any other gsv to have the grey area aboard the gcu will have to lie off and thatll make this mimagestealing trick easier if the grey area was actually inside the gsv at the time it probably couldnt carry it off undetected genarhofoen was looking thoughtful again this artifact thing he said could almost be a whatdoyoucall it couldnt it an outside context paradox problem tishlin said outside context problem hmm yes one of those almost an outside context problem was the sort of thing most civilisations encountered just once and which they tended to encounter rather in the same way a sentence encountered a full stop the usual example given to illustrate an outside context problem was imagining you were a tribe on a largish fertile island youd tamed the land invented the wheel or writing or whatever the neighbours were cooperative or enslaved but at any rate peaceful and you were busy raising temples to yourself with all the excess productive capacity you had you were in a position of nearabsolute power and control which your hallowed ancestors could hardly have dreamed of and the whole situation was just running along nicely like a canoe on wet grass when suddenly this bristling lump of iron appears sailless and trailing steam in the bay and these guys carrying long funnylooking sticks come ashore and announce youve just been discovered youre all subjects of the emperor now hes keen on presents called tax and these brighteyed holy men would like a word with your priests that was an outside context problem so was the suitably upteched version that happened to whole planetary civilisations when somebody like the affront chanced upon them first rather than say the culture the culture had had lots of minor ocps problems that could have proved to be terminal if theyd been handled badly but so far it had survived them all the cultures ultimate ocp was popularly supposed to be likely to take the shape of a galaxyconsuming hegemonising swarm an angered elder civilisation or a sudden indeed instant visit by neighbours from andromeda once the expedition finally got there in a sense the culture lived with genuine ocps all around it all the time in the shape of those sublimed elder civilisations but so far it didnt appear to have been significantly checked or controlled by any of them however waiting for the first real ocp was the intellectual depressant of choice for those people and minds in the culture determined to find the threat of catastrophe even in utopia almost maybe agreed the apparition perhaps its a little less likely to be so with your help genarhofoen nodded staring at the surface of the table so whos in charge of this he asked grinning theres usually a mind which acts as incident controller or whatever they call it in something like this the incident coordinator is a gsv called the not invented here tish told him it wants you to know you can ask whatever you want of it uhhuh genarhofoen couldnt recall having heard of the ship and why me particularly he asked he suspected he already had the answer to that one the sleeper service has been behaving even more oddly than usual tishlin said looking suitably pained its altered its course schedule its no longer accepting people for storage and its almost completely stopped communicating but it says it will allow you on board for a browbeating no doubt genarhofoen said glancing to one side and watching a cloud pass over the meadows of the valley shown on the dining rooms projector walls probably wants to give me a lecture he sighed still looking round the room he fastened his gaze on tishlins simulation again she still there he asked the image nodded slowly shit genarhofoen said iii but it makes my brain hurt nevertheless major this is of inestimable importance i only looked at the first bit there and its already given me a thumping caseache still it has to be done kindly read it all carefully and then ill explain its significance knot my stalks this is a terrible thing to ask of a chap after a regimental dinner fivetide wondered if humans suffered so for their selfindulgence he doubted it no matter what they claimed with the possibly honourable possibly demented exception of genarhofoen they seemed a bit too stuffy and sensible willingly to submit to such selfpunishment in the cause of fun besides they were so insecure in their physical inheritance they had meddled with themselves in all sorts of ways probably they thought hangovers were just annoying rather than characterforming and so had shortsightedly dispensed with them i realise its early and it is the morning after the night before major but please the emissary which fivetide had met once before and which possessed the irritating trait of looking somewhat like a betterbuilt version of fivetides dear departed father had just appeared in the nest house without notice or warning if he hadnt known the way these things worked fivetide would right now be thinking of ways to torture the head of nest security tentacles had rolled beaks had been separated for less lucky hed been able to whip the bed covers round his deputy wife and both vice courtesans before the blighter had announced hisits presence by just floating into the nest fivetide clapped his forebeak together a couple of times tastes like ive had me beak up me arse he thought cant you just tell me what the damn signal means now he asked you wont know what im referring to come now the sooner you read it the sooner ill be able to tell you what it means and the sooner ill be able to demonstrate how it is just possible that this information will at the very least enable you to remove the harness of culture interference forever hmm im sure and whatll it do at most the emissary of the ship let its eye stalks dip to either side the affronter equivalent of a smile at most the information in this signal will lead to you being able to dominate the culture as completely as it if it chose to could dominate you the creature paused this signal could conceivably presage the start of a process which will deliver the entire galaxy into your hands and subsequently open up territories for expansion and exploitation beyond that which you cannot even begin to guess at and i do not exaggerate have i your attention now major fivetide snorted sceptically i suppose you have he said shaking his limbs and rubbing his eyes he returned his gaze to the note screen and read the signal xgcu fate amenable to change ogsv ethics gradient strictly as

again allow me to explain uninvited guests i the battle of boustrago had taken place on xlephier prime thirteen thousand years earlier it had been the final decisive battle in the archipelagic war though it had inappropriately been fought near to the centre of a continent a twentyyear conflict between that worlds first two great imperial nation states the muzzleloading cannon and rifle were stateoftheart munitions at the time though the cavalry charge was still very much regarded as both the most decisive battlefield manoeuvre and quite the finest and most stirring sight that warfare had to offer by the military high commands on each side the combination of modern ordnance and outdated tactics had as ever created enormous casualties on both sides amorphia wandered amongst the dead and dying of hill the battle had by this time moved on the few defenders whod survived and repelled the initial rush had been ordered to pull back just as the next wave of opposing troops had appeared out of the cannon smoke and fallen upon them they had been slaughtered almost to a man and the victors had swept on to the next redoubt across the shallow valley beyond shattered palisades lines of stakes and bunkers had been chewed up by the initial bombardment and later by the hooves of the cavalry bodies lay scattered like twisted shredded leaves amongst the tornup grassland and the rich brownred soil the blood of men and animals saturated the grass in places making it thick and glossy and collected in little hollows like pools of dark ink the sun was high in the cloudless sky the only cover was the wispy remnants of cannon smoke already a few carrion birds no longer too concerned by the noise of the battle near by had landed and started to investigate the corpses and the shattered bodies of the wounded the soldiers wore brightly coloured cheerylooking uniforms with lots of metal bucklework and very tall hats their guns were long simplelooking things their pikes swords and bayonets lay glittering in the sunlight the animals lying tangled amongst the traces of the smashed cannon trains were big thickset beasts almost unadorned the cavalry mounts were almost as gaily decorated as their riders they all lay together some with the collapsed shapelessness of death some in a pool of their own internal organs some missing limbs some in a posture appropriate to a still vital suffering caught in expressions appropriate to their agony thrashing or writhing or in the case of some of the soldiers supporting themselves on one limb and reaching out to plead for help or water or a coup de grace to end their torment it was all quite still frozen like a threedimensional photograph and it all lay spread out like some military societys model scene made real in general bay three inner of the gsv sleeper service the ships avatar achieved the top of the low hill and looked out over the battlescene beyond it stretched for kilometres in all directions across the sunlit rolling downland a grand confusion of posed men dashing mounts cavalry charges cannons and smoke and shadows getting the smoke right had been the hardest part the landscape was simplicity itself a covering of artificial flora on a thin layer of sterilised soil lying on a structure of foametal the great majority of the animals were simply very good sculptures the ship had created the people were real of course though the ones whod been disembowelled or particularly severely mutilated were generally sculptures too the details of the scene were as authentic as the ship could make them it had studied every painting etching and sketch of the battle and read every account military and media report of it even taking the trouble to track down the records of the diary entries of individual soldiers while at the same time undertaking exhaustive research into the whole historical period concerned including the uniforms weaponry and tactics in use when the battle had taken place for what it was worth after so much time a drone team had visited the preserved battle site itself and conducted their own deepscan of the ground the fact that xlephier prime was one of the twenty or so planets that could fairly claim to have been one of the home worlds of the culture not that it really admitted to having such things made the task easier the gsv had studied the realtime recordings contact craft and their emissaries had taken over the years of battles fought by humanoid societies with similar technology to get a feel for the way such events really looked and felt without the possibly prejudiced and partial eyes and memories of the participants or spectators getting in the way and it had eventually got the smoke right it had taken a while and eventually it had had to resort to a rather highertech solution than it would have preferred but it had done it the smoke was real each particle held and isolated in the grip of a localised antigravity field produced by projectors hidden underneath the landscape the ship was quietly proud of the smoke even the fact that the scene still wasnt perfect many of the soldiers looked female andor foreign or indeed alien when you looked closely at them and even the males of the appropriate and nottoomeddledwith genetic stock were too big and too generally healthy to be right for the time didnt really disturb the ship the people hadnt been the most difficult thing to get right but they were the most important component of the scene they were the reason it was all here it had all started eighty years ago on a very small scale every culture habitat whether it was an orbital or other large structure a ship a rock or a planet possessed storage facilities storage was where some people went when they had reached a certain age or if they had just grown tired of living it was one of the choices that culture humans faced towards the end of their artificially extended threeandahalf to four centuries of life they could opt for rejuvenation andor complete immortality they could become part of a group mind they could simply die when the time came they could transfer out of the culture altogether bravely accepting one of the open but essentially inscrutable invitations left by certain elder civilisations or they could go into storage with whatever revival criterion they desired some people slept for say a hundred years at a time then lived a single day before returning to their undreaming unageing slumbers some wanted simply to be woken after a set time had passed to see what had changed while theyd been gone some desired to come back when something especially interesting was happening content to leave that judgement to others and some only wanted to be brought back if and when the culture finally became one of the elders itself that was a decision the culture had been putting off for many millennia in theory it could have sublimed anything up to ten thousand years ago but while individuals and small groups of people and minds did sublime all the time and other parts of the society had hived off and split away to make their own decisions on the matter the bulk of the culture had chosen not to determining instead to surf a line across the everbreaking wave of galactic life continuation partly it was a kind of curiosity that no doubt seemed childish to any sublimed species a feeling that there was still more to discover in base reality even if its laws and rules were all perfectly known and besides what of other galaxies what of other universes did the elders have access to these but none of them had ever seen fit to communicate the truth to the unsublimed or did all such considerations simply cease to matter postsublimation partly it was an expression of the cultures extrovertly concerned morality the sublimed elders become as gods to all intents and purposes seemed to be derelict in the duties which the more naive and less developed societies they left behind ascribed to such entities with certain very limited exceptions the elder species subsequently took almost nothing to do with the rest of life in the galaxy whose physical trappings they invariably left behind tyrants went unchecked hegemonies went unchallenged genocides went unstopped and whole nascent civilisations were snuffed out just because their planet suffered a cometstrike or happened to be too near a supernova even though these events occurred under the metaphorical noses of the sublimed ones the implication was that the very ideas the actual concepts of good of fairness and of justice just ceased to matter once one had gone for sublimation no matter how creditable progressive and unselfish ones behaviour had been as a species presublimation in a curiously puritanical way for society seemingly so hellbent on the ruthless pursuit of pleasure the culture thought this was itself wrong and so decided to attempt to accomplish what the gods it seemed could not be bothered with discovering judging and encouraging or discouraging the behaviour of those to whom its own powers were scarcely less than those of a deity its own elderhood would come eventually it had no doubt but it would be damned if it would let that happen until it had grown tired of doing what it hoped was good for those who wished to await that judgment day without having to live through every other day in between storage was the answer as it was for others for all those other reasons the rate of technological change in the culture at least at the level which directly affected the humans within it was fairly modest for millennia the accepted and normal method of storing a human was to place each in a coffinlike box a little over two metres long just under one across and half a metre deep such units were easy to make and suitably reliable however even such unglamorous staples of culture existence couldnt escape improvement and refinement for ever eventually along with the development of the gelfield suit it became possible to put people into the stasis of longterm storage within a covering that was even more reliable than the old coffinboxes and yet scarcely thicker than a second skin or a layer of clothing the sleeper service which was not called that then had simply been the first ship fully to take advantage of this development when it stored people it usually did so in small tableaux after the manner of famous paintings at first or humorous poses the storage suits allowed their occupants to be posed in any way that would have been natural for a human and it was a simple matter to add a pigmentation layer to the surface which did such a good job of impersonating skin that a human would have to look very closely indeed to spot the difference of course the ship had always asked the permission of the storees in question before it used their sleeping forms in this way and respected the wishes of the few people who preferred not to be stored in a situation where they might be gazed upon as though they were figures in a painting or sculptures back then the gsv had been called the quietly confident and it had been run as ships of that class normally were by not one but three minds what happened next depended on who you believed the official version was that when one of the three minds had decided it wanted to quit the culture the other two minds had argued with it and then made the unusual decision to leave the structure of the gsv to the single dissenting mind rather than as would have been more normal just giving it a smaller ship the perhaps more plausible and certainly more interesting rumour was that there had been a good oldfashioned wingding battle between the minds two against one and the two had lost very much against the odds the two losing minds had been kicked out taking to commandeered gcus like officers given life boats after a mutiny and that was why this version went the whole of the quietly confident which promptly renamed itself the sleeper service had been turned over to the single dissident mind it hadnt been some gentlepeoples agreement it had been a revolution whatever version you chose to believe it was no secret that the culture proper had chosen to dedicate another smaller gsv to the task of following the sleeper service wherever it went presumably to keep an eye on it following its renaming and paying no apparent heed to the craft now tailing it the sleeper services next step was to evacuate everybody else remaining aboard most of the ships had already gone and the rest were asked to leave then the drones aliens and all the human personnel and their pets were deposited on the first orbital it came to the only people left aboard were those in storage after that the ship went in search of others and one other in particular and let it be known throughout the culture through its information network that it was willing to travel anywhere to pick up those who might wish to join it so long as they were in storage and happy to be set amongst one of its tableaux people were reluctant at first this was definitely the sort of behaviour that earned a ship the title eccentric and eccentric ships had been known to do odd even dangerous things still the culture had its share of brave souls and a few took up the crafts strange invitation without apparent ill effect when the first few people who had been stored aboard the gsv were safely returned on the realisation of their revival criteria again without seeming to have suffered for the strangeness of their temporary lodgings the slow trickle of adventurous individuals began to turn into a steady stream of slightly perverse or just romantic ones as the reputation of the sleeper service spread and it released holograms of its more and more ambitious tableaux important historical incidents then small battles and details from greater conflicts so more and more people thought it rather amusing to be stored within this eccentric eccentric where they might be said to be forming part of a work of art even while they slept rather than just plonked in a boring box somewhere underneath their local plate and so taking a ride aboard the sleeper service as a kind of vicariously wandering soul became nothing less than fashionable and the ship slowly filled with undead people in storage suits whom it posed into larger and larger scenes until eventually it was able to tackle whole battlefields and lay them out in the sixteen square kilometres of territory it possessed in each of its general bays amorphia completed its sweeping gaze across the bright silent stillness of the vast killing ground as an avatar it possessed no real thoughts of its own but the mind that was the sleeper service liked to run the creature off a small subroutine that was only a little more intelligent than the average human being while both retaining the option of stepping in full force if it needed to and making the avatar behave in a confused distracted state that the ship believed somehow reflected on the nearly infinitely smaller human scale its own philosophical perplexities so it was that the semihuman subroutine looked out across that great tableau and felt a kind of sadness that it might all have to be dismantled there was an extra perhaps deeper melancholy at the thought that it would no longer be able to play host to the living things aboard the creatures of the sea and the air and the gasgiant atmosphere and the woman its thoughts turned to that woman dajeil gelian who in one sense had been the cause the seed for all of this and the one person it had wanted to find the one soul asleep or awake it had been determined to offer sanctuary to when it had first renounced the cultures normality now that sanctuary was compromised and she too would have to be offloaded with all the rest of its waifs and strays and teeming undead a promise being fulfilled leading to a promise to her being broken as though she had not experienced enough of that in her life still it would make amends and for that reason there were a lot of other promises being made and so far it would seem kept that would have to do movement on the motionless tableau amorphia turned its attention there and saw the black bird gravious flapping away across the field more movement amorphia walked towards it around and over the poised charging cavalry and the fallen soldiers between a pair of convincinglooking hanging fountains of earth where two cannon balls were slamming into the ground and over a small bloodswollen stream to another part of the battlefield where a team of three revival drones were floating above a revivee this was unusual people normally wanted to be woken back in their home and in the presence of friends but over the last couple of decades as the tableaux had become more impressive more people had wished to be brought back to life here in the midst of them amorphia squatted down by the woman who had been lying posed as a dying soldier her tunic punctured by bullet holes and stained red she lay on her back blinking in the sunlight attended by machines the head of the storage suit had been slipped off and lay like a rubbery mask on the grass beside her her face looked pale and just a little blotchy she was an old woman but her depilated head gave her a curious babylike quality of nakedness hello amorphia said taking one of the womans hands in hers and gently detaching that part of the suit too pulling the handcovering off insideout like a tight glove whoa the woman said swallowing her eyes watering sikleyrnajasa croepise ince stahal da mapin stored thirtyone years ago at the age of threehundred and eightysix revival criterion on the acclamation of the next line messiahelect on the planet ischeis she had been a scholar of the planets major religion and had wanted to be present at the elevation of its next saviour an event which had not been anticipated for another two hundred years or so her mouth twisted and she coughed how she began then coughed again just thirtyone standard years amorphia told her the womans eyes widened then she smiled that was quick she said she recovered rapidly for one of her age in a few minutes she was able to be helped to her feet and taking amorphias arm and trailed by the three drones they walked across the battlefield towards the nearest edge of the tableau they stood on the small hill hill that amorphia had stood on a little earlier amorphia was distantly naggingly aware of the gap the womans revival had left in the scene normally she would have been replaced within the day with another storee posed in the same position but there were none left the gap she had left would remain unless the ship plundered another tableau to repair the hole in this one the woman gazed around her for some time then shook her head amorphia guessed what she was thinking it is a terrible sight it said but it was the last great land battle on xlephier prime to have ones final significant battle at such an early technological stage is actually a great achievement for a humanoid species the woman turned to amorphia i know she said i was just thinking how impressive all this was you must be proud ii the explorer ship peace makes plenty a vessel of the stargazer clan part of the fifth fleet of the zetetic elench had been investigating a littleexplored part of the upper leaf swirl on a standard random search pattern it had left tier habitat on n along with the seven other stargazer vessels they had scattered like seeds into the depths of the swirl bidding each other farewell and knowing they might never see each other again one month in and the ship had turned up nothing special just a few bits of uncharted interstellar debris duly logged and that was all there was a hint a probably falsesignal resonation in the skein of spacetime behind them that there might be a craft following them but then it was not unusual for other civilisations to follow ships of the zetetic elench the elench had once been part of the culture proper they had split off fifteen hundred years ago the few habitats and the many rocks ships drones and humans concerned preferring to take a slightly different line from the mainstream culture the culture aimed to stay roughly as it was and change at least a proportion of those lesser civilisations it discovered while acting as an honest broker between the involved the more developed societies who made up the current players in the great galactic civilisational game the elench wanted to alter themselves not others they sought out the undiscovered not to change it but to be changed by it the elencher ideal was that somebody from a more stable society the culture itself was the perfect example could meet the same elencher rock ship drone or human on successive occasions and never encounter the same entity twice they would have changed between meetings just because in the interim they had encountered some other civilisation and incorporated some different technology into their bodies or information into their minds it was a search for the sort of panrelevant truth that the cultures monosophical approach was unlikely ever to throw up it was a vocation a mission a calling the results of this attitude were as various as might be imagined entire elencher fleets had either never come back from expeditions and remained lost or had eventually been found the vessels and their crews completely if willingly subsumed by another civilisation at its most extreme in the old days some craft had been discovered turned entirely into aggressive hegemonising swarm objects selfishly autoreplicating organisms determined to turn every piece of matter they found into copies of themselves there were techniques beyond simple outright destruction which was always an option for dealing with this sort of eventuality which normally resulted in the objects concerned becoming evangelical hegemonising swarm objects rather than aggressive hegemonising swarm objects but if the objects concerned had been particularly singleminded it still meant that people had died to contribute to its greedily ungracious selfregard these days the elench very rarely ran into anything like that sort of trouble but they did still change all the time in a way the elench even more than the culture was an attitude rather than an easily definable grouping of ships or people because parts of elench were constantly being subsumed and assimilated or just disappearing while at the same time other individuals and small groups were joining it both from the culture and from other societies human and otherwise there was anyway a turnover of personnel and secondary ideas that made it one of the most rapidly evolving inplay civilisations somehow though despite it all and perhaps because it was more an attitude a meme than anything else the elench had developed an ability that it had arguably inherited from its parent civilisation the ability to remain roughly the same in the midst of constant change it also had a knack of turning up intriguing things ancient artifacts new civilisations the mysterious remnants of sublimed species unguessably old depositories of antique knowledge not all of which were of ultimate interest to the elench itself but many of which might excite the curiosity further the purposes and benefit the informational or monetary funds of others especially if they could get to them before anybody else such opportunities arose but rarely but they had occurred sufficiently often in the past for certain societies of an opportunistic bent to consider it worth the expense or the bother of dedicating a ship to follow an elencher craft for a while at least and so the peace makes plenty had not been unduly alarmed by the discovery that it might be being tailed two months in and still nothing exciting just gas clouds dust clouds brown dwarfs and a couple of lifeless star systems all well enough charted from afar and displaying no sign of ever having been touched by anything intelligent even the hint of the following ship had disappeared if it ever had been real the vessel concerned had probably decided the peace makes plenty was not going to strike lucky this trip nevertheless everything the elencher ship came within range of was scanned passive sensors filtered the natural spectrum for signs of meaning beams and pulses were sent out into the vacuum and across the skein of spacetime searching and probing while the ship consumed whatever echoes came back analysing considering evaluating seventyeight days after leaving tier approaching a red giant star named esperi from a direction which according to its records nobody had ever taken before the peace makes plenty had discovered an artifact fourteen light months distant from the sun itself the artifact was a little over fifty kilometres in diameter it was blackbody an ambient anomaly indistinguishable from a distance from any given volume of almost empty interstellar space the peace makes plenty only noticed it at all because it occluded part of a distant galaxy and the elencher ship knowing that bits of galaxies did not just wink off and back on again of their own accord had turned to investigate the artifact appeared to be either almost completely massless or perhaps some sort of projection it seemed to make no impression on the skein the fabric of spacetime which any accumulation of matter effectively dents with its mass like a boulder lying on a trampoline the artifactprojection gave the impression that it was floating on the skein making no impression on it whatsoever this was unusual this was certainly worth investigating even more intriguingly there was also a possible anomaly in the lower energy grid which underlay the fabric of real space there was a region directly underneath the threedimensional form of the artifact that intermittently seemed to lack the otherwise universally chaotic nature of the grid there was a vaguestofvague hint of order there almost as if the artifact was casting some sort of bizarre indeed impossible shadow even more curious the peace makes plenty hove to sitting in front of the artifact in as much as it could be said to have a front and trying both to analyse it and communicate with it nothing the blackbody sphere appeared to be massless and inviolable almost as though it was a blister on the skein itself as though the signals the ship was sending towards it could never connect with a thing there because all they did was slide flickering over that blister almost as though it wasnt there and pass on undisturbed into space beyond as though trying to pick upa stone that appeared to be resting on the surface of a trampoline one discovered that the trampoline surface itself was bulged up to cover the stone the ship decided to attempt to contact the artifact in a more direct manner it would send a droneprobe underneath the object in hyperspace below the surface of spacetime effectively making a tear a rent in the fabric of the skein the sort of opening it would normally create to fashion a way into hs through which it could travel the droneprobe would attempt as it were to surface inside the artifact if there was nothing there but a projection it would find out if there was something there it would presumably either be prevented from entering it or accepted within the ship readied its emissary the situation was so unusual the peace makes plenty even considered breaking with elench precedent by informing tier habitat or one of its peers what was going on the nearest other stargazer craft was a months travel away but might be able to help if the peace makes plenty got itself into trouble in the end however it stuck with tradition and kept quiet there was a kind of stealthy pragmatism in this an encounter of the sort the ship was embarking upon might only be successful if the elencher craft could fairly claim to be acting on its own without having made what might to a suspicious contactee look like a request for reinforcements plus there was simple pride involved an elencher ship would not be an elencher ship if it started acting like part of a committee why it might as well then be a culture ship the droneprobe was dispatched with the peace makes plenty keeping in close contact the instant the probe passed within the horizon of the artifact it the records the drone sisela ytheleus had access to ended there something obviously had happened the next thing it personally knew the peace makes plenty had been under attack the assault had been almost unbelievably swift and ferocious the droneprobe must have been taken over almost instantaneously the ships subsystems surrendered milliseconds later and the integrity of the ships mind shattered within at a guess less than a second after the droneprobe had infringed the space beneath the artifact a few more seconds later and sisela ytheleus itself had been involved in a last desperate attempt to get word of the ships plight to the outside galaxy while the vessels usurped systems did their damnedest to prevent it by destroying it if necessary the longagreed carefully workedout ruse using itself and its twin and the preprogrammed independent displacer unit had worked though only just and even so with considerable damage to the drone that had been sisela ytheleus and was now sisela ytheleus with a kind of twisted remnant of sisela ytheleus lodged within it the drone had carried out the equivalent of pressing an ear to the wall of the core with its twins mind in it carefully accessing a meaningfree abstract of the activity inside the closedoff core to find out what was happening in there it was like listening to a furious argument going on in an adjoining room a chilling frightening sound the sort of bawling match that made you expect the sound of screams and things breaking any moment its original self had probably died in the process of escape instead of its own body it now inhabited that of its twin whose violated defected mindstate now raged helplessly within the core labelled the drone still tumbling through interstellar space at two hundred and eighty kilometres a second felt a kind of revulsion at the very idea of having a treacherous perverted version of its twin locked inside its own mind its first reaction was to expunge it it thought about just dumping the core into the vacuum and wasting it with its laser the one weapon which still seemed to be working at close to normal capacity or it could just shut off power to the core letting whatever was in it die for want of energy and yet it mustnt like the two higher mind components the ravaged version of its twins mindstate might contain clues to the nature of the artifacts own mindtype it the ai core and the photonic nucleus all had to be kept as evidence retained perhaps as samples from which a kind of antidote to the artifacts poisonous infectivity might be drawn there was even a chance that something of its twins true personality might be retained in the rapacious mindstate the two upper minds and the core contained equally there was a possibility that the ships mind had lost control but not integrity perhaps like a small garrison quitting the undefendable curtain wall of a great fortress to take refuge in an allbutinvulnerable central keep the mind had been forced to dissociate itself from all its subsystems and given up command to the invader but succeeded in retaining its own personality in a mind core as invulnerable to infiltration as the electronic core within the drones mind where what was left of its twin now seethed was proof against escape elencher minds had been in such dire situations before and survived certainly such a core could be destroyed they could not have their power turned off as the drones core could mind cores had their own internal energy sources but even the most brutal aggressor would far rather lay siege to that keepcore in the knowledge that the information contained within must surely fall to it eventually than just destroy it there was always hope the drone told itself it must not give up hope according to the specifications it had the displacer which had catapulted it out of the illfated ship had a range with something the volume of sisela ytheleus of nearly a light second surely that was far enough to put it beyond range of detection certainly the peace makes plentys sensors wouldnt have had a hope of spotting something so small so far away it just had to hope that neither could the artifact excession that was what the culture called such things it had become a pejorative term and so the elench didnt use it normally except sometimes informally amongst themselves excession something excessive excessively aggressive excessively powerful excessively expansionist whatever such things turned up or were created now and again encountering an example was one of the risks you ran when you went awandering so now it knew what had happened to it and what the core contained the question was what was to be done it had to get word to outside that was the task it had been entrusted with by the ship that was what its whole lifemission had become the instant the ship came under such intensive attack but how its tiny warp unit had been destroyed its bomcom unit likewise its hs laser too it had nothing that worked at translight speeds no way of unsticking itself or even a signal from the glutinous slowness that trapped anything unable to step outside the skein of spacetime the drone felt as if it was some quick graceful flying insect knocked down to a stagnant pond and trapped there by surface tension all grace abandoned in its bedraggled doomed struggle with a strange cloyingly foreign medium it considered again the subcore where its selfrepair mechanisms waited but not its own repair systems those of its turncoat twin it was beyond belief that those too had not been subverted by the invader worse than useless a temptation because there was a vanishingly small chance that in all the excitement they had not been taken over temptation but no it couldnt risk it it would be folly it would have to make its own selfrepair units it was possible but it would take forever a month for a human a month was not that long for a drone even one thinking at the shamefully slow speed of light on the skein it was like a sequence of life sentences a month was not a long time to wait drones were very good at waiting and had a whole suite of techniques to pass the time pleasantly or just sidestep it but it was an abominably long time to have to concentrate on anything to have to work at a single task even at the end of that month it would just be the start at the very least there would be a lot of fine tuning to be done the selfrepair mechanisms would need direction amendment tinkering with some would doubtless dismantle where they were supposed to build others would duplicate what they were meant to scour it would be like releasing millions of potential cancer cells into an already damaged animal body and trying to keep track of each one it could quite easily kill itself by mistake or accidentally breach the containment around the core of its corrupted twin or the original selfrepair mechanisms even if all went well the whole process could take years despair it set the initial routines under way all the same what else could it do and thought on it had a few million particles of antimatter stored it had some maniplefield capability left somewhere between finger and armstrength but downscalable to the point of being able to work at the micrometer scale and capable of slicing molecular bonds it would need both capabilities when it came to building the prototype selfrepairer constructs it possessed two hundred and forty onemillimetrelong nanomissiles also am tipped it could still put up a small mirror field about it and it had its laser which was not far off maximum potential plus it still had the thimbleful of mush that had been the finalresort backup biochemical brain which might no longer be able to support thought but could still inspire it well it was one way to use the nasty gooey mess sisela ytheleus started to fashion a shielded reaction chamber and began working out both how best to bring the antimatter and the cellular gunge together to provide itself with the most reaction mass and maximum thrust and how to direct the resulting exhaust plume so as to minimise the chances of attracting attention accelerating into the stars using a wasted brain it had its amusing side it supposed it set those routines in motion too and with the equivalent of a long sigh and the taking off of a jacket and the rolling up of sleeves returned its attention to the selfrepairerbuilding problem at that instant a skein wave passed around and through it a sharp purposeful ripple in spacetime it stopped thinking for a nanosecond a few things produced such waves several were natural collapsing stellar cores for example but this wave was compressed tightly folded not the massive swelllong surge created when a star contracted into a black hole this wave was not natural it had been made it was a signal or it was part of a sense the drone sisela ytheleus was helplessly aware of its body the few kilos of mass it represented resonating producing an echoing signal that would transmit back along the radius of that expanding circular disturbance in the skein to whatever instrument had produced the pulse in the first place it felt not despair it felt sick it waited the reaction was not long in coming a delicate fanning probing cluster of maser filaments rods of energy seeming to converge almost at infinity some distance off to one side from where it had guessed the artifact was three hundred thousand or so kilometres away the drone tried to shield itself from the signals but they overcame it it started to shut down certain systems which might conceivably be corrupted by an attack through the maser signal itself though the characteristics of the beam had not looked particularly sophisticated then suddenly the beam shut off the drone looked around nothing to be seen but even as it scanned the cold empty depths of the space around it it felt the surface of spacetime itself tremble again all around it ever so slightly something was coming the distant vibration increased slowly the insect trapped in the surface tension of the pond would have gone still now while the water quivered and whatever was advancing upon it skating across the waters surface or angling up from underneath approached its helpless prey iii the car zipped along slung under one of the monorails that ran amongst the superconducting coils beneath the ceiling of the habitat genarhofoen looked down through the angled windows of the car at the clouded framescape below godshole habitat it was much too small to be called an orbital according to the cultures definitive nomenclature plus it was enclosed was at nearly a thousand years old one of the affronts older outposts in a region of space most civilisations had long since agreed to call the fernblade the small world was in the shape of a hollow ring a tube ten kilometres in diameter and two thousand two hundred long which had been joined into a circle the superconducting coils and em wave guides formed the inner rim of the enormous wheel the tiny rapidly spinning black hole which provided the structures power sat where the wheels hub would have been the circularsectioned living space was like a highly pressurised tyre bulging from the inner rim and where its tread would have been hung the gantries and docks where the ships of the affront and a dozen other species came and went the whole lot was in a slow distant orbit about an otherwise satelliteless brown dwarf mass just too small to be a proper star but which had long had the honour of being in exactly the right place to further the continuing expansion and consolidation of the affront sphere of influence the monorail car rushed towards a huge wall spread entirely across the view ahead the rails disappeared into a small circular door which opened like a sphincter as the car approached then closed again behind it it was dim in the car for a while as it traversed a short tunnel then another door ahead of it dilated and it shot out into a huge open mistfilled space where the view just disappeared amongst clouds and haze the interior of godshole habitat was sectioned off into about forty individually isolable compartments most of them crisscrossed by a webwork of frames girders and tubular members partly to provide additional strength for the structure but partly because these created a multitude of places for the affront to anchor the nest spaces that were the basic cellular buildingblock of their architecture there were more open compartments every few sections along the habitat filled with little more than layers of cloud a few floating nest space bundles and a selection of flora and fauna these were the sections which more closely mirrored conditions on the sort of mainly methaneatmosphered planets and moons the affront preferred and it was in these the affront indulged their greatest passion by going hunting it was one of these immense game reserves that the car was now crossing genarhofoen looked downwards again but he couldnt see a hunt in progress as much as a fifth of the whole habitat was devoted to hunting space and even that represented a huge concession to practicality by the affront theyd probably have preferred the proportions to be about halfandhalf hunting space and everything else and even then have thought they were being highly responsible and selfsacrificing genarhofoen found himself wondering again about the tradeoff between skillhoning and distraction that took place in the development of any species likely to end up as one of those in play in the great galactic civilisation game the cultures standard assessment held that the affront spent far too much time hunting and not nearly enough time getting on with the business of being a responsible spacefaring species though of course the culture was sophisticated enough to know that this was just its admittedly subjective way of looking at things and besides the more time the affront spent dallying in their hunting parks and regaling each other with hunting tales in their carousing halls the less they had for rampaging across their bit of the galaxy being horrible to people but if the affront didnt love hunting as much as they did would they still be the affront hunting especially the highly cooperative form of hunting in three dimensions which the affront had evolved required and encouraged intelligence and it was generally though not exclusively intelligence that took a species into space the required mix of common sense inventiveness compassion and aggression required was different for each perhaps if you tried to make the affront just a little less enraptured by hunting you would only be able to do so by making them much less intelligent and inquisitive it was like play it was fun at the time when you were a child but it was also training for when you became an adult fun was serious still no sign of a hunt in progress or even of any herds of prey animals just a few filmy mats and hanging verticals of floating plant life doubtless some of the smaller animals which a few species of the preycreatures themselves predated would be hanging munching away on the membranes and gas sacs of the flora but they were invisible from this distance with the haze preventing closer inspection genarhofoen sat back there was no seat to sit back on because the monorail car wasnt built for humans but the gelfield suit was imitating the effects of a seat he wore his usual gilet and holster at his feet was his gelfield holdall he looked at it then prodded it with a foot it didnt look much to be taking on a round trip of six thousand light years bastards the module said inside his head what he asked it they seem to enjoy leaving everything to the last moment the module said sounding annoyed you know we only just finished negotiating for the hire of the ships i mean youre due to leave in about ten minutes how late can these maniacs leave things ships plural he asked ships plural the module said they insist we hire three of their ridiculous tubs any one of which could easily accommodate me i might add thats another point at issue but three can you believe thats practically a fleet by their standards must need the money genarhofoen i know you think it amusing to be the cause of the transfer of funds to the affront but might i point out to you that where it is not to all intents and purposes irrelevant money is power money is influence money is effect money is effect genarhofoen mused that one of your own scopellafranqui the point is that every time we donate the affront extra means of exchange we effectively become part of their expansionist drive it is not moral shit we gave them orbitalbuilding technology how does that compare with a few gambling debts that was different we only gave them that so theyd stop taking over so many planets and because they didnt trust the orbitals we made for them and im not talking about your gambling debts however outrageous or your bizarre habit of biddingup the price of bribes im talking about the cost of hiring three affronter nova class battlecruisers and their crews for two months genarhofoen almost laughed out loud sc isnt putting that on your tab is it of course not i was thinking of the wider picture what the fuck am i supposed to do he protested this is the fastest way of getting me where sc wants me to be not my fault you could have said no could have and youd have spent the next year or so biting my ear about not doing my duty to the culture when i was asked your only motive im sure scopellafranqui said sniffily as the monorail car slowed the module went offline with an ostentatious click prick genarhofoen thought unheard the monorail car passed through another couple of habitat section walls exiting into a crowdedlooking industrial section where the keel skeletons of newly begun affronter ships rose out of the haze like oddly inappropriate collections of spines and ribs ornate elaborations within the greater framework of buttresses and columns supporting the habitat itself the monorail car continued to slow until it drew to a stop within a webtube attached to one of the structural members the car started to drop almost in freefall the car vibrated in fact it was rattling genarhofoen had grown up on a culture orbital where only sporting vehicles and things you built yourself for a laugh ever vibrated normal transport systems rarely ever even made a noise unless it was to ask which floor you wanted or whether youd like the onboard scent changed the monorail car flashed through a floor and into another gigantic hangar space where the towering shapes of halffinished craft rose like barbed pinnacles out of the mistshrouded framework of slender girders below the bladed hulls of the ships blurred past to one side weehee said the gelfield suit which thought affronter freefall was just a total hoot glad youre amused genarhofoen thought i hope you realise that if this thing crashes now even i wont be able to stop you breaking most of your major bones the suit informed him if you cant say something helpful shut the fuck up he told it another floor rushed up to meet the car it plummeted through to a vast misty hall where almostfinished affronter ships rose like jagged skyscrapers the car came juddering and screeching to a halt near the floor of the huge space the suit clamped around him in support but genarhofoen could feel his insides doing uncomfortable things under the effects of the additional apparent gravity then the car cycled through a pair of airlocks and rumbled down a dark tunnel it came out on to the edge of the underside of the habitat where a succession of docks shaped like giant ribcages disappeared away along the lazy curve of the little world there was a lot of glare but a few bright stars shone in the darkness about half the docks were occupied some with affronter ships some with craft from a handful of other species dwarfing all the others were three huge dark craft each of which looked vaguely as though it had been modelled by taking a freefall aerial bomb from one age and welding onto it a profusion of broad swords scimitars and daggers from an even earlier time and then magnifying the result until each was a couple of kilometres in length they hung cradled in docks a few kilometres off the car swung round and headed towards them the good ships sacslicer ii frightspear and kiss the blade the suit announced as the car slowed again and the bulbous black bulks of the craft blotted out the stars charmed im sure thought genarhofoen picking up his holdall he studied the hulls of the three warships looking for the signs of damage that would indicate the craft were veterans the signs were there a delicate tracery of curved lines light grey on dark grey and black spread out across the spines blades and curtain hull of the middle ship indicated a probably glancing blow from a plasma blast which even genarhofoen who found weapons boring could recognise blurred grey roundels like concentric bruises on that middle ship and the nearest vessel were the marks of another weapon system and sharp straight lines etched across the various surfaces of the third craft looked like the effects of yet another of course the affronts ships were as selfrepairing as any other reasonably advanced civilisations and the marks that had been left on the vessels were just that they would be no thicker than a coat of paint and have negligible effect on the ships operational capability however the affront thought that it was only right that their ships should like themselves bear the scars of honour that battle brings and so allowed their warships selfrepair mechanisms to stop just short of perfection the better to display the provenance of their war fleets glorious reputations the car stopped directly underneath the middle warcraft in the midst of a forest of giant pipes and tubes which disappeared into the belly of the ship crunches thumps and hisses from outside the car announced all was being made safe a wisp of vapour burst from a seal and the cars door swung out and up there was a corridor beyond an honour guard of affronters jerked to attention not for him of course but for fivetide and the affronter at his side dressed in the uniform of a navy commander both of them were half floating half walking along towards him paddles rowing and dangling limbs pushing and heres our guest fivetide shouted genarhofoen allow me to present commander kindrummer vi of both the bladescorner tribe and the battlecruiser kiss the blade so human ready for our little jaunt yup he said and stepped out into the corridor iv ulver seich barely twentytwo famed scholastic overachiever since the age of three voted most luscious student by her last five university years and breaker of more hearts on phage rock than anybody since her legendary greatgreatgreat grandmother had been summarily dragged away from her graduation ball by the drone churt lyne churt she said balling her fists in her long black gloves and nodding her head forward her high heels clicked along the inlaid wood of the vestibule floor how dare you that was a deeply lovely young man i was dancing with he was utterly utterly gorgeous how could you just drag me away like that the drone hurrying at her back dived round in front of her and opened the ancient manually operated double doors leading from the ballroom vestibule its suitcasesized body rustling against the bustle of her gown as it did so im sorry beyond words ulver it told her now please lets not delay mind my bustle she said sorry he was gorgeous ulver seich said vehemently as she strode down a stoneflagged hallway lined with paintings and urn plants following the floating drone as it headed for the traveltube doors ill take your word for it it said and he liked my legs she said looking down at the slashed front of the gown her long exposed legs were sheathed in sheer blackness violet shoes matched her deepcut gown its short train hurried after her in quick sinuous flicks theyre beautiful legs the drone agreed signalling ahead to the traveltube controls to hurry things up damn right they are she said she shook her head he was gorgeous im sure she stopped abruptly im going back she turned on her heel just a little unsteadily what yelped churt lyne the drone darted round in front of her she almost bumped into it ulver the machine said sounding angry its aura field flashed white really get out the way he was gorgeous hes mine he deserves me come on shift it wouldnt get out of the way she balled her fists again and beat at its snout stamping her feet she hiccuped ulver ulver the drone said gently taking her hands in its fields she stuck her head forward and frowned as hard as she could at the machines front sensory band ulver it said again please please listen this is what is it anyway she cried i told you something you have to see a signal well why cant you show it to me here she looked round the hallway at the softly lit portraits and the variegated fronds creepers and parasols of the urn plants there isnt even anybody else around because it just doesnt work that way churt lyne said sounding exasperated ulver please this is important you still want to join contact she sighed i suppose so she said rolling her eyes join contact and go exploring well this is your invitation it let go of her hands she stuck her head forward at it again her hair was an artful tangle of masked black curls studded with tiny heliumfilled globes of gold platinum and emerald it brushed against the drones snout like a particularly decorative thundercloud will it let me go exploring on that young man she asked trying to keep her face straight ulver if you will just do as i ask there is every chance contact will happily provide you with entire ships full of gorgeous young men now please turn round she snorted derisively and went on tiptoes to look wobblingly over the machines casing in the direction of the ballroom she could still hear the music of the dance shed left yeah but it was that one i was interested in the drone took her hands again in fields coloured yellow green with calm friendliness bringing her down off her toes young lady it said i shall never say anything more truthful to you than these two things one there will be plenty more gorgeous young men in your life two you will never have a better chance of getting into contact even special circumstances and with them owing you a favour or two do you understand this is your big chance girl dont you girl me she told it sniffily the drone churt lyne had been a family friend for nearly a millennium and parts of its personality were supposed to date back to when theyd been programs in a housesystems computer nine thousand years earlier it wasnt in the habit of pulling age on her like this and reminding her that she was a mere dayfly to its creakingly venerable antiquity but it wasnt above doing so when it thought the situation demanded it either she closed one eye and looked closely at the machine did you say special circumstances just there yes she drew back hmm she said her eyes narrowing behind her the traveltube chimed and the door rolled open she turned and started walking towards it well come on then she said over her shoulder phage rock had been wandering the galaxy for nearly nine thousand years that made it one of the cultures oldest elements it had started out as a threekilometrelong asteroid in a solar system which was one of the first explored by a species that would later form part of the culture it had been mined for metals minerals and precious stones then its great internal voids had been sealed against the vacuum and flooded with air it had been spun to provide artificial gravity and it had become a habitat orbiting its parent sun later when the technology made it possible and the political conditions prevailing at the time made it advisable to quit that system it had been fitted with fusionpowered steam rockets and ion engines to help propel it into interstellar space again due to those political conditions it armed itself with uprated signal lasers and a number of at least partially targetable mass launchers which doubled as rail guns some years later scarred but intact and finally accepted as personally sentient by its human inhabitants it had been one of the first spacebased entities to declare for the new pancivilisational panspecies grouping which was calling itself the culture over the years decades centuries and millennia that had followed phage had journeyed through the galaxy wandering from system to system concentrating on trading and manufacturing at first and then on a gradually more cultural educatory role as the advances in technology the culture was cultivating began to distribute the societys productive capacity so evenly throughout its fabric that the ability to manufacture almost anything developed almost everywhere and trade became relatively rare and phage rock by now recognised as one of a distinct category of culture artifacts which were neither ships nor worlds but something in between had grown accruing new bits of systemic or interstellar debris about it as its needs required and its population increased securing the chunks of metal rock ice and compacted dust to its still gnarled outer surface in a slow process of acquisition consumption and evolution so that within just a millennium of its transition from mine to habitat its earlier original self wouldnt have recognised it it was thirty kilometres long by then not three and only the front half of that initial body still peeped out from the prow of the knobbly collection of equipmentscattered mountains and expanded balloonlike hangar and accommodation rotundae that now formed its roughly conical body phage rocks rate of accretion had slowed after that and it was now just over seventy kilometres long and home to one hundred and fifty million people it looked like a collection of craggy rocks smooth stones and still smoother shells brought from a beach and cemented into a rough cairn all dotted with what looked like a museum collection of culture equipment through the ages launch pads radar pits aerial frames sensory arrays telescope dishes railgun pylons craterlike rocket nozzles clamshell hangar doors iris apertures and a bewildering variety of domes large and small intact and partdismantled or just ruined as its size and its population had grown so had the speeds phage rock was capable of it had been successively fitted with evermore efficient and powerful drives and engines until eventually it was able to maintain a perfectly respectable velocity either warping along the fabric of spacetime or creating its own inducedsingularity pathway through hyperspace beneath or above it ulver seichs had been one of the rocks founding families she could trace her ancestry back through fiftyfour generations on phage itself and numbered amongst her ancestors at least two forebears who were inevitably mentioned in even onevolume histories of the culture as well as being descended from as the fashions of the intervening times had ordained people who had resembled birds fish dirigible balloons snakes small clouds of cohesive smoke and animated bushes the tenor of the time had generally turned against such outlandishness and people had mostly returned to looking more like people over the last millennium albeit assuredly pretty goodlooking people but still some part of ones appearance was initially at least left to luck and the random nature of genetic inheritance and it was a matter of some pride to ulver that she had never had any form of physical alteration carried out well apart from the neural lace of course but that didnt count it would have been a brave or deranged human or machine who told ulver seich to her face that the giveortakeabit humanbasic form was not almost unimprovably graceful and alluring especially in its female state and even more especially when it was called ulver seich she looked round the room the drone had brought her to it was semicircular and moderately big shaped like an auditorium or a shallowly sloped lecture hall but most of the steps or seats seemed to be filled with complicatedlooking desks and pieces of equipment a huge screen filled the far wall theyd entered the room through a long tunnel which shed never seen before and which was blocked by a series of thick mirrorcoated doors which had rolled silently back into recesses as theyd approached and revolved back into place behind them once theyd passed ulver had admired her reflection in every one of them and drawn herself up even straighter in her spectacular violet gown the lights had come on in the semicircular room as the last door had rolled back into place the place was bright but dusty the drone whooshed off to one side and hovered over one of the desks ulver stood looking round the space wondering she sneezed bless you thank you what is this place churt she asked emergency centre command space the drone told her as the desk beneath it lit up in places and various panes and panels of light leapt up to waver in the air above its surface ulver seich wandered over to look at the pretty displays didnt even know this place existed she said drawing one blackgloved finger along the desks surface the displays altered and the desk made a chirping noise churt lyne slapped her hand away going tssk while its aura field flashed white she glowered at the machine inspected the grey rim of dust on her finger tip and smeared it on the casing of the drone normally churt lyne would have slicked that part of its body with a field and the dust would just have fallen off having literally nothing to cling to but this time it ignored her and just kept on hovering over the desk and its rapidly changing displays obviously controlling both it and them ulver crossed her blackgloved arms in annoyance the sliding panels of lights hanging in the air changed and rotated figures and letters slid across their surfaces then they all disappeared right the drone said a maniple field coloured formal blue extended from the machines casing and dragged a small sculpted metal seat over placing it behind her and then shoving it quickly forward she had no choice but to plonk down into it ow she said pointedly she adjusted her bustle and glared at the drone but it still wasnt paying attention here we go it said what looked like a pane of brown smoked glass suddenly leapt into existence above the desk she studied it attempting to see her reflection ready the drone asked her mmhmm she said ulver child the drone said in a voice she knew it had spent centuries investing with gravitas it swivelled through the air until it was directly in front of her she rolled her eyes yes what ulver i know youre a little im drunk drone i know she told it but i havent lost my wits well good but i need to know youre fit to make this decision what youre about to see might change your life she sighed and put her gloved elbow on the surface of the desk resting her chin on her hand ive had a few young fellows tell me that before she drawled it always turns out to be a disappointment or a joke of the grossest nature this is neither but you must understand that just seeing what im about to show you might give special circumstances an interest in you that will not pass even if you decide you dont want to join contact or even if you do but youre still refused it is possible they might watch you for the rest of your life just because of what youre about to see im sorry to sound so melodramatic but i dont want you to enter into anything you dont understand the full implications of me neither she yawned can we get on with this youre sure youve understood what ive said hell yes she exclaimed waving her arms around just get on with it oh just one other thing what she yelled will you travel to a distant location in the guise of somebody else and probably help kidnap somebody another culture citizen will i what she said wrinkling her nose and snorting with laughter and disbelief sounds like a no to me the drone said didnt think you would had to ask though that means i have no choice but to show you this it sounded relieved she put both her blackgloved arms on the desk rested her chin on them and looked as soberly as she could at the drone churt she said what is going on here youll see it told her getting out of the way of the screen you ready if i get any more ready ill be asleep

document including its existence override postdocument warning readout aborted i wish youd stop doing that the drone muttered sorry she said ulver seich shook her head slowly at the text hanging in the air in front of her and the drone churt lyne she took a deep breath suddenly she felt quite entirely sober is this as important as i think it is almost certainly much more so oh she said fuck indeed the drone replied any other questions so far she looked at the last word of the gcus main signal gulp gulp well she could relate to that all right questions ulver seich said staring at the holo screen and blowing her cheeks out she turned to the drone her violet ball gown rustling lots first what are we really no hold on just take me through the signal never mind all the translations or whatever whats it actually saying the general contact unit issues an excession notice through its home general systems vehicle the drone told her but its prevented from being broadcast by another gsv which the first one obviously contacted before doing anything the gcu tells us that its sensors clipped this artifact which then hailed the gcu using an old elench greeting and an even older galactic common language then the gcu spends a great deal of the signal detailing how clever it was pretending that its slower not as manoeuvrable and less well equipped in the sensor department than actually it is it describes the object and a few surrounding bits and pieces of debris which imply there was some sort of smallscale military action there fiftythree days earlier then it assures its well and unviolated but its ready to blow itself up or let somebody else blow it up if its integrity is threatened not a step a gcu takes lightly however entirely the most important aspect of the signal is that the object it has discovered is linked to the energy grid in both hyperspatial directions that alone puts it well outside all known parameters and precedents we have no previous experience whatsoever with something like this its unique beyond our ken im not surprised the gcu is scared okay okay thats kind of what i thought shit she belched delicately excuse me of course now like i was going to say what are we really dealing with here an excession or something else well if you take the definition of an excession as anything external to the culture that we should be worried about this is an excession all right on the other hand if you compare it to the average or even an exceptional hegemonising swarm its small localised noninvasive unaggressive unshielded immobile and almost chatty using galin ii to communicate the drone paused the crucial characteristic then remains the fact that the things linked to the energy grid both up and down thats interesting to put it mildly because as far as we know nobody knows how to do that well nobody apart from the elder civilisations probably they wont say and we cant tell so this thing can do something the culture cant looks like it and i take it the culture would like to be able to do what it can do oh yes yes very much so or even if it couldnt partake of the technology at least it would like to use the implied opportunity the excession may represent to do what wehhll churt lyne said drawing the word out while its aurafield coloured with embarrassment and its body wobbled in the air technically maybe the ability to travel easily to other universes the machine paused again looking at the human and waiting for her sarcastic reply when she didnt say anything it continued it should be possible to step outside the timestrand of our universe as easily as a ship steps outside the spacetime fabric it might then become feasible to travel through superior hyperspace upwards to universes older than ours or through inferior hyperspace downwards to universes younger than our own time travel no but affording the opportunity to become time proof age proof in theory one might become able to step down consecutively through earlier universes well forever forever real forever as far as we understand it you could choose the size and therefore age of the universe you wanted to remain within andor visit as many as you wanted you could for example head on up through older universes and attempt to access technologies perhaps beyond even this one but just as interesting is the point that because you wouldnt be tied to one universe one time stream you need be involved in no heat death when the time came in your original universe or no evaporation or no big crunch depending its like being on an escalator at the moment confined to this universe were stuck to this stair this level the possibility this artifact appears to offer is that of being able to step from one stair to another so that before your stair on the escalator comes to the end of its travel heatdeath big crunch whatever you just step off one level down to another you could in effect live for ever well unless its discovered that cosmic fireball engines themselves have a lifecycle as i understand it the metamath on that implies but does not guarantee perpetuity seich looked at the drone for a while her brows furrowed havent we ever found anything like this before not really there are ambiguous reports of vaguely similar entities turning up in the past though they tend to disappear before anybody can fully investigate but as far as we know nobody has ever found anything quite like this before the human was silent for a while then she said if you could access any universe and go back to one universe at a very early presentience stage with an already highly developed civilisation you could take over the whole thing the drone confirmed an entire universe would be yours alone in fact go back far enough that is to a small enough early enough justpostsingularity universe and you could conceivably customise it mould it shape it influence its primary characteristics admittedly that sort of control may well remain in the realm of the fantastic but it might be possible ulver seich drew a deep breath and looking at the floor nodded slowly and of course she said if this thing is what it appears to be it could be an exit as well as an entrance entirely so it is almost certainly both at once as you imply never mind us getting into it we dont know what might come out of it ulver seich nodded slowly holy shit she said lets call up the comments churt lyne suggested can we miss out the preparatory junk at the start allow me there read previous comments and skip all the detailology crap too just who said what as you wish comments section x wisdom like silence gsv continent class as agreed within the informal sc extraordinary events core group crisis preparatory foresight subcommittee occasional we in multiple mode have assumed the management of this situation as of n the following constitute our introductory remarks might we first beg to record that it goes without saying that we are not only extremely flattered but also deeply humbled to be placed in a position of such importance on the occasion of this grave profound and indeed one might even say momentous circumstance pofaced bastard are all continents this up themselves want me to ask somebody yeah im sure wed get a straight answer to that one just so hmm meanwhile the bullshit rolls on clearly this is a matter of the utmost consequence it follows that the manner in which it is presented beyond ourselves must be considered with regard to all the possible ramifications and repercussions such a pandevelopmentally crucial subject might reasonably be expected to entail sit on it in other words seich said tartly what exactly is a continent classs multiple mode anyway threemind grouping usually thats why its saying everything in triplicate the excession under consideration is without precedent but it is also it would appear static and presently and again apparently to all intents and purposes inactive thus caution born of import situational stability and imprecedence would appear to be the order of the moment we have as a temporary measure and with the approval of those comprising the above group and subcommittee who are within reasonable consultative range deemed the matter to be secrecyrated such that all discussions and communications regarding it are carried out according to m standard under the terms of the temporary emergencies allowed subterfuges postdebacle steering committee report following the azadian matter the maximum length of the m secrecy interval has been set at days standard from n with a mean envisaged duration of days and a fullsubcommittee review period of hours the nearest star to this excession is called esperi under standard adopted nomenclature however in accordance with m procedure we propose the codeterm taussig from the primary random eventnaming list be used regarding this matter henceforth this concludes our introductory remarks the following comments will be arranged in sortedrelevance order actual receivetimes and contextschedules are available in the usual appendices we hereby open the discussion on the taussig matter oo x anticipation of a new lovers arrival the gsv plate class right first this should not be kept secret even for a limited time i object in the strongest possible terms to the fact that the instant we stumble over possibly the most important thing anybodys ever found anywhere ever the first thing sc does is snap into fullscale raving paranoia mode and apply this m totalsecrecyorwellpullyourplugsoutbaby shit ive given my word and im not going to leak this but for the record i believe we should be telling everybody lets face it well probably have to well before this unrealistic timelimit of days anyway that said if we are going to keep this to ourselves for the time being might i anticipate scs alltoopredictable reaction and draw everyones attention to a study by the added value text and details attached which basically says if you surround something like this with a megafleet and it isnt quite omnipotent just staggeringly powerful and fully invasive youre basically giving it an immense readymade warfleet to play with if it is hostile just a thought oo x tactical grace gcu escarpment class i agree absolutely with the above and endorse the added value study let us not thoughtlessly get cannoned up on this one oo x woetra orbital hub schiparseoevyli system solo some sadness reigns we may approach the end of our knowing naïvety draw round the fire growing dim draws too drawing in its breath for one fine final burst of flame potentially an end of innocence we face this glancing backwards within the horizon of our mutual import an end and start to meaning finally beginning ancients knowing so little would have half expected partly welcomed what we all fear this might be we knowing all too much would rather deny its untold implications ephemera they were half happy with and wholly used to the possibility of an end by their knowing immortal we tremble before the same my friends if we have ever worshipped anything it has been the great god chaos what else shields intelligence from the awful implications of utter omniscience might we be looking at our gods deiclast oo x steely glint gcv plains class remarkable one hears nothing for years then suddenly well anyway pace the added value study mentioned above i propose the immediate and complete remilitarisation of all viable units to within say sixtyfour days rushin distance not so much because we might need to fight the taussig matter itself but because this event will undoubtedly not stay secret for very long and will with equal certitude attract an entire cast of terminological civiliseds of the distinctly undesirable persuasion serious upcannoning on our part for all its intrinsic vulgarity and firstprinciple undesirability may be the only way to prevent scalar intercivilisation conflicts which at worst might overshadow the entail of the matter itself oo x serious callers only lsv tundra class here in the bare dark face of night a calm unhurried eye draws sight we see in what we think we fear the cloudings

and call the matter after esperi the nearest star i also propose that between eight and sixteen days from now depending on the availability of more noteworthy news from elsewhere we move to an information release at mlevel simply saying that we have discovered an excession of an ambiguous nature which we are investigating and which we are asking others to stay away from assuming that they

disappeared so what does all that mean she asked good grief ulver the drone said giving a fair impression of spluttering its the heavy crew its the ghosts what the who she swivelled in the seat to face the drone child there were names appearing there i hadnt seen for five centuries some of those minds are legends this is the interesting times gang were talking about i take it thats obviously what they call themselves well good for them but i still want to know what all that was about well a normal enough but pretty highpower mind incident group gets together to discuss whats going on then allowing for signal travel duration within realtime seconds its taken over by probably the most respected not to mention enigmatic group of minds ever assembled together in the same signal sequence since the end of the idiran war you dont say ulver said yawning a little and putting one blackgloved hand over her mouth yes in the case of the not invented here everybody i know thought the thing had been lost half a millennium ago then they dump the boring pedantic gsv that happened to be on the incident coordinating rota agree to waitandsee with the excession itself while sending investigatory reinforcements start a localised mobilisation mobilisation and release a halftruth about the excession when theres some more exciting news breaking ulver frowned when did all this happen well if you hadnt turned off the datetime function muttered the drone colouring frosty blue ulver rolled her eyes again the excession was discovered and that signal sequence plus comments dates from twelve days ago the excessions discovery was announced through the standard channels the day before yesterday the human shrugged i missed it the headlines concerned the resolution of the blitteringueh situation ahhah that would do it i suppose most of the developed galaxy had been following that story for the past hundred days as the aftermath of the short but bitter blitteringuehdeluger war played itself out on the cambombmined blitteringueh home planets and the deluger fleets fleeing with their precious holy relics and grand house captives it had ended with relatively little loss of life but in high drama and with continuing developing repercussions little wonder anything else announced that day had slipped by almost unnoticed and stayed that way and what was that thing towards the end there about calling our mutual friend thatll probably turn out to be something to do with inviting some other mind onto the group the drone was silent for a moment though of course it could be some preagreed form of words a secret signal amongst the group seich stared at the drone a secret signal she said in an mlevel transmission its possible no more seich continued to stare at the machine for a moment youre saying that these minds are discussing something agreeing to something thats so sensitive so secret they wont even talk about it in special circumstances topend code the fucking holy of holies the unbreakable inviolable totally secure m no im not im just saying its semipossible the drones aura field flickered grey with frustration in that event though i dont think it would be breakability theyd be worried about what then seichs eyes narrowed deniability if were thinking in such paranoid terms in the first place yes thatd be my guess the drone said dipping its front once in a nod and making a noise like a sigh so theyre up to something well theyre up to a lot by the sound of it but its just possible that some part of what theyre up to might be well risky ulver seich sat back staring at the empty square of the projected screen hanging in the air in front of her and the drone churt lyne like a pane of slightly opaque smoked glass risky she said she shook her head and felt a strange urge to shiver which she suppressed shit dont you hate it when the gods come out to play in a word said the drone yes so what am i supposed to do and why youre supposed to look like this woman the drone said as a bright still picture flashed on to the smoky screen in front of her ulver studied the face chin in her hand again hmm she said shes older than me true and not as pretty fair enough why do i have to look like her to draw the attention of a certain man she narrowed her eyes wait a minute im not expected to fuck this guy am i oh good grief no the drone said its aura field briefly grey again all you have to do is look like an old flame of his she laughed i bet i am expected to fuck him she rocked back in the little metal seat how quaint is this really what sc gets up to no youre not hissed the drone aura fields going deep grey you just have to be there ill bet she guffawed and sat back crossing her arms so who is he anyway him the drone said another still face appeared on the screen ulver seich sat forward again raising one hand hold on i take it all back actually hes pretty enticing the drone made a sighing noise ulver if you will please try to hold your hormones in check for just a second what she shouted spreading her arms will you do this or not it asked her she closed one eye and wobbled her head from side to side maybe she slurred it means a trip the drone said leaving tonight pah she sat back crossing her arms and looking up at the ceiling out of the question forget it all right tomorrow she turned to the drone after lunch breakfast late breakfast oh the machine said aura field briefly grey with frustration all right late breakfast but before noon in any event ulver opened her mouth to protest then gave a tiny shrug and settled for scowling okay how long for youll be back in a month if all goes well she tipped her head back narrowed her eyes again and said quite soberly and precisely where the drone said tier huh she said tossing her head a sore point phage had been heading to tier specifically for that years festival but had been diverted off course to help build an orbital after the partevacuation of some stupid planet it had taken forever the festival only lasted a month and was now almost over the rock was still heading that way but wouldnt arrive for two hundred days or so she frowned but thats a couple of months away even on a fast ship special circumstances has its own ships and theyre faster ten days to get there on the one theyre giving you my own ship ulver asked eyes flashing all yours not even any human crew wow she said sitting back and looking pleased with herself aloof dependency principle i tight beam m rec n xgsv anticipation of a new lovers arrival the oeccentric shoot them later is

this feels strange oo how dare you imply im not serious anyway whats the problem this is the most important thing ever by our understanding naturally everything and everybody will seem a little odd after such a realisation we cannot help but be affected oo youre right im sure but i just have this niggling feeling no the more i think about it the more im convinced you are right and i am worrying over nothing ill do a little checking for my own peace of mind but im sure it will only help lay my fears to rest oo you should spend more time in infinite fun space you know oo youre probably right oh well oo still keep in touch just in case anything does turn up of course take care oo good checking my friend you take care too ii the drone sisela ytheleus drifted waiting several seconds had passed since the skein pulse had resonated around it and it was still trying to decide what to do it had passed the time by throwing together the antimatter reaction chamber as best it could in the short time available instead of painstakingly putting it together bit by delicate bit as an afterthought it released all but one of its nanomissiles and stuck two hundred of them around its heatscarred rear panel in two groups on either side of the reaction chamber fortuitously the panels damaged surface made it easy for it to embed the tiny missiles so that only the last third of their millimetrelong bodies protruded from the panel it kept the other thirtynine missiles ready to fire for all the good that would do against whatever it was stalking it the gentle buzzing vibrations in the skein had taken on a distinctive signature something was coming towards it in hyperspace with a sensory keel in real space trawling slowly well below lightspeed whatever it was it was not the peace makes plenty the timbral characteristics were all wrong a wash of wideband radiation like a sourceless light a final pulse of maser energies in real space this time and then something shimmering away to one side a ship surfacing into the threedimensional void image flickering once then snapping steady ten kilometres away one klick long matched velocity a fat greyblack ellipsoid shape covered with sharp spines barbs and blades an affronter ship the drone hesitated could this have been the ship that had been following the peace makes plenty probably had it been taken over by the artifactexcession possibly not that it mattered in the end shit the affront no friends of the elench or anybody else for that matter ive failed theyll reel me in gobble me up the drone tried desperately to work out what it could do did the fact it was an affronter ship make any real difference doubtful should it signal it try to get it to help it could try the affront were signatories to the standard conventions on ships and individuals in distress and in theory they ought to take the drone aboard help repair it and broadcast a warning about the artifact to the rest of the galaxy in practice they would take the drone to bits to find out how it worked drain it of all its information ransom it if they hadnt destroyed it in the process of investigation and inquisition probably try to put a spyprogram into it so that it would report back to them once it was back amongst the elench and meanwhile try to work out how they could use the artifactexcession perhaps being foolhardy enough to attempt investigating it in the same final fatal way the peace makes plenty had or perhaps keeping it secret for now and bringing more ships and technology to bear upon it almost certainly the one thing they wouldnt do was play the situation by the book em effector communicating sisela ytheleus readied its shields for as much as that was worth probably delay proceedings by oh a good nanosecond if the affronter ship decided to attack it machine what are you well that was spoken like an affronter certainly itd bet they hadnt tangled with the artifactexcession yet oh well play it by the conventions i am sisela ytheleus drone of the explorer ship peace makes plenty a vessel of the stargazer clan part of the fifth fleet of the zetetic elench and in distress it communicated and you you are ours now surrender or take flight definitely still affront sorry i missed that what did you say your name was again surrender at once or take flight wretch let me think about that and thinking was exactly what it was doing thinking hard thinking feverishly stalling for time but thinking no the effector signal strength started to soar exponentially it had plenty of time to slam down its shields bastards it thought of course they like a chase the drone fired the missiles embedded in its rear panel the two hundred tiny engines brought unequal amounts of matter and antimatter together and threw the resulting blast of plasma boiling into the vacuum careening the machine away across space directly away from the affronter craft the acceleration was relatively mild the drone had no time to test the antimatter reaction chamber it had constructed it threw a few particles of each sort into the chamber and hoped the chamber blew up shit back to the drawing board not much damage not much extra damage anyway but not much extra impetus either and it wouldnt be using the chamber again the acceleration went on building slowly what else think the affronter ship didnt bother to set off in pursuit of the drone sisela ytheleus dropped its plan of leaving a few nanomissiles scattered like mines behind it who am i trying to kid anyway think think space seemed to buckle and twist in front of it and suddenly it was no longer heading straight away from the affronter ship it was parallel to it again those animal pusbags are playing with me a flicker from near the affronter ships nose a centimetrediameter circle of laser light blinked onto the drones casing and wavered there the drone instructed the nanomissile engines to shut off and flicked on its mirror shields the laser beam tracked it unsteadily and narrowed until it was a millimetre in diameter then its power suddenly leapt by seven orders of magnitude the drone coned its protesting mirrorfield and turned rearon to the ship again presenting the smallest possible target the laser modulated stepping up to the ultraviolet it started strobing playing with me just fucking playing with me think think well first it popped the clamps around its two upperlevel minds and raised the bit of its casing that would let the two components ai core and photonic nucleus free the casing shuddered and grated but it moved once it was clear of the main casing the drone nudged the two mind components with its maniple field nothing happened they were stuck panic if they remained intact and the affronters captured them and werent a great deal more careful than they were notorious for being it pushed harder the components duly drifted out losing power the instant contact lapsed with the drones body whatever was inside them should be dead or dying now it blasted them with its laser anyway turning them into hot dust then vented the powder behind it round the edge of the mirrorshield where it might interfere with the laser a little a very little it readied the core inside its present substrate that would have to be dumped and lasered too then the drone had an idea it thought about it if it had been a human its mouth would have gone dry it turned round inside the tight confines of its pummelled shield and fired all two hundred of the nanomissile engines it shook off the remaining loose nanomissiles and fired thirty of them straight at the affronter ship the other nine it left tumbling behind it like a handful of tiny blackbody needletips with their own instructions and the small amount of spare capacity in their microscopic brains packed with coded nonsense the nanomissiles fired at the affronter ship accelerated towards it in a cloud of sparkling light ahead of the drone they were picked off one by one over the course of a millisecond in a dizzy flaring scatter of lightblossoms their tiny warheads and the remains of their antimatter fuel erupting together the last one to be targeted by the affronters effector and forced to selfdestruct had closed the range to the ship by less than a kilometre behind all nine of the tumbling nanomissiles must have been picked out by the effector as well because they detonated too and with any luck youll think those were my messages in bottles and that was my neat idea sisela ytheleus thought decoupling the core with its twins mindstate in it the core depowered whatever was in there died it had no time to mourn it rearranged its internal state to shunt the core to the outside then let its body settle back to normal it pushed the core back down over its blistered cracked casing to the top of the rear panel near where the wreckage of the cobbledtogether and blownapart reaction chamber hung then it let the core fall into the livid plasma and sleeting radiation of the nanomissiles exhausts it flared and disintegrated falling astern in a bright trail of fire the laser targeted on the drone was heading into the xray part of the spectrum it would break through the mirror shield in a second and a half it would take the drone four and a half seconds to get within range of the ship shit it waited until the mirrorshield was a couple of tenths of a second from failing then signalled i surrender and hoped that it was talking to another machine if it was relying on affronter reactions itd be fried before the message got through to their stupid animal brains the laser flicked off the drone kept its em shields up it was heading towards the affronter vessel at about half a klick a second the ships bebladed swollenlooking bulk drifted closer turn off your shields i cant it put expression into the signal so that it came across as a wail now im trying im trying you damaged me damaged me even more such weaponry what chance have i a mere drone something smaller than an affronters beak against such power nearly in range not far not far now another two seconds drop your shields instantly and allow yourself to be taken over or suffer instant destruction still nearly two seconds it would never keep them talking long enough please dont im attempting to shut off the shield projector but its in failsafe mode it wont let itself be shut off its arguing can you believe that but honestly i am doing my best please believe me please dont kill me im the only survivor you know our ship was attacked i was lucky to get away ive never seen anything like it never heard of anything like it either a pause a pause of animal dimensions time for animal thoughts loads of time final chance turn off there turning shields off now im all yours the drone sisela ytheleus turned off its electromagnetic mirrorshield in the same instant it fired its laser straight at the affronter ship an instant later it released the containment around its remaining stock of antimatter detonated its inbuilt selfdestruct charge and instructed the single nanomissile it still carried within its body to explode too fuck you were its final words its last emotion was a mixture of sorrow elation and a kind of desperate pride that its plan might have worked then it died instantly and forever in its own small fireball of heat and light to the affronter ship the effect of the tiny drones laser was rather less than a tickle it flickered across its hull and barely singed it the cloud of glowing wreckage the drones selfdestruction had caused passed over the affronter ship and was duly swept by analysing sensors plasma atoms nothing as big as a molecule likewise the slowly expanding debris from the two groups of nanomissiles disappointment then that had been a particularly sophisticated model of elencher drone not far behind the leadingedge of culture drone technology capturing one would have been a good prize still it had put up a reasonable fight considering and provided a morsel of unexpected sport the affront light cruiser furious purpose came about and headed slowly away from the scene of its miniature battle carefully scanning for more nanomissiles they posed no threat to the cruiser of course but the small drone appeared to have tried to use some of the tiny weapons to place information in and it might have left others behind which were not inclined to selfdestruct when effectortargeted none showed up the cruiser backtracked along the course the drifting drone appeared to have taken it discovered a small cooling cloud of matter at one point the remnants of some sort of explosion apparently but that was all beyond that nothing nothing everywhere one looked most dissatisfying the furious purposes restless officers debated how much more time they should spend looking for this lost elencher ship had something happened to it had the small drone been lying might there be a more interesting opponent floating around out here somewhere or might it all be a ruse a decoy the culture the real culture the wily ones not these semimystical elenchers with their miserable hankering to be somebody else had been known to give whole affronter fleets the runaround for several months with not dissimilar enticements and subterfuges keeping them occupied seemingly on the track of some wildly promising prey which turned out to be nothing at all or a culture ship with some ridiculous but earnestly argued excuse while the culture or one of its snivelling client species got on or away with something else somewhere else spoiling rightful affronter fun how were they to know this was not one of those occasions perhaps the elencher ship was under contract to the culture proper perhaps they had lost the explorer craft and a gcu trailing them as they had been trailing the elench craft had slipped in to take its place might this not be true no argued some of the officers because the culture would never sacrifice a drone it considered sentient the rest thought about this considered the cultures bizarrely sentimental attitude to life and were forced to concede the point the cruiser spent another two days around the esperi system and then broke away it returned to the habitat called tier with a trivial but niggling engine fault iii technically it was a branch of metamathematics usually called metamathics metamathics the investigation of the properties of realities more correctly realityfields intrinsically unknowable by and from our own but whose general principles could be hazarded at metamathics led to everything else it led to the places that nobody else had ever seen or heard of or previously imagined it was like living half your life in a tiny stuffy warm grey box and being moderately happy in there because you knew no better and then discovering a little hole in one corner of the box a tiny opening which you could get a finger into and tease and pull at so that eventually you created a tear which led to a greater tear which led to the box falling apart around you so that you stepped out of the tiny boxs confines into startlingly cool clear fresh air and found yourself on top of a mountain surrounded by deep valleys sighing forests soaring peaks glittering lakes sparkling snowfields and a stunning breathtakingly blue sky and that of course wasnt even the start of the real story that was more like the breath that is drawn in before the first syllable of the first word of the first paragraph of the first chapter of the first book of the first volume of the story metamathics led to the mind equivalent of that experience repeated a million times magnified a billion times and then beyond to configurations of wonder and bliss even the simplest abstract of which the humanbasic brain had no conceivable way of comprehending it was like a drug an ultimately liberating utterly enhancing unadulterably beneficial overpoweringly glorious drug for the intellect of machines as far beyond the sagacity of the human mind as they were beyond its understanding this was the way the minds spent their time they imagined entirely new universes with altered physical laws and played with them lived in them and tinkered with them sometimes setting up the conditions for life sometimes just letting things run to see if it would arise spontaneously sometimes arranging things so that life was impossible but other kinds and types of bizarrely fabulous complication were enabled some of the universes possessed just one tiny but significant alteration leading to some subtle twist in the way things worked while others were so wildly aberrantly different it could take a perfectly firstrate mind the human equivalent of years of intense thought even to find the one tenuously familiar strand of recognisable reality that would allow it to translate the rest into comprehensibility between those extremes lay an infinitude of universes of unutterable fascination consummate joy and absolute enlightenment all that humanity knew and could understand every single aspect known guessed at and hoped for in and of the universe was like a mean and base mud hut compared to the vast glittering cloudhigh palace of monumentally exquisite proportions and prodigious riches that was the metamathical realm within the infinities raised to the power of infinities that those metamathical rules provided the minds built their immense pleasuredomes of rhapsodic philosophical ecstasy that was where they lived that was their home when they werent running ships meddling with alien civilisations or planning the future course of the culture itself the minds existed in those fantastic virtual realities sojourning beyondward into the multidimensioned geographies of their unleashed imaginations vanishingly far away from the single limited point that was reality the minds had long ago come up with a proper name for it they called it the irreal but they thought of it as infinite fun that was what they really knew it as the land of infinite fun it did the experience pathetically little justice the sleeper service promenaded metaphysically amongst the lush creates of its splendid disposition an expanding shell of awareness in a dreamscape of staggering extent and complexity like a gravityfree sun built by a jeweller of infinite patience and skill it is absolutely the case it said to itself it is absolutely the case there was only one problem with the land of infinite fun and that was that if you ever did lose yourself in it completely as minds occasionally did just as humans sometimes surrendered utterly to some ai environment you could forget that there was a base reality at all in a way this didnt really matter as long as there was somebody back where you came from minding the hearth the problem came when there was nobody left or inclined to tend the fire mind the store look after the housekeeping or however you wanted to express it or if somebody or something else somebody or something from outside the sort of entity that came under the general heading of an outside context problem for example decided they wanted to meddle with the fire in that hearth the stock in the store the contents and running of the house if youd spent all your time having fun with no way back to reality or just no idea what to do to protect yourself when you did get back there then you were vulnerable in fact you were probably dead or enslaved it didnt matter that base reality was petty and grey and mean and demeaning and quite empty of meaning compared to the glorious majesty of the multihued life youd been living through metamathics it didnt matter that base reality was of no consequence aesthetically hedonistically metamathically intellectually and philosophically if that was the single foundationstone that all your higherlevel comfort and joy rested upon and it was kicked away from underneath you you fell and your limitless pleasure realms fell with you it was just like some ancient electricitypowered computer it didnt matter how fast errorfree and tireless it was it didnt matter how great a laboursaving boon it was it didnt matter what it could do or how many different ways it could amaze if you pulled its plug out or just hit the off button all it became was a lump of matter all its programs became just settings dead instructions and all its computations vanished as quickly as theyd moved it was also like the dependency of the humanbasic brain on the humanbasic body no matter how intelligent perceptive and gifted you were no matter how entirely you lived for the ascetic rewards of the intellect and eschewed the material world and the ignobility of the flesh if your heart just gave out that was the dependency principle that you could never forget where your off switches were located even if it was somewhere tiresome it was the problem that subliming dispensed with of course and it was one of the usually more minor reasons that civilisations chose elderhood if your course was set in that direction in the first place then eventually that reliance on the material universe came to seem vestigial untidy pointless and even embarrassing it wasnt the course the culture had fully embarked upon at least not yet but as a society it was well aware of both the difficulties presented by remaining in base reality and the attractions of the sublime in the meantime it compromised busying itself in the macrocosmic clumsiness and petty messy profanity of the real galaxy while at the same time exploring the transcendental possibilities of the sacred irreal it is absolutely the a single signal flicked the great ships attention entirely back to base reality xrock end in tears ogsv sleeper service done the ship contemplated the oneword message for what was for it a very long time and wondered at the mixture of emotions it felt it set its newly manufactured dronefleet to work in the external environments and rechecked the evacuation schedule then it located amorphia the avatar was wandering bemused through kilometres of tableaux exhibition space that had once been accommodation sections and instructed it to revisit the woman dajeil gelian iv genarhofoen was distinctly unimpressed with his quarters aboard the battlecruiser kiss the blade for one thing they smelled what is that he asked his nose wrinkling methane methane is odourless genarhofoen the suit said i believe the smell you find objectionable may be a mixture of methanal and methylamine fucking horrible smell whatever it is im sure your mucous membrane receptors will cease to react to it before long i certainly hope so he was standing in what was supposed to be his bedroom it was cold it was very big a tenmetre square plenty of headroom but it was cold he could see his breath he still wore most of the gelfield suit but hed detached all but the napepart of the neck and let the head of the suit flop down over his back so that he could get a fresher impression of his quarters which consisted of a vestibule a lounge a frighteningly industriallooking kitchendiner an equally intimidatingly mechanical bathroom and this socalled bedroom he was starting to wish he hadnt bothered the walls floor and ceiling of the room were some sort of white plastic the floor bulged up to create a sort of platform on which a huge white thing lay spread like a cloud made solid what he asked pointing at the bed is that i think it is your bed id guessed but what is that thing lying on it quilt duvet bedcovering what do you want to cover it for he asked genuinely confused well its more to cover you i think when youre asleep the suit said sounding uncertain the man dropped his holdall onto the shiny plastic floor and went forward to heft the white cloudy thing it felt quite light possibly a little damp unless the suits tactiles were getting confused he pulled a glovesection back and touched the bedcover thing with his bare skin cold maybe damp module genarhofoen said hed get its opinion on all this you cant talk to scopellafranqui directly remember the suit said politely shit genarhofoen said he rubbed the material of the bedcover between his fingers this feel damp to you suit a little do you want me to ask the ship to patch you through to the module eh oh no dont bother we moving yet no the man shook his head horrible smell he said he prodded the bedcover thing again he wished now hed insisted that the module be accommodated on board the ship so that he could live inside it but the affronters had said this wasnt possible hangar space was at a premium on all three ships the module had protested and hed made supportive noises but he had been rather entertained by the idea that scopellafranqui would have to stay here while he went zapping off to faroff parts of the galaxy on an important mission seemed like a good idea at the time now he wasnt so sure there was a distant growling noise and a tremor underfoot then there came a jerk that almost threw the human off his feet he staggered to one side and had to sit down on the bed it made a squelching sound he stared at it aghast now were moving said the suit v singing softly to himself the man tended the little fire he had started on the floor of the hall beneath and between the stored ships arrayed in the blackness like the trunks of enormous trees in a silent petrified forest gestra ishmethit was surveying his charges in the deepburied darkness that was pittance pittance was a huge irregular lump of matter two hundred kilometres across at its narrowest point and ninetyeight per cent iron by volume it was the remnant of a catastrophe which had occurred over four billion years earlier when the planet of whose core it had been part had been struck by another large body expelled from its own solar system by that cataclysm it had wandered between the stars for a quarter of the life of the universe uncaptured by any other gravity well but subtly affected by all it passed anywhere near it had been discovered drifting in deep space a millennium ago by a gcu taking an eccentrically trajectorial course between two stellar systems it had been given the brief examination its simple and homogeneous composition deserved and then had been left to glide noted effectively tagged untouched but given the name pittance when the time came five hundred years later to dismantle the colossal war machine the culture had created in order to destroy that of the idirans pittance had suddenly been found a role most of the cultures warships had been decommissioned and dismantled a few were retained demilitarised to act as express delivery systems for small packages of matter humans for example on the rare occasions when the transmission of information alone was not sufficient to deal with a problem and an even smaller number were kept intact and operational two hundred years after the war ended the number of fully active warcraft was actually smaller than it had been before the conflict began though as the cultures critics never tired of pointing out the average and avowedly completely peaceful general contact unit was more than a match for the vast majority of alien craft it was likely to bump into over the course of its career never a civilisation to take too many risks however and priding itself on the assiduity of its bethedging the culture had not disposed of all the remaining craft a few thousand representing less than a per cent of the original total were kept in reserve fully armed save for their usual complement of displacerdispatched explosive warheads a relatively minor weapon system anyway which they and other craft would manufacture in the event of mobilisation most of the mothballed ships were retained within a scattering of culture orbitals chosen so that if there ever was an emergency which the craft would be required to deal with no part of the greater galaxy would be more than a month or sos flight away still guarding against threats and possibilities even it found difficult to specify some of the cultures stored warvessels were harboured not in or around highly populated orbitals full of life and the comings and goings of cruise ships and visiting gsvs but in places as far out of the way as it was possible to find amongst the cavernously cold and empty spaces of the great lens quiet secret hidden places places off the beaten track places possibly nobody else even knew existed pittance had been chosen as one of those places the general systems vehicle uninvited guest and a fleet of accompanying warcraft had been dispatched to rendezvous with the cold dark wandering mass it was found exactly where it had been predicted it ought to be and work began firstly a series of enormous halls had been hollowed out of its interior then a precisely weighed and shaped piece of the matter mined from one of those giant hangars had been aimed with millimetric accuracy and fired at pittance by the gsv leaving a small new crater on the surface of the world exactly as though it had been struck by another smaller piece of interstellar debris this was done because pittance wasnt spinning quite quickly enough or heading in exactly the right direction for the cultures purposes the exquisitely engineered collision made both alterations at once so pittance spun a little quicker to provide a more powerful hint of artificial gravity inside and its course was altered just a fraction to deflect it from a star system it would otherwise have drifted through in five and a half thousand years or so a number of giant displacer units were set within the fabric of pittance and the warships were safely displaced one at a time into the giant spaces the gsv had created lastly a frightening variety and number of sensory and weapon systems had been emplaced camouflaged on the surface of pittance and buried deep underneath it while a cloud of tiny dark almost invisible but apocalyptically powerful devices were placed in orbit about the slowly tumbling mass also to watch for unwelcome guests and if necessary welcome them with destruction its work finished the uninvited guest had departed taking with it most of the iron mined from pittances interior it left behind a world that save for that plausiblelooking extra crater seemed untouched even its overall mass was almost exactly as it had been before again minus a little to allow for the collision it had suffered the debris of which was allowed to drift as the laws of gravity dictated most of it sailing like lazy shrapnel spinning into space but a little of it captured by the tiny worlds weak gravitational field drifting along with it and so incidentally providing perfect cover for the cloud of blackbody sentry devices watching over pittance from near its centre was its own quiet mind carefully designed to enjoy the quiet life and to take a subdued passive pride in the feeling of containing and jealously guarding an almost incalculable amount of stored latent preferably nevertobeused power the rarefied specialist minds in the warships themselves had been consulted like the rest on their fate those five hundred years ago those in storage at pittance had been of the persuasion that preferred to sleep until they might be needed and been prepared to accept that their sleep might be very long indeed before quite probably ending in battle and death what they had all agreed they would prefer would be to be woken only as a prelude to joining the cultures ultimate sublimation if and when that became the societys choice until then they would be content to slumber in their dark halls the war gods of past wrath implicitly guarding the peace of the present and the security of the future meanwhile the mind of pittance watched over them and looked out into the resounding silence and the sunfreckled darkness of the spaces between the stars forever content and ineffably satisfied with the absence of anything remotely interesting happening pittance was a very safe place then and gestra ishmethit liked safe places it was a very lonely place and gestra ishmethit had always craved loneliness it was at once a very important place and a place that almost nobody knew or cared about or indeed probably ever would and that also suited gestra ishmethit quite perfectly because he was a strange creature and accepted that he was tall adolescently gawky and awkward despite his two hundred years gestra felt he had been an outsider all his life hed tried physical alteration hed been quite handsome for a while hed tried being female shed been quite pretty shed been told hed tried moving away from where hed been brought up hed moved half the galaxy away to an orbital quite different but every bit as pleasant as his home and hed tried a life lived adream hed been a merman prince in a waterfilled space ship fighting an evil machinehive mind and according to the scenario was supposed to woo the warrior princess of another clan but in all the things hed tried he had never felt anything else than awkward being handsome was worse than being gangly and bumbling because his body felt like a lie he was wearing being a woman was the same and somehow embarrassing as well as though it was somebody elses body he had kidnapped from inside moving away just left him terrified of having to explain to people why hed wanted to leave home in the first place and living in a dream scenario all day and night just felt wrong he had a horror of immersing himself in that virtual world as completely as his merman did in his watery realm and thus losing hold of what he felt was a tenuous grip on reality at the best of times and so hed lived the scenario with the nagging sensation that he was just a pet fish in somebody elses fish tank swimming in circles through the prettified ruins of sunken castles in the end to his mortification the princess had defected to the machine hivemind the plain fact was that he didnt like talking to people he didnt like mixing with them and he didnt even like thinking about them individually the best he could manage was when he was well away from people then he could feel a not unpleasant craving for their company as a whole a craving that quite vanished to be replaced by stomachchurning dread the instant it looked like being satisfied gestra ishmethit was a freak despite being born to the most ordinary and healthy of mothers and an equally ordinary father in the most ordinary of families on the most ordinary of orbitals and having the most ordinary of upbringings an accident of birth or some allbutimpossible conjunction of disposition and upbringing had left him the sort of person the cultures carefully meddledwith genes virtually never threw up a genuine misfit something even rarer in the culture than a baby born physically deformed but whereas it was perfectly simple to replace or regrow a stunted limb or a misshapen face it was a different matter when the oddness lay inside a fact gestra had always accepted with an equanimity he sometimes suspected people regarded as even more freakish than his original almost pathological shyness why didnt he just have the condition treated his relations and few acquaintances asked why didnt he ask to remain as much himself as possible yet with this strange aberrancy removed expunged it might not be easy but it would be painless probably it could be done in his sleep hed remember nothing about it and when he woke up he could live a normal life he came to the attention of ais drones humans and minds that took an interest in that sort of thing soon they were queuing up to treat him he was a challenge he became so frightened by their by turns kind cheery cajoling brusque or just plain plaintive entreaties to talk to him counsel him explain the merits of their various treatments and courses to him that he stopped answering his terminal and practically became a hermit in a summer house in his familys estate unable to explain that despite it all indeed exactly because of all his previous attempts to integrate with the rest of society and what he had learned about himself through them he wanted to be who he was not the person he would become if he lost the one trait that distinguished him from everybody else no matter how perverse that decision seemed to others in the end it had taken the intervention of the hub mind of his home orbital to come up with a solution a drone from contact had come to speak to him one day hed always found it easier talking to drones rather than humans and this drone had been somehow particularly businesslike but unconcernedly charming as well and after probably the longest conversation with anybody gestra had ever had it had offered him a variety of posts where he could be alone he had chosen the position where he could be most alone and most lonely where he could happily yearn for the human contact he knew was the one thing he was incapable of appreciating it was in the end a sinecure it had been explained from the beginning that he would not really have anything to do on pittance he would simply be there a symbolic human presence amongst the mass of quiescent weapons a witness to the minds silent sentinelship over the sleeping machines gestra ishmethit had been perfectly happy with that lack of responsibility too and had now been resident on pittance for one and a half centuries had not once left to go anywhere else had not received a single visitor in all that time and had never felt anything less than content some days he even felt happy the ships were arranged in lines and rows sixtyfour at a time in the series of huge dark spaces those great halls were kept cold and in vacuum but gestra had discovered that if he found some rubbish from his quarters and kept it warm in a gelfield sack and then set it down on the chill floor of one of the hangars and blew oxygen over it from a pressurised tank it could be made to burn quite a satisfactory little fire could be got going flaring white and yellow in the breath of gas and producing a quickly dispersing cloud of smoke and soot he had found that by adjusting the flow of oxygen and directing it through a nozzle he had designed and made himself he could produce a fierce blaze a dull red glow or any state of conflagration in between he knew the mind didnt like him doing this but it amused him and it was almost the only thing he did which annoyed it besides the mind had grudgingly admitted both that the amount of heat produced was too small ever to leak through the eighty kilometres of iron to show up on the surface of pittance and that ultimately the waste products of the combustion would be recovered and recycled so gestra felt free to indulge himself with a clear conscience every few months or so todays fire was composed of some old wall hangings hed grown tired of some vegetable scraps from past meals and tiny bits and pieces of wood the wooden scraps were produced by his hobby which was constructing oneinonetwentyeighth scale models of ancient sailing ships he had drained the swimming pool in his quarters and turned it into a miniature forestry plantation and farm using some of the biomass the mind and he had been provided with tiny trees grew there which he cut down and sliced into little planks and turned on lathes to produce all the masts spars decks and other wooden parts the sea ships required other bonsai plants in the forest provided long fibres which he teased and twisted and coiled into thread and stringthin ropes to make halyards and sheets different plants let him create still thinner fibres which he wove into sails on infinitesimal looms he had also constructed himself the iron and steel parts were made from material scraped from the iron walls of pittance itself he smelted the metal in a miniature furnace to rid it of the last traces of impurities and either flattened it in a tiny handturned rolling mill cast it using wax and talclike fines or turned it on microscopic lathes another furnace fused sand taken from the beach which had been part of the swimming pool to make waferthin sheets of glass for portholes and skylights yet more of the lifesupport systems biomass was used to produce pitch and oils which caulked the hull and greased the little winches derricks and other pieces of machinery his most precious commodity was brass which he had to pare from an antique telescope his mother had given him with some ironic comment he had long chosen to forget when hed announced his decision to leave for pittance his mother was herself stored now one of his great grandnieces had sent him a letter it had taken him ten years to make the tiny machines to make the ships and then making each ship occupied another twenty years of his time he had constructed six vessels so far each slightly larger and better made than the one before he had almost completed a seventh with just the sails to finish and sew the scraps of wood he was burning were the last of its offcuts and compacted sawdust the little fire burned well enough he let it blaze and looked around his breath sounded loud in his suit as he lifted his head to gaze around the dark space the sixtyfour ships stored in this hall were gangster class rapid offensive units slim segmented cylinders over two hundred metres tall and fifty in diameter the tiny glow from the fire was lost to normal sight amongst the spirelike heights of the ships he had to press the control surfaces on the forearm of the ancient space suit to intensify the image displayed on the visorscreen in front of him the ships looked like theyd been tattooed their hulls were covered in a bewildering swirl of patterns upon patterns upon patterns a fractal welter of colours designs and textures that saturated their every square millimetre he had seen this a hundred times before but it never failed to fascinate and amaze him on a few occasions he had floated up to some of the ships and touched their skins and even through the thickness of the gloves on the millenniumold suit he had felt the roughened surface whorled and raised and encrusted beneath he had looked closely then more closely still using the suits lights and the magnification on the visorscreen to peer into the gaudy display in front of him and found himself becoming lost within concentric layers of complexity and design finally the suit was using electrons to scan the surface and imposing false colours on the surfaces displayed and still the complexity went on down and down to the atomic level he had pulled back out through the layers and levels of motifs figures mandalas and fronds his head buzzing with the extravagant numbing complexity of it all gestra ishmethit remembered seeing screenshots of warships they had been whatever colour they wanted to be usually perfectly black or perfectly reflecting when they were not hidden by a hologram of the view straight through them but he could not recall ever having seen such odd designs upon them he had consulted the minds archives sure enough the ships had been ordinary plainhulled craft when they had flown here he asked the mind why the ships had become decorated so writing to it on the display of his terminal as he always did when he wanted to communicate why ships tattooed look the mind had replied think of it as a form of armour gestra and that was all he could get out of it he decided he would have to be content to remain puzzled the little fire sent quivering veins of dim light into the hollow shadows around the enigmatic towers of the dazzlingly patterned ships the only sound was his breathing he felt wonderfully alone here even the mind couldnt communicate with him here as long as he kept the suits communicator turned off here was perfect here was total and complete loneliness here was peace and quiet and a fire in the vacuum he lowered his gaze again towards the embers something glinted near the floor of the hall a couple of kilometres away his heart seemed to freeze the thing glinted again whatever it was it was coming closer he turned the suit communicator on with a shaking hand before his quivering fingers could tap in a question to the mind the display on his visorscreen lit up gestra we are to be visited please return to your quarters he stared at the text his eyes wide his heart thudding in his chest his mind reeling the glowing letters stayed where they were they added up to the same thing they would not go away he inspected each one in turn looking for mistakes desperately trying to make some different kind of sense from them but they kept repeating the same sentence they kept meaning the same thing visited he thought visited visited visited he felt terror for the first time in one and a half centuries the drone which had glinted in the shadows which the mind had sent to summon him because his suit communicator had been turned off had to carry the man back to his quarters he was shaking so much it had picked up the oxygen cylinder too turning it off behind it the fire went on glowing faintly for a few seconds in the darkness then even that baleful glimmer succumbed to the empty coldness and it winked out kiss the blade i the

touching on as many of the dark frozen bodies as it could searching for its lost sister vessel the doublesun system was relatively poor in comets there were only a hundred billion of them however many of them had orbits well outside the ecliptic and that helped to make the search every bit as difficult as it would have been with a greater number of comet nuclei but in a more planar cloud even so it was impossible to check all of them ten thousand ships would have been required to thoroughly check every single sensor trace in the comet cloud to make sure that one of them was not a stricken ship and the best the break even could do was briefly fasten its gaze on the most likely looking candidates just doing that bare minimum would take a full day for this system alone and it had another nine stars allocated to it as prime possibilities plus another eighty less likely solar systems the other six vessels of the fifth fleet had similar schedules similar allocations of stellar systems to attempt to search elencher ships sent routine location and status reports back to a responsible and reliable habitat facility or coursescheduled craft every sixteen standard days the peace makes plenty had signalled safely back to the elench embassy on tier along with the other seven ships of the fleet sixtyfour days after theyd all left the habitat day eighty had come and only seven had reported in the others immediately stopped heading any further away if that was the course theyd been set on four days later still with no word and with no sign of anybody else having heard anything the seven remaining ships of the fifth fleet set their courses to converge on the last known position of the missing ship and accelerated to their maximum speed the first of them had arrived in the general volume where the peace makes plenty ought to be five days later the last one appeared another twelve days after that they had to assume that the ship they were looking for had not travelled at that sort of speed since it had last signalled they had to assume that it had been cruising even loitering amongst the systems it had been investigating they had to assume that it was somewhere within a stellar system small nebula or gas cloud in the first place and they had to assume that it was not deliberately trying to hide from them or that somebody else was not deliberately trying to hide it from them the stars themselves were relatively easy to check microscopic as it might be compared to the average sun a halfmillion tonne ship containing a few tonnes of antimatter and a variety of highly exotic materials falling into a star left a tiny but distinct and unmistakable flash behind it and usually a mark on the stellar surface that lasted for days at least one loop round the star could tell you if that kind of disaster had befallen a missing craft small solid planets were easy too unless a ship was deliberately hiding or being hidden which of course was perfectly possible in such situations and considerably more likely than a ship suffering some natural disaster or terminal technical fault large gaseous planets presented a bigger challenge asteroid belts where they existed could pose real problems and comet clouds were a nightmare in the vast majority of solar systems the spaces between the inner system and the comet cloud were easy to search for big obvious things and pointless to search for small things or anything trying to hide interstellar space was the same but much worse unless something was trying to signal you from out there you could more or less forget about finding anything smaller than a planet the break even and its crew like the rest of the fleet the clan and the elench had no illusions about the likelihood of success their search offered they were doing it because you had to do something because there was always just a chance no matter how remote that their sister ship was somewhere findable and obvious orbiting a planet sitting in a stabile round a big planets orbit and you wouldnt be able to live with yourself if you took the cold statistical view that there was next to zero hope of finding the ship intact and then later discovered it had been there all along savable at the time but later lost because nobody could be bothered to hope and act against the odds still the statistics did not make optimistic reading indicating that the whole task was as close to being impossible as made little difference and there was a morbid depressing quality about such searches almost as though they were more a kind of vigil for the dead part of a funeral ceremony than a practical attempt to look for the missing the days went by the ships aware that whatever had befallen the peace makes plenty might as easily happen to them signalled their locations to each other every few hours sixteen days after the first ship had started searching and hundreds of investigated star systems later the quest began to be wound down over the next few days five of the ships returned to the other parts of the upper leaf spiral they had been exploring while two remained behind in the volume the peace makes plenty ought still to be in somewhere carrying out more thorough explorations of the star systems as part of their normal mission profile but always hoping that their missing sister ship might turn up or at the very least that they might uncover some fragment of evidence some hint of what had happened to their missing sibling the fact that the ship had disappeared would not be reported outside the fleet for another sixteen days the stargazer clan would pass the sad news on to the rest of the elench eight days subsequently and the outside galaxy would be informed if it cared another month after that the elench looked after their own and kept themselves to themselves as well the break even powered away from the last stellar system it had investigated leaving the red giant astern with a kind of dismal relief it was not one of the two craft whod stay to continue the scaleddown search it was heading back to the volume where it had been before the peace makes plenty had gone missing it kept all its sensors sweeping on full scan as it moved away from the giant sun through the orbits of two small cold planets and further out the dark gelid bodies of the comet nuclei its course took it directly towards the next nearest star on the way it swept interstellar space with its sensors too still hoping still half dreading but nothing turned up esperis single dimred globe fell away astern like an ember cooling to ash in the freezing night a few hours later the ship was out of the volume altogether heading outdownspinward back to its allotted crop of distant anonymous stars ii tight beam m tra n xgsv anticipation of a new lovers arrival the oeccentric shoot them later i think i have discovered something attached are course schedules for the steely glint and wo fixed abode diaglyphs attached the movements of the not invented here can only be guessed at note that both alter within hours of each other for no given reason nineteen days ago the gcu fate amenable to change which discovered the excession also made a sudden and acute coursechange nineteen days ago a new heading which took it almost straight to the excession then there is a report from the gcu reasonable excuse charged with oversight of our semidetached friend the gcu greyarea that the ship left its most recent place of interest two days ago and was last detected heading in the direction of the lower leaf swirl possibly tier oo tight beam m tra n xeccentric shoot them later ogsv anticipation of a new lovers arrival the yes oo do not be obtuse oo i am not being obtuse you are being paranoid a lot of course schedules have been altered recently thanks to this thing im thinking about finding an excuse to edge in that direction myself and as you point out yourself the meatfucker is heading towards the lower swirl not the upper oo there is a certain potential rendezvous implied in that direction do i have to spell it out and the point remains these are the only three schedules which change at the same point oo they alter over the course of five hours hardly a point and even so what if they do and whats so special about nineteen or even nineteentwo days ago oo stuttered tight point m it does not worry you that there might be a conspiracy in the highest levels of a contactsc committee i am suggesting that there may be prior knowledge here that some tip or clue was received by one of our colleagues which was not passed on to anybody else that is what is so special about nineteen days ago it is less than fiftyseven days ago when whatever took place in the vicinity of the excession appears to have occurred oo yes yes yes but so what my dear ship which of us has not taken part in some scheme some ruse or secret plan some stratagem or diversion sometimes of quite a sizable and labyrinthine nature and involving matters of considerable import theyre what makes ordinary life worth living so some of our chums in the core group may have had a sniff of something interesting in that region good for them i say have you never had some clue some lead a hint of some potential sport amusement jape or focus of contemplation that was certainly worth acting upon but equally decidedly did not merit advertising due to some reservation concerning potential embarrassment the wish not to seem vain or simply a desire for privacy really i think there is no conspiracy here whatsoever and that even if there is it is a benign one apart from anything else there is one question you have not i believe addressed what is the conspiracy for if it was merely a couple of minds getting wind of something odd in the upper leaf spiral and finessing a search there are they not simply to be congratulated oo but there has been nothing this important before this is perhaps our first real ocp and we may not be up to the challenge it represents meat it makes me ashamed i just find this all so distressing for millennia we have congratulated ourselves on our wisdom and maturity and revelled in our freedom from baser drives and from the ignobility of thought and action that desperation born of indigence produces my fear my terror is that our freedom from material concern has blinded us to our true underlying nature we have been good because we have never needed to make the choice between that and anything else altruism has been imposed upon us now suddenly we are presented with something we cannot manufacture or simulate something which is to us as precious metals or stones or just other lands were to ancient monarchs and we may find that we are prepared to cheat and lie and scheme and plot like any bloody tyrant and contemplate adopting any behaviour however reprehensible so that we may grab this prize it is as if we have been children until this point playing without care and dressing in but not filling adult clothes blithely assuming that when we are grown we shall behave as we have done in the headlong heedless innocence that has been our life so far oo but my dear friend none of this has happened yet oo have you not carried out the projections i took your advice to spend more time in metamathical pursuits modelling the likely course of events divining the shape of the future the results worry me what i feel myself worries me i wonder what we may stop at what we may not stop at to attain the prize this excession may offer oo i meant spend more time enjoying yourself as you well know besides simulations abstractions projections these are only themselves not the reality of what they claim to represent attend to the actuality of events we have a fascinating phenomenon before us and we are taking all reasonable precautions as we deal or prepare to deal with it some of our colleagues show laudable enterprise and initiative while others ourselves exhibit caution just as commendable as and in sum complementary to their ambition what is there to fear but the wild imaginings which may well be the result of looking too far beyond the scale of relevance oo i suppose so perhaps it is me certainly i see worrying signs everywhere i dare say it must be me i may still make some further inquiries but i take your point make your inquiries if you must but frankly i think it is this constant urge to inquire that causes you such pain when one is able to scrutinise a subject as closely as we are and to do so with the crossreferential capacity we possess then the closer one looks into anything the more coincidences one finds perfectly innocent though they may be what is the point of inquiring at such depth that one loses sight of the sunlit surface lay up that magnifying glass and take up thy drink glass my friend slip off the academic gown and on with the antic pants oo i thank you for your advice i am reassured somewhat i shall consider what you say do keep in touch farewell for now stuttered tight point m tra n xeccentric shoot them later olsv serious callers only the anticipation of a new lovers arrival was in touch again signal file attached i still think it could be one of them oo stuttered tight point m tra n xlsv serious callers only oeccentric shoot them later and i still think you should let it in with us it almost certainly now suspects you are part of the conspiracy oo i have an image to maintain and i would point out that we are still very much in the dark we are not yet sure there is a conspiracy beyond the kind of normal outsmarting outcliqueing nonsense in which all of us indulge from time to time what purpose would formally extending the circumference of our concern serve for now our sleuth is still behaving as though it is one of us but it knows nothing of our scepticism we have naught to gain by bringing it aboard at present if it is genuine it will apply itself to our purpose and if discovered the shadow of its guilt will not fall across us if it is a test then it they may decide to bait us with more information of genuine interest delivered at no cost to our virtue are we agreed have i convinced you anyway enough of that have we yet a plan what was the result of your own investigations oo frustratingly vague an exhaustive search has thrown up one remote possibility but it remains an improbability predicated upon an uncertainty oo pray tell oo well let me ask you a question what do you understand results by our communicating with our mutual friend oo why that we are allowed to share in its inimitable objectivity what else oo that is the general volume of my concern ill say no more oo what dont be ridiculous elaborate oo no you know what you said to our unwitting fellow in suspicion about not advertising lines of inquiry which might end in embarrassment oo unfair after all ive shared with you oo yes including the exciting opportunity to get involved with this in the first place thanks a lot oo cast that up to me again would you ive said im sorry wish id never said anything now oo yes but if the anticipation of a new lovers arrival finds out who passed on the information which led to the fate amenable to changes search in the first place oo i know i know look im doing all i can i have requested a sympathetic ship to divert itself to pittance just in case thats where my prognostications indicate a site for possible future mischief oo death if it comes to that iii the twittering batball bounced off the centre of the highscoring wall and flew straight towards genarhofoen the creatures tiny clipped wings paddled frantically at the atmosphere as it tried to right itself and flee one of its stumpy wings was ragged perhaps even broken it started to curve away as it approached the human he took a good backswing with his bat and slammed it into the little creature sending it yelping and spinning away hed intended it to head for the highscoring wall but the stroke had been slightly offtarget resulting in the spin hed given the thing and its course towards the corner between the highscoring wall and the rightside forfeit baffle shit he thought the batball thrashed at the atmosphere and curved further towards the forfeit baffle fivetide darted forward and with a flip of the bat strapped to one of his front limbs and a resounding ha snapped the batball into the centre of the highscoring wall again it thudded against the roundel and ricocheted off at an angle genarhofoen knew he wasnt going to be able to intercept he lunged at it anyway but the creature sailed slackly past half a metre away from his outstretched bat he fell to the floor and rolled feeling the gelfield suit tensing and squeezing him as it absorbed the shock he picked himself up to a sitting position and looked around he was breathing hard and his heart was hammering playing this sort of game against another human would have been no joke in affronter gravity playing it against an affronter even one with half his tentacles sportingly tied round its back was even harder work hopeless fivetide roared crossing towards where the batball lay motionless near the back of the court as he passed the human he flicked a tentacle under genarhofoens chin and levered him up the gesture was almost certainly meant to be helpful but it would have broken the average unprotected human neck genarhofoen merely found himself propelled off the floor like a rock out of a catapult and sent sailing towards the ceiling of the court arms flailing idiot the suit said as genarhofoen reached the top of his trajectory he assumed the suit was talking about fivetide a tentacle wrapped itself round his waist like a whip oops fivetide said and lowered him safely to the floor with surprising gentleness sorry about that genarhofoen he yelled you know what they say its a wise lad knows his own strength when hes having fun eh he patted the human relatively gently on the head then continued over to the motionless body of the batball he prodded it with the bat dont breed them like they used to he said then made a noise genarhofoen had learned to interpret as a sigh tentacled scumbag fuckwit said the suit suit really he thought amused well the suit was not in the best of moods he and it were spending a lot more time together the suit didnt trust the containment around genarhofoens quarters in the ship and had insisted that the human keep it on even when he was asleep genarhofoen had grumbled but not overmuch there were too many funny smells in his quarters for him to have complete faith in the affronts attempt at a human lifesupport system the most the gelfield suit would let him do at night was peel aside its head section so that he could sleep with his face exposed that way even if his environment collapsed suddenly and totally the suit would be able to protect him fivetide flicked the batball up with the end of his bat and flicked it over the transparent wall of the court into the spectators seats then he banged on the wall waking the snoozing form of the gelding on the far side wake up you dozy pellet fivetide bellowed another batball dolt the neutered affronter adolescent jumped to its tentacle tips its eye stalks waving around wildly then it reached into a small cage by its side with one limb while another tentacle opened the door in the court wall it picked one batball out of the dozen or so tied up in the cage and handed the squirming creature to the adult affronter who accepted it then jerked forward and hissed at the adolescent making it flinch it closed the door quickly ha fivetide shouted putting the trussed wriggling batball to his forebeak and tearing the cord that had held it immobile another game genarhofoen fivetide spat the short length of cord away and patted the batball up and down in one of his limbs while the little animal flexed its abbreviated wings why not genarhofoen said coolly he was exhausted but he wasnt going to let fivetide know ninenil to me i believe the affronter said holding the batball up to his eyes i know he said lets make it more interesting he put the struggling batball into the tip of his forebeak his eye stalks bent forward and down to look at what he was doing there was a delicate movement around fivetides beakfronds and a tiny screech accompanied by a faint pop fivetide withdrew the creature from his beak and inspected it apparently satisfied there he said always good for a change playing with a blinded one he threw the writhing mewling creature to genarhofoen your serve i believe the culture had a problem with the affront the affront had a problem with the culture too for that matter but it was a pretty plain thing in comparison the affronts problem with the culture was simply that the older civilisation stopped it doing all the things it wanted to do the cultures problem with the affront was like an itch they couldnt scratch the cultures problem with the affront was that the affront existed at all and the culture couldnt in all conscience do anything about it the problem stemmed from an accident of galactic topography and a combination of bad luck and bad timing the fuzzily specified region which had given rise to the various species that had eventually made up the culture had been on the far side of the galaxy from the affront home planet and contacts between the culture and the affront had been unusually sparse for a long time for a variety of frankly banal reasons by the time the culture came to know the affront better shortly after the long distraction of the idiran war the affront were a rapidly developing and swiftly maturing species and short of another war there was no practical way of quickly changing either their nature or behaviour some culture minds had argued at the time that a quick war against the affront was exactly the right course of action but even as theyd started setting out their case theyd known it was already lost for all that the culture was just then at a peak of military power it had never expected to attain at the start of that long and terrible conflict just so there was a corresponding determination at all levels that the task of stopping the idirans relentless expansion having been accomplished the culture would neither need nor seek to achieve such a martial zenith again even while the minds concerned had been contending that a single abrupt and crushing blow would benefit all concerned including the affront not just ultimately but soon the cultures warships were being stood down deactivated componented stored and demilitarised by the tens of thousands while its trillions of citizens were congratulating themselves on a job well done and returning with the relish of the truly peaceloving to the uninhibited enjoyment of all the recreational wonders the resolutely hedonismfocused society of the culture had to offer there had probably never been a less propitious time for arguing that more fighting was a good idea and the argument duly foundered though the problem remained part of the problem was that the affront had the disturbing habit of treating every other species they encountered with either total suspicion or amused contempt depending almost entirely on whether that civilisation was ahead of or behind them in technological development there had been one developed species the padressahl in that same volume of the galaxy which had been sufficiently like the affront in terms of evolutionary background and physical appearance to be treated almost as friends by the affront and which yet had a moral outlook similar enough to the cultures to consider it worth the effort of chaperoning the affront with the other local species and to their eternal credit the padressahl had been doggedly endeavouring to nudge the affront into something remotely resembling decent behaviour for more centuries than they cared to remember or admit it was the padressahl who had given the affront their name originally the affront had called themselves after their home world issorile calling them the affront following an episode involving a padressahl trade mission to issorile which the recipients had treated more as a food parcel had been most decidedly intended as an insult but the issorilians as they then were thought that affront sounded much better and had steadfastly refused to drop their new name even after they had formed their loose patronprotégé alliance with the padressahl however a century or so after the end of the idiran war the padressahl had had what the culture regarded as the gross bad manners to suddenly sublime off into advanced elderhood at just the wrong time leaving their less mature charges joyfully off the leash and both snapping at the heels of the local members of the cultures great long straggling civilisational caravan wending its way towards progress whether they went wittingly or not and positively savaging several of the even less welldeveloped neighbouring species which for their own good nobody else had yet thought fit to contact suggestions by a few of the more cynical culture minds that the padressahl decision to hit the hyperspace button and go for full dontgiveadamnanymore godhead had been caused partially if not principally by their frustration and revulsion at the incorrigible ghastliness of affront nature had never been either fully accepted or convincingly refuted whatever in the end with a deal of arm and tentacle twisting some deftly managed suitabletechnology donation through what the affront intelligence regiment still gleefully but naively thought was some really neat hightech theft on their part the occasional instance of knocking heads together or whatever anatomical feature was considered appropriate and a hefty amount of naked bribery woefully inelegant to the refined intellect of the average culture mind their tastes generally ran to far more rarefied forms of chicanery but undeniably effective the affront had kicking and screaming at times admittedly finally been more or less persuaded to join the great commonality of the galactic metacivilisation they had agreed to abide by its rules almost all the time and had grudgingly accepted that other beings beside themselves might have rights or at least tolerably excusable desires such as those concerning life liberty selfdetermination and so on which occasionally might even override the selfevidently perfectly natural demonstrably just and indeed arguably even sacred affronter prerogative to go wherever they wanted and do whatever they damn well pleased preferably while having a bit of fun with the locals at the same time all that however represented only a partial solution to the least vexing part of the problem if the affront had been simply one more expansionist species of callously immature but technologically localised adventurers with bad contact manners the problem they represented to the culture would have subsided to the sort of level that would have gone more or less unnoticed they would have become just another part of the general clutter of inventively obdurate species struggling to express themselves in the vast emptiness that was the galaxy the problem was rooted deeper however it went back further it was more intrinsic the problem was that the affront had spent uncounted millennia long before theyd even got off their own fogbound moonplanet tinkering with and carefully altering the flora and especially the fauna of that environment they had discovered at a relatively early point in their development how to change the genetic makeup of both their own inheritance which almost by definition needed little further amendment given their manifest superiority and that of the creatures with whom they shared their home world those creatures had all accordingly been amended as the affront saw fit for their own amusement and delight the result was what one culture mind had described as a kind of selfperpetuating neverending holocaust of pain and fear affronter society rested on a huge base of ruthlessly exploited juvenile geldings and a subclass of oppressed females who unless born to the highest families and not always even then could count themselves lucky if they were only raped by the males from their own tribe it was generally regarded as significant within the culture if nowhere else that one of the few aspects of their own genetic inheritance with which the affront had deemed it desirable to meddle had been in the matter of making the act of sex a somewhat less pleasurable and considerably more painful act for their females than their basic genetic legacy required the better it was claimed to further the considered good of the species rather than the impetuously selfish pleasure of the individual when an affronter went hunting for the artificially fattened treehurdlers limbcroppers paralice or skinstrippers that were their favoured prey it was in a soarchariot pushed by the animals called swiftwings which lived in a state of perpetual dread their nervous systems and pheromone receptors painstakingly tuned to react with ever increasing levels of dread and the urge to escape as their masters became more and more excited and so exuded more of the relevant odours the hunted animals themselves were artificially terrified as well just by the very appearance of the affronters and so driven to ever more desperate manoeuvres in their frantic urge to escape when an affronters skin was cleaned it was by the small animals called xysters whose diligence had been vastly improved by giving them such a frenetic hunger for an affronters dead skin cells that unless they were overcome by exhaustion they were prone to bloating themselves literally to the point of bursting even the affronts standard domesticated food animals had long since been declared as tasting much more interesting when they betrayed the signs of having been severely stressed and so had also been altered to such a pitch of highly strung anxiety and husbanded in conditions diligently contrived to intensify the effect that they inevitably produced what any affronter worth his methylacetylene would agree was the most inspiringly tasty meat this side of an event horizon the examples went on in fact reviewing their society it was more or less impossible to avoid manifestations of the affronters deliberate even artistic use of genetic manipulation to produce through a kind of ebulliently misplaced selfishness which to them was indistinguishable from genuine altruism the sort of result it took most societies paroxysms of selfdestructive wretchedness to generate hearty but horrible that was the affront progress through pain it was an affronter saying genarhofoen had even heard fivetide say it he couldnt recall exactly but it had probably been followed by a bellowed ho ho ho the affront appalled the culture they appeared so unamendable their attitude and their abominable morality seemed so secured against remedy the culture had offered to provide machines to do the kind of jobs the juvenile castrati did but the affront just laughed why they could quite easily build machines of their own but where was the honour in being served by a mere machine similarly the cultures attempts to persuade the affront that there were other ways to control fertility and familial inheritance besides those which relied on the virtual imprisonment genetic mutilation and organised violation of their females or to consume vatgrown meat better if anything than the real thing or to offer nonsentient versions of their hunting animals all met with equally derisive if brusquely goodhumoured dismissals still genarhofoen liked them and had come even to admire them for their vivacity and enthusiasm he had never really subscribed to the standard culture belief that any form of suffering was intrinsically bad he accepted that a degree of exploitation was inevitable in a developing culture and leant towards the school of thought which held that evolution or at least evolutionary pressures ought to continue within and around a civilised species rather than as the culture had done choosing to replace evolution with a kind of democratically agreed physiological stasisplusoptionlist while handing over the real control of ones society to machines it was not that genarhofoen hated the culture or particularly wished it ill in its present form he was deeply satisfied that he had been born into it and not some other humanoid species where you suffered procreated and died and that was about it he just didnt feel at home in the culture all the time it was a motherland he wanted to leave and yet know he could always return to if he wanted he wanted to experience life as an affronter and not just in some simulation however accurate plus he wanted to go somewhere the culture had never been and well explore neither ambition seemed to him all that much to ask but hed been thwarted in both desires until now hed thought hed detected movement on the affronter side of things before this sleeper business had come up but now if all concerned were to be believed he could more or less have whatever he wanted no strings attached he found this suspicious in itself special circumstances was not notorious for its desire to issue blank cheques to anyone he wondered if he was being paranoid or had just been living with the affront for too long none of his predecessors had lasted longer than a hundred days and hed been here nearly two years already either way he was being cautious he had asked around he still had some replies to receive they should be waiting for him when he arrived at tier but so far everything seemed to tally he had also asked to speak to a representation of the desert class msv not invented here the ship acting as incident coordinator for all this again this ought to happen on tier and hed looked up the crafts own history in the modules archives and transferred the results to the suits own ai the desert class had been the first type of general systems vehicle the culture had constructed providing the original template for the very large fast selfsufficient ship concept at threeandabit klicks in length it was tiny by todays standards ships twice its length and eight times its volume were routinely constructed inside gsvs the size of the sleeper service and the whole class had been demoted to medium systems vehicle status but it certainly had the distinction of age the not invented here had been around for nearly two millennia and boasted a long and interesting career coming as close as the cultures distributed and democratic military command structure had allowed to being in advisory control of several fleets in the course of the idiran war it was now in that equivalent of serenely glorious senescence that affected some ancient minds no longer producing many smaller ships taking relatively little to do with contacts normal business and keeping itself relatively sparsely populated it remained nevertheless a full culture ship it hadnt taken a sabbatical gone into a retreat or become an eccentric nor had it joined the culture ulterior the fairly recently fashionable name for the bits of the culture that had split away and werent really fully paidup members any more all the same and despite the fact that the archive entry on the old ship was huge as well as all the naked factual stuff it contained one hundred and three different fulllength biographies of the craft which it would have taken him a couple of years to read genarhofoen couldnt help feeling that there was a slight air of mystery about the old ship it also occurred to him that minds wrote voluminous biographies of each other in order to cover the odd potentially valuable or embarrassing nugget of truth under a mountain of bullshit also included in the archive entries were some fairly wild claims by a few of the smaller more eccentric news and analyses journals and reviews some of them oneperson outfits to the effect that the msv was a member of some shadowy cabal that it was part of a conspiracy of mostly very old craft which stepped in to take control of situations which might threaten the cultures cozy protoimperialist metahegemony situations which proved beyond all doubt that the socalled normal democratic process of general policymaking was a complete and utter ultrastatist sham and the humans and indeed their cousins and fellow dupes in this mindcontrolled plot the drones had even less power than they thought they had in the culture there was quite a lot of stuff like that genarhofoen read it until his head felt as if it was spinning then he stopped there came a point when if a conspiracy was that powerful and subtle it became pointless to worry about it whatever doubtless the old msv was not itself in total command of the situation he was allowing himself to be dragged into but just the tip of the iceberg representing a collection if not a cabal of other interested and experienced minds whod all be having a say in the immediate reaction to the discovery of this artifact near esperi as well as his request for a talk with a personalitystate of the not invented here genarhofoen had sent messages to ships drones and people he knew with sc connections asking them if what hed been told was all true a few of the nearer ones had got replies to him before hed left godshole habitat each confirming that what they had been told of what he was asking about which admittedly varied according to how much whatever collection of minds the not invented here was representing had chosen to tell the individuals concerned the information hed received looked genuine and the deal hed been offered sounded good at any rate by the time hed got to tier and received all his replies he reckoned so many other people and minds not irretrievably complicit with sc would have heard about what hed been offered it would become impossible for sc to wriggle out of its deal with him without losing an unthinkable amount of face he still suspected there was a lot more to this than he was being told and he had no doubt he was and would continue to be both manipulated and used but providing the price they were paying him was right that didnt bother him and at least the job itself sounded simple enough hed taken the precaution of checking up on the story his uncle had told him about the disappearing trillionyearold sun and the orbiting artifact sure enough there it was a semimythological story set way back in the archives one of any number of weirdsounding tales with frustratingly little evidence to back them up certainly nobody seemed able to explain what had happened in this case and of course there was nobody around to ask anymore except for the lady he was travelling to talk to the captain of the good ship problem child had indeed been a woman zreyn tramow honorary contact fleet captain gartkepilesa zreyn enhoff tramow afayaf dam niskatwest to give her her official title and full name the archives held her picture shed looked proud and capable a pale narrow face with closeset eyes centimetreshort blonde hair and thin lips but smiling and with what appeared to him at least to be an intelligent brightness to those eyes he liked the look of her hed wondered what it would be like to have been stored for twoandabit millennia and then be woken up with no body to return to and a man youd never seen before talking to you and trying to steal your soul hed stared at the photograph for a while trying to see behind those clear blue mocking eyes they played another two games of batball fivetide won those as well genarhofoen was quivering with fatigue by the end then it was time to freshen up and head for the officers mess where there was a fulldress uniform celebration dinner that evening because it was commander kindrummer vis birthday the carousing went on long into the night fivetide taught the human some obscene songs genarhofoen responded in kind two atmosphere force wing captains had an only semiserious duel with grater muffs much blood no limbs lost honour satisfied and genarhofoen did a tightrope walk over the commanders table pit while the scratchounds howled beneath the suit swore it hadnt contributed to the feat though he was sure it had steadied him a couple of times however he didnt say anything around them the kiss the blade and its two escorts powered their way through the spaces between the stars heading for tier habitat iv ulver seich woke up in the best possible way she surfaced with a languorous slowness through fuzzy layers of luxurious halfdreams and memories of sweetness sensuality and sheer carnal bliss to find it all merging rather splendidly into reality and what was happening right now she toyed with the idea of pretending she was still asleep but then he must just have touched exactly the right spot and she couldnt help making a noise and moving and clenching and so she rolled over and took his face in her hands and kissed it oh no she croaked laughing dont stop thats a fine way to say good morning nearly afternoon the young man breathed he was called otiel he was tall and very darkskinned and he had fabulously blond hair and a voice that could raise bumps on your skin at a hundred metres or better still millimetres metaphysics student swam a lot and freeclimbed the one shed set her heart on the previous evening the legliker long sensitive fingers hmm really well you know maybe you can say that later but meantime you just keep right on what ulver seich jerked to a sitting position eyes wide open she slapped the young mans hand away and stared wildly around she was in what she thought of as her romantic bed it was more of a chamber really a ruched pavilionceilinged fivemetre crimson hemisphere filled with billowy bolsters and slinky sheets which blended into puffy paddings forming the single wall of the chamber and which swelled out in places to form various projections shelves straps and little seatlike things she had other beds her childhood bed still stuffed with toys her just sleep bed comfy and surrounded by nocturne plants a huge grandly formal and terribly oldfashioned canopied reception bed for when she wanted to receive friends and an oil bed which was basically a fourmetre sphere of warm oils you had to put little noseplug things in and the air was displaced into you not to everybodys taste sadly but very erotic her neural lace had woken up already with the adrenaline rush it told her it was half an hour to noon shit shed thought shed set an alarm to wake her an hour ago shed meant to must have slipped her mind due to the fun hormonal reprioritisation well it happened what otiel said smiling he was looking at her oddly like he was wondering whether this was part of some game twinkle in the eye he reached out for her damn the gravity was still on she commanded the bed controls to switch to onetenth g sorry she said blowing him a kiss as the apparent gravity cut by ninety per cent the padding beneath their bodies suddenly had a lot less weight to support the effect was to produce a very gentle padded pat on the bottom which was enough to send them both floating fractionally upwards he looked surprised it was such a sweet boyish innocent expression she almost stayed but she didnt she jumped out of the bed kicking up through the air and raising her arms above her head to dive through the loose gatherings of the chambers tented ceiling and out into the bedroom beyond arcing out over the padded platform around the bed chamber and falling gently back into the clutches of its standard gravity she ran down the curved steps to the bedroom floor and almost bumped into the drone churt lyne i know she yelled flapping one hand at it it lifted out of her way then turned smoothly and followed her across the floor of the bedroom towards the bathroom its fields formal blue but tinged with a rosy humour ulver broke into a run shed always liked big rooms the bedroom one was twenty metres square and five high one wall was window it looked out onto a tightly curved landscape of fields and wooded hills dotted with towers and ziggurats this was interior space one the central and longest cylinder of a cluster of independently revolving fivekilometre diameter tubes which formed the main living areas in the rock anything i can do the drone asked as ulver ran into the bathroom behind it there was a shout and then a series of curses as the young man tried to exit the bed chamber in the same way ulver had and got the gravitytransition wrong the drone turned briefly towards the disturbance then swivelled back as ulvers voice floated out through the noise of rushing fluids well you could throw him out nicely mind what ulver screamed you get me to ditch a luscious new guy after one night you make me scrap all my engagements for a month and then you wont even let me take a few pets or a couple of pals ulver can i talk to you alone churt lyne said calmly rotating to point at a room off the main gallery no you cant she yelled throwing down the cloak shed been carrying anything you have to say to me you can damn well say in front of my friends they were in the outer gallery of iphetra a long reception area lined with windows and old paintings it looked out to the formal gardens and interior space one beyond a couple of traveltubes waited beyond doors set into the wall full of portraits shed told everybody to rendezvous here shed missed the noon deadline by over an hour but there were certain things about ones toilet that simply couldnt be rushed and as shed told a briefly but fetchingly incandescently furious churt lyne from her milkbath if she was really that important to all these topsecret plans sc had no choice but to wait as a concession to the urgency of the situation she had left her face unadorned tied her hair back into a simple bun and slipped into a conservatively patterned loose pants and jacket combination even choosing her jewellery for the day had taken no more than five minutes the gallery had got quite busy her mother was here tall and tousled in a jellaba three cousins seven aunts and uncles about a dozen friends all houseguests and a little blearyeyed after the graduation party and a couple of houseslaved drones attempting to control the animals a brace of tawny speytlid hunters looking about at everybody and snuffling and slavering with excitement and her three hooded but still restless alseyns which kept stretching their wings and giving their piercing plangent cry another drone waited outside the nearest window with brave her favourite mount saddled up and pawing the ground while the three drones shed decided were the minimum she could manage with were taking care of her luggage trunks which were still appearing from the house lift a tray floated at her side with breakfast shed just started munching on a chislen segment when the drone had told her she had to make this journey alone churt lyne didnt reply in speech instead astonishingly it spoke through her neural lace ulver for pitys sake this is a secret mission for special circumstances not a social outing with your girlfriends and dont secrettalk me ulver hissed through clenched teeth grief thats so rude quite right dear muttered her mother yawning a couple of her friends laughed lightly churt lyne came right up to her until it was almost touching her and then the next thing she knew there was a sort of grey cylinder around her and the machine it stretched from wooden floor to stonecarved ceiling and it was about a metre and a half in diameter neatly enclosing her churt and the tray carrying breakfast she stared at the drone her mouth open eyes wide it had never done anything like this before its aura field had disappeared it hadnt even had the decency to square the field and put the field on a mirror finish at least she could have checked her appearance sorry about this ulver the machine said its voice sounded flat in the narrow cylinder ulver closed her mouth and prodded the field the drone had slung around them it was like touching warm stone ulver the drone said again taking one of her hands in a maniple field i apologise i ought to have made the point earlier i just assumed well never mind im supposed to come with you to tier but not anybody else your friends have to stay here but peis and i always go deep space together and klatsli is my new protege i promised her she could stick around me i cant just abandon her do you have any idea what that could do to her development to her social life people might think ive dumped her besides shes got an utterly exquisite older brother if i you cant take them the drone said loudly theyre not included in the invitation i heard what you said yesterday you know ulver said shaking her head and leaning forward at the drone keep it secret i havent told them where were going thats not the point when i said dont tell a soul i meant dont tell a soul youre going not dont tell a soul exactly where youre going she laughed throwing her head back churt real space here my diary is a public document hadnt you noticed there are at least three channels devoted to me all run by rather desperate young men admittedly but nevertheless i cant change my eye colour without anybody on the rock who follows fashion knowing about it within the hour i cant just disappear are you mad and i dont think the animals can come either churt lyne said smoothly ignoring her question the protira certainly cant there isnt room on the ship isnt room she roared what size is this thing are you sure its safe warships dont have stables ulver its an ex war ship she exclaimed waving her arms around ow she sucked at the knuckle shed hit against the field cylinder sorry but still what about my clothes a cabin full of clothes is perfectly all right though i dont know for whose benefit youre going to be wearing them what about when i get to tier she cried what about this guy im not supposed to fuck am i supposed to just wander past him naked take two roomsful three clothes are not a problem and you can pick up more when you get there no wait a minute i know how long it takes you to choose new clothes just take what you want four cabins there but my friends tell you what ill show you the space youve got to work with okay oh okay she said shaking her head and sighing heavily the drone fed convincinglooking pictures of the exwarships interior into ulvers brain through the neural lace she caught her breath her eyes were wide when the display stopped she stared at the drone the rooms she exclaimed the cabins theyre so small quite still think you want to take your friends she thought for a second yes she yelled thumping a fist on the little tray floating at her side it wobbled trying not to spill the fruit juice itd be cozy what if you fall out that stopped her for a moment she tapped her lips with one finger frowning into space she shrugged i can cut people dead in a traveltube churt i can ostracise people in the same bed she leant towards the machine again then glanced round at the grey walls of the field cylinder i can ostracise people in something this big she said pointedly her hands on her hips she put her head back narrowed her eyes and lowered her voice i could just refuse to go you know you could the machine said with a pronounced sigh but youd never get into contact and sc would be forced to try and get a double a synthetic entity to impersonate this woman on tier the authorities there wouldnt be amused if they found out she gazed levelly at the machine for a moment she sighed and shook her head bugger she breathed snatching the glass of fruit juice from the floating tray and looking in distaste at where the juice had run down the outside of the glass i hate this acting adult shit she knocked the juice back set the glass back down and licked her lips okay lets go lets go the goodbyes took a while churt lyne glowed greyer and greyer with frustration until it turned into a sort of offblack sphere then it dropped its aura field altogether and sped out of the nearest opened window it raced around in the air outside for a while a couple of sonic booms nearly had the mounts bolting eventually though ulver had said her farewells decided to leave all her animals and two trunks of clothes behind and then having remained serene in the midst of much hullabaloo and some tears from klatsli entered a traveltube with a frostily blue churt lyne and was taken to the forward docks and a big brightly lit hangar where the psychopath class exrapid offensive unit frank exchange of views was waiting for her ulver laughed it looks she snorted like a dildo thats appropriate churt lyne said armed it can fuck solar systems she remembered when she was a little girl and had stood on a bridge over a gorge in one of the other interior spaces she had a stone in her hand and her mother had held her up to the bridge parapet so that she could look over the edge and drop the stone into the water below shed held the stone it was about the same size as her little fist right up to one eye and closed her other eye so that the dark stone had blotted out everything else she could see then shed let it go she and churt lyne stood in the ships tiny hangar area surrounded by her cases bags and trunks as well as a deal of plain but somehow menacinglooking bits and pieces of military equipment the way that stone had fallen towards the dark water then shrinking and shrinking was very like the way phage rock fell silently away from the old warship now this time of course there was no splash when phage had entirely disappeared she switched out of the view her neural lace had imported into her head and turned to the drone thinking a thought that would have occurred to her a lot earlier she hoped if shed been sober and unimpassioned over the last day when was this ship sent to phage churt and from where why dont you ask it yourself it said turning to indicate a small drone approaching over the jumble of equipment churt she asked via the neural lace yes damn i was hoping the ships rep might be a dazzling handsome young man instead its something that looks like a churt lyne interrupted ulver you are aware that the ship itself acts as exchange hub for these communications oh dear she thought and felt herself colour as the little drone approached she smiled broadly at it no offence she said none taken said the little machine as it came to a halt in front of her it had a reedy but reasonably melodious voice for the record she said still smiling and still blushing i thought you looked a bit like a jewellery box could have been worse chipped in churt lyne you should hear what she calls me sometimes the little drones snout dipped once in a sort of bow thats quite all right ms seich it said delighted to meet you allow me to welcome you aboard the very fast picket frank exchange of views thank you she said also nodding slowly i was just asking my friend where youd come from and when youd been dispatched i didnt come from anywhere except phage the ship told her she felt her eyes widen really really it said laconically and the answer to your next three questions id guess are because i was very well hidden and thats actually quite easy in a conglomeration of matter the size of phage getting on for five hundred years and there are another fifteen like me back home i trust you are reassured rather than shocked and that we may rely on your discretion in the future oh golly absolutely she said nodding and felt half inclined to click her heels and salute v dajeil had been spending a lot more time with the beasts she swam with the great fish and the seaevolved mammals and reptiles she donned a flyer suit and cruised high above the sea with her wide wings extended alongside the dirigible creatures in the calm currents of air and the cloud layers and she donned a full gelfield suit with a secondary ag unit and carved her way amongst the poison gases the acid clouds and the storm bands of the upper atmosphere surrounded by noxiousness and the ferocious beauty of the ecosystem there she even spent some time walking in the ships topside parks the nature reserves which the sleeper service had possessed even when it had been a regular wellbehaved gsv and diligent member of the contact section the parks complete landscapes with hills forests plains river and lake systems and the remains of small resort villages and hotels covered all the great ships flat top surfaces and together measured over eight hundred square kilometres with the humans gone from the ship there were fairly large populations of land animals in the park lands including grazers predators and scavengers shed never really paid any of them much attention her interests had always been with the larger buoyant animals of the fluid environments but now that they were all likely to suffer the same exile or unconsciousness as the rest she had started to take a belated almost guilty interest in them as though she thought ruefully her attention bestowed some special significance on the behaviour she witnessed or meant anything at all to the creatures concerned amorphia did not come for its regular visit another couple of days passed when the avatar came to her again she had been swimming with the purplewinged triangular rays in the shallow part of the sea extending beyond the sheer threekilometre cliff which was the rear of the craft returning she had taken the flyer which the ship habitually put at her disposal but asked it to drop her at the top of the scree slope beneath the cliff facing the tower it was a bright cold day and the air tasted sharp this part of the ships environment was cycling towards winter all the trees save for a few everblues had lost their leaves and soon the snows would come the air was very clear and from the top of the scree slope she could see the edge islands thirty kilometres away out close to where the inner containment field of the ship came down like a wall across the sea she had scrambled down the scree in small rattles of stones like dry fanning rivers of pebbles and dust she had long ago learned how to use her altered centre of gravity to her advantage in this sort of adventure and had never yet fallen badly she got to the bottom her heart beating hard her leg muscles warm with the effort expended and her skin bright with sweat she walked quickly back through the salt marsh along the paths the ship had fashioned for her the sunline was near setting when she returned to the tower breathless and still perspiring she took a shower and was sitting by the log fire the tower had lit for her letting her hair dry naturally when gravious the black bird rapped once on the window and then disappeared again she pulled her robe tighter about her as the tall darkdressed figure of amorphia climbed the stairs and entered the room amorphia she said tucking her wet hair into the hood of the robe hello can i get you anything no no thank you the avatar said looking nervously around the circular living room dajeil indicated a chair while she sat on a couch by the fire please she pulled her legs up underneath her so what brings you here today i the avatar began then stopped and pulled at its lower lip with its fingers well it seems it started again then hesitated once more it took a breath the time it said then stopped looking confused the time dajeil gelian said its its come amorphia said and looked ashamed for the changes you talked about yes the avatar said sounding relieved yes for the changes they have to start now in fact they have already begun the roundingup of the creatures comes first and the it looked unsure again and frowned deeply the the delandscaping it gulped it tripped up on the next words in its rush to say them the ungeometri the ungeomorphologising the the pristinisation it said almost shouting dajeil smiled trying not to show the alarm she felt i see she said slowly so it is all definitely going to happen yes amorphia said breathing heavily yes it is and i will have to leave the ship yes youll have to leave the ship i im sorry the avatar looked suddenly crestfallen where am i to go where confused where are you going to stop or where will i be taken is it another ship or a habitat or an o or a planet a rock what i the avatar frowned again the ship does not know yet it said things are being worked out dajeil looked at amorphia for a while her hands absently stroking the bulge of her belly under her robe what is happening amorphia she asked keeping her voice soft why is all this taking place i cant there is no need no need for you to know the avatar said hesitantly it looked exasperated and shook its head as though angry gaze flicking up and around the room as though seeking something finally it looked back at her i might be able to tell you more later if you will agree to stay on board until until a time comes when i can only evacuate you by another vessel she smiled that sounds like no great hardship does that mean i can stay here longer not here the tower and everything else will have gone it will mean living inside inside the gsv dajeil shrugged all right i suppose i can suffer that when will that have to happen in a day or two amorphia said then the avatar looked concerned and sat forward on the seat there its possible its possible there might be a slightly increased risk to you staying aboard until then the ship will do all it can to minimise that of course but the possibility exists and it might be amorphias head shook suddenly i the ship would like you to remain on board if possible until then it might be important good the avatar looked as though it had startled itself dajeil suddenly recalled having held a tiny baby when it had farted loudly the look of utter blinking surprise on its face was not dissimilar to that on amorphias face now dajeil choked back an urge to laugh and it disappeared anyway when as though prompted by the thought her child kicked within her she clamped a hand to her belly yes amorphia said nodding vigorously it would be good if you stayed on board good might come of it altogether it sat staring at her panting as though from exertion then i had better stay hadnt i dajeil said again keeping her voice steady and calm yes said the avatar yes id appreciate that thank you it stood up suddenly from the seat as though released by a spring within dajeil was startled she almost jumped i must go now amorphia said dajeil swung her legs out and stood too more slowly very well she said as the avatar made its way to the staircase set onto the wall of the tower i hope youll tell me more later of course the avatar mumbled then it turned and bowed quickly and was gone bootsteps clattering down the stairs the door slammed some moments later dajeil gelian climbed the steps to the parapet of the tower a breeze caught her robes hood and spilled her heavy stillwet hair out and down the sunline had set throwing highlights of gold and ruby light across the sky and turning the starboard horizon into a fuzzy violet border the wind stiffened it felt cold amorphia was not walking back this evening after the creature had hurried up the narrow path through the towers walled garden and out of the landgate it just rose up into the air without any obvious ag pack or flying suit and then accelerated through the air in a dark thin blur curving through the air to disappear a few seconds later over the edge of the cliff beyond dajeil looked up there were tears in her eyes which annoyed her she sniffed them back angrily and wiped her cheeks a few blinks and the view of the sky was steady and unobscured again it had indeed already begun a flight of the dirigible creatures were dropping down from the redspeckled clouds above her heading for the cliffs looking closely she could see the accompanying drones that were their herders doubtless the same scene was being repeated at this moment both beneath the grey surface of the sea on the far side of the tower as well as above in the region of furious heat and crushing pressure that was the gasgiant environment the dirigible creatures hesitated in the skies above in front of them a whole area of the cliff perhaps a kilometre across and half that in height simply folded in on itself in four parcelneat sections and disappeared backwards into four huge long glowing halls the reassured dirigible creatures were shepherded towards one of the opened bays elsewhere other parts of the cliffs were performing similar tricks lights sparkled in the spaces revealed the entire swathe of greybrown scree easily twenty kilometres across and a hundred metres in both depth and height was folding and tipping in eight gigantic vs and channelling several billion tonnes of realenough rock into eight presumably reinforced ship bays doubtless to undergo whatever transformational process was in store for the sea and the gasgiant atmosphere a titanic boneresounding tremor shook the ground and rumbled over the tower while huge clouds of dust leapt billowing into the chilly air as the rock disappeared dajeil shook her head her wet hair flapping on the sodden shoulders of her robe then walked towards the doorway which led to the rest of the tower intending to retreat there before the clouds of stone dust arrived the black bird gravious made to settle on her shoulder she shooed it off and it landed flapping uproariously on the edge of the opened trap door my tree it screamed hopping from leg to leg my tree theyve i my its gone too bad she said the sound of another great tumble of falling rock split the skies stay wherever it puts me she told the bird if itll let you now get out of my way but my food for the winter its gone winter has gone you stupid bird she told it the black bird stopped moving and just perched there head thrown forward and to one side right eye staring at her as though trying to catch some more meaningful echo of what she had just told it oh dont worry she said im sure youll be accommodated she waved it off its perch and it flapped noisily away a last earthquake of sound rolled under and over the tower the woman dajeil gelian looked round at the twilightlit rolling grey dust clouds to see the light from opened bays beyond shine through as the pretence at natural form was dispensed with and the overall shape of the crafts fabric began to reveal itself the culture general systems vehicle sleeper service no longer just her gallant protector and a grossly overspecified mobile game reserve it seemed that the great ship had finally found something to become involved with which was more in keeping with the extent of its powers she wished it well though with trepidation the sea like stone she thought she turned and stepped down into the warmth of the tower patting the bulge that was her sleeping undreaming child a stern winter indeed harder than any of us had anticipated vi leffid ispanteli was trying desperately to remember the name of the lass he was with geltry usper stemli oh yes yes ffffuck gods yes more more now yes there there yes thats oohhh soli getrin ayscoe oh fuck there more harder right right now aah selas serayer grief how ungallant of him oh sweet providence oh fuck no wonder he couldnt think of her name the girl was kicking up such a racket he was surprised he could think at all still a chap shouldnt grumble he supposed always nice to be appreciated even if it was the yacht that was doing most of the work the diminutive hire yacht continued to shudder and buck beneath them spiralling and curving through space a few hundred kilometres away from the huge stepped world that was tier leffid had used these little yachts for this sort of thing before if you fed a nicely jagged course into their computers theyd do most of the bumping and grinding for you while leaving just enough apparent gravity to brace oneself without leaving one feeling terribly heavy programming in the odd poweroff interval gave moments of delicious freefall and drew the small craft further away from the great world so that gradually the view beyond the viewing ports increased in majesty as more and more of the conical habitat was revealed turning slowly and glittering in the light of the systems sun altogether a wonderful way of having sex really providing one found a suitable and willing partner aw aw aaawww force push push push yes she held his thrusting hips smoothed his feathered scalp and used her other hand turned out to stroke his lower belly her huge dark eyes glittered myriad tiny lights sparkling somewhere inside them in pulsing vortexes of colour and intensity that varied charmingly with the intensity of her pleasure come on yes come on up further further aaarrrhh dammit all what was her name geldri shokas esiel grief what if it wasnt even a culture name hed been certain it was but now he was starting to think maybe it wasnt after all that made it even more difficult more excusable maybe too but certainly more difficult too theyd met at the homomdan ambassadors party to celebrate the start of the sixhundred and fortyfifth festival of tier hed resolved to have his neural lace removed for the month of the festival deciding that as this years theme was primitivism he ought to give up some aspect of his amendments the neural lace had been his choice because although there was no physical alteration and he looked just the same to everybody else hed reckoned hed feel more different which he did it was oddly liberating to have to ask things or people for information and not know precisely what the time was and where he was located in the habitat but it also meant that he was forced to rely on his own memory for things like peoples names and how imperfect was the unassisted human memory hed forgotten hed even thought of having his wings removed too at least partly to show that he was taking part in the spirit of the festival but in the end hed stuck with them probably just as well this girl had made a big thing about the wings headed straight for him masked body glittering she was nearly as tall as he was perfectly proportioned and she had four arms a drink in each hand too his kind of female hed decided instantly even as she was looking admiringly at his folded snowwhite wings she wore some sort of gelsuit basically deep blue but covered with a pattern like gold wire wrapped all over it and dotted with little diamonds of contrasting subtly glowing red her whiskered mask was porcelainbone studded with rubies and finished with iridescent badra feathers stunning perfume she handed him a glass and took off her mask to reveal eyes the size of opened mouths eyes softly blackly featureless in the lustrous lights of the vibrantly decorated dome until hed looked carefully and seen the tiny hints of lights within their curved surfaces the gelfield suit covered her everywhere except those heavily altered eyes and a small hole at the back of her head where a plait of long shiningly auburn hair spilled out wrapped in gold wire it ended at the small of her back and was tethered to the suit there shed said her first name the gelsuits lips had parted to show white teeth and a pink tongue leffid hed replied bowing deeply but watching her face as best he could while he did so shed looked up at his wings as theyd risen up and towards her over the plain black robe hed worn hed seen her take a deep breath the lights in her eyes had sparkled brightly ahha hed thought the homomdan ambassador had turned the riotously decorated stadiumsized bowl that was her residential quarters into an oldfashioned funfair for the party they had wandered through the acts tents and rides he and she talking small talk passing comment on other people they passed celebrating the refreshing absence of drones at the party discussing the merits of whirligigs shubblebubs helterskelters iceflumes quittletraps slicicles boingbraces airblows tramplescups and bodyflaggers and bemoaning the sheer pointlessness of interspecies funnyface competitions she was on an improving tour from her home orbital cruising and learning with a party of friends on a semieccentric ship that would be here as long as the festival lasted one of her aunts had some contact contacts and had swung an invitation to the ambassadors celebration her friends were so jealous he guessed she was still in her teens though she moved with the easy grace of somebody older and her conversation was more intelligent and even shrewder than hed have expected he was used to being able to almost switch off talking to most teenagers but he was having to race after her meanings and allusions at time were teenagers getting even smarter maybe he was just getting old no matter she obviously liked the wings she asked to stroke them he told her he was a resident of tier culture or exculture depending how you wanted to look at it it wasnt something he bothered about though he supposed if forced he felt more loyalty to tier where hed lived for twenty years than to the culture where hed lived for the rest of his life in the ahforgetlt tendency that was not the culture proper which the tendency regarded as being far too serious and not nearly as dedicated to hedonistic pursuits as it ought to be hed first come here as part of a tendency cultural mission but stayed when the rest returned back to their home orbital hed thought about saying well actually i was in the tendencys equivalent of special circumstances kind of a spy really and i know lots of secret codes and stuff but that probably wasnt the sort of line that would work with a sophisticated girl like this oh much older than her quite middleaged at one hundred and forty well that was kind of her to say so yes the wings worked in anything less than standard gravity had them since he was thirty he lived on an air level here with gravity huge webtrees up there some people lived in their hollowedout fruit husks though he preferred a sort of wispy housething made from sheets of chaltressor silk stretched over hipressure thinbooms oh yes shed be very welcome to see it had she seen much of tier arrived yesterday such good timing for the festival hed love to be her guide why not now why not they could hire a yacht first though they would go and make their apologies to the ambassador of course he and she were old pals something to tell that aunt of hers and theyd call by the cruise ship bring the others oh just a little camera drone well why not yes tiers rules could be tiresome at times couldnt they yes yes yeeehhhsss that was him shed given one final earsplitting shriek and then gone limp with just a huge grin on her gelsuited face shed kept it on another aperture had obligingly opened time to bring this bout to a climax the yacht had served him before it heard what he said and took that as a signal to cut engines and go into freefall he loved technology the neural lace would have handled his orgasm sequence better controlling the flow of secretions from his drug glands so that they more precisely matched and enhanced the extended humanbasic physiological process taking place but it was still pretty damn good all the same his didnt last quite as long as hers obviously had but hed put it at over a minute easily he floated still joined to her watching the smile on her face and the tiny dim lights in the huge dark eyes her fabulous chest heaved now and again her four arms waved round with a graceful undersea motion after a while one of her hands went to the nape of her neck she took the gelsuits head off and let it float free the deep dark eyes stayed the rest of her face was brown flushed with red and quite beautiful he smiled at her she smiled back with the gelsuits head removed a little sweat beaded on her forehead and top lip he gently fanned her face with his wings bringing them sweeping softly from behind his shoulders and then back the huge eyes regarded him for a while then she put her head back stretching and sighing a couple of pink cushions floated past bumping into her floating arms and ricocheting slowly away the yachts hirelimit warning chimed it wasnt allowed to stray too far from tier hed already told it to cruise back in when it hit the limit it duly fired its engines and they were pressed back into the slickly warm surfaces of the couches and cushions in a delicious tangle of limbs for a while the girl wriggled with a succulent slowness eyes quite dark now he looked over to one side and saw the little camera drone shed brought sitting on the ledge under one of the diamond view ports its one beady eye still fastened on the two of them he winked at it something moved outside in the darkness amongst the slow wheeling turn of stars he watched it for a while the yacht murmured engine firing quietly some apparent gravity stuck him and the girl to the ceiling for a second or two then weightlessness returned the girl made a couple of small noises that might have indicated she was asleep and seemed to relax inside letting go of him he pulled her closer with his arms while his wings beat once twice bringing them both closer to the view port outside close by a ship was passing by heading inbound on its final approach for tier they must have been almost directly in its path the yachts engineburn had been avoidance action leffid looked down at the sleeping girl wondering if he ought to wake her so that she could watch there was something magical about seeing this great craft going sliding silently by its dark spectacularly embellished hull slicing space just a hundred metres away he had an idea and grinned to himself and stretched out his hand to take the little camera drone currently getting a fine view of the lasss backside and his balls and turn it round point it out the view port at the passing ship so that she would have a surprise when she watched her recording but then something else caught his attention and his hand never did touch the camera drone instead he stared out of the port his eyes fastened on a section of the vessels hull the ship passed on by he kept staring out into space the girl sighed and moved two of her arms went out and drew his face towards hers she squeezed him from inside wooooo she breathed and kissed him their first real kiss without the gelsuit over her face eyes still enchanting oceanically deep and enchanting estray her name was estray of course common enough name for an uncommonly attractive girl here for a month eh leffid congratulated himself this could end up being a good festival they started caressing each other again it was just as good as the first time but no better because he still wasnt able to give the proceedings his full attention now instead of trying to remember what the girls name was he couldnt stop wondering why there was an elencher emergency message spattered minutely across the scarhull of an affronter light cruiser pittance i ulver seich sobbed into her pillow she had felt bad before her mother had refused her something some lad had unbelievably preferred somebody else to her admittedly very rare she had felt terribly alone exposed and vulnerable the first time she had camped out under the stars on a planet and various pets had died but nothing as terrible as this she raised her tearmarked face up from the sodden pillow and looked again at her reflection in the reverser field on the walkin across the horribly small cabin she saw her face again and howled with anguish burying her head in the pillow once again and bashing her feet up and down on the undercover which wobbled like a jelly in the ag field trying to compensate her face had been altered while shed slept during the night one day out from phage her face her beautiful heartshaped heartwinning heartmelting heartbreaking face the face which she had sat and gazed at in a mirror or a reverser field for hours at a time on occasion when shed been old enough for her drug glands to come on line and young enough to experiment with them the face she had gazed at and gazed at not because she was stoned but because she was just so damned lovely her face had been made to look like somebody elses and there was worse it might be hurting a little now if she wasnt keeping the pain turned off but that wasnt what mattered what mattered was that her face was a puffy swollen and discoloured after the nanotechs had done their work b not her own any longer and c older the woman she was supposed to look like was older than she much older sixty years older people claimed that nobody in the culture really changed much in appearance between about twentyfive and two hundred and fifty then there was a slow but sure ageing to the threefifty four hundred mark by which time your hair would be white or gone your skin would be wrinkled like some basics scrotum and your tits swinging round your bellybutton ugh but she had always been able to tell how old people were she was rarely more than five or ten years out never more than twenty at any rate and she could see how old she was now even beneath the puffiness and shadowy bruising she was seeing how she would look when she was older and it didnt matter that it wasnt her own face it didnt matter that she would probably look much better than this by the time she was in her mideighties she had pictures of per cent certain projections prepared for her by the house ai which showed exactly how shed look at every decade for two centuries ahead and they looked great what mattered was that she looked old and dowdy and that would make her feel old and dowdy and therefore that would make her behave old and dowdy and that feeling and that way of behaving and therefore that look might not go away when she was returned to her normal her natural her own appearance this wasnt turning out as shed hoped at all no friends no pets no fun and the more she thought about it the riskier it all might be the less certain she was what she was getting into this whole thing was supposed to be an adventure but this part on the ship was just boring and so would the return journey be as well and in the middle lay whoknewwhat everybody knew how devious sc was what were they really up to what did they really want her to do even if it did turn out to be somehow exciting and even fun she wouldnt be allowed to tell anybody about it and where was the point in fun if you couldnt talk about it later of course she could tell other people but then she wouldnt be able to stay in contact hell churt was being ambiguous about whether she was in it now or not well was she or wasnt she was this a real contact and even sc mission she was engaged in as shed dreamed of fantasised about since early childhood or some extracurricular wheeze even a test of some sort she bit the pillow and the particular texture of the fabric in her mouth and between her teeth and the sensation of her face being puffedup while her eyes stung with tears took her back to childhood again she raised her head licking her top lip clear of the salty fluid and then snorted and sniffed back both the tears and the snot that was filling her nose she thought about glanding some calm but decided not to she did some deep breathing then swivelled round on the bed and sat up and looked at herself in the reverser raising her chin at the hideous image it showed and sniffing again and wiping her face with her hands and swallowing hard and fluffing out her hair at least it could stay as it was sniffing again and stared herself in the eyes and forbade herself to cry or look away after a few minutes her cheeks had dried and her eyes were coming clear again losing their red puffiness she was still abhorrently ugly and even disfigured by her own high standards but she was not a child and she was still the same person inside ah well she supposed a little suffering might do her some good she had always been pampered all her hardships had been selfinflicted and recreational in the past she had gone hungry and unwashed when hiking somewhere primitive but there had always been food at the end of the day and a shower or at the very least a peelspray to remove the grime and sweat even the pain of what had felt on occasion like an irretrievably broken heart had consistently proved less lasting than shed initially imagined and expected the revelation that a boys taste was so grotesquely deficient he could prefer somebody else to her always reduced both the intensity and the duration of the anguish her heart demanded be endured to mark such a loss of regard she had always known there were too few real challenges in her life too few genuine risks it had all been too easy even by culture standards while her lifestyle and material circumstances in phage had been no different from that of any other person her age it was true that just because the culture was so determinedly egalitarian what little hierarchic instinct remained in the population of the rock manifested itself in the ascription of a certain cachet to belonging to one of the founder families in a society in which it was possible to look however one wanted to look acquire any talent one wished to acquire and have access to as much property as one might desire it was generally accepted that the only attributes which possessed that particular quality of interest which derives solely from their being difficult to attain were entry into contact and special circumstances or having some familial link with the cultures early days even the most famous and gifted of artists whether their talents were congenital or acquired were not regarded in quite the same hallowed light as contact members and somewhere really old like phage direct descendants of founders being a famous artist in the culture meant at best it was accepted you must possess a certain gritty determination at worst it was generally seen as pointing to a pitiably archaic form of insecurity and a rather childish desire to show off when there were almost no distinctions to be drawn between peoples social standing the tiny differences that did exist became all the more important to those who cared ulvers feelings about her familys ancient name were mostly negative admittedly possessing an old name meant some people were prepared to make an advance on any respect they might come to feel was rightly your due but on the other hand ulver wanted to be admired worshipped and lusted after for herself just her just this current collection of cells right here with no reference to the inheritance those cells carried and what was the point of having what was sometimes insultingly referred to as an advantage in life if it couldnt even smooth your way into contact if anything it had been hinted it was a disadvantage she would have to do better than the average person she would have to be so completely utterly demonstrably perfect for the contact section that there could be no question of anybody ever thinking shed got in because the people and machines on the admissions board knew the name seich from their history lessons well churt had been right this was her big chance she had been and would be unamendedly beautiful she was intelligent charming and attractive and she had common sense by the bucketload but she couldnt expect to breeze this the way she had breezed everything else in her life so far shed work at it shed study shed be diligent assiduous and industrious and all the other things shed worked so hard at not being while ensuring that her university results had sparkled as brilliantly as her social life maybe she had been a spoiled brat maybe she still was a spoiled brat but she was a ruthlessly determined spoiled brat and if that ruthless determination dictated ditching spoiled brathood then out it would go faster than you could say bye ulver dried her eyes collected herself still without the help of any glandular secretions then got up and left the cabin she would sit in the lounge where there was more space and there she would find out all she could about tier this man genarhofoen and anything else that might be relevant to what they wanted her to do ii leffid ispanteli eased himself into the seat beside the viceconsul for the ahforgetlt tendency carefully hooking his wings over the seat back and smiling at the viceconsul who regarded him with that particular kind of vacant look people tend to assume when theyre communicating by neural lace leffid held up his hand words im afraid lellius he said had my lace removed for the festival very primitive viceconsul lellius said approvingly nodding gravely and returning his attention to the race they were sitting in a carousel suspended beneath a vast carbontubed structure sculpted in the image of a web tree the thousands of viewing carousels dangled like fruit from the canopy and were multifariously connected by a secondary web of delicate swaying cable bridges the view beneath and to either side was of a series of great steps of stone dotted with vegetation and moving figures it was very like looking at an ancient amphitheatre which had been lifted from the horizontal to the vertical and each of whose seat levels was able to rotate independently the moving figures were ysnermistretl combinations the ysners were the huge twolegged flightless and almost brainless birds doing the running while their thinking was done by the mistretl jockey each carried on its back mistretls were tiny and almost helpless but brainy simians and the combination of one of them per ysner was a naturally occurring one from a planet in the lower leaf spiral ysnermistretl races had been a part of life on tier for millennia and running them on a giant mandala two kilometres across composed of steps or levels all rotating at different speeds had been traditional for most of that time the huge slowly turning racecourse looked a little like tier itself which took its name from its shape tier was a stepped habitat its nine levels all revolved at the same speed but that meant that the outer tiers possessed greater apparent gravity than those nearer the centre the levels themselves were sectioned into compartments up to hundreds of kilometres long and filled with atmospheres of different types and held at different temperatures while a stunningly complicated and dazzlingly beautiful array of mirrors and mirrorfields situated within the staggered cone of the worlds axis provided amounts of sunlight precisely timed attenuated and where necessary altered in wavelength to mimic the conditions on a hundred different worlds for a hundred different intelligent species this environmental diversity and the civilisational codependence it implied and intermingling it encouraged had been tiers raison dêtre the very foundation of its purpose and fame for the seven thousand years it had existed its original builders were perhaps unknown they were believed to have sublimed shortly after building it leaving behind a species or model depending how you defined these things of biomechanical sintricate which ran and maintained the place were individually dull but collectively highly intelligent took the shape of a small sphere covered with long articulated spines were between half a metre and two metres in size and had seemed to have an intense suspicion of anything possessing less of a biological basis than they did themselves drones and other ais were tolerated on tier but very closely watched followed everywhere and their every communication and even thought monitored minds were immune to this sort of treatment of course but their avatars tended to attract a degree of intense physical observation which bordered on harassment and so they rarely bothered entering the world itself sticking to the outer docks where they were made perfectly welcome and afforded every hospitality tier after all was a statement a treasure a symbol and as such any small discriminatory foibles it chose to display were considered perfectly tolerable the ysnermistretl race track was one level up from the tier where the homomdan mission was housed and three levels down from leffids home circumference leffid the vice consul said he was a rotund massy male of apparently indeterminate species vaguely human in shape but with a triangular head and an eye at each corner his skin was bright red the flowing robes he wore were a vivid but gradually shifting shade of blue he turned his head slightly so that two of his eyes regarded leffid while the third continued to watch the race did i see you at the homomdan do last night i cant remember briefly leffid said i waved hello but you were busy with the ashpartzi delegate viceconsul lellius wheezed with laughter trying to hold the blighter down it was having buoyancy problems inside its new suit automatics werent really up to the job with the ai removed terrible thing when one of these gasgiant floater beasties suffers from flatulence you know leffid recalled that lellius had rather looked as though hed been wrestling with the bowrope for what appeared to be a small airship at the homomdan ambassadors party not as terrible as it must be for the inhabitant of the suit id guess ha indeed lellius chuckled nodding and wheezing may i order you some refreshment no thank you good i have given up emoterkeyed foods and drinks for the duration of the festival and would only be jealous he shook his head i thought primitives were supposed to have more fun but everything i could think of changing the better to partake in the festivals spirit seemed to make life less fun he said then made a tutting noise at something on the race course leffid looked to see one of the ysnermistretl pairs failing to make a jump hitting the ramp just behind and falling down to another level they picked themselves up and ran on but theyd need to be very lucky to win now lellius shook his head and used the flat end of a stylo to smooth a number off the woodbordered wax tablet he held in his broad red hand you winning leffid asked him lellius shook his head and looked sad leffid smiled then made a show of inspecting the race track and the contending ysnermistretl pairs they dont look very festive to me he said i expected something more well festive he concluded lamely i believe the race authorities regard the festival with the same misanthropic dubiety as i lellius said the festival is what two days old leffid nodded and already i am tired of it lellius said scratching behind one of his three ears with the wax tablet stylo i thought of taking a holiday while it was occurring but i am expected to be here of course a month of challenging groundbreaking art and ruthlessly enforced fun lellius shook his head heavily what a prospect leffid put his chin in his cupped hand youve never really been a natural for the ahforgetlt tendency have you lellius i joined hoping it would make me more lellius looked up contemplatively at the broad spread of the tree sculpture hanging above them cavortprone he said and nodded i wished to be more prone to cavorting and so i joined the tendency hoping that the natural hedonism of people like your good self would somehow infect my own more deliberate phlegmatic soul he sighed i still live in hope leffid laughed lightly then looked slowly around you here alone lellius lellius looked thoughtful my incomparably efficient clerical assistant number three visits the latrines i believe he wheezed my wastrel son is probably trying to invent new ways of embarrassing me my mate is half a galaxy away very nearly enough and my current darling stays at home indisposed or rather disposed not to come to what she terms a boring birdandmonkey race he nodded slowly i could reasonably be said to be alone i suppose why do you ask leffid sat a little closer arms on the carousels small table saw something strange last night he said that young thing with the four arms lellius asked at least one eye twinkling i did wonder if any other of her anatomical features were also doubledup your prurience flatters me leffid said ask her nicely and she will probably furnish you with a copy of a recording which proves both our relevant bits were quite singular lellius chuckled and drank from a strawed flask not that then what are we alone leffid asked quietly lellius stared blankly at him for a moment yes my lace is now turned off there is nothing else i know of watching or listening what is this thing you saw ill show you leffid took a napkin from the tables slot and from a pocket in his shirt extracted the terminal he was using instead of the neural lace he looked at the markings on the instrument as though trying to remember something then shrugged and said umm terminal become a pen please leffid wrote on the napkin producing a sequence of seven pendant rhombi each composed of eight dots or tiny circles when hed finished he turned the napkin towards lellius who looked carefully down at it and then equally deliberately up at leffid very pretty he wheezed what is it leffid smiled he tapped the rightmost symbol first its an elench signal because its base eight and arranged in that pattern this first symbol is an emergency distress mark the other six are probably almost certainly by convention a location really lellius did not sound especially impressed and the location of this location about seventythree years into the upper swirl from here oh lellius said with a sort of rumbling noise that probably meant he was surprised just six digits to define such a precise point base twofivesix easy leffid said shrugging his wings but whats interesting is where i saw this signal mmhmm lellius said momentarily distracted by something happening on the race track he took another drink then returned his attention to the other man it was on an affronter light cruiser leffid said quietly burned into its scarhull very lightly very shallowly at an angle across the blades blades lellius asked leffid waved one hand decoration but it was there if i hadnt been very close to the ship in a yacht as it was approaching tier id never have seen it and the intriguing possibility exists of course that the ship doesnt know it bears this message lellius stared at the napkin for a moment he sat back hmm he said mind if i turn on my lace not at all leffid said i already know the ships called the furious purpose and its back here unscheduled in dock b if its a mechanical problem its got i cant imagine its anything to do directly with the scarring as for the location in the signal its about half way between the stars cromphalet iii and esperi slightly closer to esperi and theres nothing there nothing that anybody knows about anyway leffid tapped at the pocket terminal and after some experimentation got the beam to brighten until it ignited the napkin hed written on he let it burn and was about to sweep the ashes into the tables disposal slot when lellius who was slumped back in the seat looking blank reached out one red hand and absently ground the ashes under his palm before scattering them to the breeze they fell floating away from the carousel in an insubstantial cloud towards the seats and private boxes stacked below some minor runninggear problem lellius said the affronter ship he was silent a moment longer the elench may have had a problem he said nodding slowly a clanfleet eight ships left here a hundred days ago to investigate the swirl i remember leffid said there have been lellius paused indications barely even rumours that not all has been right with them well leffid said placing his palms flat on the table and making to rise from his seat it may be nothing but i just thought id mention it kind lellius wheezed nodding not sure what the tendency can do with it last ship we had coming here went sabbatical on us ungrateful cur but we might be able to trade it to the mainland yes the dear old mainland leffid said it was the term the ahforgetlt tendency usually employed to refer to the culture proper he smiled whatever he held his wings away from the seatback as he stood sure you wont stay lellius said blinking we could have a betting competition bet youd win no thanks this evening im playing host to a lady who needs two place settings at a time and i have to go polish my cutlery and make sure my flight feathers are fettled for ruffling ah have armfuls of fun i suspect i shall oh damn lellius said sadly as a great shout went up from below and to most sides the race was over lellius leant over and scratched out another couple of numbers on the wax tablet never mind leffid said patting the viceconsul on his ample shoulder as he headed for the swaying cable bridge that would take him back to the main trunk of the huge artificial tree yes lellius sighed looking at the smudge of ash on his hand im sure therell be another race starting in a while iii the black bird gravious flew slowly across the recreation of the great sea battle of octovelein its shadow falling over the wreckagedotted water the sails and decks of the long wooden ships the soldiers who stood massed on the decks of the larger vessels the sailors who hauled at ropes and sheets the rocketeers who struggled to rig and fire their charges and the bodies floating in the water a brilliant bluewhite sun glared from a violet sky the air was crisscrossed by the smoky trails of the primitive rockets and the sky seemed supported by the great columns of smoke rising from stricken warships and transports the water was dark blue ruffled with waves spattered with the tall feathery plumes of crashing rockets creased white at the stem of each ship and covered in flames where oils had been poured between ships in desperate attempts to prevent boarding the bird flew over the edge of the sea scene where the water ended like a still liquid cliff and the unadorned floor of the general bay resumed just five metres below its surface also covered with what looked like wreckage as though the tide had somehow gone out in this part of the bay but not the other but which on closer inspection proved to be objects parts of ships parts of people which had been in the process of construction the incomplete sea battle filled less than half of the bays sixteen square kilometres this would have been the sleeper services masterwork its definitive statement now it might never be finished the black bird flew on passing a few of the ships drones on the surface of the bay gathering the construction debris and loading it onto an insubstantial conveyor belt which appeared to consist of a thin line of shady air it kept beating its goal lay on the far end of the doubled general bay between this internal section and the bay that opened to the rear of the ship damn the woman for choosing to stay at the bows nearest to where the tower had been bad luck the place it had to be was so close to the stern it had already flown through twentyfive kilometres of interior space down the gigantic dark internal corridor in the centre of the ship between closed bay doors where a few dim lights glowed and utter silence reigned a kilometre of air below its gently flapping wings another above and one to each side the bird had looked about it taking in the huge gloomy volumes and supposing it ought to feel privileged the ship had kept it out of these places for the last forty years restricting it to the upper kilometre of its hull which housed the old accommodation areas and the majority of its storees gravious had senses beyond those normally available to an ordinary animal and it had employed a couple of them in an attempt to probe the bay doors and find out what lay behind them if anything as far as it could tell the thousands of bays were empty that had only taken it as far as the general bay engineering space the biggest single volume in the ship with the divisions down nine thousand metres deep nearly twice that across and filled with noise and flickering lights and blurringly fast motion as the ship created thousands of new machines to do whoknewwhat most of the engineering space wasnt even filled with air the material components and machines could move faster that way gravious was flying down a transparent traveltube set into the ceiling nine kilometres of that took it to a wall which led into the relative serenity or at least stillness of the sea battle tableau it was halfway across that now just another four thousand metres to go its wing muscles ached it landed on the parapet of a balcony which looked out into the rear of this set of general bays beyond were thirtytwo cubic kilometres of empty air a perfectly empty general bay the sort of place where a normal gsv of this size would be building a smaller gsv playing host to one which was visiting housing an alien environment like a gigantic guests room turning over to some sports venue or subdividing into smaller storage or manufacturing spaces gravious looked back at the modest tableau on the balcony which in its previous existence before the gsv had decided to go eccentric had been part of a cafe with a fine view of the bay here were posed seven humans all with their backs to the view of the empty bay and facing the hologram of a calm empty swimming pool the humans wore trunks they sat in deck chairs around a couple of low tables full of drinks and snacks they had been caught in the acts of laughing talking blinking scratching their chin drinking some famous painting apparently it didnt look very artistic to gravious it supposed you had to see it from the right angle it lifted one leg up from the parapet and slipped falling into the air of the general bay it hit something between it and the bay and fell bouncing off the bays rear wall then off the invisible wall then found its bearings flapped close and parallel to the wall twisted in the air when it got back to the level of the balcony and returned to it uhhuh it thought it risked using again the senses it was not supposed to have solidity in the bay what it had hit was not glass and not a field between it and the empty bay the bay was not empty and what it had hit was the fieldedge of a projection on the far side for at least two kilometres there was solid matter dense solid matter partially exotic dense solid matter well there you were the bird shook itself and preened a little combing its feathers smooth with its beak then it looked around and half hopped half flew over to one of the posed figures it inspected each one briefly staring into an eye here seemingly looking for a juicy parasite in an ear here peering at a stray hair here and carefully studying a nostril here it often did this studying the next ones to go the ones who would next be revived and taken away as though there was something to be learned from their carefully artificial postures it pecked in a desultory barely interested sort of way at a stray hair in one mans armpit then hopped away studying the group from a variety of nearby tables and angles trying to find the correct perspective from which to view the scene soon to be gone of course in fact they were all going this lot with the rest but this lot to reawakening whereas most of them would just be stored somewhere else but this lot when they were woken in a few hours would be coming back to life somewhere funny to think of it finally the bird shook its head stretched its wings and hopped through the hologram and into the deserted cafe beyond ready to begin the first leg of its journey back to its mistress a few moments later the avatar amorphia stepped out of another part of the hologram turned once to glance back at where the bird had hopped through the projection then went and squatted before the figure of the man at whose armpit gravious had pecked iv tight beam m tra n xeccentric shoot them later ogsv anticipation of a new lovers arrival the it was me oo tight beam m tra n xgsv anticipation of a new lovers arrival the oeccentric shoot them later what was you oo i was the gobetween for the information transmitted from the ahforgetlt tendency to sc one of our people on tier saw the affront light cruiser furious purpose as it arrived back there it had a location in elench code burned onto its scarhull the information was transmitted from the tendency mission on tier to me i passed it on to the different tan and the steely glint my usual contacts in the groupgang i would guess the signal was then relayed to the gsv ethics gradient home ship of the gcu fate amenable to change which subsequently discovered the excession so in a sense this is all my fault i apologise i had hoped this confession would never be necessary but having turned this over in my mind i have concluded that as was the case concerning the passingon of the original information regarding the scarhull signal in the first place i had no choice had you guessed had you started to do you still trust me oo it had occurred to me but i had no access to tendency transmission records and was unwilling to ask the other gang members directly i trust you no less for what you say why are you telling me now oo i would like to retain that trust have you discovered anything else oo yes i think there is a link to a man called genarhofoen a contact representative with the affront on a habitat called godshole in the fernblade he left there the day after the excession was discovered sc has hired three affronter battle cruisers to take him to tier they are due there in fourteen days his biography files attached you see the connection that ship again oo you think it involved beyond what we believe we have agreed to already oo yes and the grey area oo the times look a little unlikely if it really pushed itself the ga can reach tier in what three days or so after this human gets there but that still leaves our other concern two months or more out of touch oo i know still i think there is something going on i am following up all the avenues of investigation i can im making further inquiries through the more likely contacts mentioned in his file but its all going terribly slowly thank you for your candour i shall remain in touch oo youre welcome do keep me informed stuttered tight point m tra n xeccentric shoot them later olsv serious callers only got fed up waiting i called it signal file attached oo stuttered tight point m tra n xlsv serious callers only oeccentric shoot them later and now it trusts you no less ha oo i remain convinced it was the right thing to do oo whatever it is done what of the ship you asked to head for pittance oo on its way oo and why pittance oo is it not obvious perhaps not mayhap the paranoia of the anticipation of a new lovers arrival is contagious however that may be let me make my argument pittance houses a veritable cornucopia of weaponry indeed the weapons deployed there just to protect the main cache of munitions that is the ships alone represents a vast stockpile of potential destruction certainly the stores course takes it nowhere near the excession but it has taken it into the general volume within which the affront have some interest now while it has almost certainly gone unnoticed and even if it is spotted and tracked it can be of no interestto the affront and of course it is anyway well able to defend itself and it is not part of the subtle mobilisation being organised by the steely glint it nevertheless represents the greatest concentration of matériel in the vicinity i start to wonder when roughly did the culture start to have doubts serious doubts about the affront and when was pittance chosen as one of the ship stores around the same time indeed pittance was chosen fitted out and stocked entirely within the timescale of the debate which took place at the end of the idiran war regarding military intervention against the affront there are billions of bodies like pittance the galaxy is littered with such pieces of wreckage wandering between the stars yet pittance was chosen as one of only eleven such stores a rock whose slow progress would take it into affronter space within five or six centuries depending on how fast the affront expanded their sphere of influence and which might well remain within that sphere for the foreseeable future given that affronter influence could easily push its borders out at a greater rate than that of a slowly tumbling rock moving at much less than a per cent of light speed how fortuitous to have such a wealth of weaponry embedded in affront space might not this all in fact be a setup think about this is this not just the sort of thing you would be proud to have thought up such foresight such patience such attention to the long game such plausible protestations of innocence should the coincidence be remarked upon or revealed i know id be pleased with myself had i been part of such a plan lastly on the committee of minds which oversaw the choice of these stores the names woetra different tan and not invented here all sound rather familiar think ye not taken all together and even recognising that this is almost certainly a blind alley i thought it irresponsible not to have a sharp eye attached to a sympathetic mind in the vicinity of that precious little rock oo all right point taken oo and what of whatever you were working on oo my original idea was to attempt to find someone acceptable on tier who might be persuaded to our purpose however this proved impractical there is considerable contact and sc presence on the habitat but nobody i think we could risk sharing our apprehensions with instead i have the tentative agreement of an old ally to support our cause should the occasion arise it is a month or more from tier and the excession lies beyond there on its orientation but it has access to a number of warships the tricky part is that some of them may be called up in the mobilisation but a few may be put at our disposal not as warships i hasten to add certainly not against other culture ships but as counters as it were or delivery systems if and when we find a vulnerable point in the conspiracy we believe might exist this genarhofoen person i may make my own inquiries in that direction if i can avoid stepping on the metaphorical toes of our coconcernee the affront angle is the one that worries me so aggressive such drive for all our oftrepeated horror at their effects on others there exists i think a kind of grudging admiration in many culture folk for the affronts energy not to mention their apparent freedom from the effects of moral conscience such an easy threat to see and yet so difficult a problem to deal with i dread to think what awful plan might be hatched with a thoroughly clear conscience by perfectly estimable minds to deal with such a perceived menace equally given the qualitative scale of the opportunity which may be presented by the excession the affront are just the sort of species and at precisely the most likely stage in their development to attempt some sort of mad undertaking which however likely to fail if it did succeed might offer rewards justifying the risk and who is to say they would be wrong in making such a judgement oo look the damned excession hasnt done anything yet all this nuisance has been caused by everybodys reaction to it serve us all right if it turned out it is a projection of some sort some gods jest im growing impatient i dont mind telling you the fate amenable to change stands off watching the excession doing nothing and reporting on it every now and again various lowlevel involveds are puffing themselves up and girding their scrawny loins with a view to taking a sightseeing trip to the latest show in town and in the vague hope that if there is some sort of action theyll be able to pick up some of it and all that the rest of us are doing is sitting around waiting for the big guns to arrive i wish something would happen v good travelling with you genarhofoen fivetide boomed they slapped limbs the man had already braced one leg and the gelfield suit absorbed the actual impact so he didnt fall over they were in the entity control area of the level eight docks affronter section surrounded by affronters their slaved drones and other machines a few members of other species who could tolerate the same conditions as the affront as well as numerous tier sintricates floating around like little dark balls of spines all coming and going leaving or joining travelators spin cars lifts and intersection transport carriages not staying for some rest and recreation genarhofoen asked the affronter tier boasted a notoriously excellent affront hunting reserve section ha on the way back perhaps fivetide said duty calls elsewhere in the meantime he chuckled genarhofoen got the impression he was missing a joke here he wondered about this then shrugged and laughed well ill see you back on godshole no doubt indeed fivetide said enjoy yourself human the affronter turned on his tentacle tips and swept away back to the battlecruiser kiss the blade genarhofoen watched him go and watched the lock doors close on the transit tunnel with a frown on his face whats worrying you asked the suit the man shook his head ah nothing he said he stooped and picked up his holdall human male byr genarhofoen plus gelfield suit said a sintricate floating up to him it looked genarhofoen thought like an explosion in a sphere of black ink frozen an instant after it began he bowed briefly correct i am to escort you to the entity control human section please follow me certainly they found a spin car little more than a platform dotted with seats stanchions and webbing genarhofoen hopped on followed by the sintricate and the car accelerated smoothly into a transparent tunnel which ran out along the underside of the habitats outer skin they were heading spinward so that as the car gained speed they seemed to lose weight a field shimmered over the car seeming to mould itself to the curved roof of the tunnel gases hissed they went underneath the huge hanging bulk of one of the other affronter ships all blades and darkness he watched as it detached itself from the habitat falling massively silently away into space and the circling stars another ship then another and another dropped away after it they disappeared what was the fourth ship the man asked the comet class light cruiser furious purpose the suit said hmm wonder where theyre off to the suit didnt reply it was getting misty in the car genar hofoen listened to gases hiss around him the temperature was rising the atmosphere in the fieldshrouded car changing from an affronter atmosphere to a human atmosphere the car zoomed upwards for lower less gravity intense levels and genarhofoen used to affronter gravity for these last two years felt as though he was floating how long before we rendezvous with the meatfucker he asked three days the suit told him of course they wont let you into the world proper will they the man said as though realising this for the first time no said the suit whatll you do while im off having fun the same ive already inquired ahead and come to an arrangement with a visiting contact ship gp drone so i shall be in thrall it was genarhofoens turn not to say anything he found the whole idea of drone sex even if it was entirely of the mind with no physical component whatsoever quite entirely bizarre ah well each to his own he thought mr genarhofoen said a stunningly heartstoppingly beautiful woman in the postentity reception area human she was tall perfectly proportioned her hair was long and red and extravagantly curled and her eyes were a luminous green just the right side of natural her loose plain tabard exposed smoothly muscled glossily tanned skin welcome to tier my names verlioef schung she held out a hand and shook his firmly skin on skin no suit at last it was a good feeling he was dressed in a semiformal outfit of loose pantaloons and long shirt and enjoying the lushly sensual sensation of the glidingly smooth materials on his body contact sent me to look after you verlioef schung said with a hint of ruefulness im sure you dont need it but im here if you do i ah i hope you dont mind her voice her voice was something to immerse yourself in he smiled broadly and bowed how could i he said she laughed putting one hand over her mouth and of course her perfect teeth as she did so youre very kind she held out a hand may i take your bag no thats all right she raised her shoulders and let them drop well she said youve missed the festival of course but theres a whole gang of us who did too and weve sort of decided to have our own over the next few days and well frankly we need all the help we can get all i can promise you is luxurious accommodation great company and more delectable preparations than you can shake a principle at but if you care to make the sacrifice i promise well all try to make it up to you she flexed her eyebrows and then made a mockfrightened expression pulling down the corners of her succulently perfect mouth he let her hold the look for a moment then patted her on the upper arm no thank you he said sincerely her expression became one of hurt sadness oh are you sure she said in a small softly vulnerable voice fraid so made my own arrangements he said with genuine but determined regret but if there was anyone who was likely to tempt me away from them it would be you he winked at her im flattered by your generous offer and do tell sc i appreciate the trouble theyve gone to but this is my chance to cut loose for a few days you know he laughed dont worry ill have some fun and then ill be ready to ship on out when the time comes he fished a small pen terminal out of one pocket and waved it in front of her face and ill keep my terminal with me at all times promise he put the terminal back in his pocket she gazed intently into his eyes for a few moments then lowered her eyes and then her head and gave a small shrug she looked back up expression ironic when she spoke her voice had changed as well modulating into something deeper and more considered almost regretful well she sighed i hope you enjoy yourself byr she grinned our offer stands if you wish to reconsider brave smile my colleagues and i wish you well she looked furtively round the busy concourse and bit her bottom lip frowning slightly dont suppose you fancy a drink or something anyway do you she said almost plaintively he laughed shook his head and bowed as he backed off hoisting his holdall over his shoulder genarhofoen had arrived a few days after the end of tiers annual festival there was an air of autumnal desuetude mixed with highsummer torpor about the place when he arrived people were cleaning up calming down getting back to normal and generally behaving themselves hed signalled ahead and succeeded in booking the services of an erotroupe as well as reserving a garden penthouse in the view the best hotel on level three all in all entirely worth passing up the rather too obvious advances of his perfect woman for well no it wasnt except it was when your perfect woman was almost certainly a special circumstances agent altered to look like the creature of your fantasies and sent to look after you keep you happy and safe when what you actually wanted was a bit of variety some excitement and some unculturelike danger his perfect partner certainly looked like the very splendid verlioef schung but she was even more positively not sc not contact and probably not even culture either it was that desire for strangeness for apartness for alienness they probably couldnt understand he lay in bed pleasantly exhausted the odd muscle quivering now and again of its own accord surrounded by sleeping pulchritude his head buzzing with the aftereffects of some serious glanding and watched the tier news culture bias channel on a screen hanging in the air in front of the nearest tree an earpip relayed the sound still leading with the blitteringuehdeluger saga then came a feature on the increase in fleeting in culture ships fleeting was when two or more ship minds decided they were fed up being all by themselves and only being able to exchange the equivalent of letters instead they got together keeping physically close to each other so that they could converse operationally most inefficient some older minds were worried it represented their more recently built comrades going soft and wanted the premisestates of minds which would be constructed in the future to be altered to deal with this weak overly chummy decadence local news there was a brief followup report basically saying that the mysterious explosion which had happened in dock b on the third day of the festival was still a mystery the affronter cruiser furious purpose had been lightly damaged by a small pure energy detonation which had done nothing more than locally burn off a layer of its scarhull an overenthusiastic festival prank was suspected not quite so locally the arguments were still going on about the creation of a new hintersphere a few kiloyears antispinward a hintersphere was a volume of space in which ftl flights were banned except in the direst of emergencies and life generally moved at a slower pace than elsewhere in the culture genarhofoen shook his head at that one pretentious rusticism nearer home again backup craft were only a day away from the location of the possible anomaly near esperi the discovering gcu was still reporting no change in the artifact despite requests from contact section various other involved civilisations had sent or were sending ships to the general volume but tier itself had forgone dispatching a craft to the surprise of most observers the affront had criticised the reaction of those who had decided to be nosy and had stayed severely away from the anomaly though there were unconfirmed reports of increased affront activity in the upper leaf swirl and just today four ships off genarhofoen said quietly and the screen duly vanished one of the erotroupe stirred against him he looked at her the girls face was the very image of that belonging to zreyn tramow onetime captain of the good ship problem child her body was different from the original altered in the direction of genarhofoens tastes but subtly there were two like her and three who looked exactly like famous personalities an actress a musician and a lifestyler zreyn and enhoff shpel py and gidinley they had all been perfectly charming as well as being quite plausible impersonators but genarhofoen thought you had to wonder at the mentality of people who actually chose to alter their appearance and behaviour every few days just to suit the tastes usually though not always sexual of others but maybe he was just being a bit fuddyduddyish perhaps they were slightly boring people otherwise or perhaps they just liked a deal more variety in such matters than other people whatever their motivations all five had fallen politely asleep on the ag bed after the fun which had been preceded by a meal and a party the troupes exemplary couple gakic and leleeril were asleep too lying in each others arms on the carpetlike lawn between the bed platform and the stream which threaded its way from the tinkling waterfall and the pool detumesced the mans prick was almost normal looking genarhofoen felt slightly sleepy himself but he was determined to stay awake for the whole holiday he brushed the sleepiness back under the edges of his mind with a glandular release of gain doing this for three days solid would leave him needing lots of sleep but there would be a week on the grey areameat fucker plenty of time to recover the buzz of gain coursed through him clearing his head and ridding his body of the effects of fatigue gradually a feeling of rested ready peacefulness washed over and through him he clasped his hands behind his neck and gazed happily upwards past the fronds of a couple of overhanging trees at the blue cloudstrewn sky just that movement performed in the gravity of tiers standardg level gave him a good light almost childishly enjoyable sensation affronter standard gravity was more than twice the culturepromoted human norm and he supposed it was a sign of how well and how easily his body had adapted to conditions on godshole habitat that he had quickly and long since stopped noticing how much heavier he had felt from day to day a thought occurred to him he closed his eyes briefly going quickly into the semitrance that the average culture adult employed when they needed to and could be bothered to check on their physiological settings he dug around inside various images of his body until he saw himself standing on a small sphere the sphere was set at one standard gravity his subconscious had registered the fact that he had been in a steady reduced gravity field for longer than a few hours and had reset itself left to its own devices his body would now start to lose bone and muscle mass thin the walls of his blood vessels and perform a hundred other tiny but consequential alterations the better to suit his frame tissues and organs to that reduced severity of weight well his subconscious was only doing its job and it didnt know he would be back in affronter gravity again in a month or so he increased the size of the sphere his image stood upon until it was back to the two point one gravities his body would have to readjust itself to once he returned to godshole there that should do it he cast a quick look round his internal states while he was here not that there ought to be anything amiss warning signs made themselves obvious automatically sure enough all was well fatigue being dealt with presence of gain noted blood sugar returning to normal hormones generally being gathered back to optimum levels he came out of the semitrance opened his eyes and looked over at where the pen terminal lay on a sculpted smoothly varnished tree stump at the bedside so far he had mostly used it to check up on the replies from his contact contacts confirming what they could concerning this so far pleasantly undemanding mission the terminal was supposed to blink a little light if it had a message stored for him he was still waiting to hear from the gsv not invented here the incident coordinator for the excession the terminal lay where hed left it dull no new messages oh well he looked away and watched the clouds move in the sky for a while then wondered what it looked like turned off sky off he said keeping his voice low the sky disappeared and the true ceiling of the penthouse suite was revealed a slickly black surface studded with projectors lights and miscellaneous bumps and indentations the few gentle animal sounds faded away in the view hotel every suite was a penthouse corner suite there were four per floor and the only floor which didnt have four penthouse suites was the very top one which so that nobody in the lower floors would feel they were missing out on the real thing when it was available was restricted to housing some of the hotels machinery and equipment genarhofoens was called a jungle suite though it was entirely the most manicured pestfree and temperately temperaturecontrolled and generally civilised jungle he had ever heard of night sky on he said quietly the slick black ceiling was replaced by blackness scattered with sharply bright stars some animal noises resumed sounding different compared to those heard in the daylight they were real animals not recordings every now and again a bird would fly across the clearing where the bed was situated or a fish would splash in the bathing pool or a chattering simian would swing across the forest canopy or a huge glittering insect would burr delicately through the air it was all terribly tasteful and immaculate and genarhofoen was already starting to look forward to the evening when he intended to dress in his best clothes and hit the town which in this case was night city located one level almost straight down where traditionally anything on tier that could breathe a nitrogenoxygen atmosphere and tolerate one standard gravity and had any sort of taste for diversion and excitement tended to congregate a night in night city would be just the thing to complete this first mad rush of fun at the onset of his short holiday calling ahead and ordering up a fabulously expensive erotroupe to act out his every sexual fantasy was one thing one extremely wonderful and deeply satisfying thing beyond all doubt he told himself with all due solemnity but the idea of a chance meeting with somebody else another free independent soul with their own desires and demands their own reservations and requirements that just because it was all up to chance and up to negotiation just because it all might end in nothing in rejection in the failure to impress and connect in being found wanting rather than being wanted that was a more valuable thing that was an enterprise well worthy of the risk of rebuff he glanded charge that ought to do it seconds later filled to bursting with the love of action movement and the blessed need to be doing something he was bouncing out of bed laughing to himself and apologising to the sleepily grumbling but still palatably comely cast of the erotroupe he skipped to the warm waterfall and stood under it as he showered he told a bluefurred wiselooking little creature dressed in a dapper waistcoat and sitting on a nearby tree what clothes he wished prepared for the evening it nodded and swung off through the branches vi its nothing to worry about gestra the drone told him as he stepped out of the bulky suit in the vestibule beyond the airlocks gestra ishmethit leant against a maniple field which the drone extended for him he looked down the corridor to the main part of the accommodation unit but there was no sign of anybody yet the ship has come with new codes and updated security procedures the drone continued its some years before these were due to be altered but there has been some unusual activity in a nearby volume nothing threatening as such but its always best to be careful so its been decided to move things along a bit and perform the update now rather than later the drone hung the mans suit up near the airlock doors its surface sparkling with frost gestra rubbed his hands together and accepted the trousers and jacket the drone handed him he kept glancing down the corridor the ship has been verified and authenticated by the necessary outside referees the drone told him so its all aboveboard you see the machine helped him button up the jacket and smoothed his thin fair hair the crew have asked to come inside just curious really gestra stared at the drone obviously distressed but the machine patted him on the shoulder with a rosy field and said itll be all right gestra i thought it only polite to grant their request but you can stay out of their way if you like saying hello to them at first would probably go down well but it isnt compulsory the mind had its drone study the man for a moment checking his breathing heart rate pupil dilation skin response pheromone output and brainwaves i know what it said soothingly well tell them youve taken a vow of silence hows that you can greet them formally nod or whatever and ill do the talking would that be all right gestra gulped and said yyyes yes he said nodding vigorously that that would be good good idea thathank you right the machine said floating at the mans side as they headed down the corridor for the main reception area theyll displace over in a few minutes like i say just nod to them and let me say whatever has to be said ill make your excuses and you can go off to your suite if you like im sure they wont mind being shown round by this drone meanwhile ill be receiving the new ciphers and routines theres a lot of multiplechecking and bureaucratic bookkeeping sort of stuff to be done but even so it should only take an hour or so we wont offer them a meal or anything with any luck theyll take the hint and head off again leave us in peace eh after a moment gestra nodded at this vigorously the drone swivelled in the air at the mans side to show him it was looking at him does all this sound acceptable i mean i could put them off completely tell them theyre just not welcome but it would be terribly rude dont you think yyes gestra said frowning and looking distinctly uncertain rude suppose so rude mustnt be rude probably come a long way should think a smile flickered around his lips like a small flame in a high wind i think we can be pretty sure of that the drone said with a laugh in its voice it clapped him gently on the back with a field gestra was smiling a little more confidently as he walked into the accommodation units main reception area the reception area was a large round room full of couches and chairs gestra usually paid it no attention it was just a largish space he had to walk through on his way to and back from the airlocks which led to the warship hangars now he looked at each of the plumply comfortablelooking seats and sofas as though they represented some terrible threat he felt his nervousness return he wiped his brow as the drone stopped by a couch and indicated he might like to sit lets have a look shall we the drone said as gestra sat a screen appeared in the air on the far side of the room starting as a bright dot quickly widening to a line eight metres long then seeming to unroll so that it filled the fourmetre space between floor and ceiling blackness little lights space gestra realised suddenly how long it had been since hed seen such a view then sweeping slowly into view came a long dark grey shape sleek symmetrical doubleended reminding gestra of the axle and hubs of a ships windlass the killer class limited offensive unit attitude adjuster the drone said in a matteroffact almost boredsounding voice not a type we have here gestra nodded no he said then stopped to clear his throat a few times no pattern patterns on it its hull thats right the drone said the ship was stopped now almost filling the screen the stars wheeled slowly behind it well i the drone said then stopped the screen on the far side of the room flickered the drones aura field flicked off it fell out of the air bouncing off the seat beside gestra and toppling heavily lifelessly to the floor gestra stared at it a voice like a sigh said sssave yourssselfff then the lights dimmed there was a buzzing noise from all around gestra and a tiny tendril of smoke leaked out of the top of the drones casing gestra leapt up out of the seat staring wildly around then jumped up on the seat crouching there and staring at the drone the little wisp of smoke was dissipating the buzzing noise faded slowly gestra squatted hugging his knees with both arms and looking all about the buzzing noise stopped the screen collapsed to a line hanging in the air then shrank to a dot then winked out after a moment gestra reached forward with one hand and prodded the drones casing with one hand it felt warm and solid it didnt move a sequence of thuds from the far side of the room shook the air beyond where the screen had hung in the air four tiny mirror spheres bloated suddenly growing almost instantly to over three metres in diameter and hovering just above the floor gestra jumped off the seat and started back away from the spheres he rubbed his hands together and glanced back at the corridor to the airlock the mirror spheres vanished like exploding balloons to reveal complicated things like tiny spaceships not much smaller than the mirror spheres themselves one of them rushed towards gestra who turned and ran he pelted down the corridor running as fast as he could his eyes wide his face distorted with fear his fists pumping something rushed up behind him crashed into him and knocked him over sending him sprawling and tumbling along the carpeted floor he came to a stop his face hurt where it had grazed along the carpet he looked up his heart twitching madly in his chest his whole body shaking two of the miniature ship things had followed him into the corridor each floated a couple of metres away one on either side of him there was a strange smell in the air frost had formed on various parts of the ship things the nearer one extended a thing like a long hose and went to take him by the neck gestra ducked down and doubled himself up lying on his side on the carpet face tucked into his knees arms hugging his shins something prodded him about the shoulders and rump he could hear muffled noises coming from the two machines he whimpered then something very hard slammed into his side he heard a cracking noise and his arm burned with pain he screamed still trying to bury his face in his knees he felt his bowels relax warmth flooded his pants he was aware of something inside his head turning off the searing pain in his arm but nothing could turn off the heat of shame and embarrassment tears filled his eyes there was a noise like ka then a whooshing noise and a breeze touched his face and hands after a moment he looked up and saw that the two machines had gone down to the airlock doors there was movement in the reception area and then another one of the machines came down the corridor it slowed down as it approached him he ducked his head down again another whoosh and another breeze he looked up again the three machines were moving around near the airlock doors gestra sniffed back his tears the three machines drew back from the doors then settled down onto the ground gestra waited to see what would happen next there was a flash and an explosion the middle set of doors blew out in a burst of smoke that rolled up the corridor and then collapsed backwards seemingly sucking the whole explosion back into where the doors had been the doors had gone leaving a dark hole a breeze tugged at gestra then the breeze turned to a wind and the wind became a storm that howled and then screamed past him and then started moving him bodily along the floor he shouted in fear trying to grab hold of the carpet with his one good arm he slid down the corridor in the roar of air his fingers scrabbling for a grip his nails dug in found purchase and his fingers closed around the fibres pulling him to a stop he heard thuds and looked up gasping towards the reception area eyes streaming with tears as the wind whipped by him something moved bouncing in the lighted doorway of the circular lounge he saw the vague rounded shape of a couch thudding into the floor twenty metres away and flying towards him on the howling stream of air he heard himself shout something the couch thudded into the floor ten metres away tumbling end over end he thought it was going to miss him but one end of it smashed into his dangling feet tearing him away the storm of air picked him up bodily and he screamed as he fell with it past the shapes of the three watching machines one of his legs hit the jagged edges of the breach in the airlock doors and was torn off at the knee he flew out into the huge space beyond the air pulled from his mouth first by his scream and then by the vacuum of the hangar itself he skidded to a stop on the cold hard floor of the hangar fifty metres from the wrecked doors blood oozing then freezing around his wounds the cold and the utter silence closed in he felt his lungs collapse and something bubbled in his throat his head ached as if his brain were about to burst out of his nose eyes and ears and his every tissue and bone seemed to ring with brief stunning pain before going numb he looked into the enveloping darkness and up at the towering heedless heights of the bizarrely patterned ships then the ice crystals forming in his eyes fractured the view and made it splinter and multiply as though seen through a prism before it all went dim and then black he was trying to shout to cry out but there was only a terrible choking coldness in his throat in a moment he couldnt even move frozen there on the floor of the vast space immobile in his fear and confusion the cold killed him finally shutting off his brain in concentric stages freezing the higher functions first then the lower mammal brain then finally the primitive nearreptilian centre his last thoughts were that he would never see his model sea ships again nor know why the warships in the cold dark halls were patterned so victory commander risingmoon parchseason iv of the farsight tribe nudged the suit forward floating out through the torn doors of the airlock and into the hangar space the ships were there gangster class his gaze swept their ranks sixtyfour of them he had privately thought it might all be a hoax some culture trick at his side his weapons officer steered his suit across the floor over the body of the human and up towards the nearest of the ships the other suited figure the affronter commanders personal guard rotated watching if youd waited another minute the voice of the culture ship said tiredly through the suits communicator i could have opened the airlock doors for you im sure you could the commander said is the mind quite under your control entirely touchingly naive in the end and the ships quiescent undisturbed asleep they will believe whatever they are told good the commander said begin the process of waking them it is already under way nobody else here his security officer said over the communicator he had gone on into the rest of the human accommodation section when they had made their way to the airlock doors anything of interest the commander asked following his weapons officer towards the nearest warship he had to try to keep the excitement out of his voice they had them they had them he had to brake the suit hard in his enthusiasm he almost collided with his weapons officer in the ruined suite that had been the place where the human had lived the security officer swivelled in the vacuum surveying the wreckage the evacuating whirlwind of air had left human coverings clothes items of furniture some complicated structures models of some sort no he said nothing of interest hmm the ship said something about the tone communicated unease to the commander at the same moment his weapons officer turned his suit to him sir he said a light flicked on picking out a metrediameter circle of the ships hull its surface was riotously embellished and marked covered in strange sweeping designs the weapons officer swept the light over nearby sections of the vessels curved hull it was all the same all of it covered with these curious whorled patterns and motifs what the commander said concerned now this complexity the weapons officer said sounding perplexed internal too the culture ship broke iri it the weapons officer said spluttering his suit moved closer to the warships hull until it was almost touching this will take for ever to scan he said it goes down to the atomic level what does the commander said sharply the ships have been baroqued to use the technical term the culture ship said urbanely it was always a possibility it made a sighing noise the vessels have been fractally inscribed with partially random nonpredictable designs using up a little less than one per cent of the mass of each craft there is a chance that hidden in amongst that complexity will be independent security nanodevices which will activate at the same time as each ships main systems and which will require some additional coded reassurance that all is well otherwise they will attempt to disable or even destroy the ship these will have to be looked for as your weapons officer says the craft will each have to be scanned at least down to the level of individual atoms i shall begin this task the instant i have completed the reprogramming of the bases mind this will delay us thats all the ships would have required scanning in any event and in the meantime nobody knows were here you will have your war fleet in a matter of days rather than hours commander but you will have it the weapons officers space suit turned to face the commanders the light illuminating the outlandish designs switched off somehow from the way he performed these actions the weapons officer conveyed a mood of scepticism and perhaps even disgust to the commander ka the commander said contemptuously whirling away and heading back towards the airlock doors he needed to wreck something the accommodation section ought to provide articles which would be satisfying but unimportant his personal guard swept after him weapons ready passing over the still frozen body of the human even that hadnt provided any sport commander risingmoon parchseason iv of the farsight tribe and the battleship xenoclast on secondment to the alien ship attitude adjuster unholstered one of the external weapons on his own suit and blasted the small figure into a thousand pieces scattering fragments of frosty pink and white across the cold floor of the hangar like a small delicate fall of snow tier i such investigations took time there was the time that even hyperspacially transmitted information took to traverse the significant percentages of the galaxy involved there were complicated routes to arrange other minds to talk to sometimes after setting up appointments because they were absent in infinite fun space for a while then the minds had to be casualed up to or gossip or jokes or thoughts on a mutual interest had to be exchanged before a request or a suggestion was put which rerouted and disguised an information search sometimes these reroutes took on extra loops detours and shuntings as the minds concerned thought to play down their own involvement or involve somebody else on a whim so that often wildly indirect paths resulted branching and rebranching and doubling back on themselves until eventually the relevant question was asked and the answer assuming it was forthcoming started the equally tortuous route back to the original requester frequently simple seekeragent programs or entire mindstate abstracts were sent off on even more complicated missions with detailed instructions on what to look for where to find it who to ask and how to keep their tracks covered mostly it was done like that through minds ai core memories and innumerable public storage systems information reservoirs and databases containing schedules itineraries lists plans catalogues registers rosters and agenda sometimes though when that way the relatively easy quick and simple way was closed to the inquirer for some reason usually to do with keeping the inquiry secret things had to be done the slow way the messy way the physical way sometimes there was no alternative the vacuum dirigible approached the floating island under a brilliantly clear night sky awash with moon and star light the main body of the airship was a giant fat disk half a kilometre across with a finish like brushed aluminium it glinted in the bluegrey light as if frosted though the night was warm balmy and scented with the heady perfume of wineplant and sierra creeper the crafts two gondolas one on top one suspended underneath were smaller thinner disks only three storeys in height each slowly revolving in different directions their edges glowing with lights the sea beneath the airship was mostly blackdark but in places it glowed dimly in giant slowly fading vs as giant sea creatures surfaced to breathe or to sieve new levels of the waters for their tiny prey and so disturbed the lightemitting plankton near the surface the island floated high in the breezeruffled waters its base a steeply fluted pillar that extended a kilometre down into the seas salty depths its thin spirelike mountains thrusting a similar distance into the cloudless air it too was scattered with lights of small towns villages individual houses lanterns on beaches and smaller aircraft most of them come out to welcome the vacuum dirigible the two slowly revolving gondola sections slid gradually to a halt preparatory to docking people in both segments congregated on the sides nearest the island for the view the airships system registered the imbalance building up and pumped bubblecarbon spheres full of vacuum from one lot of tanks to another so maintaining a suitably even keel the islands main town drifted slowly closer the docking tower bright with lights lasers fireworks and searchlights all fought for attention i really should go tish the drone gruda aplam said i didnt promise but i did kind of say id probably stop by ah stop by on the way back tishlin said waving his glass let them wait he stood on the balcony outside one of the lower gondolas midlevel bars the drone a very old thing like two greybrown rounded cubes one on top of the other and threequarters the size of a human floated beside him theyd only met that day four days into the cruise over the orbitals floating islands and theyd got on famously quite as though theyd been friends for a century or more the drone was much older than the man but they found they had the same attitudes the same beliefs and the same sense of humour they both liked telling stories too tishlin had the impression he hadnt yet scratched the veneer off the old machines tales of when it had been in contact a millennium before he had and goodness knew he was considered an old codger these days he liked the ancient machine hed really come on this cruise looking for romance and he still hoped to find it but in the meantime finding such a perfect companion and raconteur had already made him glad hed come the trouble was the drone was supposed to get off here and go to visit some old drone pals who lived on the island before resuming its cruise on the next dirigible due in a few days time a month from now it would be leaving on the gsv that had brought it here but i feel id be letting them down look just stay another day the man suggested you never did finish telling me about what was it bhughredi yes bhughredi the old drone chuckled exactly bhughredi the sea nukes and the interference effect thing or whatever it was damnedest way to launch a ship the old drone agreed and made a sighing noise so what did happen like i said its a long story so stay tomorrow tell me it youre a drone for goodness sake you can float back by yourself but i said id visit them when the airship got here tish anyway my ag units are due a service theyd probably fail and id end up at the bottom of the sea having to be rescued very embarrassing take a flyer back the man said watching the islands shore slide underneath people gathered round fires on the beach waved up at the craft he could hear music drifting on the warm breeze oh i dont know theyd probably be upset tishlin drank from his glass and frowned down at the waves breaking on the beach which led towards the lights of the town a particularly large and vivid firework detonated in the air directly above the bright docking tower oos and aahs duly sounded round the crowded balcony the man snapped his fingers i know he said send a mindstate abstract the big drone hesitated then said oh one of those hmm well still not really the same thing i think anyway ive never done one not sure i really approve i mean its you but its not you you know tishlin nodded certainly do know cant say i think theyre as you know benign as theyre cracked up to be either i mean its supposed to act sentient without being sentient so isnt it actually sentient what happens to it when its just turned off im not convinced there isnt some sort of iffy morality here either but ive done it myself talked into it reservations like you say but he looked round then leant closer to the machines dull brown casing bit of a contact thing actually really the old machine said tipping its whole body away from him for a moment then tipping it back so that it leant towards him it extended a field round the two of them the exterior sounds faded when it spoke again it was with a slight echo that indicated the field was keeping whatever they said between the two of them what was that well wait a moment if you arent supposed to tell anybody tishlin weaved his hand well not officially he said brushing white hair over one ear but youre a contact veteran and you know how sc always dramatises things sc the drone said its voice rising you didnt say it was them im not sure i want to hear this it said through a chuckle well they asked a favour the man said quietly pleased that he seemed finally to have impressed the old drone sort of a family thing had to record one of these damn things so it could go and convince a nephew of mine he should do his bit for the great and good cause last i heard the boy had done the decent thing and taken ship for some eccentric gsv he watched the outskirts of the town slide underneath a flowergarlanded terrace held groups of people patterndancing he could imagine the whoops and wild whirling music the scent of roasting meat came curling over the balcony parapet and made it through the hushfield they asked if i wanted it to be reincorporated after it had done its job he told the drone they said it could be sent back and sort of put back inside my head but i said no gave me a creepy feeling just thinking about it what if it had changed a lot while it was away why i might end up wanting to join some retreatist order or autoeuthenise or something he shook his head and drained his glass no i said no hope the damn thing never was really alive but if it was or is then its not getting back into my head no thank you im sorry well if what they told you was true its yours to do with as you wish isnt it exactly well i dont think ill take the same step the drone said sounding thoughtful it swivelled as though to face him the field around them collapsed the sound of the fireworks returned tell you what the old drone said i will get off here and see the guys but ill catch up with you in a couple of days all right well probably fall out in a day or two anyway theyre cantankerous old buggers frankly ill take a flyer or try floating myself if i feel adventurous deal it extended a field deal tishlin said slapping the field with his hand the drone gruda aplam had already contacted its old friend the gcu its character forming currently housed in the gsv zero gravitas which was at that point docked under a distant plate of seddun orbital the gcu communicated with the orbital hub tsikiliepre which in turn contacted the ulterior entity highpoint which signalled the lsv misophist which passed the message on to the university mind at oara on khasli plate in the juboal system which duly relayed the signal along with an interesting series of rhymescheme glyphs ordinary poems and word games all based on the original signal to its favoured protege the lsv serious callers only stuttered tight point m tra n xlsv serious callers only oeccentric shoot them later it is genarhofoen i am now convinced i am not certain why he may be important to the conspiracy but he surely is i have drawn up a plan to intercept him on tier the plan involves phage rock will you back me up if i request its aid oo stuttered tight point m tra n xeccentric shoot them later olsv serious callers only my dear old friend of course oo thank you i shall make the request immediately we shall be reduced to dealing with amateurs im afraid however i hope to find a highprofile amateur a degree of fame may protect where sc training is not available what of our fellow counterconspirator no word perhaps its spending more time in the land of if oo and the ship and pittance oo arriving in eleven and a half days time oo hmm four days after the time it will take for us to get somebody to tier it is within the bounds of possibility this ship will be heading into a threatening situation is it able to take care of itself oo oh i think it capable of giving a good account of itself just because im eccentric doesnt mean i dont know some big hitters oo let us hope such throwweight is not required oo absolutely ii a plate class general systems vehicle was quite a simple thing in at least one way it was four kilometres thick the lowest kilometre was almost all engine the middle two klicks were ship space an entire enclosed system of sophisticated dockyards and quays in effect and the topmost thousand metres was accommodation most of it for humans there was of course a great deal more to it than that but this covered the essentials using these broadbrush figures it was a simple matter for anybody to work out the crafts approximate maximum speed from the cubic kilometrage of its engines the number of ships of any given size it could contain according to the volume given over to the various sizes of bays and engineering space and the total number of humans it could accommodate by simply adding up how many cubic kilometres were given over to their livingspace the sleeper service had retained an almost pristine original specification internally which was a rare thing in an eccentric vessel usually the first thing they did was drastically reconfigure their physical shape and internal layout according to the dictates of some private aesthetic driving obsession or just plain whim but the fact the sleeper service had stuck to its initial design and merely added its own private ocean and gasgiant environment on the outside made it relatively easy to measure its actual behaviour against what it ought to be capable of and so ensure that it wasnt up to any extra mischief besides being eccentric in the first place in addition to such simple arithmetical estimates of a ships capability it was of course always a good idea when dealing with an eccentric craft to have just that little extra bit of an edge intelligence to be specific an inside view a spy as it approached the dreve system the plate class gsv sleeper service was travelling at its usual cruising speed of about forty kilolights it had already announced its desire to stop off in the inner system and so duly started braking as it passed through the orbit of the systems outermost planet a light week distant from the sun itself the yawning angel the gsv which was shadowing the larger craft decelerated at the same rate a few billion kilometres behind the yawning angel was the latest in a long line of gsvs which had agreed to take a shift as the sleeper services escort it wasnt a particularly demanding task indeed no sensible gsv would wish it to be though there was a small amount of vicarious glamour associated with it guarding the weirdo letting it roam wherever it wanted but maintaining the fraternal vigilance that such an enormously powerful craft espousing such an eccentric credo patently merited the only qualifications for being a sleeper service shadow were that one was regarded as being reliable and that one was capable of staying with the ss if it ever decided to make a dash for it in other words one had to be quicker than it the yawning angel had done the job for the best part of a year and found it undemanding naturally it was somewhat annoying not to be able to draw up ones own course schedule but providing one took the right attitude and dispensed with the standard mind conviction that held efficiency to the absolute bottom line of everything it could be an oddly enhancing even liberating experience gsvs were always wanted in many more places at the same time than it was possible to be and it was something of a relief to be able to blame somebody else when one had to frustrate peoples and other ships wishes and requests this stop at dreve had not been anticipated for example the sss course had seemed set on a reasonably predictable path which would take it through the next month but now it was here the yawning angel would be able to drop off a few ships take another couple on and swap some personnel there should be time the ss had never acknowledged the presence of any of the vessels tailing it and it hadnt posted a course schedule since it had turned eccentric forty years earlier but it had certain obligations in terms of setting reawakened people back in the land of the living again and it always announced how long it would be staying in the systems it visited it would be here in dreve for a week an unusually long time it had never stayed anywhere for longer than three days before the implication according to the group of ships considered experts on the behaviour of the sleeper service and given what the gsv itself had been saying in its increasingly rare communications was that it was about to offload all its charges all the storees and all the big sea air and gasgiantdwelling creatures it had collected over the decades would be moved physically presumably rather than displaced to compatible habitats dreve would be an ideal system to do this in it had been a culture system for four thousand years comprising nine more or less wilderness worlds and three orbitals hoops giant bracelets of livingspace only a few thousand kilometres across but ten million kilometres in diameter calmly gyrating in their own carefully aligned orbits and housing nearly seventy billion souls some of those souls were far from human one third of each of the systems orbitals was given over to ecosystems designed for quite different creatures gasgiant dwellers on one methane atmospherians on another and high temperature silicon creatures on another the fauna the ss had picked up from other gasgiant planets would all fit comfortably into a subsection of the orbital designed with such animals in mind and the sea and air creatures ought to be able to find homes on that or either of the other worlds a week to hang around the yawning angel thought that would go down particularly well with its human crew one of the many tiny but significant and painful ways a gsv could lose face amongst its peers was through a higher than average crew turnover rate and while it had been expecting it the yawning angel had found the experience most distressing when people had announced they were fed up not being able to have any reliable advance notice of where they were going from week to week and month to month and so had decided to live elsewhere all its protestations had been to no avail what would in effect be a weeks leave in such a cosmopolitan sophisticated and welcoming system really should convince a whole load of those currently wavering between loyalty and shipjumping that it was worth staying on with the good old yawning angel it was sure the sleeper service came to an orbitrelative stop a quarterturn in advance along the path of the middle orbital the most efficient position to assume to distribute its cargo of people and animals evenly amongst all three worlds permission to do so was finally received from the last of the orbitals hub minds and the sleeper service duly began getting ready to unload the yawning angel watched from afar as the larger craft detached its traction fields from the energy grid beneath real space closed down its primary and ahead scan fields dropped its curtain shields and generally made the many great and small adjustments a ship normally made when one was intending to stick around somewhere for a while the sleeper services external appearance remained the same as ever a silvery ellipsoid ninety kilometres long sixty across the beam and twenty in height after a few minutes however smaller craft began to appear from that reflective barrier speeding towards the three orbitals with their cargoes of stored people and sedated animals all this matched with the intelligence the yawning angel had already received regarding the setup and intentions of the eccentric gsv so far so good then content that all was well the yawning angel drifted in to match velocities with teriocre the middle orbital and the one with the gasgiant environments it docked underneath the orbitals most populous section and drew up a variety of travel and leave arrangements for its own inhabitants while setting up a schedule of visits events and parties aboard to thank its hosts for their hospitality everything went swimmingly until the second day then without warning just after dawn had broken over the part of the orbital the yawning angel had docked beneath stored bodies and giant animals started popping into existence all over teriocre posed people some still in the clothes or uniforms of the tableaux they had been part of on board the sleeper service suddenly appeared inside sports halls on beaches terraces boardwalks and pavements in parks plazas deserted stadia and every other sort of public space the orbital had to offer to the few people who witnessed these events it was obvious the bodies had been displaced the appearance of each was signalled by a tiny point of light blinking into existence just above waist level this expanded rapidly to a twometre grey sphere which promptly popped and disappeared leaving behind the immobile storee unmoving people were left lying on dewy grass or sitting on park benches or scattered by the hundred across the patterned mosaic of squares and piazzas as though after some terrible disaster or a particularly assertive public sculpture exhibition dim cleaning machines spiralling methodically within such spaces were left bemused picking erratic courses amongst the rash of new and unexpected obstructions in the seas the surface swelled and bulged in hundreds of different places as whole globes of water were carefully displaced just beneath the surface the sea creatures contained within were still gently sedated and moved sluggishly in their giant fish bowls each of which retained its separation from the surrounding water for a few hours osmosing fields gradually adjusting the conditions within to those in the sea outside in the air similar gauzy fields surrounded whole flocks of buoyant atmosphere fauna bobbing groggily in the breeze further along the vast shallow sweep of the orbital the gasgiant environments were witness to equivalent scenes of nearinstant immigration followed by gradual integration the yawning angels own drones its ambassadors on the orbital were witness to a handful of these sudden manifestations after a nanoseconds delay to ask permission the gsv clicked into the orbitals own monitoring systems and so watched with growing horror as hundreds thousands tens of thousands more stored bodies and animals came thumping into existence all over the surface and all through the air water and gasecologies of teriocre the yawning angel flashwoke all its systems and switched its attention to the sleeper service the big gsv was already moving rolling and twisting to point directly upwards out of the system its engine fields reconnected with the energy grid its scanners were all already back on line and the rest of its multilayered field complex was rapidly configuring itself for sustained deepspace travel it moved off not especially quickly its displacers had switched to pick rather than put now in a matter of seconds they had snapped almost its entire fleet of smaller ships out of the system their genuine yet deceptive delivery missions completed only the furthest most massive vessels were left behind the yawning angel was already frantically making its own preparations to depart in pursuit closing off most of its transit corridors snapdisplacing drones from the orbital hurrying through a permissiontodepart request to the worlds hub and drawing up schedules for ferrying people back to the orbital on smaller craft once it had got under way while at the same time bringing other personnel back before its own velocity grew too great it knew it was wasting its energy but it signalled the sleeper service anyway meanwhile it watched intently as the departing ship accelerated away the yawning angel was gauging judging calibrating it was looking for a figure comparing an aspect of the reality that was the absconding craft with the abstraction that was a simple but crucial equation if the sleeper services velocity could at any point over time be described by a value greater than x ns the yawning angel might be in trouble it might be in trouble anyway but if the larger vessel was accelerating significantly quicker than its normal design parameters implied allowing for the extra mass of the crafts extraneous environments then that trouble started right now as it was the yawning angel was relieved to see the sleeper service was moving away at exactly that rate the ship was still perfectly apprehendable and even if the yawning angel waited for another day without doing anything it would still be able to track the larger craft with ease and catch up with it within two days still suspecting some sort of trick the yawning angel started an observation routine throughout the system for unexpected displacings of gigatonnes of water and gasgiant atmosphere suddenly dumping all that extra volume and mass now would be one way the sleeper service could put on an extra burst of speed even if it would still be significantly slower than the yawning angel the smaller gsv retransmitted its polite but insistent signal still no reply from the sleeper service no surprise there then the yawning angel signalled to tell other contact craft what was happening and sent one of its fastest ships a cliff class superlifter stationed in space outside the gsvs own fields for exactly this sort of eventuality in pursuit of the escaping gsv just so it would know this precocious irksome action was being taken seriously probably the sleeper service was simply being awkward rather than up to something more momentous but the yawning angel couldnt ignore the fact the larger craft was abandoning a significant proportion of its smaller ships and had resorted to displacing people and animals displacing was especially at such speed inherently and unfinessably dangerous the risk of something going horribly terminally wrong was only about one in eighty million for any single displacement event but that was still enough to put the average fussily perfectionist ship mind off using the process for anything alive except in the direst of emergencies and the sleeper service assuming it had rid itself of its entire complement of souls must have carried out thirtythousand plus displacements in a minute or less nudging the odds up well into the sort of likelihoodoffuckup range any sane mind would normally recoil from in utter horror even allowing for the sleeper services eccentricity that did tend to indicate that there was something more than usually urgent or significant about its current actions the yawning angel looked up what was in effect an annoyance chart it could leave right now within a hundred seconds and aggravate lots of people because they were on board itself instead of the orbital or viceversa or it could depart within twenty hours and leave everybody back where they ought to be even if they were irritated at their plans being upset compromise it set an eighthour departure time terminals in the shape of rings pens earrings brooches articles of clothing and the inbuilt versions neural laces woke startled culture personnel all over the orbital and the wider system insisting on relaying their urgent message so much for keeping everybody happy with a weeks leave the sleeper service accelerated smoothly away into the darkness already well clear of the system it began to induct flittering between inferior and superior hyperspace its apparent realspace velocity jumped almost instantly by a factor of exactly twentythree again the yawning angel was comforted to see spot on no unpleasant surprises the superlifter charitable view raced after the fleeing craft its engines unstressed energy expenditure throttled well back also threading its way between the layers of fourdimensional space the process had been compared to a flying fish zipping from water to air and back again except that every second airjump was into a layer of air beneath the water not above it which was where the analogy did rather break down the yawning angel was quickly customising thousands of carefully composed exquisitely phrased apologies to its personnel and hosts its schedule of ship returns varied to reflect the different courses the sleeper service might take if it didnt remain on its present heading didnt look too problematic it had delayed letting people venture far away until the sleeper service had sent most of its own fleet out an action even it had thought overcautious at the time but which now seemed almost prescient it delegated part of its intellectual resources to drawing up a list of treats and blandishments with which to mollify its own people when they returned and planned for a twoweek return to dreve packed with festivities and celebrations to say sorry when it was free of the obligation to follow this accursed machine and was able to draw up its own course schedule again the charitable view reported that the sleeper service was still proceeding as could be expected the situation it appeared was in hand the yawning angel reviewed its own actions so far and found them exemplary this was all very vexing but it was responding well playing it by the book where possible and extemporising sensibly but with all due urgency where it had to good good it could well come out of this shining three hours twentysix minutes and seventeen seconds after setting off the general systems vehicle sleeper service reached its nominal terminal acceleration point this was where it ought to stop gaining speed plump for one of the two hyperspatial volumes and just cruise along at a nice steady velocity it didnt instead it accelerated harder that figure zoomed quickly to the plate classs normal design maximum the charitable view communicated this turn of events back to the yawning angel which went into shock for about a millisecond it rechecked all its insystem ships drones sensors and external reports there was no sign that the sleeper service had dumped its extra mass anywhere within range of the yawning angels sensors yet it was behaving as though it had where had it done it could it have secretly built longerrange displacers no half its mass would have been required to construct a displacer capable of dumping so much volume beyond the range of the yawning angels sensors and that included all the extra mass it had taken on board over the years in the form of the extraneous environments in the first place though now that it was thinking in such outrageous terms there was another associated possibility that just might but no that couldnt be there had been no intelligence no hint no it didnt even want to think about that the yawning angel rescheduled everything it had already arranged in a flurry of redrafted apologies pleas for understanding and truncated journeys it halved the departure warning time it had given thirtythree minutes to departure now the situation it tried to explain to everybody was becoming more urgent the sleeper services acceleration figures remained steady at their design maxima for another twenty minutes though the charitable view keeping a careful watch on every aspect of the gsvs performance from its station a few realspace light days behind reported some odd events at the junctions of the sleeper services traction fields with the energy grid by now the yawning angel was existing in a state of quiveringly ghastly tension it was thinking at maximum capacity worrying at full speed suddenly and appallingly aware how long things took to happen a human in the same state would have been clutching a churning stomach tearing their hair out and gibbering incoherently look at these humans how could such glacial slowness even be called life an age could pass virtual empires rise and fall in the time they took to open their mouths to utter some new inanity ships even ships they were restricted to speeds below the speed of sound in the bubble of air around the ship and the docks it was joined to it reviewed how practicable it would be to just let the air go and move everything in vacuum it made sense thankfully it had already shifted all vulnerable pleasure craft out of the way and sealed and secured its unconnected hull apertures it told the hub what it was doing the hub objected because it was losing some of its air the gsv dumped the air anyway everything started moving a little faster the hub screamed in protest but it ignored it calm calm it had to remain calm stay focused keep the most important objectives in mind a wave of what would have been nausea in a human swept through the yawning angels mind as a signal came in from the charitable view now what whatever it might have feared this was worse the sleeper services acceleration factor had started to increase almost at the same time it had exceeded its normal maximum sustainable velocity fascinated appalled terrified the yawning angel listened to a running commentary on the other gsvs progress from its increasingly distant child even as it started the sequence of actions and commands that would lead to its own nearinstant departure twelve minutes early but that couldnt be helped and if people were pissed off too bad still increasing time to go disconnect there the charitable view signalled that the sleeper services outermost field extent had shrunk to within a kilometre of nakedhull minima the yawning angel dropped away from the orbital twisting and aiming and punching away into hyperspace only a few kilometres away from the worlds undersurface ignoring incandescent howls of protest from the hub over such impolite and feasibly dangerous behaviour and the astonished but slow so slow yelps from people who an instant earlier had been walking down a transit corridor towards a welcoming foyer in the gsv and now found themselves bumping into emergency sealfields and staring at nothing but blackness and stars the superlifters continuous report went on the sleeper services acceleration kept on increasing slowly but steadily then it paused dropping to zero the crafts velocity remained constant could that be it it was still catchable panic over then the fleeing ships velocity increased again as did its rate of acceleration impossible the horrific thought which had briefly crossed the yawning angels mind moments earlier settled down to stay with all the gruesome deliberation of a selfinvited house guest it did the arithmetic take a plate class gsvs locomotive power output per cubic kilometre of engine add on sixteen cubic klicks of extra drive at that pushpercube value make that thirtytwo at a time and it matched the step in the sleeper services acceleration it had just witnessed general bays great grief it had filled its general bays with engine the charitable view reported another smooth increase in the sleeper services rate of progress leading to another step another pause it was increasing its own acceleration to match the yawning angel sped after the two of them already fearing the worst do the sums do the sums the sleeper service had filled at least four of its general bays with extra engine bringingthem on line two at a time balancing the additional impetus another increase six probably all eight then what about the engineering space behind had that gone too sums sums how much mass had there been aboard the damn thing water gasgiant atmosphere highly pressurised about four thousand cubic kilometres of water alone four gigatonnes compress it alter it transmute it convert it into the ultra dense exotic materials that comprised an engine capable of reaching out and down to the energy grid that underlay the universe and pushing against it ample ample more than enough it would take months even years to build that sort of extra engine capacity or only days if youd spent say the last few decades preparing the ground dear holy shit if it was all engine even the superlifter wouldnt be able to keep up with it the average plate class could sustain about one hundred and four kilolights more or less indefinitely a good range class which was what the yawning angel had always been proud to count itself as could easily beat that by forty kilolights a cliff class superlifter was ninety per cent engine faster even than a rapid offensive unit in short bursts the charitable view could hit twotwentyone flat out but that was only supposed to be for an hour or two at a time that was chase speed catchup speed not something it could maintain for long the figure the yawning angel was looking at was the thick end of twothirtythree if the sleeper services engineering space had been packed with engine too the charitable views tone had already turned from one of amusement to amazement then bewilderment now it was plain peevish the sleeper service was topping the twofifteen mark and showing no signs of slowing down the superlifter would have to break away within minutes if it didnt topout soon it asked for instructions the yawning angel still accelerating for all its worth determined to track and follow for as long as it could or until it was asked to give up the chase told its offspring craft not to exceed its design parameters not to risk damage the sleeper service went on accelerating the superlifter charitable view gave up the chase at twotwenty it settled back to a less frenetic two hundred dropping back all the time even so it was still not a speed it could maintain for more than a few hours the yawning angel topped out at one fortysix the sleeper service finally hit cruise at around twothirtythree and a half disappearing ahead into the depths of galactic space the superlifter reported this but sounded like it couldnt believe it the yawning angel watched the other gsv race away into the everlasting night between the stars a sense of hopelessness of defeat settled over it now it knew it had shaken off its pursuers the sleeper services course was starting to curve gently no doubt the first of many ducks and weaves it would carry out if it was trying to conceal its eventual goal and assuming that it had a goal other than simply giving the slip to its minders somehow the yawning angel suspected its eccentric charge or excharge did have a definite goal a place a location it was headed for two hundred and thirtythree thousand times the speed of light dear holy fucking shit the yawning angel thought there was something almost vulgar about such a velocity where the hell was it heading for andromeda the yawning angel drew a courseprobability cone through the galactic model it kept in its mind it supposed it all depended how devious the sleeper service was being but it looked like it might be headed for the upper leaf swirl if it was it would be there within three weeks the yawning angel signalled ahead look on the bright side at least the problem was out of its fields now the avatar amorphia stood arms crossed thin blackgloved hands grasping at bony elbows gaze fastened intently upon the screen on the far side of the lounge it showed a compensated view of hyperspace vastly magnified looking into the screen was like peering into some vast planetary airscape far below was a layer of glowing mist representing the energy grid above was an identical layer of bright cloud the skein of real space lay in between both of these a twodimensional layer a simple transparent plane which the gsv went flickering through like a weaving shuttle across an infinite loom far far behind it the tiny dot that was the superlifter shrank still further it too had been bobbing up and down through the skein on a sine wave whose length was measured in light minutes but now it had stopped oscillating settling into the lower level of hyperspace the magnification jumped the superlifter was a larger dot now but still dropping back all the time a lightpoint tracing its own once wavy now straight course even further behind was the pursuing gsv the star of the dreve system was a bright spot back beyond that stationary in the skein the sleeper service reached its maximum velocity and also ceased to oscillate between the two regions of hyperspace settling into the larger of the two infinities that was ultraspace the two following ships did the same increasing their speed fractionally but briefly a purist would call the place where they now existed ultraspace one positive though as nobody had ever had access to ultraspace one negative or infraspace one positive for that matter it was a redundant even pedantic distinction or it had been until now that might be about to change if the excession could deliver what it appeared to promise amorphia took a deep breath and then let it go the view clicked off and the screen disappeared the avatar turned to look at the woman dajeil gelian and the black bird gravious they were in a recreation area on the ridge class gcu jaundiced outlook housed in a bay in one of the sleeper services midtop strakes the lounge was pretty well standard contact issue deceptively spacious stylishly comfortable punctuated by plants and subdued lighting this ship was to be the womans home for the rest of the journey a life boat ready to quit the larger craft at a moments notice and take her to safety if anything went wrong she sat on a white recliner chair dressed in a long red dress calm but wideeyed one hand cupped upon her swollen belly the black bird perched on one arm of the seat near her hand the avatar smiled down at the woman there it said it made a show of looking around alone at last it laughed lightly then looked down at the black bird its smile disappearing whereas you it said will not be again gravious jerked upright neck stretching what it asked gelian looked surprised then concerned amorphia glanced to one side a small device like a stubby pen floated out of the shadows cast by a small tree it coasted up to the bird which shrank back and back from the small silent missile until it almost fell off the arm of the chair its blueblack beak centimetres from the nose cone of the tiny intricate machine this is a scout missile bird amorphia told it do not be deceived by its innocent title if you so much as think of committing another act of treachery it will happily reduce you to hot gas it is going to follow you everywhere dont do as i have done do as i say and dont try to shake it off there is a tracer nanotech on you in you which will make it a simple matter to follow you it should be correctly embedded by now replacing the original tissue what the bird screeched again head jerking up and back if you want to remove it amorphia continued smoothly you may of course youll find it in your heart primary aortic valve the bird made a screaming noise and thrashed vertically into the air dajeil flinched covering her face with her hands gravious wheeled in the air and beat hard for the nearest corridor amorphia watched it go from beneath cold lidhooded eyes dajeil put both her hands on her abdomen she swallowed something black drifted down past her face and she picked it out of the air a feather sorry about that amorphia said what what was all that about gelian asked amorphia shrugged the bird is a spy it said flatly has been from the first it got its reports to the outside by encoding them on a bacterium and depositing them on the bodies of people about to be returned for reawakening i knew about it twenty years ago but let it pass after checking each signal it was never allowed to know anything the disclosure of which could pose a threat its last message was the only one i ever altered it helped facilitate our escape from the attentions of the yawning angel amorphia grinned almost childishly theres nothing further it can do i set the scout missile on it to punish it really if it distresses you ill call it off dajeil gelian looked up into the steady grey eyes of the cadaverous darkclad creature for some time quite as if she hadnt even heard the question amorphia she said please what is going on what is really going on the ships avatar looked pained for a moment it looked away towards the plant the scout missile had been hiding underneath whatever else it said awkwardly formally always remember that you are free to leave me at any time this gcu is entirely at your disposal and no order or request of mine will affect its actions it looked back at her it shook its head but its voice sounded kinder when it spoke again im sorry gelian i still cant tell you very much we are going to a place near a star called esperi the creature hesitated as though unsure gaze roaming the floor and the nearby seats because i want to it said eventually as though only realising this itself for the first time because there may be something i can do there it raised its arms out from its body let them fall again and in the meantime we await a guest or at any rate i await a guest you may not care to who the woman asked havent you guessed the avatar said softly byr genarhofoen the woman looked down then and her brows slowly creased and the dark feather she had caught fell from her fingers iii stuttered tight point m tra n xlsv serious callers only oeccentric shoot them later have you heard was i not right about genarhofoen do the times not now start to tally oo stuttered tight point m tra n xeccentric shoot them later olsv serious callers only yes two three three whats it doing going for some kind of record yes yes yes all right you were correct about the human but why didnt you have any warning of this oo i dont know two decades of reliable but totally boring reports and then just when it might have been handy to know what the big bugger was really up to the intelligence conduit caves in all i can think of is that our mutual friend oh hell might as well call it by its real name now i suppose is that the sleeper service discovered the link we dont know when and waited until it had something to hide before it started messing with our intelligence oo yes but whats it doing we thought it was just being invited to join the group out of politeness didnt we suddenly its acting like a fucking missile what is it up to oo this may seem rather obvious but we could always just ask it oo tried that still waiting well you could have said oo i beg your pardon so now what oo now i get a load of bullshit from the steely glint excuse me oo tight beam m tra n xlsv serious callers only ogcv steely glint our mutual friend with the velocity obsession this wouldnt be what we really expected would it some private deal by any chance oo tight beam m tra n xgcv steely glint olsv serious callers only no it isnt im getting fed up repeating this i should have posted a general notice no we wanted the damn things views some sort of entirely outside viewpoint not it tearing off to anywhere near the excession itself it was part of the gang before you know we owed it that no matter that it is now eccentric would that we had known how much now weve got another horrendous variable screwing up our plans if you have any helpful suggestions id be pleased to hear them if all you can do is make snide insinuations then it would probably benefit all concerned if you bestowed the fruits of your prodigious wit on someone with the spare time to give them the consideration they doubtless deserve oo stuttered tight point m tra n xlsv serious callers only oeccentric shoot them later signal file attached what did i tell you i dont know about this looks suspicious to me oo hmm and i dont know either i hate to say it but it sounds genuine of course if i prove to be wrong you will never confront me with this ever all right oo if after all this is over we are both still in a position for me to confer and you to benefit from such leniency i shall be infinitely glad to extend such forbearance oo well it could have been expressed more graciously but i accept this moral blank cheque with all the deference it merits oo im going to call the sleeper service it wont take any notice of me but im going to call the mealworm anyway iv genarhofoen didnt take his pen terminal with him when he went out that evening and the first place he visited in night city was a tiersintricateishlorsinami tech store the woman was small for an ishy thought genarhofoen still she towered over him she wore the usual long black robes and she smelled musty they sat on plain narrow seats in a bubble of blackness the woman was bent over a tiny foldaway screen balanced on her knees she nodded and craned her body over towards him her hand extended close to his left ear a sequence of shining telescoping rods extended from her fingers she closed her eyes in the dimness genarhofoen could see tiny lights flickering on the inside of her eyelids her hand touched his ear tickling slightly he felt his face twitch dont move she said he tried to stay still the woman withdrew her hand she opened her eyes and peered at the point where the tips of three of the delicate rods met she nodded and said hmm genarhofoen bent forward and looked too he couldnt see anything the woman closed her eyes again her lid screens glowed again very sophisticated she said could have missed it genarhofoen looked at his right palm sure theres nothing on this hand he asked recalling verlioef schungs firm handshake as sure as i can be the woman said withdrawing a small transparent container from her robe and dropping whatever she had taken out of his ear into it he still couldnt see anything there and the suit he asked fingering one lapel of his jacket clean the woman said so thats it he asked that is all she told him the black bubble disappeared and they were sitting in a small room whose walls were lined with shelves overflowing with impenetrably technicallooking gear well thanks that will be eight hundred tiersintricatehour equivalents oh call it a round thousand he walked along street six in the heart of night city tier there were night cities throughout the developed galaxy it was a kind of condominium franchise though nobody seemed to know to whom the franchise belonged night cities varied a lot from place to place the only certain things about them was that it would always be night when you got there and youd have no excuse for not having fun night city tier was situated on the middle level of the world on a small island in a shallow sea the island was entirely covered by a shallow dome ten kilometres across and two in height internally the city tended to take its cue from each years festival the last time genarhofoen had been here the place had taken on the appearance of a magnified oceanscape all its buildings turned into waves between one and two hundred metres tall the theme that year had been the sea street six had existed in the long trough between two exponentially swept surges ripples on the towering curves of the waves surfaces had been balconies burning with lights luminous foam at each waves looming overhanging crest had cast a pallid sepulchral light over the winding street beneath at either end of the street the broadway had risen to meet crisscrossing wave fronts and connect through oceanically inauthentic tunnels with other highways the theme this year was the primitive and the city had chosen to interpret this as a gigantic early electronic circuit board the network of silvery streets formed an almost perfectly flat cityscape studded with enormous resistors denselooking centipedally legged flattopped chips spindly diodes and huge semitransparent valves with complicated internal structures each standing on groups of shining metal legs embedded in the network of the printed circuit those were the bits that genarhofoen sort of half recognised from his history of technical stuff course or whatever it had been called when hed been a student there were lots of other jagged knobbly smooth brightly coloured matt black shiny vaned crinkled bits he didnt know the purpose or the name of street six this year was a fifteenmetre wide stream of quickly flowing mercury covered with etched diamond sheeting every now and again large coherent blobs of sparkling bluegold went speeding along the mercury stream underfoot apparently these were symbolised electrons or something the original idea had been to incorporate the mercury channels into the city transport system but this had proved impractical and so they were there just for effect the city tube system ran deep underground as usual genarhofoen had jumped on and off a few of the underground cars on his way to the city and on and off a couple more once hed arrived hoping to give the slip to anybody following having done this and had the tracer in his ear removed he was happy hed done the best he could to ensure that his evenings fun would take place unobserved by sc though he wasnt particularly bothered if they were still watching him it was more the principle of the thing no point getting obsessive about it street six itself was packed with people walking talking staggering strolling rolling along within bubblespheres riding on exotically accoutred animals riding in small carriages drawn by ysnermistretl pairs and floating along under small vacuum balloons or in force field harnesses above in the eternal night sky beneath the citys vast dome this part of the evenings entertainment was being provided by a citywide hologram of an ancient bomber raid the sky was filled with hundreds and hundreds of winged aircraft with four or six piston engines each many of them picked out by searchlights spasms of light leaving blackonblack clouds and blossoming spheres of dimming red sparks were supposed to be antiaircraft fire while in amongst the bombers smaller single and twinengined aircraft whizzed the two sorts of aircraft were shooting at each other the large planes from turrets and the smaller ones from their wings and noses gently curving lines of white yellow and red tracer moved slowly across the sky and every now and again an aircraft seemed to catch fire and start to fall out of the sky occasionally one would explode in mid air all the time the dark shapes of bombs could be glimpsed falling to explode with bright flashes and vivid gouts of flame on parts of the city seemingly always just a little way off genarhofoen thought it all looked a little contrived and he doubted thered ever been such a concentrated air battle or one in which the ground fire kept up while interceptor planes did their intercepting but as a show it was undeniably impressive explosions gunfire and sirens sounded above the chatter of people filling the street and was sporadically submerged by the music spilling from the hundreds of bars and multifarious entertainment venues lining the street the air was full of halfstrange halffamiliar entirely enticing smells and wild pheremonic effects understandably banned everywhere else on tier genarhofoen strolled down the middle of the street a large glass of tier in one hand a cloud cane in the other and a small puffcreant nestling on one shoulder of his immaculately presented ownskin jacket the was a cocktail which notoriously involved about three hundred separate processes to make many of them involving unlikely and even unpleasant combinationsof plants animals and substances the end result was an acceptable if strongtasting drink composed largely of alcohol no more but you didnt really drink it for the internal effect you drank it to show you could afford to they put it in a special crystal fieldgoblet so you could show that you could the name was meant to imply that after sinking a few you were ninety per cent certain to get laid and fifty per cent assured of ending up in legal trouble or it may have been the other way round genarhofoen could never remember the cloud cane was a walking stick burning compressed pellets of a mildly and briefacting psychotropic mixture taking a suck on its pierced top cap was like sliding two distorting lenses in front of your eyes sticking your head underwater and shoving a chemical factory up your nose while standing in a shifting gravity field the puffcreant was a small symbiont half animal half vegetable which you paid to squat on your shoulder and cough up your nose every time you turned your face towards it the cough contained spores that could do any one of about thirty different and interesting things to your perceptions and moods genarhofoen was particularly pleased with his new suit it was made of his own skin genetically altered in various subtle ways specially vatgrown and carefully tailored to his exact specifications hed donated a few skin cells to and left the order and payment with a genetailor here on tier two and a half years earlier when he was on his way to godshole habitat it had been a whim after a drinking session as had an animated obscene tattoo hed removed a month later he hadnt really expected to pick the suit up for a while fortunately longterm fashions hadnt changed too much in the interim the suit and its accompanying cloak looked terrific he felt great spadassins digladiate ziffidae and xebecs contend goliard dunking slogans signs announcements odours and personal greeters vied for attention advertising emporia and venues stunning scapes and scenes played out in sensorium bubbles bulging out into the centre of the street putting you instantly into bedrooms feasthalls arenae harems seaships fair rides space battles states of temporary ecstasy tempting prompting suggesting offering providing entrance stimulating appetites prompting desires suggesting propositioning pandering rhyparography keloidal anamnesis ivresse genarhofoen walked through it all soaking it all in refusing all the offers and suggestions politely turning down the overtures and comeons the recommendations and invitations zufulos orpharions rastrae naumachia hourly for now he was content just to be here walking promenading watching and being watched sizing up and with any luck being sized up it was evening real evening in this level of tier the time when night city started to become busy everywhere was open nowhere was full everybody wanted your custom but nobody was really settling on a venue yet just cruising grazing petting genarhofoen was happy to be part of that general drift he loved this he gloried in it this was where he felt most himself for now there was simply no better place to be and he believed in entering into the experience with all due and respectful intensity these were his sort of people here was where his sort of thing happened and this was his sort of place pilious omadhauns invite rasure lagophthalmiscity guaranteed when you see the jeistiecors and loricas of our martichorastic minikins he saw her outside a sublimer sekos set under the rotundly swollen bulk of a building shaped like a giant resistor the entrance to the cults sacred place was a brightly shining loop like a thick but tiny rainbow layered in different shades of white young sublimers stood outside the enclosure clad in glowing white robes the sublimers each tall and thin glowed too their skin glowed gently pallid to the point of unhealthylooking bloodlessness their eyes shone soft light spilling from the wide open whites while the same halfsilvery light was projected from their teeth when they smiled they smiled all the time even when they were talking the woman was standing looking at the pair of enthusiastically gesticulating sublimers with an expression of amused disdain she was tall tawnyskinned her face was broad her nose thin and almost parallel with the planes of her cheeks her arms were crossed her body tilted back from the two young people her weight taken on one blackbooted heel as she looked down that long nose at the shining sublimers her eyes and her hair looked as dark as the featureless shadowrobe which hid the rest of her frame he stopped in the middle of the street and watched her arguing with the two sublimers for a few moments her gestures and the way she held her body were different but the face was very similar to the way he remembered her looking forty years ago just a little older perhaps he had always wondered how much shed changed but it couldnt be her tishlin had said she was still on board the sleeper theyd have mentioned if shed left wouldnt they he let a group of squatly chortling bystlians pass him then sauntered a little way back up the street studying the architecture of the giant valve bulging over it from the opposite pavement and sniffing from his cloud cane in a vague bored manner while watching a line of dark bombs flit out of the darkness above to fall and detonate somewhere beyond the line of barrellike resistors that formed the other side of the street bright yelloworange explosions lit up the sky and debris rose slowly and fell further up the avenue some sort of commotion surrounded a large animal he turned and looked back down the crowded street at that moment a giant bluegold shape slid under his feet rushing silently along within the mercury stream beneath the diamond plate the girl arguing with the sublimers turned glancing at the street as the blob went gliding past as she looked back to the two young glowing people she caught sight of him watching her her gaze settled on him for a moment and the flicker of an expression a glimmer of recognition passed briefly over her face before she started talking to the sublimers again he hadnt had time to look away even if hed wanted to he was wondering whether he ought to go over to her now wait and see if she stepped back into the thoroughfare and maybe approach her then or just walk away when a tall girl in a glowing gown stepped up to him and said may i help you sir you seem taken with our place of exaltation do you have any questions youd like to ask is there anything i can do to enlighten you he turned to the sublimer she was almost as tall as he her face was pretty but somehow vacuous though he knew that might have been prejudice on his part sublimers had turned what was a normal but generally optional part of a species choice of fate into a religion sublimers believed that everybody ought to sublime that every human every animal every machine and mind ought to head straight for ultimate transcendence leaving the mundane life behind and setting as direct a course as possible for nirvana people who joined the cult spent a year trying to persuade others of this before they sublimed themselves joining one of the sects groupminds to contemplate irreality the few drones other ais and minds that became persuaded of the merit of this course of action through the arguments of the sublimers tended to do what any other machine did on such occasions and disappear in the direction of the nearest sublimed entity though one or two stuck around in a presublimed state long enough to help the cause in general though the cult was regarded as rather a pointless one subliming was seen as something that usually happened to entire societies and more as a practical lifestyle alteration than a religious commitment more like moving house than entering a sacred order well i dont know genarhofoen said sounding wary what exactly do you people believe in again the sublimer looked up the street behind him oh we believe in the power of the sublime she said let me tell you more she glanced up the avenue again oh perhaps we ought to get off the street dont you think she held out her hand and took a step back towards the pavement genarhofoen looked back to where things were getting noisy the giant animal hed noticed earlier a sexipedal pondrosaur was advancing slowly down the avenue in the midst of a retinue and a crowd of spectators the shaggy brownfurred animal was six metres tall splendidly liveried with long gaudy banners and ribbons and commanded by a garishly uniformed mahout brandishing a fiery mace the beast was surmounted by a glitteringly black and silver cupola whose bulbously filigreed windows gave no hint of who or what might be inside similarly ornamented bowls covered the great animals eyes it was attended by five loping kliestrithrals each black tusked creature pawing at the street surface and snorting and held on a tight lead by a burly hire guard a knot of people held the procession up the pondrosaur paused and put its long head back to let out a surprisingly soft subdued roar then it adjusted its eyecups with its two legthick forelimbs and bobbed its head to either side the gaggle of promenaders began to disperse and the great beast and its escorts moved forward again hmm yes genarhofoen said perhaps wed better move out the way he finished the and looked round for a place to deposit the empty container please allow me the sublimer girl took the fieldgoblet from him as though it was some sort of holy object genarhofoen followed her onto the sidewalk she put an arm through his and they proceeded slowly towards the entrance to the sekos where the woman was still standing talking to the other two sublimers with her look of ironic curiosity have you heard of sublimers before the girl on his arm asked oh yes he said watching the other womans face as they approached they stopped on the pavement outside the sublimer building entering a hushfield in which the only sound was gently tinkling music and a background of waves on a beach you believe everybody should just sort of disappear up their own arses dont you he asked with every appearance of innocence he was only a few metres from the woman in the shadowrobe though the compartmented hushfield meant he couldnt hear what she was saying her face was much like he remembered it the eyes and mouth were the same she had never worn her hair up like that but even its shade of blackblue was the same oh no the sublimer girl said her expression terribly serious what we believe in takes one completely away from such bodily concerns out of the corner of his eye he could see up the street where the pondrosaur was shuffling forwards through a thick crowd of admirers he smiled at the sublimer girl as she talked on he shifted a little so that he could see the other woman better no it wasnt her of course it wasnt shed have recognised him shed have reacted by now even if shed been trying to pretend she hadnt seen him hed have been able to tell shed never been very good at hiding her feelings from anybody least of all from him she glanced at him again then quickly away he felt a sudden unbidden sensation of fearful pleasure a jolt of excitement which left his skin tingling highest expression of our quintessential urge to be greater than we he nodded and looked at the sublimer girl who was still babbling away he frowned a little and stroked his chin with his free hand still nodding he kept watching the other woman out on the street the pondrosaur and its retinue had come to a stop almost alongside them a tier sintricate was hovering level with the giant animals mahout who seemed to be arguing angrily with it the woman was smiling at the other two sublimers with what appeared to be an expression of tolerant ridicule she kept her eyes on the sublimer fellow doing the talking at that point but took a long deep breath and just as she let it out glanced at genarhofoen again with the briefest of smiles and a flick of her eyebrows before looking back at the sublimers and tipping her head just a little to one side he wondered would sc really go this far to keep him under their control or at least under their eye how likely was it that he should find somebody who looked so much like her he supposed there must be hundreds of people who bore a passing resemblance to dajeil gelian perhaps there were even a few who had heard something about her and deliberately assumed her appearance that happened all the time with genuinely famous people and just because hed never heard of anybody taking on dajeils looks didnt mean nobody had ever done so if this person was one of them it was just possible he would have to be on his guard personal ambition or the desire to better oneself or to provide opportunities for ones children is but a pale reflection of compared to the ultimate transcendence which true subliming offers for as it is written genarhofoen leant closer to the girl talking to him and tapped her lightly on the shoulder im sure he said quietly would you excuse me for just a moment he took the two steps over to the woman in the shadowrobe she turned her head from the two sublimers and smiled politely at him excuse me he asked dont i know you from somewhere he grinned as he said it acknowledging both the wellworn nature of the line and the fact that neither he nor she was really interested in what the sublimers had to say she nodded her head politely to him i dont think so she said her voice was higher than dajeils more girlish and with a quite different accent though if we had met and you hadnt altered in some way and id forgotten certainly id be far too ashamed to admit it she smiled he did the same she frowned unless do you live on tier just passing through he told her a bomber in flames tore past just overhead and exploded in a burst of light behind the sublimer building on the street the argument around the pondrosaur seemed to be getting more heated the animal itself was staring intently at the sintricate and its mahout was standing up on its neck pointing the flaming mace at the darkly spiny being to emphasise whatever points he was making but ive been this way before genarhofoen said perhaps we bumped into each other then she nodded thoughtfully perhaps she conceded oh you two know each other said the young sublimer man shed been talking to well many people find that subliming in the company of a loved one or just somebody they know is do you play calascenic crasis she asked cutting across the young sublimer you may have seen me at a game here she put her head back looking down that long nose at him if so im disappointed you left it till now to say hello ah the sublimer lad said games an expression of the urge to enter into worlds beyond ourselves another ive never even heard of the game he confessed do you recommend it oh yes she said and sounded ironic it benefits all who play well im always willing to entertain some new experience perhaps you could teach me ah now the ultimate new experience began the sublimer lad genarhofoen turned to him and said oh shut up it had been an instinctive reaction and for a moment he was worried he might have said the wrong thing but she didnt seem to be regarding the young sublimers hurt look with any great degree of sympathy she looked back to him all right she said you stand me my stake and ill teach you crasis he smiled wondering if that had been too easy its a deal he said he waved the cloud cane under his nose and took a deep breath then bowed my names byr pleased to meet you she nodded again call me flin she said and taking hold of the cane waved it under her own nose shall we flin he said and indicated the street beyond where the pondrosaur had sunk to its belly its four legs doubled up underneath it and both forelimbs folded beneath its chin as though bored two sintricates were shouting at the enraged mahout who was shaking the flaming mace at them the hire guards were looking nervous and patting the restless kliestrithrals certainly remember where you met the sublimer called after them subliming is the ultimate meeting of souls the pinnacle of they left the hushfield his voice was drowned out by the thudding of projected antiaircraft fire as they walked along the pavement so where are we going he asked her well you can take me for a drink and then well hit a crasis bar i know sound all right sounds fine shall we take a trap he said pointing a little way up the street to a twowheeled open vehicle waiting by the kerb a ysnermistretl pair were harnessed between the traces the ysner craning its long neck down to peck at a feed bag in the gutter the small smartly uniformed mistretl on its back looking around alertly and tapping its thumbs together good idea she said they walked up to the trap and climbed aboard the collyrium lounge the woman said to the mistretl as they sat in the rear of the small vehicle it saluted and pulled a whip out from its fancy jerkin the ysner made a sighing noise the trap shook suddenly a great deep burst of noise came from the street behind them they all looked round the pondrosaur was rearing up bellowing its mahout nearly fell off its neck his mace tumbled from his grasp and bounced on the street two of the kliestrithrals jumped up and leapt into the crowd snarling and dragging their handlers with them the two sintricates whod been arguing with the mahout rose quickly into the air out of the way people in float harnesses took avoiding action through the confusion of searchlight beams and antiaircraft fire flin and genarhofoen watched people scatter in all directions as the pondrosaur leapt forward with surprising agility and started charging down the street towards them the mahout clung desperately to the beasts ears screeching at it to stop the stabilised black and silver cupola on the animals back seemed to float along above it until the animals increasing speed forced it to oscillate from side to side at genarhofoens side flin seemed frozen genarhofoen glanced round at the mistretl well he said lets get going the little mistretl blinked quickly still staring up the street another bellow echoed off the surrounded buildings genarhofoen looked back again the charging pondrosaur reached up with one forelimb and ripped its eyecups off to reveal huge faceted blue eyes like chunks of ancient ice with its other limb it gripped the mahout by one shoulder and wrenched him off its neck he wriggled and flailed but it brushed him to one side and onto the pavement he landed running fell and rolled the pondrosaur itself thundered on down the street people threw themselves out of its way somebody in a bubblesphere didnt move fast enough the giant transparent ball was kicked to the side smashing into a hot foodstall flames leapt from the wreckage shit genarhofoen said as the giant bore down upon them he turned to the mistretl driver again he could see the face of the ysner turned back to look up the street behind too its big face expressing only mild surprise move he shouted the mistretl nodded goo iea it chirped it reached behind to slip a knot on the rear of the ysner and jabbed its bootheels into the animals lower neck the startled ysner took off leaving the trap behind the vehicle tipped forward as the ysnermistretl pair disappeared down the rapidly clearing street genarhofoen and flin were thrown forward in a tangle of harnesses he heard her shout fuck then go oof as they hit the street something hit him hard on the head he blacked out for a moment then came to looking up at a huge face a monstrous face gazing down at him with huge prismed blue eyes then he saw the womans face the face of dajeil gelian she had blood on her top lip she looked groggily at him and then turned to gaze up at the huge animal face looking down at them there was a sort of buzzing sensation from somewhere genarhofoen felt his legs go numb the woman collapsed over his legs he felt sick lines of red dots crossing the sky floated behind his eyelids when they closed when he forced his eyes open again she was there again somebody looking like dajeil gelian who wasnt her except it wasnt flin either she was dressed differently she was taller and her expression was not the same and anyway flin was still draped unconscious over his legs he really didnt understand what was going on he shook his head this hurt the girl who wasnt dajeil or flin stooped quickly looked into his eyes whirled the cloak off her shoulders and onto the street beside him in one movement then rolled him over onto it heaving flins immobile body out of the way as she did so he tried waving his arms around but it didnt do much good the cloak went rigid underneath him and floated into the air wrapping round him he cried out and tried to fight against its enclosing black folds but the buzzing came again and his vision faded even before the cloak finished wrapping itself round him killing time i the usual way to explain it was by analogy this was how the idea was introduced to you as a child imagine you were travelling through space and you came to this planet which was very big and almost perfectly smooth and on which there lived creatures who were composed of one layer of atoms in effect twodimensional these creatures would be born live and die like us and they might well possess genuine intelligence they would initially have no idea or grasp of the third dimension but they would be able to live perfectly well in their two dimensions to them a line would be like a wall across their world or from the end it would look like a point an unbroken circle would be like a locked room perhaps if they were able to build machines which allowed them to journey at great speed along the surface of their planet which to them would be their universe they would go right round the planet and come back to where they had started from more likely they would be able to work this out from theory either way they would realise that their universe was both closed and curved and that there was in fact a third dimension even if they had no practical access to it being familiar with the idea of circles they would probably christen the shape of their universe a hypercircle rather than inventing a new word the threedimensional people would of course call it a sphere the situation was similar for people living in three dimensions at some point in any civilisation starting to become advanced it was realised that if you set off into space in what appeared to be a perfectly straight line eventually you would arrive back at where you started because your threedimensional universe was really a fourdimensional shape being familiar with the idea of spheres people tended to christen this shape a hypersphere usually around the same point in a societys development it was understood that unlike the planet where the twodimensional creatures lived space was not simply curved into a hypersphere it was also expanding gradually increasing in size like a soapbubble on the end of a straw which somebody was blowing into to a fourdimensional being looking from far enough away the threedimensional galaxies would look like tiny designs imprinted onto the surface of that expanding bubble each of them generally heading away from all the others because of the hyperspheres general expansion but like the shifting whorls and loops of colour visible on the skin of a soap bubble able to slide and move around on that surface of course the fourdimensional hypersphere had no equivalent of the straw blowing air in from outside the hypersphere was expanding all by itself like a fourdimensional explosion with the implication that once it had been simply a point a tiny seed which had indeed exploded that detonation had created or at least had produced matter and energy time and the physical laws themselves later cooling coalescing and changing over immense amounts of time and expansion it had given rise to the cool ordered threedimensional universe which people could see around them eventually in the progress of a technologically advanced society occasionally after some sort of limited access to hyperspace more usually after theoretical work it was realised that the soap bubble was not alone the expanding universe lay inside a larger one which in turn was entirely enclosed by a bubble of spacetime with a still greater diameter the same applied within the universe you happened to find yourself onin there were smaller younger universes inside it nested within like layers of paper round a muchwrapped spherical present in the very centre of all the concentric inflating universes lay the place they had each originated from where every now and again a cosmic fireball blinked into existence detonating once more to produce another universe its successive outpourings of creation like the explosions of some vast combustion engine and the universes its pulsing exhaust there was more complications in seven dimensions and beyond that involved a giant torus on which the d universe could be described as a circle contained and containing other nested tori with further implications of whole populations of such metarealities but the implications of multiple concentric sequential universes was generally considered enough to be going on with for the moment what everybody wanted to know was whether there was any way of travelling from one universe to another between any pair of universes there was more than just empty hyperspace there was a thing called an energy grid it was useful strands of it could help power ships and it had been used as a weapon but it was also an obstacle and by all accounts so far one which had proved impenetrable to intelligent investigation certain black holes appeared to be linked to the grid and perhaps therefore to the universe beyond but nobody had ever made it intact into one or ever reappeared in any recognisable form there were white holes too ferociously violent sources spraying torrents of energy into the universe with the power of a million suns and which also seemed to be linked to the grid but no body no ship or even information had ever been observed appearing from their tumultuous mouths no equivalent of an airborne bacteria no word no language just that incoherent scream of cascading energies and super energetic particles the dream that every involved had which virtually every technologically advanced civilisation clove to with almost religious faith was that one day it would be possible to travel from one universe to another to step up or down through those expanding bubbles so that apart from anything else one need never suffer the final fate of ones own universe to achieve that would surely be to sublime truly to transcend to consummate the ultimate surpassing and accomplish the ultimate empowerment the river class general contact unit fate amenable to change lay in space it was locally stationary taking its reference from the excession the excession was equally static taking its reference from the star esperi the entity sat there a few light minutes away a featureless dot on the skein of real space with a single equally dulllooking strand of twisted compressed spacetime fabric leading down to the lower layer of energy grid and a second leading upwards to the higher layer the excession was doing exactly what it had been doing for the past two weeks nothing the fate amenable to change had carried out all the standard initial measurements and observations of the entity but had been very forcefully advised indeed not to do any more no direct contact was to be attempted not even by probes smaller craft or drones in theory it could disobey it was its own ship it could make up its own mind but in practice it had to heed the advice of those who knew if not more than it better than it collective responsibility also known as sharing the blame so all it had done after the first exciting bit when it had been the centre of attention and everybody had wanted to know all it could tell them about the thing it had found had been to hang around here still at the focus of events in a sense but also feeling somehow ignored reports it filed reports it had long since stopped trying to make them different or original the ship was bored it was also aware of a continuing undercurrent of fear a real emotion that it was by turns annoyed at ashamed of and indifferent to according to its mood it waited it watched beyond it around it most of its small fleet of modules and satellites a few of its most spacecapable drones and a variety of specialist devices it had constructed specifically for the purpose also floated watching and waiting inside the vessel its human crew discussed the situation monitored the data coming in from the ships own sensors and those coming in from the small cloud of dispersed machines the ship passed some of the time by making up elaborate games for the humans to play meanwhile it kept up its observation of the excession and scanned the space around waiting for the first of the other ships to arrive sixteen days after the culture craft had stumbled upon the excession and six days after the discovery had been made public the first ship appeared its presence noted initially within the fate amenable to changes main sensor array the gcu moved one state of readiness higher signalled what was happening to the ethics gradient and the not invented here fastened its track scanner on the incoming signal began a tentative reconfiguration of its remote sensor platforms and started to move towards the newcomer round the perimeter of the excessions safe limit at a speed it hoped was pitched nicely between polite deliberation and alarmraising urgency it sent a standard interrogatory signal burst to the approaching craft the vessel was the sober counsel an explorer ship of the zetetic elenchs stargazer clans fifth fleet the fate amenable to change felt relief the elench were friends identifications completed the two ships rendezvoused locally stationary just a few tens of kilometres apart on the outskirts of the safe limit from the excession the culture vessel had set welcome thank you dear holy stasis is that thing attached to the grid or is it my sensors if its your sensors its mine too impressive isnt it becomes greatly less so once youve sat looking at it for a week or two take my word for it i hope youre just here to observe thats all im doing waiting on the big guns thats right when do they arrive thats restricted promise this wont go outside the elench promise a medium sv gets here in twelve days the first general sv in fourteen then one every few days for a week then one a day then several a day by which time i expect a few other involveds will probably have started to show dont ask me what the gsvs will consider a quorum before they act how about you can we talk off the record just the two of us all right we have another ship heading here two days away still the rest of the fleet are still undecided though they have stopped drawing further away we lost a ship somewhere round here the peace makes plenty ah did you indeed about when some time between and this is still confidential within the elench then yes we searched this volume as best we could for two weeks but found nothing what brought you here suggestion by my home gsv the ethics gradient that was in wanted me to look in the upper leaf swirl cloud top no reason given bumped into this on the way there thats all i know and the fate amenable to change thought coldly about that suggestion the cloud top volume was a long way from here but that meant nothing what mattered was that it had been given a relatively precise location within the cloud top to head for and been given the subtlest of hints to watch out for anything interesting while en route given where it had been when it had received the suggestion from its home gsv its route had inevitably taken it near the excession thirtysix days had elapsed between the date the elench knew they might have lost a ship and the time when it had been dispatched on what was starting to look a little like a setup it wondered what had taken place in between could some elench ship have leaked word to the culture but then how had such a leak apparently produced such accuracy given that it a single ship had practically run straight into the damn excession while the elench had spent two weeks here with seveneighths of a full fleet and spotted nothing feel free to ask the ethics gradient what prompted its suggestion it added thank you youre welcome id like to try contacting the excession this might be where our comrade disappeared at the least it might have some information at most and for all we know our ship is still in there i want to talk to it maybe send a droneship in if it doesnt reply madness this thing is welded into the grids both directions know anything that can do that me neither im not even going to start feeling safe until theres a fleet of gsvs round here heck i was pleased to see you there company at last i thought somebody to pass the time with while i sit out my lonely vigil now you want to start poking this thing with a stick are you crazy no but we might have a ship in distress in there i cant just sit here doing nothing have you attempted to contact the entity no i sent back a pro forma to its initial hello but wait a moment look at the signal it sent signal enclosed there you see i told you that was probably an elenchsourced handshake burst meatshit yes i see well maybe your pal did find the damn thing first but if it did it probably did exactly what youre proposing to do and its gone disappeared you seeing where this is leading i intend to be careful uhhuh was your comrade vessel notoriously careless indeed not well then i appreciate your concern was there any sign of contention in the volume when you got here emergency or distress signals voyage event record ejectiles there was this here material analysislocation enclosed but if you want to mention any of this stuff on record youd better make it look like you just stumbled across the debris all right thank you yes of course looks like one of our littledrones was caught up in something hmm sort of smells subsidiary somehow dont you think possibly i know what you mean its untidy back on record okay i hereby give notice i intend to attempt to contact the entity i beg you not to let me make a request that you be allowed to take part in the culture investigation when it takes place im sure there is every chance you will be welcome to share in the relevant data im sorry i have my own reasons for considering the matter urgent off record again all right my records show you to be to all intents and purposes identical to the peace makes plenty yes go on dont you see look if this thing jeopardised your comrade with no more fuss than an escaped littledrone whats it going to be able to do now that its had a chance to pick over the structure and mindset of your sister craft for at least sixtysix days i have the benefit of being forewarned and the entity may not have been able entirely to take over the peace makes plenty yet the ship might be inside there under siege perhaps all the entitys intellectual energies are being absorbed in the maintenance of that blockade that being the case my intervention may lift the siege and free my comrade cousin this is selfdelusion we have already dealt with the issue of the minimal extra safeguarding provided by you having been alerted to the entitys potential danger the peace makes plenty could hardly have been less prepared i appreciate your feelings towards your fellow craft and fleetmate but it rends the bounds of possibility to believe that something capable of perpetuating egrid links in both directions is going to be substantially troubled by craft with the capabilities of ourselves the excession has not troubled me but then i did not trouble it we exchanged greetings no more what you propose might be construed as interference or even as a hostile act i have accepted a duty to observe and wont be able to help you if you get into trouble please please reconsider i take your point i still intend to attempt communication with the entity but i shall not recommend that a drone approach be made i have to put all this to my humans of course but they usually concur naturally i urge you to argue strongly against sending any object towards the excession should your human crew suggest this ill see which way they jump this could take a while they like arguing dont

thirty minutes thanks to your delaying tactics commander it probably already suspects something and may well have signalled back to whoever sent it already think yourself lucky we have as much as half an hour to prepare it is being cautious they had resealed the airlocks from the accommodation section and pumped in some real atmosphere commander risingmoon parchseason iv of the farsight tribe had been able to shed his space suit some days earlier the gravity was still far too mild but it was better than floating the commander clicked his beak at the image on the screen presented by the mobile command centre theyd set up in what had been the humans poolgrowing unit a lieutenant at the commanders side spoke quietly but urgently to the twenty other affronters distributed throughout the bases caverns letting them know what was going on the commander looked back impatiently waiting for the servant whod been sent to fetch his suit the instant the culture warship had appeared on the other crafts sensors on secondary screens he could see suited affronter technicians their machines and some slaved drones working on the exteriors of the stored ships they had about half of them ready to get out and go a decent fleet but they needed the rest and preferably all at once and as a complete surprise to the culture and everybody else cant you destroy it the commander asked the traitor culture vessel he glanced at the status of the nearest affront vessels far too far away they had avoided approaching pittance in case they could be monitored by other culture craft the attitude adjuster didnt like vocalising it preferred to print out its side of a conversation if it gets to within a few minutes yes perhaps it might have been relatively easy if i could have caught it completely unawares however i doubt that was ever very likely given that it must have been suspicious to come here in the first place and is almost certainly completely out of the question now what about the ships weve cleared commander they havent been woken up yet until ive done that theyre useless and if we wake half of them now theyll have too long to think too much time to do their own checking around before we need them for the main action our project must all happen in a rush in a state of perceived chaos panic and urgency or it cannot happen effectively at all there was a pause while the message scrolled along and off the screen then commander i suspect this will be a formality but i have to ask do you wish to admit to what has happened here and turn your command over without a fight to the rou killing time this will probably be our last opportunity to avoid hostilities dont be ridiculous the commander said sourly i thought not very well i shall vector away in the skeinshadow of the rock and try to loop round behind the rou let it enter the defence system wait until its a week inside no more and then set everything you have upon it i urge you again commander turn over the tactical command apparatus to me no the commander said leave and do whatever you think will best jeopardise the culture vessel i shall allow it to arrive at a point three weeks in and then attack i am on my way do not let the ship come within a light week of the store itself commander i know how it will think if it is attacked this is not some genteel orbital mind or a nicely timorous general contact unit this is a culture warship showing every sign of being fully armed and ready to press matters what creeping in as it is the commander sneered commander you would be amazed and appalled at how few bright sides there are concerning the appearance and behaviour of a warship like this the fact its not charging in through the defence screen and metaphorically skidding to a stop is almost certainly a bad sign it probably means its one of the wily ones i repeat do not wait until it is most of the way into the defence system before opening fire assaulted so far inside the defensive field it may well figure that it has no chance of escape and so might as well continue towards you and attack and at that sort of range it would stand a decent chance of being able to obliterate the entire store and all the ships within it the commander felt almost annoyed that the ship hadnt appealed to his own personal sense of selfpreservation very well he snapped half way in two weeks commander no that is still too close if we cannot destroy the ship in the first instant of the engagement it must be presented with a reasonable opportunity to escape otherwise it may go for glory rather than attempt to extricate itself but if it escapes it can alert the culture if our attack is not immediately successful it will signal elsewhere anyway assuming it has not already done so we shall not be able to stop it in that case we shall have been discovered though with any luck that will only put our plans out by a few days believe me the crafts physical escape will not bring the culture here any quicker than a signal would you will be putting this entire mission in jeopardy if you allow the vessel to come within more than three light weeks of the store all right the commander spat he flicked a tentacle over the glowing board of the command desk the communication link was cut the attitude adjuster did not attempt to reestablish it your suit sir said a voice from behind the commander whirled round to find the gelding midshipman uniformed but not suited with his space suit in his limbs oh at last the commander screamed he flicked a tentacle at the creatures eye stalks the blow bounced them back off its casing the gelding whimpered and fell back gas sac deflating the commander grabbed his suit and pulled himself inside it the midshipman staggered along the floor half blinded the commander ordered his lieutenant to reconfigure the command desk from here they could personally control all the systems that had been entrusted by the culture to the mind which the traitor ship had killed the command desk was like an ultimate instrument of destruction a giant keyboard to play death tunes on some of the keys admittedly had to be left to trigger themselves once set but these controls really did control the holo screen projected a sphere out towards the commander the globe displayed the volume of real space around pittance with tiny green white and gold flecks representing major components of the defence system a dull blue dot represented the approaching warship coasting in towards them another dot bright red on the directly opposite side of the ship store from the blue dot and much closer though drawing quickly away was the traitor ship attitude adjuster another screen alongside showed an abstracted hyperspatial view of the same situation indicating the two ships on different surfaces of the skein a third screen showed a transparent abstract of pittance itself detailing its shipfilled caverns and surface and internal defence systems the commander finished getting into his space suit and powering it up he settled back into position he reviewed the situation he knew better than to try to conduct matters at a tactical level but he appreciated the strategic influence he could wield here he was dreadfully tempted all the same to take personal control and fire all the defence systems personally but he was aware of the enormous responsibility he had been given in this mission and was equally conscious that he had been carefully selected for this task he had been chosen because he knew when not to what had the traitor ship called it go for glory he knew when not to go for glory he knew when to back off when to take advice when to retreat and regroup he flicked open the communicator channel to the traitor ship did the warship stop exactly a light month out he asked yes thats thirtytwo standard culture days correct thank you he closed the channel he looked at the lieutenant at his side set everything within range to open fire on the warship the instant it crosses the eightpoint one days limit he sat back as the lieutenants limbs flickered over the holo displays putting his command into effect only just in time the commander noted hed been longer getting into his suit than hed thought forty seconds sir the lieutenant said give it just enough time to relax the commander said more to himself than to anybody else if that is how these things work exactly eight and a tenth light days in from the position the rapid offensive unit killing time had held while negotiating its permission to approach space all around the blue dot on the screen scintillated abruptly as a thousand hidden devices of a dozen different types suddenly erupted into life in a precisely ordered sequence of destruction in the realspace holo sphere it looked like a miniaturised stellar cluster suddenly bursting into existence all around the blue dot the trace disappeared instantly inside a brilliant sphere of light in the hyperspace holo sphere the dot lasted a little longer slowed down it could be seen firing some munitions back for a microsecond or so then it too disappeared in the wash of energies bursting out of the realspace skein and into hyperspace in twin bulging plumes the lights in the accommodation space flickered and dimmed as monumental amounts of power suddenly diverted to the rocks own longrange weaponry the commander left the comm channel to the traitor ship open its own course had altered the instant the defence weaponry had been unleashed now its course was hooked changing colour from red to blue and curving up and round and vectoring in hyperspace too looping round to the point where the slowly fading and dissipating radiation shells marked the focus of the systems annihilatory power a flat screen to the commanders left wavered as if some still greater power surge had sucked energy even from its protected circuits a message flashed up on it missed you fuckers the legend read what the commander said the display flashed once and came clear again commander the attitude adjuster here again as you may have gathered we have failed what but keep all defence and sensory systems at maximum readiness ramp the sensor arrays up to significant degradation point in a week we shall not need them beyond then but what happened we got it i shall move to plug the gap the attack left in our defences ready all the cleared ships for immediate awakening i may have to rouse them within a day or two complete the tests on the displacers use a real ship if you have to and run a total levelzero systems check of your own equipment if the ship was able to insert a message into your command desk it may have been able to carry out more pertinent mischief therein the commander slammed a limb end down on the desk what is going on he roared we got the bastard didnt we no commander we got some sort of shuttle or module somewhat faster and better equipped than the average example such a ship would normally carry but possibly constructed en route with such a ruse in mind now we know why its approach appeared so politely leisurely the commander peered into the holo spheres juggling with magnifications and fielddepths then where the hell is it give me control of the primary scanner commander just for a moment will you the commander fumed in his space suit for a moment then nodded his eye stalks at the lieutenant the second holo sphere became a narrow dark cone and swung so that the wide end was directed towards the ceiling pittance glowed at the very point of the other end of the projection the screen of defence devices reduced to a tiny florette of coloured light close in to the cones point at the far wide end there was a tiny fiercely almost painfully red dot there is the good ship killing time commander it set off at almost the same time i did regrettably it is both quicker and faster than i it has already done us the honour of copying to me the signal it sent to the rest of the culture the moment we opened fire on its emissary ill transmit you a copy too minus the various venomous unpleasantnesses directed specifically at myself thank you for the use of your control desk you can have it back now the cone collapsed to become a sphere again the traitor ships last message scrolled off the side of the flat screen the commander and the lieutenant looked at each other the small screen came up with another incoming signal oh and will you contact affront high command or shall i somebody had better tell them were at war with the culture iii genarhofoen woke up with a headache it took minutes to calm down performing the relevant painmanagement inside his head took far too much concentration for somebody feeling this bad to perform quickly he felt like he was a child on a beach swinging a toy spade and building a sea wall all around him as the tide rushed in waves kept overtopping and he was constantly shovelling sand up to small breaches in his defences and the worst of it was the more sand he piled up the deeper he dug and higher he had to throw eventually water started seeping in from the bottom of his sea fort and he gave in he just blanketed all pain if somebody started holding flames to his feet or he jammed his fingers in a door thatd just be too bad he knew better than to shake his head so he imagined shaking his head hed never had a hangover this bad he tried opening one eye it didnt seem too keen on cooperating try the other one no that one didnt want to face the world either very dark like being wrapped up inside a big dark cloak or some he jerked both eyes tore open making both smart and water he was looking at some sort of big screen inholod space stars he looked down finding it difficult to move his head he was held inside a large very comfortable but very secure chair it was made of some sort of soft hide it was half reclined and it smelled very pleasant but it had big padded hoops that had clamped themselves over his forearms and his lower legs a similar hidecovered bar looped over his lower abdomen he tried moving his head again it was held inside some sort of openface helmet which felt like it was attached to the headrest of the chair he looked to one side hidecovered wall polished wood a panel or screen showing what looked like an abstract painting it was an abstract painting a famous one he recognised it ceiling black light studded in front just the screen floor carpeted looked much like the inside of a standard culture module so far very quiet not that that meant anything he looked to his right there were two more seats like his across the width of the cabin it was probably a cabin and this was almost certainly a nine or twelve person module he couldnt see behind to tell the seat in the middle the one nearer him was occupied by a bulky rather antiquelooking drone its flattopped bulk resting on the cushion of the seat people always said drones looked a bit like suitcases but this one reminded genarhofoen of an oldfashioned sledge somehow it gave the impression that it was staring at the screen its aura field was flickering as though it was undergoing rapid moodchanges mostly it displayed a mixture of grey brown and white frustration displeasure and anger not an encouraging combination the seat on the far side of the cabin held a beautiful young woman who looked just a little like dajeil gelian her nose was smaller her eyes were the wrong colour her hair was quite different it was hard to tell whether her figure bore any resemblance to the other woman because she was inside what looked like a jewelled space suit a standardish culture hard suit plated in platinum or silver and liberally plastered in gems that certainly glittered and flashed in the overhead lights as though they were things like rubies emeralds diamonds and so on the suits helmet equally encrusted rested on the arm of her seat she wasnt shackled into place in the seat he noticed the girl bore on her face a frown so deep and severe he imagined it would have made almost anybody else look quite supremely ugly on her it looked rather fetching probably not the desired effect at all he decided to risk a smile the openfaced helmet he was wearing ought to let her see it umm hello he said the old drone rose and flicked round as if glancing at him it thumped back into the seat cushion its aura fields off its hopeless it announced as though it hadnt heard what the man had said were locked out nowhere to go the girl in the far seat narrowed her fiercely blue eyes and glared at genarhofoen when she spoke her voice was like an ice stiletto this is all your fault you ghastly piece of shit she said genarhofoen sighed he was losing consciousness once more but he didnt care he had absolutely no idea who this creature was but he liked her already it went dark again iv stuttered tight point m tra n xlsv serious callers only oeccentric shoot them later its war those insane fucks have declared war theyre mad oo stuttered tight point m tra xeccentric shoot them later olsv serious callers only i was about to call i just got the message from the ship i requested attend pittance this looks bad oo bad its a fucking catastrophe oo did your girl get her man oo oh she got him all right but then a few hours later the affront high command announced the birth of a bouncing baby war the ship phage sent to tier was standing a days module travel away it decided it had better things to do than hang around on a mission it had never been very happy with even from the beginning i think the declaration of war came almost as a relief to it it promptly announced its position to the steely glint and was immediately asked to ship out at maximum speed on some desperate defence mission bastard wouldnt even tell me where took me real milliseconds to argue it out of confessing all to the steely glint and telling it exactly why it was anywhere near tier in the first place i was able to persuade it phages honour rested on it keeping quiet i dont think itll squeal i let it know i give serious grudge oo but it was demilled hasnt it just gone back to phage for munitioning oo ha demilitarised my backup fucker left phage fully tooled phages own idea sneaky scumbag always was overprotective what comes of being that geriatric i suppose anyway the frank exchange of views is cannoned to the gunwales and itching for a brawl apparently whatever it has gone which leaves our lass and the captive genarhofoen floating in a module nearly a day out of tier with nowhere to go tier is requesting make that insisting all culture and affront craft and personnel leave it for the duration of the hostilities and nobodys being allowed in ive tried to find somebody else within range to pick them up but its hopeless a tier deepscan inventory has already identagged their module the meatfucker is skimming in a day away and the module can make oh all of two hundred lights guess what happens next weve failed oo so it would appear was this the aim and is this now the result of the conspiracy war with the affront oo i believe so the excession is still the more important matter but its appearance and the possibilities it may open up have been used by the conspiracy to tempt the affront into initiating hostilities pittance is worse though that pittance has fallen implies entrapment it points to treachery the killing time believes there was another culture or exculture ship there not one of the stored vessels but another craft something no less old than the stored vessels but wiser and more experienced something thats been around as long as they but awake all that time it believes that this ship was taking the part of the pittance mind when it communicated with it on its approach i suspect it will prove to be a warship which apparently went eccentric or ulterior at some point in the last five hundred years and was supposedly not actually demilitarised by one of the conspirators i have a list of suspects the killing time suggests that this ship tricked its way beneath the pittance minds guard and either destroyed it or took it over the store was then turned over to the affront they now have a readymade instant battle fleet of culture warcraft tech generations of development beyond their own ships and just nine days journey from the excession nothing we can put in place in the time available can stop them for what its worth the killing time is making all speed for esperi nine days from now well have the not invented here and the different tan from the gang there the nih has two operational thug class rous its in the process of cannoningup a hooligan lou and a delinquent gou another couple of gsvs should be there too if they arent diverted because of the war with a total of five ous two of them torturer class eight of phages psychopath rous are bound for the excession but the rest are down for defensive duties elsewhere to cope with likely threats from affront battle units even those eight wont get within punchthrowing range of the excession until two days after the affront can be there bottom line is there are a total of ten warships of various classes capable of making it to the excession in time to make a stand against the affront enough to hold off the entire affront navy if that was all we were going to be faced with but simply not capable of holding back more than an eighth of the ships that could come out of pittance if they all go straight to the excession it will be theirs for the record all the remaining ship stores are breaking themselves open but the nearest is over five weeks travel away a gesture thats all oh and a few other involveds have offered help but theyre all either too weak or too far away a couple of other barbarics are probably going to declare for the affront once theyve stopped scratching their heads and worked out what they might be able to get up to with the cultures attention diverted but theyre even less relevant and if we were expecting some welldisposed elders to step into the nursery and confiscate all our toys and restore order it doesnt look very likely so far no notice taken as far as anybody can tell oo so that just leaves our old friend currently possibly probably almost certainly also en route wild card somehow part of the conspiracy have we any more thoughts come to that have you had any reply from it oo none and no no offence but the ss is one of the more unfathomable eccentrics perhaps it thinks the excession requires storing perhaps it intends to ram it at that speed or attempt to plunge into it and access other universes i dont know there is some private issue being played out in this i believe and genarhofoen fits in somewhere i have almost given up thinking about this aspect of affairs i shall continue my attempts to contact it but i dont think its even looking at its signal files the point is that the war itself takes precedence with the excession prioritised beyond that oo no offence taken so we are left with the affront on the cusp of apotheosis or nemesis oo indeed quite how they intend to use these elderly but still potent warships to take control of the excession one can only hazard at perhaps they intend surrounding it and charging admission but they have begun a war which unless they can somehow gain control of the excession and exploit it they can only lose they have a few hundred halfmillenniumold warships capable of inflicting untold damage let loose in a peaceable unmilitarised if relatively unpopulated section of the galaxy certainly but only for a month or two at most then the culture gathers the force to crush them utterly and moves on to rip the affront hegemony to shreds and impose its own peace upon it there can be no other outcome unless the excession does come into play which i doubt maybe it is some sort of projection maybe its appearance was not fortuitous but planned this looks unlikely i know but everything else about this has been so cunningly put together whatever the argument which everybody had thought was lost at the end of the idiran war is about to be won the agreement come to then is in the process of being overturned i for one am not going to stand for this we may have failed to frustrate the conspiracy but it will still be possible to work towards the discovery of the guilty parties involved in its planning and implementation both during and after the hostilities i intend to copy all my thoughts theories evidence communications and all other relevant documentation to every trusted colleague and contact i possess if you have any intention of taking part in the course of action i am suggesting i urge you to do the same and to relay this advice to the anticipation of a new lovers arrival i intend to pursue the perpetrators of this unnecessary war for as long as it takes until they are brought to justice and i am aware both that i will no longer be able to do so without them knowing that i am doing so and that there is no better circumstance to arrange for the jeopardisation of a fellow mind than in time of war when blanket secrecies are imposed warcraft of every sort are loosed mistakes can be claimed to have been made deals done mercenaries hired and old scores settled i do not believe i am being melodramatic in this i will be under terminal threat and so will anybody else who determines to adopt the same course as i the conspirators have played exceedingly dirty until this point and i cannot imagine they will do other than continue to do so now that their filthy scheme is on the very brink of success what do you say will you join in this perilous mission oo how i wish that i could persuade myself never mind you that you are being melodramatic you risk more than i my eccentricity might save me we have gone this far together count me in oh meat they never said this would happen when they invited me onto the group and into the gang hmm i had forgotten how unpleasant the emotion of fear is this is hateful youre right lets get these bastards how dare they disturb my peace of mind so just to teach some tentacled bunch of backwoods barbarians a lesson v the battlecruiser kiss the blade caught the cruise ship just passing through on the outskirts of the ekro system the culture craft tenkilometres of sleek beauty host to two hundred thousand holidaying travellers of umpteen different speciestypes hove to as soon as the battlecruiser came within range but the affronter vessel put a shot across its bows anyway just on general principles the more determinedly assiduous revellers hadnt believed the announcement about the war anyway and thought the missile warheads detonation which lit up the skies ahead of the ship was just some particularly big but otherwise unimpressive firework it had been close another hours warning and the culture ships hurried reconfiguring and matterscavenging enginerebuild would have ensured its escape but it wasnt to be the two ships joined in the reception vestibule a small party of people met a trio of suited affronters as they emerged from the airlocks in a swirl of cool mists you are the ships representative yes the squat figure at the front of the humans said and you i am colonel alienbefriender first class fivetide humidyear vii of the winterhunter tribe and the battlecruiser kiss the blade this ship is claimed as prize in the name of the affront republic according to the normal rules of war if you obey all our instructions promptly there is every possibility that no harm will come to you your passengers or crew in case you have any illusions concerning your status you are now our hostages any questions none that i either cant guess the answer to or imagine youd answer truthfully the avatar said your jurisdiction is accepted under force of arms alone your actions while this situation persists will be recorded nothing less than the total destruction of this vessel atom by atom will wipe out that record and when in due course yes yes ill contact my lawyers now now take me to your best suite fitted out for affront physiology the girl was indignant with a kind of ferocity probably only somebody from the peace faction could muster in such a situation but were the peace faction she protested for the fifth or sixth time were were like the true culture the way it used to be ah leffid said grimacing as somebody pushed behind him and forced his chest into the front of the bar he glanced round scowling and ruffled his wings back into shape the starboard lounge of the xoanon was crowded the ship was crowded and he could see his wings were going to end up in a terrible shape by the time this was over mind you there were compensations somebody pushed into the bar and squeezed the peace faction girl closer to him so that her bare arm touched him and he could feel the warmth of her hip against his she smelled wonderful now that could be your problem he said trying to sound sympathetic calling yourselves the true culture you see to the tier sintricates and even to the affront that could sound well confusing but everybody knows we wont have anything to do with war its just so unfair she flicked her short black hair and stared into the drug bowl she held it was fuming too fucking war she sounded close to tears leffid judged the time right to put his arm round her she didnt seem to mind he thought the better of hinting that in his own small way he might have helped start the war sort of thing some people might be impressed with but not all besides hed given his word and the tendency had been rewarded for its tipoff to the mainland with this very ship currently engaged in the highly humanitarian task of helping to evacuate tier habitat of all temporarily undesirable aliens not to mention earning the tendency some muchneeded cordiality credit with a whole raft of other involveds and strands of the culture the girl sighed deeply and held the drug bowl to her face letting some of the heavy grey smoke tip towards her exceedingly pretty little nose she glanced round at him with a small brave smile her gaze rising over his shoulder like your wings she said he smiled why thank you damn ah my dear the professor blinked yes it really was an affronter floating at the far end of the room near the windows suit like a small tubby spacecraft all gleaming knobbly bits articulated limbs and glistening prisms the gauzy white curtains blew in around it letting bright highangled sunlight flow in waves across the carpet oh dear was that her underwear draped over a hassock in the affronters shadow i beg your pardon she said she wasnt sure shed heard right phoese cloathelbeldrunsa khoriem lei poere damerire you have been deemed the senior human representative on the orbital named cloathel you are hereby informed that this orbital is claimed in the name of the affront republic all culture personnel are now affront citizens third class all orders from superiors will be obeyed any resistance will be treated as treason the professor rubbed her eyes cloudsheen is that you she asked the affronter the destroyer wingclipper had arrived the day before with a cultural exchange group the university had been expecting for some weeks cloudsheen was the ships captain theyd had a good talk about panspecies semantics at the party just the night before intelligent surprisingly sensitive creature not remotely as aggressive as shed expected this looked like him but different she had a disquieting feeling the extra bits on his suit were weapons captain cloudsheen if you please professor the affronter said floating closer it was directly above her skirt lying crumpled on the floor heavens she had been messy last night are you serious she asked she had a strong urge to fart but she held it in she was oddly concerned that the affronter would think she was being insulting i am perfectly serious professor the affront and the culture are now at war oh she said she glanced over at her terminal brooch lying on an extension of the beds headboard well the newsflash light was winking right enough practically strobing in fact must be urgent indeed she thought shouldnt you be addressing this to the hub it refuses to communicate the affronter officer said we have surrounded it you have been deemed most senior culture exculture i should say representative in its place this is not a joke professor im sorry to say the orbital has been mined with am warheads if it proves necessary your world will be destroyed the full cooperation of yourself and everybody else on the orbital will help ensure this does not happen well i dont accept this honour cloudsheen i the affronter had turned and was floating back towards the windows again it swivelled in the air as it retreated you dont have to it said as i said you have been deemed well then she said i deem you to be acting without any authority i care to recognise and the affronter darted through the air towards her and stopped directly above the bed making her flinch despite herself she smelled something cold and toxic professor cloudsheen said this is not an academic debate or some common room wordgame you are prisoners and hostages and all your lives are forfeit the sooner you understand the realities of the situation the better i know as well as you that you are in no way in charge of the orbital but certain formalities have to be observed regardless of their practical irrelevance i consider that duty has now been discharged and frankly thats all that matters because i have the am warheads and you dont it drew quickly away sucking a cool breeze behind it it stopped just before the windows again lastly it said i am sorry to have disturbed you i thank you personally and on behalf of my crew for the reception party it was most enjoyable he left the curtains soughed in and out slowly golden her heart she was surprised to discover was pounding the attitude adjuster woke them one by one telling each the same story excessionary threat near esperi deluger craft mimicking culture ship configurations cooperation of affront extreme urgency obey me or our affront allies if i should be lost some of the vessels were immediately suspicious or at least puzzled the confirmatory messages from other craft the no fixed abode the different tan and the not invented here convinced them in every case part of the attitude adjuster felt sick it knew it was doing the right thing in the end but at a simple surface level it felt disgust at the deception it was having to foist upon its fellow ships it tried to tell itself that it would all end with little or no blood spilled and few or no minddeaths but it knew that there was no guarantee it had spent years thinking all this through shortly after the proposition had been put to it seventy years earlier and had known then accepted then that it might come to this but it had always hoped it would not now the moment was at hand it was starting to wonder if it had made a mistake but knew it was too late to turn back now better to believe that it had been right then and now it was merely being shortsighted and squeamish it could not be wrong it was not wrong it had had an open mind and it had become convinced of the rightness of the course which was being suggested and in which it would play such an important part it had done as it had been asked to do it had watched the affront studied them immersed itself in their history culture and beliefs and in all that time it had achieved a kind of sympathy for them an empathy even and at the start perhaps a degree of admiration for them but it had also built up a cold and terrible hatred of their ways in the end it thought it understood them because it was just a little like them it was a warship after all it was built designed to glory in destruction when it was considered appropriate it found as it was rightly and properly supposed to an awful beauty in both the weaponry of war and the violence and devastation which that weaponry was capable of inflicting and yet it knew that attractiveness stemmed from a kind of insecurity a sort of childishness it could see that by some criteria a warship just by the perfectly articulated purity of its purpose was the most beautiful single artifact the culture was capable of producing and at the same time understand the paucity of moral vision such a judgement implied to fully appreciate the beauty of a weapon was to admit to a kind of shortsightedness close to blindness to confess to a sort of stupidity the weapon was not itself nothing was solely itself the weapon like anything else could only finally be judged by the effect it had on others by the consequences it produced in some outside context by its place in the rest of the universe by this measure the love or just the appreciation of weapons was a kind of tragedy the attitude adjuster thought it could see into the souls of the affronters they were not the happygolucky lifeandsouloftheparty grand fellows with a few bad habits they were commonly thought to be they were not thoughtlessly cruel in the course of seeking to indulge other more benign and even admirable pleasures they were not merely terrible rascals they gloried first and foremost in their cruelty their cruelty was the point they were not thoughtless they knew they hurt their own kind and others and they revelled in it it was their purpose the rest the robust joviality the blokish vivacity was part happy accident part cunningly exaggerated ploy the equivalent of an angeliclooking child discovering that a glowing smile will melt the severest adult heart and excuse almost any act however dreadful it had agreed to the plan now coming to fruition with a heavy soul people would die minds be destroyed because of what it was doing the ghastly danger was gigadeathcrime mass destruction utter horror the attitude adjuster had lied it had deceived it had acted by what it knew would be the consensual opinion of all but a few of its peers with massive dishonour it was all too well aware its name might live for millennia hence as that of a traitor as an abhorrence an abomination still it would do what it had become convinced had to be done because to do otherwise would be to wish an even worse selfhatred upon itself the ultimate abomination of disgust at oneself perhaps it told itself as it brought another slumbering warcraft to wakefulness the excession would make everything all right the halfthought was already ironic but it continued with it anyway yes maybe the excession was the solution maybe it really was worth all that was being risked in its name and capable of bringing placid resolution that would be sweet the excuse takes over the casus belli brings peace like fuck it thought the ship sneered at itself examining the idiotic thought and then discarding it with probably less contempt than it deserved it was anyway too late to reconsider now too much had been done already the pittance mind was already dead choosing selfdestruction rather than compromise the human who had been the only other conscious sentience in the rock had been killed and the destored ships would speed utterly deceived to what could well prove to be their doom the future alone knew who or what else they would take with them the war had begun and all the attitude adjuster could do was play out the part it had agreed to play another warship mind surfaced to wakefulness excessionary threat near esperi the attitude adjuster told the newly woken ship deluger craft mimicking culture ship configurations cooperation of affront extreme

two years they had spent together on godshole habitat and which indeed it had deliberately kept hidden for fear of his ridicule and it saw itself now as being like the castellan of some small fortified embassy in a teeming barbarian city far from the civilised lands that were his home a wise thoughtful man technically a warrior but more of a thinker one who saw much more of the realities behind the embassys mission than those in his charge and who had devoutly hoped that his warrior skills would never be called upon well that time had come the native soldiers were hammering at the compounds gates right now and it was only a matter of time before the embassy compound fell there was treasure in the embassy and the barbarians would not rest until they had it the castellan left the parapet where he had looked out upon the besieging forces and retreated to his private chamber his few troops were already putting up the best defence they could nothing he could do or say would do other than hinder them now his few spies had been dispatched some time ago through secret passageways into the city to do what damage they could once the embassy itself was destroyed as it surely must be there was nothing else which awaited his attention save this one decision he had already opened the safe and taken out the sealed orders the paper was in his hand he read it again so it was to be destruction he had guessed as much but it was still a shock somehow it should not have come to this but it had he had known the risks they had been pointed out at the beginning when he had taken up this position but he had not really imagined for a moment that he would really be faced with either utter dishonour and the vicarious treachery of forced collaboration or death at his own hand there was of course no real choice call it his upbringing he looked ruefully around the small private chamber that held the memories of home his library his clothes and keepsakes this was him this was who he was the same beliefs and principles that had led him here to this lonely outpost required that there was no choice over surrender or death but there was still one choice to make and it was a bitter one to be given he could destroy the embassy and himself with it of course completely so that all that would be left to the barbarians would be its stones or he could take the entire city with him it was not just a city in one sense it was not even principally a city it was a vast arsenal a crowded barracks and a busy naval port altogether an important component of the barbarians war effort its destruction would benefit the side that the castellan was loyal to the cause that he absolutely believed in arguably it would save lives in the long run yet the city had its civilians too the outnumbering innocents that were the women and children and the subjugated underclasses not to mention the blameless others from neutral lands who just happened to find themselves caught up in the war through no fault of their own had he a right to snuff them out too by destroying the city he put the piece of paper down he looked at his reflection in a distant looking glass death in all this choice there was no doubt about his own fate only about how he would be remembered as humanitarian or weakling as massmurderer or hero death how strange to contemplate it now he had always wondered how he would face it there was a certain continued existence of course he had faith in that the assurances of the priests that his soul was recorded in a great book somewhere and capable of resurrection but the precise he he was right now that would assuredly end and soon that was over death he remembered somebody saying once was a kind of victory to have lived a long good life a life of prodigious pleasure and minimal misery and then to die that was to have won to attempt to hang on for ever risked ending up in some as yet unglimpsed horrorfuture what if you lived for ever and all that had gone before however terrible things had sometimes appeared to be in the past however badly people had behaved to each other throughout history was nothing compared to what was yet to come suppose in the great book of days that told the story of everything all the gone done past was merely a bright happy introduction compared to the main body of the work an unending tale of unbearable pain scraped in blood on a parchment of living skin better to die than risk that live well and then die so that the you that is you now can never be again and only tricks can recreate something that might think it is you but is not the outer gates fell he heard them go the castellan stood up and went to the casement in the courtyard the barbarian soldiers flowed through to the last line of defence soon the choice the choice he could spin a coin but that would be cheap unworthy he walked to the device that would destroy the embassy compound and the city too if he chose there was no choice here either not really there would be peace again the only question was when he could not know if ultimately more people would suffer and die because he was choosing not to destroy the city but at least this way the damage and the casualties would be confined to the minimum for the longest possible time and if in the future he would be judged to have done the wrong thing and to have made the incorrect decision well death had the other advantage that he would not be present to suffer that knowledge of that judgement he doublechecked that the device was set so that only the embassy would be destroyed he waited a moment longer to be sure that he was calm and clear about what he was doing then as the tears came to his eyes he activated the device the module scopellafranqui selfdestructed in a blink of annihilatory energies centred on its ai core obliterating it entirely the module itself was blasted into a million pieces the explosion sent a shiver through the fabric of godshole habitat that was felt all the way round that great wheel it took out a significant section of the surrounding inner docks area and caused a rupture in the skin of the engineering compartment beneath this was quickly repaired the destroyer riptalon was damaged and would require a further week in dock though there were no fatalities or serious injuries on board the explosion killed five officers and a few dozen soldiers and technicians in the docks and smaller craft alongside the module a number of semiaware ai entities were also lost and their cores later found to be corrupted by agent entities the module had succeeded in infiltrating into the habitats systems shortly before its destruction despite every precaution these or their descendants continued to significantly reduce the habitats contribution to the war effort for the duration of hostilities so whats it like being at war scary when you have every reason to believe you may be sitting next to the real reason it was declared the gcu fate amenable to change floated in a triangular pattern with the two elencher vessels sober counsel and appeal to reason the two elench ships had repeatedly attempted to communicate with the excession entirely without success the fate was getting nervous just waiting for the pressure building up with the crews of the two elencher ships for more intrusive action to overcome the reticence of the craft themselves the three craft had secretly declared their own little pact over the last few days after the second elencher ship had appeared on the scene they had exchanged drone and human avatars opened up volumes of their mindsets they would not normally have exposed to craft of another society and pledged not to act without consulting the others that agreeable agreement would lapse if the elenchers chose to try to interfere with the excession it would have to lapse to some extent anyway in a couple of days when the msv not invented here arrived and the fate suspected started bossing everybody about but it was trying desperately to dissuade the two elencher ships from doing anything rash in the meantime are there any affront warships known to be anywhere in this volume the appeal to reason asked no the fate amenable to change replied in fact theyve been staying away and telling everybody else to do so as well i suppose we should have guessed that was suspicious in itself thats the trouble with people like them i suppose whenever you think youre detecting the first signs of them starting to behave responsibly its just them being even more devious and underhand than usual you think they want the excession the sober counsel asked its possible perhaps theyre not coming here suggested the appeal to reason arent they attacking the whole culture there are reports of scores of ships and orbitals being taken i dont know the fate admitted it looks like madness to me they cant defeat the whole culture but theyre saying a shipstore at this rock pittance has fallen the sober counsel sent well yes officially theres still a blackout on that but off record of course if they are coming in this direction i wouldnt want to be here in about a weeks time so if were going to get through to the entity wed better do it soon the appeal to reason sent oh dont start on about that again you said yourself they might not be coming the fate began then broke off hold on are you getting

i have thought about this no i will not help in trapping the serious callers only or the shoot them later i reported my previous misgivings and the fact that i had shared them with the other two craft because in the course of my investigations into what i perceived as a dangerous conspiracy i became convinced of the need to deal decisively with the affront i still do not approve of the way this has been done but by the time your plans became uncovered it would arguably have caused more damage attempting to arrest them than letting them go ahead i still find it nard to believe tnat the rogue ship which tricked the ship store at pittance was acting alone and that you merely took advantage of the ruse despite your assurances however i have no evidence to the contrary i have given my word and i will not go public with all this but i will consider that agreement dependent on the continued wellbeing and freedom from persecution of both the serious callers only and the shoot them later as well of course as being contingent upon my own continued integrity i dont doubt you will think me either paranoid or ridiculous for systematising this arrangement with various other friends and colleagues

with our fondest regards so long as you swear never to forget that your invitation to restore your wisdom and probity to our small team stands in perpetuity vi genarhofoen spent quite a lot of time on the toilet ulver seich was hell when she was cross and she had been in a state of virtually permanent crossness ever since hed properly woken up in fact since well before shed been cross cross with him while hed been unconscious which seemed unfair somehow if he slept too long or daydozed she got even crosser so he went to the toilet for fairly long intervals the toilet in a nineperson module consisted of a sort of thick flap that hinged down from a recess in the back wall of the small crafts single cabin a semicylindrical field popped into being when the flap was in place isolating the enclosed space from the rest of the cabin and there was just enough room to make the necessary adjustments to ones clothing and stand or sit in comfort usually some pleasantly bland music played but genarhofoen preferred the perfect silence the field enclosure produced he sat there in the gentle pleasantly perfumed downward breeze not as a rule actually doing anything but content to have some time to himself stuck on a tiny but perfectly comfortable module with a beautiful intelligent young woman it ought to be a recipe for unbridled bliss it was practically a fantasy in fact it was sheer hell hed felt trapped before but never like this never so completely never so helplessly never with somebody who seemed to find him quite so annoying just to be in the presence of he couldnt even blame the drone the drone was in a sense in the way but he didnt mind just as well it was in fact he didnt know what ulver seich might have done to him if it hadnt been in the way hell he quite liked the drone the girl he could easily fall in love with and in the right circumstances certainly admire and be impressed by and yes perfectly possibly like even be friends with but right now he didnt like her any more than she liked him and she really didnt like him a lot he supposed these just were not the right circumstances the right circumstances would involve them both being somewhere extremely civilised and cultured with lots of other people around and things happening and stuff to do and opportunities to choose when and where to get to know each other not cooped up grief and it was only for two days so far but it felt more like a month in a small module in the middle of a war with no apparent idea where they were supposed to go and all their plans seemingly thwarted it probably didnt help that he was effectively their prisoner either so who was the first girl he asked her the one outside the sublimers place probably sc ulver seich told him grumpily she glared back at the drone the two humans were in the same seats theyd been in when hed first woken up the floor of the cabin area behind them could contort and produce various combinations of seats couches tables and so on but every now and again they just sat in the forwardfacing seats looking at the screen and the stars the drone churt lyne sat oblivious on the floor of the cabin taking no apparent notice of the girls glare the drone seemed to be glareproof somehow it was allowed to get away with being uncommunicative genarhofoen sat back in the seat the stars ahead looked the same as they had a few minutes ago the module wasnt really heading anywhere purposefully it was just moving away from tier down one of the many corridors approved by tier traffic control as free from warships andor volume warnings or restrictions the girl and the drone hadnt allowed him to contact tier or anybody else they had been in touch with what sounded like a ship mind communicating by screenwritten messages he wasnt allowed to see once or twice the girl and the drone had gone quiet and still together obviously in touch through its communicator and a neural lace in theory he might have been able to wrest control of the module from them at such a point but in practice it would have been futile the module had its own semisentient systems which he had no way of subverting and little chance of arguing round even if he had somehow got the better of the girl and the drone and anyway where was he supposed to go tier was out he had no idea where the grey area or the sleeper service were and suspected that probably nobody else knew where the two ships were either he assumed sc would be looking for him better to let himself be found besides when theyd finally released him from the chair hed been secured to while hed been unconscious the drone had shown him an old but shinily meanlooking knife missile it contained within its casing and given him a brief but nasty stinging sensation in his left little finger that it assured him was about a thousandth of the pain its effector was capable of inflicting on him if he tried anything silly he had assured the machine that he was no warrior and that any martial skills he might have been born with had entirely atrophied at the expense of an overdeveloped sense of selfpreservation so he was content to let them get on with it when they communicated silently made a welcome change in fact anyway whatever it was they had discovered through all this communicating they didnt seem terribly happy with it the girl in particular seemed upset he got the impression she felt cheated that shed discovered shed been lied to perhaps because of that she was telling him things she wouldnt have told him otherwise he tried to put together what shed just said about special circumstances with what shed already let him know his head ached briefly with the effort hed hit it when hed fallen out of the trap in night city he was still trying to work out what happened there but i thought you said you were with sc he said he couldnt help it he knew it would just annoy her again but he was still confused i said she hissed through gritted teeth that i thought i was working for sc she looked to one side and sighed heavily then turned back to him maybe i am maybe i was maybe theres different bits of sc maybe something else entirely i just dont know dont you understand so who sent you he asked crossing his arms the ownskin jacket slid round his torso the modules bio unit was cleaning his shirt the suit still looked pretty good he thought the girl hadnt changed out of her jewelled space suit though she had used the modules toilet rather than whatever builtin units the suit had she looked less and less like dajeil gelian every hour he thought her face becoming younger and finer and more beautiful all the time it was a fascinating transformation to watch and if the circumstances had been different hed have been aching at least to test the waters with her to see if there was any sort of mutuality of attraction here but the circumstances were as they were and right now the last thing he wanted to do was give her any impression he was ogling her i told you who sent me she said her voice cold a mind with the help well it looks more like collusion now actually she said with an insincere smile of my home worlds mind she took a deep breath then set her lips in as tight a line as their fullness would permit i had my own warship for griefs sake she said bitterly addressing the stars on the screen ahead of them is it any wonder i thought it was all scarranged she glanced back at the silent drone then looked at him again now were told our ships fucked off and weve to keep quiet about where we are and the sort of trouble we had getting you off tier she shook her head looked like sc to me not that i know that much but the machine thinks so too she said jerking her head to indicate the drone again she looked him down and up wish wed left you there now well so do i he said trying to sound reasonable shed got to tier a few days before him sent to look for him in effect given a blank cheque and yet not able to find out where he was the easy way through just asking hence the business with the pondrosaur which made sense if it wasnt special circumstances which had sent her because it was sc who had been looking after him on tier and why would they be trying to kidnap him from themselves and yet shed had her own warship apparently and been given the intelligence that had led her to tier to intercept him in the first place information sc would naturally restrict to a small number of trusted minds mystifying so she said what exactly were you supposed to be doing after you left tier or was this rather pathetic attempt to reclaim your lost youth by trying to seduce women who looked like an old flame the totality of your mission he smiled as tolerantly as he could sorry he said i cant tell you her eyes narrowed further you know she said they might just ask us to throw you outboard he allowed himself to sit back looking surprised and hurt a little shiver of real fear did make itself felt in his guts you wouldnt would you he asked she looked forward at the stars again eyebrows gathered mouth set in a downturned line no she admitted but id enjoy thinking about it there was silence for a while he was conscious of her breathing though he looked in vain at the attractively sculpted chest of her suit for any sign of movement suddenly her foot clunked down on the carpet beneath her jewelencrusted boot what were you supposed to be doing she demanded angrily turning to face him why did they want you fuck it ive told you why i was there come on tell me im sorry he sighed she was already starting to blush with anger oh no here we go he thought tantrum time again then the drone jerked up into the air behind them and something flashed round the edges of the modules screen hello in there said a large deep voice all around them vii stuttered tight point m tra xgsv anticipation of a new lovers arrival the olsv serious callers only i regret to inform you that i have changed my position concerning the socalled conspiracy concerning the esperi excession and the affront it is now my judgement that while there may have been certain irregularities of jurisdiction and of operational ethics involved these were of an opportunistic rather than a conspiratorial nature further i am as i have always been of the opinion that while the niceties of normal moral constraints should be our guides they must not be our masters there are inevitably occasions when such if i may characterise them so civilian considerations must be set aside and indeed is this not what the very phrase and title special circumstances implies the better to facilitate actions which while distasteful and regrettable perhaps in themselves might reasonably be seen as reliably leading to some strategically desirable state or outcome no rational person would argue against it is my profoundly held conviction that the situation regarding the affront is of this highly specialised and rare nature and therefore merits the measures and policy currently being employed by the minds you and i had previously suspected of indulging in some sort of grand conspiracy i call upon you to talk with our fellows in the interesting times gang whom you have unjustly i now believe distrusted with a view to facilitating an accord which will allow all parties to work together towards a satisfactory outcome both to this regrettable and unnecessary misunderstanding and perhaps to the conflict that has now been initiated by the affront for myself i intend to go into a retreat for some time starting immediately from the end of this signal i shall no longer be in a position to correspond however messages may be left for me with the independent retreats council exculture section and will be reviewed every hundred days or thereabouts i wish you well and hope that my decision might help precipitate a reconciliation i devoutly wish will happen stuttered tight point m tra n xlsv serious callers only oeccentric shoot them

meat am i miffed personally im running for a nice sunny orbital diaglyph enclosed i too have deposited all the facts on this matter with friends minds specialising in archiving and the more reliable news services i agree we cannot yet bruit our suspicions abroad there probably never was a proper moment for that but if there was the war has negated its relevance as well as the sleeper service in what has become my daily attempt to contact it who knows another opportunity may present itself once the dust has cleared from around the excession if it ever does if there is anyone left to witness it oh well its out of our fields now best of luck like they say viii the avatar amorphia moved one of its catapults forward an octagon in front of the womans leading tower the noise of solid wooden wheels rumbling and squeaking along on equally solid axles and of lashedtogether wooden spars and planks flexing and creaking filled the room a curious smell which might have been wood rose gently from the boardcube dajeil gelian sat forward in her fabulously sculpted chair one hand absently tapping her belly gently the other at her mouth she sucked at one finger her brows creased in concentration she and amorphia sat in the main room of her new accommodation aboard the gcu jaundiced outlook which had been restructured to mimic precisely the layout of the tower she had lived in for nearly forty years the big round room capped by its transparent dome resounded between the sound effects produced by the gamecube to the noise of rain the surrounding screens showed recordings of the creatures dajeil had studied swum and floated with during most of those four decades all around the womans collected curios and mementoes were placed and set just where thev had been in the tower by its lonely sea in the broad grate a log fire crackled exuberantly dajeil thought for a while then took a cavalarian and shifted it across the board to the noise of thundering hooves and the smell of sweat it came to a halt by a baggage train undefended save for some irregulars amorphia sat blackly folded on a small stool on the other side of the board went very still then it moved an invisible dajeil looked round the board trying to work out what all the avatars recent invisible moves were leading up to she shrugged the cavalry piece took the irregulars almost without loss to the sound of iron clashing on iron and screams and the smell of blood amorphia made another invisible move nothing happened for a moment then there was an almost subsonic rumbling sound dajeils tower collapsed sinking through the octagon in the board in a convincinglooking cloud of dust and the floorshaking sound of grinding crunching rocks and more screams a lot of the important moves seemed to be accompanied by those a smell of turnedover earth and stonedust filled the air amorphia looked up almost guiltily sappers it said and shrugged dajeil cocked one eyebrow hmm she said she surveyed the new situation with the tower gone the way lay open to her heartland it didnt look good think i should sue for peace she asked shall i ask the ship the avatar asked dajeil sighed i suppose so she sighed the avatar glanced down at the board again it looked up seveneighths chance it would go to me the avatar told the woman she sat back in the great chair its yours then she said she leant forward briefly and picked up another tower she studied it the avatar sat back looking moderately pleased with itself are you happy here dajeil it asked thank you yes she replied she returned her attention to the miniature towerpiece held in her fingers she was silent for a while then said so what is going to happen amorphia can you tell me yet the avatar gazed steadily at the woman we are heading very quickly towards the war zone it said in a strange almost childish voice then it sat forward inspecting her closely war zone dajeil said glancing at the board there is a war the avatar confirmed nodding it assumed a grim expression why where between whom because of a thing called an excession around the place where we are heading between the culture and the affront it went on to explain a little of the background dajeil turned the little towermodel over and over in her hands frowning at it eventually she asked is this excession thing really as important as everybody seems to think the avatar looked thoughtful for just a moment then it spread its arms and shrugged does it really matter it said the woman frowned again not understanding doesnt it matter more than anything it shook its head some things mean too much to matter it said it stood up and stretched remember dajeil it told her you can leave at any point this ship will do as you wish ill stick around for now she told it she looked briefly up at it when a couple of days it told her all being well it stood looking down at her for a while watching her turn the small tower over and over in her fingers then it nodded and turned and quietly walked out of the room she hardly noticed it go she leant forward and placed the small tower on an octagon towards the rear margin of the board on a region of shore bordering the hem of blue that was supposed to represent the sea near where a few moves earlier a shippiece of amorphias had landed a small force which had established a bridgehead she had never placed a tower in such a position in all their games the board interpreted the move with the sound of screams once more but this time the screams were the plaintive plangent calls of sea birds calling out over the sound of heavy pounding surf a sharply briny odour filled the air above the board cube and she was back there back then with the sound of the sea birds and the smell of the dashing wild sea tangled in her hair and the growing child continually heavy and sporadically lively almost violent with its sudden startling kicks in her belly she sat crosslegged on the pebble shore the tower at her back the sun a great round red shield of fire plunging into the darkly unruly sea and throwing a bloodcoloured curtain across the line of the cliffs a couple of kilometres inland she gathered her shawl about her and ran a hand through her long black hair as best she could it stuck held up by knots she didnt try to pull them out shed rather look forward to the long slow process of having them combed and cajoled and carefully teased out later in the evening by byr waves crashed on the shingle and rocks of the shore to either side of her in great sighing soughing intakings of what sounded like the breath of some great sea creature a gathering deepening sound that ended in the small moment of halfsilence before each great wave fell and burst against the tumbled growling slope of rocks and stones pushing and pulling and rolling the giant glistening pebbles in thudding concussions of water forcing its way amongst their spaces while the rocks slid and smacked and cracked against each other directly in front of her where there was a raised shelf of rock just under the surface of the sea the waves breaking on the shallower slope in front of her were smaller almost friendlier and the main force of the grumbling swelling ocean was met fifty metres out at a rough semicircle marked by a line of frothing surf she clasped her hands palm up on her lap beneath the bulge of her belly and closed her eyes she breathed deeply the ozone and the brine sharp in her nostrils connecting her to the seas salty restlessness making her in her mind again part of its great fluid coalescing of constancy and changefulness imbuing her thoughts with something of that heaving sheltering vastness that worldcleaving cradle of layered nightmaking depth inside her mind in the semitrance she now assumed she stepped smilingly down through her own fluid layers of protection and conformation to where her baby lay healthy and growing half awake half asleep wholly beautiful her own genetically altered body gently interrogated the placental processes protecting the joined but subtly different chemistries and inheritance of her childs body from her own immune system and carefully fairly managing the otherwise selfishly voracious demands the baby made upon her bodys resources of blood sugars proteins minerals and energy the temptation was always to tamper to fiddle with the settings that regulated everything as though by such meddling one proved how carefully painstaking and watchful one was being but she always resisted content that there were no warning signs no notice that some imbalance was threatening either her health or that of the fetus and happy to leave the bodys own systemic wisdom to prevail over the brains desire to intervene shifting the focus of her concentration she was able to use another designedin sense no creature from any part of her typically distributed cultural inheritance had ever possessed to look upon her soontobe child modelling its shape in her mind from the information provided by a subset of specialised organisms swimming in the as yet unbroken water surrounding the fetus she saw it hunched and curled in an orbed spectrum of smooth pinks crouched round its umbilical link with her as though it was concentrating on its supply of blood trying to increase its flowrate or nutritional saturation she marvelled at it as she always did at its bulbously headed beauty at its strange air of blankly formless intensity she counted its fingers and toes inspected the tightly closed eyelids smiled at the tiny budded cleft that spoke of the cells unprompted selection of congenital femaleness half her half something strange and foreign a new collection of matter and information to present to the universe and to which it in turn would be presented different arguably equal parts of that great everrepetitive everchanging jurisdiction of being reassured that all was well she left the dimly aware being to continue its purposeful unthinking growth and returned to the part of the real world where she was sitting on the pebbled beach and the waves fell loud and foaming amongst the tumbled rumbling rocks byr was there when she opened her eyes standing kneedeep in the small waves just in front of her wetsuited golden hair damply straggled in long ringlets face dark against the display of ruddy sunset behind found just in the act of taking off the suits facemask evening she said smiling byr nodded and splashed up out of the water sitting down beside her and putting an arm round her you okay she held the fingers of the hand over her shoulder both fine she said and the gang byr laughed peeling off the suits feet to reveal wrinkled pinkbrown toes skilipk has decided he likes the idea of walking on land says hes ashamed his ancestors went out of the ocean and then went back in again as if the air was too cold he wants us to make him a walking machine the others think hes crazy though there is some support for the idea of them all somehow going flying together i left them a couple more screens and increased some of their access to the flight archives they gave me this for you byr handed her something from the suits side pouch oh thank you she put the small figurine in one palm and turned it over carefully with her fingers inspecting it by the fading red light of the days end it was beautiful worked out of some soft stone to perfectly resemble their idea of what they thought a human ought to look like naturally flippered feet legs joined to the knees body fatter shoulders slender neck thicker head narrower hairless it did look like her the face for all that it was distorted bore a distinct resemblance probably gistigtkts work there was a delicacy of line and a certain humour about the figurines facial expression that spoke to her of the old females personality she held the little figure up in front of byr think it looks like me well youre certainly getting that fat oh she said slapping byr lightly on the shoulder she glanced down at her lap reaching to pat her belly i think youre starting to show yourself at last she said byr smiled her face still freckled with droplets of water catching the dying light she looked down holding dajeils hand patting her belly na she said rising to her feet she held out a hand to dajeil and glanced round to the tower you coming in or are you going to sit around communing with the ocean swell all evening weve got guests remember she took a breath to say something then held up her hand byr helped pull her up she felt suddenly heavy clumsy and unwieldy her back hurt dully yes lets go in eh they turned towards the lonely tower unacceptable behaviour i the excessions links with the two regions of the energy grid just fell away twin collapsing pinnacles of fluted skein fabric sinking back into the grid like idealised renderings of some spent explosion at sea both layers of the grid oscillated for a few moments again like some abstractly perfect liquid then lay still the waves produced on the grid surfaces damped quickly to nothing absorbed the excession floated free on the skein of real space otherwise as enigmatic as ever there was for a while silence between the three watching ships eventually the sober counsel asked is that it so it would appear the fate amenable to change replied it felt terrified elated disappointed all at once terrified to be in the presence of something that could do what it had just observed elated to have witnessed it and taken the measurements it had there were data here in the velocity of the skeingrid collapse in the apparent viscosity of the grids reaction to the links decoupling that would fuel genuinely utterly original science and disappointed because it had a sneaking feeling that that was it the excession was going to sit here like this for a while still doing nothing seemingly endless boredom instants of blinding terror endless boredom again with the excession around you didnt need a war the fate amenable to change started relaying all the data it had collected on the gridskein links collapse to a variety of other ships without even collating it properly first get it out of this one location first just in case another part of its mind was thinking about it though that thing reacted it told the other two craft to the affront signal the appeal to reason sent i was wondering about that could this be the state in which the peace makes plenty discovered the entity the sober counsel asked it could indeed couldnt it the fate amenable to change agreed the time has come the appeal to reason sent im sending in a drone no you wait until the excession assumes the configuration it probably possessed when it overpowered your comrade and then you decide to approach it just as it must have are you quite mad we cannot just sit here any longer the appeal to reason told the culture craft the war is days away from us we have tried every form of communication known to life and had nothing in return we must do more launching drone in two seconds do not attempt to interfere with it ii well we were going to have them at the same time it seemed i dont know more romantic i suppose more symmetrical dajeil laughed lightly and stroked byrs arm they were in the big circular room at the top of the tower kran aist and tulyi and her and byr she stood by the log fire with byr she looked to see if byr wanted to take up the story but she just smiled and drank from her wine goblet but then when we thought about it dajeil continued it did kind of seem a bit crazy two brand new babies and just the two of us here to look after them and firsttime mothers onlytime mothers byr muttered making a face into her goblet the others laughed dajeil stroked byrs arm again well however it turns out well see but you see this way we can have whatever time in between ren being born and our other child she looked at byr smiling warmly we havent decided on the other name yet anyway she went on doing it this way will give me time to recover and get the two of us used to coping with a baby before byr has his well hers she said laughing and put her arm round her partners shoulder yes byr said glancing at her we can practise on yours and then get it right with mine oh you dajeil said squeezing byrs arm the other woman smiled briefly the term used for what dajeil and byr were doing was mutualling it was one of the things you could do when you were able as virtually every human in the culture had been able to do for many millennia to change sex it took anything up to a year to alter yourself from a female to a male or viceversa the process was painless and set in action simply by thinking about it you went into the sort of trancelike state dajeil had accessed earlier that evening when she had looked within herself to check on the state of her fetus if you looked in the right place in your mind there was an image of yourself as you were now a little thought would make the image change from your present gender to the opposite sex you came out of the trance and that was it your body would already be starting to change glands sending out the relevant viral and hormonal signals which would start the gradual process of conversion within a year a woman who had been capable of carrying a child who indeed might have been a mother would be a man fully capable of fathering a child most people in the culture changed sex at some point in their lives though not all had children while they were female generally people eventually changed back to their congenital sex but not always and some people cycled back and forth between male and female all their lives while some settled for an androgynous inbetween state finding there a comfortable equanimity longterm relationships in a society where people generally lived for at least three and a half centuries were necessarily of a different nature from those in the more primitive civilisations which had provided the cultures original bloodstock lifelong monogamy was not utterly unknown but it was exceptionally unusual a couple staying together for the duration of an offsprings entire childhood and adolescence was a more common occurrence but still not the norm the average culture child was close to its mother and almost certainly knew who its father was assuming it was not in effect a clone of its mother or had in place of a fathers genes surrogated material which the mother had effectively manufactured but it would probably be closer to the aunts and uncles who lived in the same extended familial grouping usually in the same house extended apartment or estate there were partnerships which were intended to last however and one of the ways that certain couples chose to emphasise their codependence was by synchronising their sexchanges and at different points playing both parts in the sexual act a couple would have a child then the man would become female and the woman would become male and they would have another child a more sophisticated version of this was possible due to the amount of control over ones reproductive system which still further historic genetic tinkering had made possible it was possible for a culture female to become pregnant but then before the fertilised egg had transferred from her ovary to the womb begin the slow change to become a man the fertilised egg did not develop any further but neither was it necessarily flushed away or reabsorbed it could be held contained put into a kind of suspended animation so that it did not divide any further but waited still inside the ovary that ovary of course became a testicle but with a bit of cellular finessing and some intricate plumbing the fertilised egg could remain safe viable and unchanging in the testicle while that organ did its bit in inseminating the woman who had been a man and whose sperm had done the original fertilising the man who had been a woman then changed back again if the woman who had been a man also delayed the development of her fertilised egg then it was possible to synchronise the growth of the two fetuses and the birth of the babies to some people in the culture this admittedly rather longwinded and timeconsuming process was quite simply the most beautiful and perfect way for two people to express their love for one another to others it was slightly gross and well tacky the odd thing was that until hed met and fallen in love with dajeil genarhofoen had been firmly of the latter opinion hed decided twenty years earlier before he was even fully sexually mature and really knew his own mind about most things that he was going to stay male all his life he could see that being able to change sex was useful and that some people would even find it exciting but he thought it was weak somehow but then dajeil had changed byrs mind they had met aboard the general contact unit recent convert she was approaching the end of a twentyfiveyear contact career he just starting a tenyear commitment which he might or might not request to extend when the time came he had been the rake she the unavailable older woman he had decided when hed joined contact that hed try to bed as many women as possible and from the first had set about doing just that with a singleminded determination and dedication many women found highly fetching just by itself then on the recent convert he cut his usual swathe through the female half of the ships human crew but was brought to a sudden stop by dajeil gelian it wasnt that she wouldnt sleep with him there had been lots of women hed asked whod refused him for a variety of reasons and hed never felt any resentment towards them or been any less likely to eventually count them as friends than the women he had made love to it was that she told him she did find him attractive and ordinarily would have invited him to her bed but wasnt going to because he was so promiscuous hed found this a slightly preposterous reason but had just shrugged and got on with life they became friends good friends they got on brilliantly she became his best friend he kept expecting that this friendship would as a matter of course include sex even if it was just once but it didnt it seemed so obvious to him so natural and normal and right that it should not falling into bed together after some wonderfully enjoyable social occasion or sports session or just a nights drinking seemed positively perverse to him she told him he was destroying himself with his licentiousness he didnt understand her she was destroying him in a way he was still seeing other women but he was spending so much time with her because they were such friends but also because she had become a challenge and he had decided he would win her whatever it took that his usual packed schedule of seductions affairs and relationships had suffered terribly he wasnt able to concentrate properly on all these other women who were or ought to be demanding his attention she told him he spread himself too thinly he wasnt really destroying himself he was stopping himself from developing he was still in a sort of childish state a boylike phase where numbers mattered more than anything where obsessive collecting taking enumerating cataloguing all spoke of a basic immaturity he could never grow and develop as a human being until he went beyond this infantile obsession with penetration and possession he told her he didnt want to get beyond this stage he loved it anyway even though he loved it and wouldnt care if he remained promiscuous until he was too old to do it at all the chances were that he would change sometime eventually over the course of the next three centuries or so of life which he could expect there was plenty of time to do all this damned growing and developing it would take care of itself he wasnt going to try and force the pace if all this sexual activity was something he had to get out of his system before he could properly mature then she had a moral duty to help him get rid of it as quickly as possible starting right now she pushed him away as ever he didnt understand she told him it wasnt a finite supply of promiscuity he was draining it was an everreplenishing fixation that was eating up his potential for future personal growth she was the still point in his life he needed or at least a still point he would probably need many more in his life she had no illusions about that but for now she was it she was the rock the river of his turbulent passion had to break around she was his lesson they both specialised in the same area exobiology he listened to her talk sometimes and wondered whether it was possible to feel more truly alien towards another being than it was to someone of ones own species who ought to think in an at least vaguely similar way but instead thought utterly differently he could learn about an alien species study them get under their skin under their carapaces inside their spines or their membranes or whatever else you had to penetrate ha to get to know them get to understand them and he could always eventually do that he could start to think like them start to feel things the way they would anticipate their reactions to things make a decent guess at what they were thinking at any given moment it was an ability he was proud of just by being so different from the creature you were studying you started out at a sufficiently great angle it seemed to him to be able to make that penetration and get inside their minds with somebody who was ninetynine per cent the same as you you were too close sometimes you couldnt draw far enough away from them to come in at a steep enough angle you just slid off every time in a succession of glancing contacts no getting through frustration upon frustration then a post had come up on a world called telaturier a longterm situation spending anything up to five years with an aquatic species called the ktik which the culture wanted to help develop it was the sort of nonshipbased contact post people were often offered at the end of their career dajeil was regarded as a natural for it it would mean one maybe two people staying on the planet otherwise alone save for the ktik for all that time there would be the occasional visit from others but little time off and no extended holidays the whole point was to establish a longterm personal relationship with ktik individuals it wasnt something to be entered into lightly it would mean commitment dajeil asked to be considered for the post and was accepted byr couldnt believe dajeil was leaving the recent convert he told her she was doing it to annoy him she told him he was being ridiculous and unbelievably selfcentred she was doing it because it was an important job and it was something she felt shed be good at it was also something she was ready for now she had done her bit scudding round the galaxy in gcus and enjoyed every moment but now she had changed and it was time to take on something more longterm she would miss him and she hoped he would miss her though he certainly wouldnt miss her for as long as he claimed he would or even as long as he thought he would but it was time to move on time to do something different she was sorry she hadnt been able to stick around longer being his still point but that was just the way it was and this was too great an opportunity to miss later he could never remember exactly when hed made the decision to go with her but he did perhaps he had started to believe some of the things shed been telling him but he too just felt that it was time to do something different even if he had only been in contact for a short while it was the hardest thing hed ever done harder than any seduction with the possible exception of hers to start with he had to convince her it was a good idea she wasnt even initially flattered not for a second it was a terrible idea she told him he was too young too inexperienced it was far far too early in his contact stint he wasnt impressing her he was being stupid it wasnt romantic it wasnt sensible it wasnt flattering it wasnt practical it was just idiotic and if by some miracle they did let him go along with her he neednt assume that just making this great commitment would ensure shed sleep with him this didnt prove anything except that he was as foolish as he was vain iii the general contact unit grey area didnt hold with avatars it spoke through a slaved drone young lady dont you young lady me in that patronising tone ulver seich said putting her hands on her suited gemencrusted hips she still had the suit helmet on though with the visor plate hinged up they were in the gcus hangar space with a variety of modules satellites and assorted paraphernalia it looked like the space was fairly crowded at the best of times but it was even more clutterednow with the small module that had belonged to the rou frank exchange of views sitting in it ms seich the drone purred on unaffected i was not supposed to pick up you or your colleague dn churt lyne i have done so because you were effectively adrift in the middle of a war zone if you really insist we werent adrift ulver said waving her arms around and pointing back at the module we were in that its got engines you know yes very slow ones i did say effectively adrift the shipslaved drone a casingless assemblage of components floating at head height turned to the drone churt lyne dn churt lyne you too are welcome would it be possible for you to attempt to persuade your colleague ms seich and dont talk about me as if im not here either ulver said stamping one foot the deck under genarhofoens feet resounded he had never been more glad to see a gcu release from that damned module and ulver seichs abrasive moodiness bliss the grey area had welcomed him first hed noticed finally he was back on course from here to the sleeper get the job done and then if the war wasnt totally fucking things up off for some rr somewhere while things were settled he still found it hard to believe the affront had actually declared war on the culture but assuming they really had then once it was all over and the affront had been put in their place culture people with affront experience would be needed to help manage the peace and the culturisation of the affront in a way he would be sorry to see it he liked them the way they were but if they were crazy enough to take on the culture maybe they did need teaching a lesson a bit of enforced niceness might do them some good they werent going to like it though because it would be a niceness that was enforced leniently patiently and gracefully with the sort of unflappable selfcertainty the culture couldnt help displaying when all its statistics proved that it really was doing the right thing probably the affront would rather have been pulverised and then dictated to anyway whatever else happened between now and then genarhofoen was sure theyd give a good account of themselves ulver seich was doing not badly in that line herself now she was demanding she and the drone be put back in the module immediately and allowed to continue on their way given that the first thing shed done when the grey area had contacted them was demand to be rescued and taken aboard at once this was a little cheeky but the girl obviously didnt see it that way this is piracy she hollered ulver the drone churt lyne said calmly and dont you go taking its side im not taking its side im just you are so the argument went on the ships slavedrone looked from the girl to the elderly drone and then back again it rose once in the air fractionally then settled back down again it swivelled to genarhofoen excuse me it said quietly genarhofoen nodded the drone churt lyne was cut off in midsentence and floated gently down to the floor of the hangar ulver seich scowled furious then she understood she turned on the slavedrone whirling round and jabbing a finger at it how da the visor plate of her suit clanked shut her suit powered down to statuelike immobility the jewelled face plate sparkled in the hangars lights genarhofoen thought he could hear some distant muffled shouting from inside the girls suit ms seich the drone said i know you can hear me in there im terribly sorry to be so impolite but i regret to say i was finding these exchanges somewhat tedious and unproductive the fact is that you are now entirely in my power as i hope this little demonstration proves you can accept this and pass the next few days in relative comfort or refuse to accept this and either be locked up followed by a drone intervention team or drugged to prevent you getting into mischief i assure you that in any other circumstance save that of war i would happily consign you and your colleague to your module and let you do as you wished however as long as i am not called upon to perform any overtly military duties you are almost certainly much safer with me than you are drifting along or even purposefully moving along in a small unarmed and all but defenceless module which i would beg you to believe could nevertheless all too easily be mistaken for a munition or some sort of hostile craft by somebody inclined towards the reconnaissancebyfire approach genarhofoen could see the girls suit shaking it started to rock from side to side she must be throwing herself around inside it as best she could the suit came close to overbalancing and falling the little slavedrone extended a blue field to steady it genarhofoen wondered how strong the urge had been to just let it fall if i am called upon to lend my weight to the proceedings i shall let you go the ships drone continued likewise once i have discharged my duty to mr genarhofoen and the special circumstances section you will i imagine be free to leave thank you for listening churt lyne bobbed into the air and continued where it had left off easonable for once in your pampered bloody life then its voice trailed away it gave a wonderful impression of being confused turning this way and that a couple of times ulvers face plate came up her face was pale her lips compressed into a line she was silent for a while eventually she said you are a very rude ship you had better hope you never have cause to call upon the hospitality of phage rock if that is the price of your acquiescence to my entirely reasonable requests then young lady you have a deal and youd better have some decent accommodation aboard this heap of junk she said jabbing a thumb at genarhofoen im fed up inhaling this guys testosterone iv he wore her down there was a halfyear wait between her being accepted for the post on telaturier and actually taking it up it took him almost all that time to talk her round finally a month before the ship would stop at telaturier to deposit her there she agreed that he could ask contact if he could go with her he suspected that she only did so to get him to shut up and stop annoying her she didnt imagine for a moment that hed be accepted too he dedicated himself to arguing his case he learned all he could about telaturier and the ktik he reviewed the exobiological work hed done until now and worked out how to emphasise the aspects of it that related to the post on telaturier he built up an argument that he was all the more suited to this sort of stoic sedentary post just because he had been so frenetic and busy in the past he was well not burntout but fully sated this was exactly the right time to slow down draw breath calm down this situation was perfect for him and he for it he set to work he talked to the recent convert itself a variety of other contact craft several interested drones specialising in human psychovaluation and a human selection board it was working he wasnt meeting with unanimous approval it was about fiftyfifty with the recent convert leading the no group but he was building support in the end it came down to a split decision and the casting vote was held by the gsv quietly confident the recent converts home craft by that time they were back aboard the quietly confident hitching a lift towards the region of space where telaturier lay an avatar of the quietly confident a tall distinguished man spoke at length to him about his desire to go with dajeil to telaturier he left saying that there would be a second interview genarhofoen happy to be back on a ship with a hundred million females aboard though not able to throw himself into the task of bedding as many of them as possible in the two weeks available nevertheless did his best his fury at discovering one morning that the agile willowy blonde he had spent the night with was another avatar of the ship was by all accounts a sight to behold he raged he seethed the quietly spoken avatar sat winsomely dishevelled in his bed and looked on with calm untroubled eyes she hadnt told him she was an avatar he hadnt asked she pointed out she hadnt told him she was a human female either she had been going to tell him she was there to evaluate him but he had simply assumed that anyone he found attractive who came up to talk to him must want sex it was still deceit the avatar shrugged got up and got dressed he was desperately trying to remember what hed said to the creature the previous evening and night it had been a pretty drunken time and he knew hed spoken about dajeil and the whole telaturier thing but what had he said he was sickened at the ships duplicity appalled that it could trick him like this it wasnt playing fair never trust a ship oh grief hed just been wittering on about dajeil and the post with the ktik completely offguard not trying to impress at all disaster he was certain the recent convert had put its mother ship up to it bastards the avatar had paused at the door of his cabin for what it was worth she told him hed talked very eloquently about both his past life and the telaturier post and the ship was minded to support his application to accompany dajeil gelian there then she winked at him and left he was in there was just a moment of panic but then an overwhelming feeling of victory hed done it v the killing time was still racing away from the ship store at pittance at close to its maximum sustainable velocity any faster and it would have started to degrade the performance of its engines it was approaching a position about halfway between pittance and the excession when it cut power and let itself coast down towards lightspeed it deliberately avoided doing its skiddingtoastop routine instead it carefully extended a huge lightsecondswide field across the skein of real space and slowly dragged itself to an absolute stop its position within the three dimensions of normal space fixed and unchanging its only appreciable vector of movement was produced by the expansion of the universe itself the slow drawing away from the assumed central point of the reality which all d matter

transmit it towards you anyway will you receive my mindstate oo if you insist but it will be with a troubled conscience the ship transmitted a copy of what in an earlier age might have been called its soul to the other craft it then experienced a strange sense of release and of freedom while it completed its preparations for combat now it felt a strange at once proud and yet humbling affinity with the warriors of all the species through every age who had bade their lives their loves their friends and relations goodbye made their peace with themselves and with whatever imagined entities their superstitions demanded and prepared to die in battle it experienced the most minute moment of shame that it had ever despised such barbarians for their lack of civilisation it had always known that it was not their fault they had been such lowly creatures but still it had found it difficult to expunge from its feelings towards such animals the patrician disdain so common amongst its fellow minds now it recognised a kinship that crossed not just the ages species or civilisations but the arguably still greater gap between the fumblingly confused and dim awareness exhibited by the animal brain and the nearinfinitely more extended refined and integrated sentience of what most ancestor species were amusingly quaintly pleased to call artificial intelligence or something equally and appropriately perhaps unconsciously disparaging so now it had discovered the truth in the idea of a kind of purity in the contemplation of and preparations for selfsacrifice it was something its recently transferred mindstate its new self to be born in the matrix of a new warship before too long might never experience it briefly considered transmitting its current mindstate to replace the one it had already sent but swiftly abandoned the idea just more time to be wasted for one thing but more importantly it felt it would insult the strange calmness and selfcertainty it now felt to place it artificially in a mind which was not about to die it would be inappropriate perhaps even unsettling no it would cleave to this clear surety exclusively holding it to its exculpated soul like a talisman of holy certitude the warship looked about its internal systems all was ready any further delay would constitute prevarication it turned itself about facing back the way it had come it powered up its engines slowly to accelerate gradually sleekly away into the void as it moved it left the skein of space behind it seeded with mines and hyperspacecapable missiles they might only remove a ship or two even if they were lucky but they would slow the rest down it ramped its speed up to significant engine degradation in hours then then it held there to go any further would be to risk immediate and catastrophic disablement it sped on through the dark hours of distance that to mere light were decades glorying in its triumphant sacrificial swiftness radiant in its martial righteousness it sensed the oncoming fleet ahead like a pattern of brightly rushing comets in that envisaged space ninetysix ships arranged in a rough circle spread across a front thirty years of d space across half above half below the skein behind them lay the traces of another wave numerically the same size as the first but taking up twice the volume there had been three hundred and eightyfour ships stored at pittance four waves if each was the same size as the first where would it position itself if it was in command near but not quite actually in the centre of the third wave would the command vessel guess this and so position itself somewhere else on the outside edge of the first wave somewhere in the second wave right at the back or even way on the outside independent of the main waves of craft altogether make a guess it looped high out across the fourdimensional range of infraspace sweeping its sensors across the skein and readying its weapon systems its colossal speed was bringing the war fleet closer faster than anything it had ever seen before save in its most wildly indulged simulations it zoomed high above them in hyperspace still it seemed undetected a pulse of sheer pleasure swept its mind it had never felt so good soon very soon it would die but it would die gloriously and its reputation pass on to the new ship born with its memories and personality transmitted in its mindstate to the shoot them later it fell upon the third wave of oncoming ships like a raptor upon a flock vi byr stood on the circular stone platform at the top of the tower looking out to the ocean where two lines of moonlight traced narrow silver lines across the restless waters behind her the towers crystal dome was dark she had gone to bed at the same time as dajeil who tired more quickly these days they had made their apologies and left the others to fend for themselves kran aist and tulyi were all friends from the gcu unacceptable behaviour another of the quietly confidents daughter ships they had known dajeil for twenty years the three had been aboard the quietly confident four years earlier and were some of the last people byr and dajeil had seen before theyd left for telaturier the unacceptable behaviour was looping through this volume and theyd persuaded it to let them stop off here for a couple of days and see their old friend the moons glittered their stolen light across the fretful dance of waves and byr too reflected glanding a little diffuse and thinking that the moons v of light forever converging on the observer encouraged a kind of egocentricity an overly romantic idea of ones own centrality to things an illusory belief in personal precedence she remembered the first time she had stood here and thought something along these lines when she had been a man and he and dajeil had not long arrived here it had been the first night he and dajeil had finally at last after all that fuss lain together then he had come up here in the middle of the night while shed slept on and gazed out over these waters it had been almost calm then and the moons tracks when they rose and quite as though they rose and did not rise for him lay shimmering slow and near unbroken on the untroubled face of the oceans slack waters hed wondered then if hed made a terrible mistake one part of his mind was convinced he had another part claimed the moral high ground of maturity and assured him it was the smartest move hed ever made that he was indeed finally growing up he had decided that night that even if it was a mistake that was just too bad it was a mistake that could only be dealt with by embracing it by grasping it with both hands and accepting the results of his decision his pride could only be preserved by laying it aside entirely for the duration he would make this work he would perform this task and be blameless in the selfsacrifice of his own interests to dajeils his reward was that she had never seemed happier and that almost for the first time he felt responsible for anothers pleasure on a scale beyond the immediate when months later she had suggested that they have a child and later still while they were still mulling this over that they mutual for they had the time and the commitment he had been extravagant in his enthusiasm as though through such loud acclaim he could drown out the doubts he heard inside himself byr a soft voice said from the little cupola that gave access from the steps to the roof she turned round hello hi couldnt sleep either eh aist said joining byr at the parapet she was dressed in dark pyjamas her naked feet slapslapped on the flagstones no byr said she didnt need much sleep byr spent quite a lot of time by herself these days while dajeil slept or sat crosslegged in one of her trances or fussed around in the nursery they had prepared for their children same here aist said crossing her arms beneath her breasts and leaning out over the parapet her head and shoulders dangling over the drop she spat slowly the little fleck fell whitely through the moonlight and disappeared against the dark slope of the towers bottom storey she rocked back onto her feet and moved some of her mediumlength brown hair off her eyes while she studied byrs face a small frown just visible on her brow she shook her head you know she said i never thought youd be one to change sex let alone have a kid same here byr said leaning on the parapet and gazing out to sea still cant believe it sometimes aist leant beside him still its okay isnt it i mean youre happy arent you byr glanced at the other woman isnt it obvious aist was silent for a while eventually she said dajeil loves you very much ive known her twenty years shes changed completely too you know not just you she was always really independent never wanted to be a mother never wanted to settle down with one person not for a long time anyway not until she was old youve both changed each other so much its its really something almost scary but well sort of impressive you know of course there was silence for another while when do you think youll have your baby aist asked how long after she has ren isnt it yes ren i dont know well see byr gave a small laugh almost more of a cough maybe well wait until ren is grown up enough to help us look after it aist made the same noise she leant on the parapet again lifting her feet off the flagstones and balancing pivoting on her folded arms hows it been here being so far away from anybody else do you get many visitors byr shook her head no youre only the third lot of people weve seen gets lonely i suppose i mean i know youve got each other but the ktik are fun byr said theyre people individuals ive met thousands of them by now i suppose there are something like twenty or thirty million of them lots of new little chums to meet aist sniggered dont suppose you can get it off with them can you byr glanced at her never tried doubt it boy you were some swordsman byr aist said i remember you on the quietly first time we met id never met anyone so focused she laughed on anything you were like a natural force or something an earthquake or a tidal wave those are natural disasters byr pointed out with feigned frostiness well close enough then aist said laughing gently she glanced slyly slowly at the other woman i suppose id have found myself in the firing line if id stuck around longer i imagine you might byr said in a tired resigned voice yup could all have turned out completely different aist said byr nodded or it could all have turned out exactly the same well dont sound so happy about it aist said i wouldnt have minded she leant over the parapet and spat delicately again moving her head just so flicking the spittle outward this time it landed on the gravel path which skirted the towers stone base she made an approving noise and looked back at byr wiping her chin and grinning she looked at byr studying his face again its not fair byr she said you look good no matter what you are she put one hand out slowly towards byrs cheek byr looked into her large dark eyes one moon started to disappear behind a ragged layer of high cloud and a small wind picked up smelling of rain a test for her friend byr thought as the other womans long fingers gently stroked her face feather soft but the fingers were trembling still a test determined to do it but nervous about it byr put her hand up and held the womans fingers lightly she took it as a signal to kiss her after a little while byr said aist and started to pull away hey she said softly this doesnt mean anything all right just lust doesnt mean a thing a little later still byr said why are we doing this why not aist breathed byr could think of several reasons asleep in the stony darkness beneath them how i have changed she thought but then again not that much vii ulver seich strolled through the accommodation section of the grey area at least there was a bit more strolling to be done on the gcu had she come here straight from the family house on phage it would have seemed horribly cramped but after the claustrophobic confines of the frank exchange of views it appeared almost spacious she had spent so little time on tier and passed the small amount of time she had there in such a frenetic haste of preparation that it hardly counted as for the nineperson module ugh the grey areas interior built to house three hundred people in reasonable if slightly compact comfort and now home only to her churt lyne and genarhofoen was actually pretty interesting which was an unexpected plus on this increasingly disillusioning expedition the ship was like a museum to torture death and genocide it was filled with mementoes and souvenirs from hundreds of different planets all testifying to the tendency towards institutionalised cruelty exhibited by so many forms of intelligent life from thumbscrews and pilliwinks to death camps and planetswallowing black holes the grey area had examples of the devices and entities involved or of their effects or documentary recordings of their use most of the ships corridors were lined with weaponry the larger pieces standing on the floor others on tables bigger items took up whole cabins lounges or larger public spaces and the very biggest weapons were shown as scale models there were thousands of instruments of torture clubs spears knives swords strangle cords catapults bows powder guns shells mines gas canisters bombs syringes mortars howitzers missiles atomics lasers field arms plasma guns microwavers effectors thunderbolters knife missiles line guns thudders gravguns monofilament warps pancakers am projectors gridfire impulsers zpe fluxpolarisers trapdoor units cam spreaders and a host of other inventions designed for or capable of being turned to the purpose of producing death destruction and agony some of the cabins and larger spaces had been fitted out to resemble torture chambers slave holds prison cells and death chambers including the ships swimming pool though after shed pointedly mentioned that she liked to start each day with a dip this was now being converted back to its original purpose ulver supposed these stagesets were a little like the famous tableaux the sleeper service was supposed to contain except that the grey areas had no bodies in them something of a relief in the circumstances like a lot of people she had always wanted to see the real thing she had asked if she and churt lyne might go aboard the gsv when genarhofoen did but her request had been turned down they would have to stay on the grey area until the gcu could find somewhere both safe and unrestricted to deposit them what made it all even more annoying in a way was that the grey area expected it would be keeping in close contact with the sleeper service inside its field envelope if it was allowed to so near and yet so far and all that crap whatever it looked like she wouldnt get to see even the remnants of the famous crafts tableaux vivants and would have to make do with the grey area and its tableaux mortants she thought they might have been more effective if they had contained the victims or the victims and tormentors but they didnt instead they contained just the rack the iron maiden the fires and the irons the shackles and the beds and chairs the buckets of water and acid and the electric cables and all the serried instruments of torture and death to see them in action you had to stand before a nearby screen it was a little shocking ulver supposed but kind of aloof at the same time it was like you could just inspect this stuff and get some idea of how it worked and what it did though watching the screens wasnt really advisable she watched one for a few seconds and nearly lost her breakfast and it wasnt even humans who were being tortured and you could sort of ride it out you could accept that this had happened and feel bad about it all right but at the end of it you were still here it hadnt happened to you stopping this sort of shit was exactly what sc contact the culture was about and you were part of that civilisation part of that civilising and that sort of made it bearable just if you didnt watch the screens still just holding a little iron device designed to crush the sort of fingers that were holding it looking at a knotted cord whose twin knots once the cord was tightened behind the head were set at just the right distance to compress and burst the sort of eyes that were looking at it well it was kind of affecting she spent a fair bit of time shivering and rubbing the bits of her body that kept getting bumps she wondered how many people had looked upon this grisly collection of memorabilia she had asked the ship but it had been vague apparently it regularly offered its services as a sort of travelling museum of pain and ghastliness but it rarely had any takers one of the exhibits which she discovered towards the end of her wanderings she did not understand it was a little bundle of what looked like thin glisteningly blue threads lying in a shallow bowl a net like something youd put on the end of a stick and go fishing for little fish in a stream she tried to pick it up it was impossibly slinky and the material slipped through her fingers like oil the holes in the net were just too small to put a fingertip through eventually she had to tip the bowl up and pour the blue mesh into her palm it was very light something about it stirred a vague memory in her but she couldnt recall what it was she asked the ship what it was via her neural lace that is a neural lace it informed her a more exquisite and economical method of torturing creatures such as yourself has yet to be invented she gulped quivered again and nearly dropped the thing really she sent and tried to sound breezy ha id never really thought of it that way it is not generally a use much emphasised i suppose not she replied and carefully poured the fluid little device back into its bowl on the table she walked back to the cabin shed been given past the assorted arms and torture machines she decided to check up on how the war was going again through the lace at least it would take her mind off all this torture shit affront declare war on culture major events so far by timeimportance likely limits

news on phage viii it should not have made the difference that it did and yet it did their three visitors stayed for two nights going swimming with the ktik during the second day byr met aist again that night the following day the visitors left climbing into the module which the unacceptable behaviour sent down for them the ship was heading off to loop round a protonova a few thousand years distant it would be back in two weeks to drop off any further supplies they might need dajeils baby would be born a couple of weeks after that the next ship due to visit would be another year away when they might have doubled the human population of the planet they stood together on the beach dajeil held byrs hand as the module climbed into the slatecoloured clouds later that evening byr found dajeil watching the recording in the towers top room where the screens were tears ran down her face there were no monitor systems on the tower itself it must have been one of the independent camera drones this one must have landed on the tower that night found two large mammals there and started recording dajeil turned to look at byr her face streaked with the tears byr felt a sudden welling of anger on the screen she watched the two people embracing caressing on the towers moonlit roof and heard the soft gasps and whisperings yes byr said smiling ironically as she pulled off the wet suit old aist eh quite a lass you shouldnt cry you know upsets the bodys fluid balance for baby dajeil threw a glass at her it smashed behind byr on the winding stair a little servitor drone scurried past byrs feet and windmilled down the carpeted steps on its little limbs to start cleaning up the mess byr looked into her lovers face dajeils swollen breasts rose and fell within her shirt and her face was flushed byr continued to peel off bits of the wet suit it was a bit of light relief for griefs sake she said keeping her voice even just a friendly fuck a loose end sort of thing it how could you do this to us dajeil screamed do what byr protested still trying to keep her voice from rising what have i done screwing my best friend here now after everything byr kept calm does it count as screwing technically when neither of you has a penis she assumed a pained puzzled expression you shit dont laugh about it dajeil screamed her voice was hoarse unlike anything byr had heard from her before dont you fucking laugh about it dajeil was suddenly up out of her seat and dashing towards her arms raised byr caught her wrists dajeil she said as the other woman struggled and sobbed and tried to shake her hands free youre being ridiculous i always fucked other people you were fucking other people when you were giving me all this shit about being my still point we both knew it wasnt like we were juveniles or in some dumb monogamy cult or something shit so i stuck my fingers in your pals cunt so fucking what shes gone im still here youre still here the fucking kids still in your belly yours is in mine isnt that what you said is all that matters you bastard you bastard dajeil cried and collapsed byr had to support her as she crumpled to the floor sobbing uncontrollably oh dajeil come on this isnt anything that matters we never swore to be faithful did we it was just a friendly it was politeness for fucks sake i didnt even think it was worth mentioning come on i know this is a tough time for you and theres all these hormones and shit in your body but this is crazy youre reacting crazily fuck off fuck off and leave me alone dajeil spat her voice reduced to a croak leave me alone dajeil byr said kneeling down beside her please look im sorry i really am ive never apologised for fucking anybody in my life before i swore i never would but im doing it now i cant undo it but i didnt realise it would affect you like this if i had i wouldnt have done it i swear id never have done it it was she who kissed me first i didnt set out to seduce her or anything but id have said no id have said no really i would it wasnt my idea it wasnt my fault im sorry what more can i say what can i do it did no good dajeil wouldnt talk after that she wouldnt be carried to her bed she didnt want to be touched or be brought anything to eat or drink byr sat at the screen controls while dajeil whimpered on the floor byr found the recording the camera drone had taken and wiped it ix the grey area did something to his eyes it happened in his sleep the first night he was aboard he woke up in the morning to the sound of song birds trilling over distant waterfalls and the faint smell of tree resin one wall of his cabin impersonated a window high up in a forestswathed mountain range there was a memory of some strangeness a buried recollection of some sort half real half not but it slipped slowly away as he came fully to the view was blurry for a moment then slowly came clear as he recalled the ship asking him last night if it could implant the nanotechs while he slept his eyes tingled a little and he wiped away some tears but then everything seemed to settle back to normal ship he said yes replied the cabin is that it he asked with the implants yes theres a modified neural lace in place in your skull itll take a day or so to bed in properly i hurried up a little repairwork your own systems were taking their time with near your visual cortex you have hit your head recently yeah fell out of a carriage how are your eyes bit blurred and smarted a little okay now later today well go through a simulation of what happens when youve interfaced with the sleeper services storage vault system all right fine hows our rendezvous with the sleeper looking all is in hand i expect to transfer you in four days great and whats happening with the war nothing much why i just wanted to know genarhofoen said have there been any major actions yet any more cruise ships been taken hostage i am not a news service genarhofoen you have a terminal i believe i suggest you use it well thank you for your help muttered the man swinging out of bed he had never met so unhelpful a ship he went for breakfast at least it ought to be able to provide that he was sitting alone in the ships main mess watching his favourite culture news service via a holo projected by his ter minal after the first flurry of affront orbital and cruise ship takeovers with no obvious culture military reply but talk of a mobilisation taking place frustratingly almost entirely beyond the news services perceptions the war seemed to have entered a period of relative quiescence right now the news service was running a semiserious feature on how to ingratiate yourself with an affronter if you happened to bump into one when the dream he had had last night the thing he had half remembered just after the point of waking suddenly returned to him x byr awoke that night to find dajeil standing over her with a diving knife held tightly in both hands her eyes wide and full and staring her face still puffy with tears there was blood on the knife what had she done to herself blood on the knife then the pain snapped back the first reaction of byrs body had been just to blank it out now she was awake it came back not the agony a basic human would have experienced but a deep shocking awful awareness of damage a civilised creature could appreciate without the disabling suffering of crude pain byr took a moment to understand what what had been done what roaring in ears looking up to find all the sheets red her blood belly sliced open glistening masses of green purple yellow redness still pumping shock massive blood loss what would dajeil do now byr sank back so this was how it ended mess indeed feel of systems shutting down losing the body brain drawing blood to it storing oxygen determined to stay alive as long as possible even though it had lost its lifesupport mechanism they had medical gear in the tower that could save her still but dajeil just stood there staring as though sleepwalking or mad with some overdone glanddrug standing staring at her standing staring at her dying neatness to it still women penetration he had lived for it now he died of it now heshe would die and dajeil would know that he had really loved her did that make sense did it she asked the man she had once been silence from him not dead but certainly gone gone for now she was on her own dying on her own dying at the hand of the only woman shehe had ever loved so did it make sense i am who i ever was what i called masculinity what i celebrated in it was just an excuse for meness wasnt it no no no and fuck this lady byr stuck both hands over the wound and the awful heavy flap of flesh and swung out of the bed on the far side dragging the bloodheavy top sheet with her she stumbled to the bathroom holding her guts in and trying all the time to watch the other woman dajeil stood staring at the bed as though not realising byr had gone as though staring at a projection she alone could see or at a ghost byrs legs and feet were covered in blood she slipped against the door jamb and almost blacked out but managed to stagger into the rooms pastel fragrance the bathroom door locked behind her she sank to her knees loud roar in head now tunnel vision like wrong end of a telescope deep sharp smell of blood startling shocking all by itself the lifesupport collar was in a box with the other emergency medical supplies thoughtfully located below waist level so you could crawl to it byr clamped the collar on and curled up on the floor clamped and curled around the fissure in her abdomen and the long gory umbilical of shiningly red sheet something hissed and tingled around her neck even staying curled up was too much effort she flopped over on the tiles soft warmth it was easy all the blood made it so slippery xi in the dream he watched as zreyn tramow rose from a bed of pink petals some still adhered like small local blushes dispensed upon her pinkbrown nakedness she dressed in her uniform of soft grey and made her way to the bridge nodding to and exchanging pleasantries with the others on her shift and those going offwatch she donned the sculpted shell of the induction helmet and in half an eyeblink was floating in space here was the vast enfolding darkness the sheer astringent emptiness of space colossal writ wide and deep across the entire sensorial realm an unending presagement of consummate grace and meaninglessness together she looked about the void and far stars and galaxies went swivelling within her field of vision the view settled on the strange star the enigma at such moments she felt the loneliness not just of this fathomless wilderness and this nearutter emptiness but of her own position and of her whole life ship names she had heard of a craft called i blame my mother and another called i blame your mother perhaps then it was a more common complaint than she normally allowed for and of course she had ended up on this ship with its own particular chosen name forever wondering whether it had been one of those little conceits of her superiors to pair them so did she blame her mother she supposed she did she did not think she could claim any technical deficiency in the love attending her upbringing and yet at the time she had felt there was and to this day she would have claimed that the technicalities of a childhood did not cover all that might be required by certain children in short her aunts had never been enough she knew of many individuals raised by people other than their natural parent and to a man and to a woman they all seemed happy and content enough but it had not been that way for her she had long ago accepted that whatever it was she felt was wrong it was in some sense her fault even if it was a fault that derived from causes she could do nothing to alter her mother had chosen to remain in contact following the birth of her child and had left to return to her ship not long after the girls first birthday her aunts had been loving and attentive and she had never had the heart or worked up the hurtful malice to let them or anybody else know the aching void she felt inside herself no matter how many times she had lain in tears in her bed rehearsing the words she would use to do just that she supposed she might have transferred some of her need for a parent to her father but she had scarcely felt that he was a part of her life he was just another man who came to the house sometimes stayed for a while played with her and was kind and even loving but she had known instinctively at first and later admitted rationally to herself after a few years of selfdelusion had played been kind and even loved her in a more cheerily vague and offhand sort of way than many of her uncles she imagined now that he had loved her in his own fashion and had enjoyed being with her and assuredly she had felt a certain warmth at the time but still before very long even as an infant before she knew the precise reasons motives and desires involved she had guessed that the frequency and length of his visits to the house had more to do with his interest in one or two of her aunts than in any abiding tenderness he felt towards his daughter her mother returned now and again for visits that for both of them veered wildly between painful feelings of love and furious rages of resentment somehow later exhausted and dismayed by these sapping abrasive attriting episodes they came to a sort of truce but it was at the expense of any closeness by the time her mother returned for good she was like just another girlfriend they both had better friends so she had always been alone and she suspected she almost knew that she would end her days alone it was a source of sadness though she tried never to wallow in selfpity and even in a subsidiary way of shame for at the back of her mind she could not escape the nagging desire for somebody some man if she was honest with herself to come to her rescue to take her away from the vacuum that was her existence and make her no longer alone it was something she had never been able to confess to anybody and yet something that she had an inkling was known to the people and machines who had allowed her to assume this exalted if onerous position she hoped that it was secret within herself but knew too well the extent of the knowledgebase the sheer experience behind those who exercised power over her and people like her an individual did not outwit such intelligence he or she might come to an understanding with it an accommodation with it but there was no outthinking or outsmarting it you had to accept the likelihood that all your secrets would be known to them and trust that they would not misuse that knowledge but exploit it without malice her fears her needs her insecurities her compensating drives and ambitions they could be plumbed measured and then used they could be employed it was a pact she supposed and one she did not really resent for it was a mutually beneficial arrangement they and she each got what they wanted they a canny dedicated officer determined to prove herself in the application of their cause and she the chance to seek and gain approval the reassurance that she was worth something such trust and the multiplying opportunities to provide proof of her diligence and exercised wisdom ought at last to be enough for her but still sometimes it was not and she yearned for something that no fusion of herself with any conglomerative could provide a need to be reassured of a personal worth an appreciation of her individual value which would only be valid coming from another individual she went through cycles of admitting this to herself and hoping that one day she would find somebody she could finally feel comfortable with finally respect finally judge worthy of her regard when measured against her own strict standards and then rejecting it all fierce in her determination to prove herself on her terms and the terms of the great service she had entered forging the resolve to turn her frustrations to her and their advantage to redirect the energies resulting from her loneliness into her practical methodically realisable ambitions another qualification a further course of study a promotion command further advancement the enigma attracted her no less than the impossibly old star here in this discovery might eventually lie a kind of fame that could sate her desire for recognition or so she told herself sometimes here after all was already a strange kind of kinship a sort of twinning even if it was that of an implausibility and a mystery she directed her attention to the enigma seeming to rush towards it in the darkness swelling its black presence until it filled her field of vision a blink of light focused her awareness near its centre somehow without much more than that single glimmer the light had a kind of character to it something familiar recognisable it was like the opening of a door like gaining an unexpected glimpse into a brightly lit room attention drawn she looked closer automatically and was instantly sucked into the light it erupted blindingly exploding out at her like some absurdly quick solar flare engulfing her snapping around her like a trap zreyn enhoff tramow captain of the general contact ship problem child barely had time to react then she was plucked away and disappeared into the coruscating depths of the falling fire struggling and trapped and calling for help calling to him he bounced awake on the bedfield eyes suddenly open breath fast and shallow heart hammering the cabins lights came on dim at first and then brightening gently reacting to his movements genarhofoen wiped his face with his hands and looked around the cabin he swallowed and took a deep breath he hadnt meant to dream anything like that it had been as vivid as an implanted dream or some gamescenario shared in sleep he had meant to dream one of his usual erotic dreams not look back two thousand years to the time when the problem child had first found the trillionyearold sun and the blackbody object in orbit around it all hed wanted was a sexsimulation not an indepth inquisition of a bleakly ambitious womans arid soul certainly it had been interesting and hed been fascinated that he had somehow been the woman and yet not been her at the same time and had been nonsexually inside her in her mind close as a neural lace to her thoughts and emotions and the hopes and fears she had been prompted to think about by the sight of the star and the thing she had thought of as the enigma but it hadnt been what hed expected another strange unsettling dream ship he said yes the grey area said through the cabins sound system i i just had a weird dream well i have some experience in that realm i suppose the ship said with what sounded like a heavy sigh i imagine now you want to talk about it no well no i just wondered you werent ah you want to know was i interfering with your dreams is that it it just you know occurred to me well now lets see if i had been do you think i would answer you truthfully he thought does that mean you were or you werent i was not are you happy now no im not happy now now i dont know if you were or you werent he shook his head and grinned youre fucking with my head either way arent you as if i would do such a thing the ship said smoothly it made a chuckling noise which contrived to be the most unsettling sound it had articulated so far i expect it said it was just an effect caused by your neural lace bedding in genarhofoen nothing to worry about if you dont want to dream at all gland somnabsolute hmm he said slowly and then lights out he lay back down in the darkness good night he said quietly sweet dreams genarhofoen the grey area said the circuit clicked ostentatiously off he lay awake in the darkness for a while before falling asleep again xii byr woke up in bed hopelessly weak but cleansed and whole and starting to recover the emergency medical collar lay also cleaned at the side of the bed by it lay a bowl of fruit a jug of milk a screen and the small figurine byr had given dajeil from the old female ktik called gistigtkt a few days earlier the towers slavedrones brought byr her food and attended to her toilet the first question she asked was where dajeil was half afraid that the other woman had taken the knife to herself or just walked into the sea the drones replied that dajeil was in the towers garden weeding on other occasions they informed byr that dajeil was working in the towers top room or swimming or had taken a flier to some distant island they answered other questions too it was dajeil along with one of the drones who had forced open the bathroom door so she could still have killed byr byr asked dajeil to come visit her but she would not eventually a week later byr was able to get out of bed by herself and walk around a pair of drones fussed at her side across her belly the scar was already starting to fade byr already knew her recovery would be complete whether dajeil had actually intended murder or just some insane abortion she didnt know looking down into herself in a light trance to further judge the extent of the damage that had been done and was now diligently repairing itself byr noted that her body had come to the decision apparently on its own accord while shed been unconscious to become male again she let the decision hold byr walked out of the tower that day with one hand still held over the wide scar in her abdomen she discovered dajeil sitting crosslegged and bigbellied on the egground stones a few metres up from the surf line the sound of the stones sliding under byrs unsteady feet brought dajeil out of her reverie she looked round at byr then away again out to sea they sat together im sorry dajeil said so am i did i kill it byr had to think for a moment then she realised she meant the fetus yes byr said yes its gone dajeil lowered her head she would not talk again byr left with the unacceptable behaviour a week later dajeil had told her through one of the towers drones that she would not be having the baby in a week as expected she would halt its development for a while until she knew her own mind again until she felt ready for it she didnt know how long the wait would be a few months a year maybe the unborn child would be safe and unharmed just waiting until then when she did give birth the tower and its drones would be able to look after her she did not expect byr to stay they had done most of the work they had set out to do it might be best if byr left sorry was not remotely enough but it was all there was to say she would let byr know when the child was born they would meet again then if she wanted if he wanted contact was never told what had happened byr claimed a bizarre accident had happened at sea to make her lose the fetus a predator fish attacking near death and saved by dajeil they seemed well enough pleased with what she and dajeil had done and accepted byrs leaving early the ktik were a highly promising species hungry for advancement telaturier was in for some bigtime development genarhofoen became male again one day going through some old clothes he found the little figurine of dajeil the old ktik had carved he sent it back to dajeil he didnt know if she received it or not still on the unacceptable behaviour he fathered a child by aist a contact appointment a few months afterwards took him aboard the gsv quietly confident one of the ships avatars the same one he had slept with gave him a very hard time for leaving dajeil they shouted at each other to his knowledge the quietly confident subsequently blocked at least one request he put in for a post he wanted over two years after he had left telaturier he heard that dajeil still pregnant had requested to be stored the place was becoming busy and a whole new city was growing up round their old tower which was going to become a museum later still he heard that she was not stored after all but had been picked up by the gsv turned eccentric which had once been called the quietly confident and which was now called the sleeper service xiii dont do this i am determined well at least let me get my avatar off take it thank you beginning displace sequence the fate amenable to change sent to the appeal to reason and then continued please dont risk this i am risking only the drone in cognizance of your concerns i shall not remain in contact with it inflight and if it returns apparently unharmed what will you do then take every reasonable precaution including a steppedintellectlevel throttled datastreamsquirt approach a sorry to interrupt but dont tell me any more in case our friend is listening in i appreciate the lengths you are prepared to go to try and ensure you remain free from contamination but surely the point is that at any stage what you will find or start to find will look like the most valuable and interesting data available and any intellectual restructuring suggested will look unambiguously like the most brilliant upgrade you will be taken before you know it indeed you will cease to be in a sense unless your own automatic systems attempt to prevent the takeover and that will surely lead to conflict i shall resist ingesting any data requiring or suggesting either intellect restructuring or mimetic redrafting that may not be enough nothing may be enough you are overly cautious cousin sent the sober counsel we are the zetetic elench we have ways of dealing with such matters our experience is not without benefit especially once we are forewarned and i am of the culture and i hate to see such risks being taken are you sure you have the full agreement of your human crews concerning such a foolhardy attempt at contact you know we have your avatar sat in on the discussions sent the appeal to reason that was two days ago the fate amenable to change pointed out you have just given a twosecond launch notice at least hold off long enough to carry out a poll of your humans and sentient drones and so ensure that they still agree with your proposed course of action now that the business is coming to a head after all another few minutes or so is not going to make much difference is it think i beg you you know humans as well as i do things can take a while to sink in with them perhaps some have only now finished thinking about the matter and have altered their position on it please as a favour hold back a few minutes very well reluctantly but very well the appeal to reason stopped the drones launch countdown before a hundredth of a second had elapsed the fate amenable to change stood down its displacer and left its avatar aboard it all made little difference the fate amenable to change had secretly been upgrading its effectors over the past couple of days and had intended attempting to carry out its own subtle jeopardising of any drones dispatched towards the excession but it was not to have the chance even while the hurriedly called vote was taking place on board the appeal to reason the fate received a message from another craft xexplorer ship break even zetetic elench stargazer th ogcu fate amenable to change culture greetings please be advised i and my sister craft the within reason and long view are also in attendance just out of your primary scanner range we have reconfigured to an extreme offence backup form and shall soon be joined by the two remaining ships of our fleet similarly recast we would hope that you do not intend any interference with the plan our sister craft appeal to reason intends to effect two other confirmatory signals came in from divergent angles compared to that first message purporting to be from the within reason and the long view shit thought the gcu it had been reasonably confident it could either fool the two nearby elench craft or just plain overpower their efforts to contact the excession but faced with five ships three of them on a war footing it knew it would never be able to prevail it replied saying that of course it intended no mischief and glumly watched events unfold the vote aboard the appeal to reason went the same way as before though a few more humans did vote against the idea of sending the drone in than had the last time two requested an immediate transfer to the sober counsel then changed their minds they would stay aboard the fate took its avatars off both the elencher ships it had used its heavyduty displacer for the task attenuating it to make it look as though it had utilised one of the lesser systems it left the unit running at full readiness the appeal to reasons drone was duly launched a small fragilelooking gaily adorned thing its extremities sporting ribbons flowers and little ornaments and its casing covered with drawings cartoons and wellwishing messages scrawled by the crew it puttered hesitantly towards the excession chirpily beaming signals of innocent goodwill if the fate amenable to change had been a human at this point it would have looked down put one hand over its eyes and shaken its head the small machine took minutes to creep up to the seemingly unnoticing excessions dull skeinsurface an insect crawling up to a behemoth it activated a shortrange one time hyperspace unit and disappeared from the skein as though passing through a mirror of dark fluid in infraspace it disappeared too for an instant the fate amenable to change was watching the drone from a hundred different angles via its remotes they all saw it just disappear an instant later it reappeared it looped back through its little quantum burrow returning to the skein of real space to start back no less hesitantly towards the appeal to reason the fate amenable to change crashramped its plasma chambers then isolated and readied a clutch of fusion warheads at the same moment it signalled urgently was the drone meant to disappear that way hmm sent the appeal to reason well destroy it the fate urged destroy it now it has communicated slimtext only as per instructions the appeal to reason replied sounding thoughtful if wary it has gathered vast quantities of data on the entity there was a pause then excitedly it has located the mindstate of the peace makes plenty destroy it destroy it no sent the sober counsel how can i the appeal to reason protested im sorry the fate amenable to change signalled to both the nearby craft an instant after initiating a displace sequence which flicked compressed spheres of plasma and a spray of fusion bombs down their own instantaneous wormholes towards the returning drone xiv ulver seich tossed her damply tangled black hair over her shoulder and plonked her chin on genarhofoens chest she traced gentle circles round his left nipple with one finger he put a sweaty arm round her slim back drew her other hand to his mouth and delicately kissed her fingers one by one she smiled dinner talk drink shared smokebowl agreeing fuzzy heads might be cleared by a dip in the grey areas pool splashing fooling around and fooling around ulver had been holding back a little for part of the evening until shed been certain the man didnt just expect anything to happen then when shed convinced herself that he wasnt taking her for granted that he liked her and that after that awful time in the module they did get on that was when shed suggested the swim she raised her chin off his chest a little and flicked her finger back and forth over his tinily erect nipple you were serious she asked him an affronter he shrugged seemed like a good idea at the time he said i just wanted to know what it was like to be one of them so now would you have to declare war on yourself she asked pressing down on his nipple and watching it rise back up her brows creased with concentration he laughed i suppose so she looked into his eyes what about women you ever wonder the same you took the change once didnt you she settled her chin back on his chest he breathed in deeply raising her head as though on an ocean swell he put one arm behind his head and stared up at the roof of her cabin yes i did it once he said quietly she smoothed her palm over his chest for a while watching his skin intently was it just for her he craned his head up they looked at each other how much do you know about me he asked her hed tried quizzing her over dinner on what she knew and why shed been sent to tier to intercept him but shed played mysterious and to be fair he wasnt able to tell her exactly why he was on his way to the sleeper service oh i know all about you she said softly seriously then she looked down well i know the facts i suppose thats not everything he lowered his head to the pillow again yes it was just for her mmhmm she said she continued to stroke his chest you must have loved her a lot after a moment he said i suppose i must have she thought he sounded sad there was a pause then he sighed again and in a more cheerful voice he said what about you ever a guy no she said with a laugh that might have held a trace of scorn maybe one day she shifted a little and circled his nipple with the tip of her tongue for a moment im having too much fun being a girl he reached down and pulled her up to kiss her then in the silence a tiny chime sounded in the room she broke off yes she said breathing hard and scowling im very sorry to intrude said the ship making no great effort to sound sincere may i speak to mr genarhofoen ulver made an exasperated noise and rolled off the man good grief cant it wait genarhofoen said yes probably said the ship reasonably as though this had just occurred to it but people usually like to know this sort of thing immediately or so i thought what sort of thing the sentient module scopellafranqui is dead the ship told him it conducted a limited destruct on the first day of the war we have only just heard im sorry were you close genarhofoen was silent for a moment no well no not that close but im sorry to hear it thank you for telling me could it have waited the ship asked conversationally it could but i suppose you werent to know oh well sorry good night yes good night the man said wondering at his feelings ulver stroked his shoulder that was the module you lived on wasnt it he nodded we never really got on he told her mostly my fault i suppose he turned his head to look at her i can be a scumbag sometimes frankly he grinned ill take your word for it she said climbing back on top of him heavy messing i grief nothing worked the fate amenable to changes ordnance directed at the elench drone ship just disappeared snatched away to nowhere it had to react quickly to deal with the collapsing wormholes as they slammed back now endless towards its displacers how could anything do that and had the watching elench warships noticed the little elench drone flew on a few seconds away from its home ship i confess i just tried to destroy your drone the fate sent to the appeal to reason i make no apologies look what happened it enclosed a recording of the events now will you listen there seems little point in trying to destroy the machine just get away from it ill try to work out another way of dealing with it you had no business attempting to interfere with my drone the appeal to reason replied i am glad that you were frustrated i am happy that the drone appears to be under the protection of the entity i take it as an encouraging sign that it is so what are you mad ill thank you to stop impugning my mental state with such regularity and allow me to get on with my job i have not informed the other craft of your disgraceful and illegal attack on my drone however any further endeavours of a similar nature will not be treated so leniently i shall not try to reason with you goodbye and fare well where are you going i am not going anywhere ii the general contact unit grey area was about to rendezvous with the general systems vehicle sleeper service the gcu had gathered its small band of passengers in a lounge for the occasion one of the ships skeletal slavedrones joined them as they watched the view of hyperspace behind them on a wall screen the gcu was making the best speed it could rushing beneath the skein at a little over forty kilolights on a gently decreasingly curved course that was now almost identical to that of the larger craft approaching from astern this will require a coordinated full engine shutoff and displace the small cube of components that was the drone told them for an instant none of us will be within my full control genarhofoen was still trying to think of a cutting remark when the drone churt lyne said wont slow down for you eh correct the slavedrone said here it comes said ulver seich she sat crosslegged on a couch drinking a delicately scented infusion from a porcelain cup a dot appeared in the representation of space behind them it rushed towards them growing quickly it swelled to a fat shining ovoid that rushed silently underneath them the view dipped quickly to follow it beginning to perform a halftwist to keep the orientation correctly aligned genarhofoen standing near where ulver sat had to put his hand out to the back of the couch to steady himself in that instant there was a sensation of a kind of titanically enveloping slippage the merest hint of vast energies being gathered cradled unleashed contained exchanged and manipulated unimaginable forces called into existence seemingly from nothing to writhe momentarily around them collapse back into the void and leave reality from the perspective of the people on the grey area barely altered ulver seich tssked as some of her infusion spilled into the cups saucer the view had changed now it snapped to a greyblue expanse of something curved like a cup of cloud seen from the inside it pivoted again and they were looking at a series of vast steps like the entrance to an ancient temple the broad shelves of the stairs led up to a rectangular entrance lined with tiny lights a dark space beyond twinkled with still smaller lamps the view drew back to reveal a series of such entrances arranged side by side the rest of which were closed above and below set into the faces of the steps were smaller doors all similarly shut success the slavedrone said the view was changing again as the ship was drawn slowly backwards towards the single opened bay genarhofoen frowned were going inside he asked the slavedrone it swivelled to face him paused just long enough for the human to form the impression he was being treated like some sort of cretin well yes it said slowly as one might to a particularly dim child but i was told welcome aboard the sleeper service said a voice behind them they turned to see a tall angular blackdressed creature walking into the lounge my name is amorphia iii the drone returned to the appeal to reason and was taken back aboard seconds passed well the fate amenable to change asked there was a brief pause a microsecond or so then its empty the appeal to reason sent empty yes it didnt record anything its like it never went anywhere are you sure take a look for yourself a data dump followed the fate amenable to change shunted into a memory core it had set up for just such a purpose the mem it had realised what the excession was almost a month earlier it was the equivalent of a locked room an isolation ward a cell more information poured out of the appeal to reason a gushing river of data trying to flood in after the original data dump the culture ship ignored it part of its mind was listening to the howling thumping noises coming out of that locked room information flickered between the appeal to reason and the sober counsel an instant before the fate sent its own warning signal it cursed itself for its procrastination even if its warning would almost certainly have gone unheeded anyway it signalled the distant warreadied elench craft instead begging them to believe the worst had happened there was no immediate reply the appeal to reason was the nearer of the two elencher ships it turned and started accelerating towards the fate it broadcast tightbeamed lasered and fieldpulsed vast impossibly complicated signals at the culture craft the fate squirted back the contents of that locked room evacuating it then it swivelled and powered up its engines so i am going somewhere it thought and moved off away from the appeal to reason which was still signalling wildly and remained on a heading taking it straight for the culture ship the fate raced outwards powering away from the elencher vessel and heading out on a great curve that would take it rolling over the invisible sphere that was the closest approach limit it had set the sober counsel was moving off on an opposite course from the appeal to reason which was still following the culture ship a direction which would turn into an intercept course if they all held these headings oh shit the fate thought they were still close enough to each other to just talk but the fate thought it ought to be a little more formal so it signalled xgcu fate amenable to change culture oexplorer ship sober counsel whoever whatever you are if you advance on an intercept course on the far side of the closest approach limit ill open fire no further warnings no reply just the blaze of multiband mania from the appeal to reason following behind it the sober counsels course didnt alter the fate concentrated its attention on the last known locations of the three other elench craft the trio which the break even had said were all warconfigured the other two couldnt be ignored but the new arrivals had to constitute the greatest threat for now it scanned the data it had on the specifications of the elench craft calculating simulating wargaming grief to be doing this with ships that were practically culture ships the simulation runs came out equivocal it could easily deal with the two craft even staying within range of the excession as though that was a wise limitation anyway but if the other three joined in the fun and certainly if they attacked it could well find itself in trouble it signalled the break even again still nothing the fate was starting to wonder what the point was of sticking around here the big guns would start arriving in a day or two it looked like it was going to be in some sort of ludicrous continual chase with the two elencher ships until then which would be tiresome with the possibility that the other three warready elencher ships might join in which would be downright dangerous and after all there was that war fleet on its way what more was it usefully going to be able to do here certainly it could keep a watch on the excession see if it did anything else interesting but was that worth the risk of being overwhelmed by the elench or even by the excession itself if it was as invasive as it now appeared to be enough of its drones platforms and sensor platforms might be able to evade the elenchers for the time it took until the other craft got here they could keep watch on the situation couldnt they ah to hell with this it thought to itself it dodged unexpectedly along the surface of the closestapproach limit producing corresponding alterations in the headings of the two elencher ships it speeded up for a while then slowed until it was stopped relative to the excession the position it held now was such that if you drew a line between the excession and the direction it was expecting the msv not invented here to arrive from it would be on that line too the fate signalled the two elencher ships once more trying to get sense from the appeal to reason and any reply at all from the sober counsel it was careful to target the last known positions of the break even and its two militarily configured sister ships as well still trying to elicit a response none was forthcoming it waited until the last possible moment when it looked like the appeal to reason was about to ram it in its enthusiasm to overwhelm it with signals then broke away from it heading straight out directly away from the excession the fate amenable to changes avatars began the task of telling the human crew what was happening meanwhile the ship turned onto a course at a rightangle to its initial heading and powered away at maximum acceleration the appeal to reason targeted its effector on the fleeing culture ship as it curved out trying to intercept it but the attack configured more as a last attempt to communicate was easily fended off that wasnt what the fate was concerned about it watched that imaginary line from the excession to the msv not invented here focusing magnifying its attention on that lines middle distance movement probing filaments of effector radiations three foci clustered neatly around that line the elencher ship break even and its two militarily configured sister craft had been awaiting it congratulating itself on its perspicacity the gcu headed on out leaving the immediate vicinity of the excession for the first time in almost a month then its engines stopped working iv i was told genarhofoen said in the traveltube to the blankfaced and cadaverous ships avatar that id be off here in a day what do i need quarters for we are moving into a war zone the avatar said flatly there is a good chance that it will not be possible to offload the grey area or any other ship between approximately sixteen and one hundred plus hours from now a deep dark gulf of the sleeper services cavernous interior space was briefly visible sliding past then the tube car zipped into another tunnel genarhofoen stared at the tall angular creature you mean i might be stuck on here for four days that is a possibility the avatar said genarhofoen glared at the avatar hoping he looked as suspicious as he felt well why cant i stay on the grey area he asked because it might have to leave at any moment the man looked away swearing softly there was a war on he supposed but even so this was typical sc first the grey area was allowed on board the sleeper service when hed been told it wouldnt be and now this he glanced back at the avatar which was looking at him with what could have been curiosity or just gormlessness four days on the sleeper hed thought earlier stuck on the module that hed be grateful when he could leave ulver seich and her drone behind on the gcu while he came aboard the sleeper service but as it turned out he wasnt he shivered and imagined that he could still feel ulvers lips on his from when theyd kissed goodbye just a few minutes earlier the flashback tremor passed wow he thought to himself and grinned that was like being an adolescent again two nights one day that was all he and ulver had spent together as lovers it wasnt remotely long enough and now hed be stuck aboard here for up to four nights oh well it could be worse at least the avatar didnt look like it was the one hed slept with he wondered if he was going to see dajeil at all he looked at the clothes he was wearing standard loose fatigues from the grey area wasnt this how hed been dressed when he and dajeil had last parted he couldnt recall possibly he wondered at his own subconscious processes the tube car was slowing suddenly it was stopped the avatar gestured to the door that rolled open a short corridor beyond led to another door genarhofoen stepped into the corridor i trust you find your quarters acceptable he heard the avatar say quietly behind him then a soft rrrng noise and a faint draught on his neck made him look back in surprise the traveltube had gone the transparent tube door was closed and the corridor behind him was empty he looked about but there was nowhere the avatar could have gone he shrugged and continued on to the door ahead it opened onto a small lift he was in it for a couple of seconds then the door rotated open and he stepped out frowning into a dimly lit space full of boxes and equipment that somehow looked vaguely familiar there was a strange scent in the air the lift door snicked closed behind him he saw some steps over to one side in the gloom set into a curved stone wall they really did look familiar he thought he knew where he was he went to the steps and climbed them he came up from the cellar into the short passageway which led to the main door on the ground storey of the tower the door was open he walked down the passageway to it and stood outside waves beat on the shining sliding shingle of the beach the sun stood near noon one moon was visible a pale eggshell half hidden in the fragile blueness of the sky the smell hed recognised earlier was that of the sea birds cried from the winds above him he walked down the slope of beach towards the water and looked about it was all pretty convincing the space couldnt really be all that big the waves were perhaps a little too uncomplicated a little too regular further out but it certainly looked like you were seeing for tens of kilometres the tower was just the way he remembered it the low cliffs beyond the salt marsh equally familiar hello he called no answer he pulled out his pen terminal very amusing he said then frowned looking at the terminal no telltale light he pressed a couple of panels to institute a systems check nothing happened shit ah hah said a small crackly voice behind him he turned to see a black bird folding its wings on the shelf of stones behind him another captive it cackled v the fate amenable to change let its engine fields race for a moment running a series of tests and evaluation processes it was as if its traction fields were just sinking through the energy grid as if it wasnt there it tried signalling telling the outside universe of its plight but the signals just seemed to loop back and it found itself receiving its own signal a picosecond after it had sent it it tried to create a warp but the skein just seemed to slide out of its fields it attempted displacing a drone but the wormhole collapsed before it was properly formed it tried a few more tricks finessing its field structures and reconfiguring its senses in an attempt at least to understand what was going on but nothing worked it thought it felt curiously composed considering it shut everything down and let itself drift floating gradually back through the fourdimensional hypervolume towards the skein of real space propelled by nothing more than the faint pressure of radiations expelled from the energy grid its avatars were already starting to explain the change in the situation to its human crew the ship hoped the people would take it calmly then the excession seemed to swell bulging as though under an enormous lens reaching out towards the culture ship with a vast enclosing scoop of presence well here we go the ship thought should be interesting vi no please the avatar said the woman shook her head ive thought about it i dont want to see him the avatar stared at dajeil but i brought him all this way it cried just for you if you knew its voice trailed off it brought its feet up onto the front of the seat and put its arms round its legs hugging them they were in dajeils quarters inside another version of the towers interior housed within the gcu jaundiced outlook the avatar had come straight here after leaving genarhofoen in the mainbay where the original copy of the tower the one dajeil gelian had spent forty years living in had been moved to when the ship had converted all its external spare mass to engine it had thought she would be pleased that the tower had not had to be destroyed and that genarhofoen had finally been persuaded to return to her dajeil continued watching the screen it was a replay of one of her dives amongst the triangular rays in the shallow sea that was now no more as seen from a drone which had accompanied her she watched herself move amongst the gracefully undulating wings of the great gentle creatures swollen awkward she was the only graceless thing in the picture the avatar didnt know what to say next the sleeper service decided to take over dajeil it said quietly through its representative the woman looked round recognising the new tone in amorphias voice what why dont you want to see him now i she paused its just been too long she said i think i suppose for the first few years i did want to see him again to to she looked down picking at her fingernails i dont know oh to try and make things all right grief that sounds so lame she sniffed and looked upwards at the translucent dqme above her i felt there were things we needed to have said that we never did say to each other and that if we did get together even for a little while we could work things out draw a line under all that happened tie up loose ends that that sort of thing you know she said looking brighteyed at the avatar oh dajeil thought the ship how wounded about the eyes i know it said but now you feel that too much time has passed the woman smoothed her hand over her belly she nodded slowly looking at the floor yes she said its all too long ago im sure hes forgotten all about me she glanced up at the avatar and yet he is here it said did he come to see me she asked it already sounding bitter no and yes the ship said he had another motive but it is because of you he is here she shook her head no she said no too much time the avatar unfolded itself from the seat and crossed to where dajeil sat it knelt down before her and hesitantly extended one hand towards her abdomen looking into her eyes it gently placed its palm on dajeils belly dajeil felt dizzy she could not recall amorphia ever having touched her before either under its own control or under the sleeper services she put her own hand on top of the avatars the creatures hand was steady soft and cool and yet it said in some ways no time has passed dajeil gave a bitter laugh oh yes she said ive been here doing nothing except growing older but what about him she asked and suddenly there was something fierce about her voice how much has he lived in forty years how many loves has he had i dont believe that signifies dajeil the ship told her quietly the point is that he is here you can talk to him the two of you can talk some resolution might be achieved it pressed very lightly on her belly i believe it can be achieved she sighed heavily she looked down at her hand i dont know she said i dont know i need to think i cant i need to think dajeil the ship said and the avatar took her hand in both of its were it possible i would give you as long as you could desire but i am not able to there is some urgency in this i have what might be termed an urgent appointment near a star called esperi i cannot delay my arrival and i would not want to take you with me there it is too dangerous i would like you to leave in this ship as soon as possible she looked hurt the sleeper thought i wont be forced into this she told it of course not it said it attempted a smile and patted her hand why not sleep on it tomorrow will be soon enough vii the attitude adjuster watched the attacking craft fall amongst the founding shield of ships they had no time to move more an fractionally from their original positions their weaponry did their moving for them focusing on the incoming target it plunged into their midst a scatter of brightly flaring missiles preceded the killing time a hail of plasma bubbles accompanied it and cam am and nanohole warheads cluster munitions burst everywhere around it like a gigantic firework producing a giant orb of scintillations many of the individual motes themselves detonated in a clustering hyperspherical storm of lethal sparks followed sequentially by another and another echelon of explosions erupting amongst the wave of ships in a layered hierarchy of destruction the attitude adjuster scanned the realtime reports coming back from its war flock one was caught by a nanohole vanishing inside a vast burst of annihilation another was damaged beyond immediate repair by an am munition and dropped behind engines crippled fortuitously neither were crewed by affronters most of the rest of the warheads were dealt with the fleets own replies were fended detonated or avoided by the attacker no sign of the craft using its effectors to do more than cause interference flittingly interrogating and probing amongst the collected mass of ships the focus of its attention had begun near the centre of the third wave of craft and was spirally erratically outwards occasionally flicking further out towards the other waves the attitude adjuster was puzzled the killing time was a torturer class rapid offensive unit it could be it ought to be devastating the fleet for these instants as it tore through it it was capable of then it realised of course it was a grudge the attitude adjuster experienced a tingle of fear merged with a kind of contempt the killing times effector focus was a few ships away now spiralling out towards the attitude adjuster it signalled hurriedly to the five rapid offensive units immediately around it each listened understood and obeyed the killing times effector focus flicked from craft to craft still coming closer you fool the attitude adjuster thought almost angry at the attacking ship it was behaving stupidly irresponsibly a culture craft should not be so prideful it had thought the venom directed at itself by the killing time in its signal to it back at pittance had been bluster cheap bravado but it had been worse it had been sincere wounded selfesteem upset that it personally had been subject to a ruse designed to destroy it as though its enemies cared an iota who it was the attitude adjuster doubted this was an attack sanctioned by the killing times peers this wasnt war this was peevishness this was taking it personally when if there was anything war could be characterised as being it was impersonal idiot it deserved to perish it did not merit the honour it doubtless thought would accrue to it for this reckless and selfish act the surrounding warships completed their changes just in time when the attacking ships effector targeted the first of those craft the focus did not flit onto the next as it had with all the rest instead it stayed latching on concentrating and strengthening the rou caved in alarmingly quickly the attitude adjuster guessed that it was made to reconfigure its engine fields to focus them inside its mind there was a sort of signalled shriek an instant before communication was lost but the exact nature of its downfall was hidden in an accompanying shower of cam warheads which obliterated it instantaneously a mercy it would have been a grisly way for a ship to die but too quick thought the attitude adjuster it was sure the attacker would have let the rou which the killing time had mistaken for the attitude adjuster tear its intellect apart with its engines for longer if it had been totally fooled the cam dusting had been either a coup de grâce or a howl of frustration perhaps both the attitude adjuster signalled to the rest of the fleet instructing them too to impersonate itself but even as it watched the rou which had been attacked alongside it disappear astern in a fragmenting cage of radiations it began to be afraid it had originally contacted the five nearest ships hoping that the first one found and interrogated by the attackers systems would fool the killing time into believing it had found the one ship it was obviously seeking but that was stupid it sensed the torturer class ships effectors sweep over the craft on the far side of the hole in the wave of ships which the rous destruction had created insufficient elapsed time the attitude adjuster whispered to itself the rou being quizzed at the moment was still reconfiguring its internal systems signature to resemble that of the attitude adjuster the effector sweep flicked away from it dismissing the attitude adjuster quailed it had made itself a target it should have here it came a feeling of no it had gone swept over it its own disguise had worked it had been dismissed too like the rou alongside the effector focus jumped to another craft still further away the attitude adjuster was dizzy with relief it had survived the plan still held the huge filthy trick they were pulling was free to continue the way to the excession lay open the other minds in the conspiracy would commend it if it survived the but it mustnt think of the other ships involved it had to accept responsibility for what had happened it and it alone it was the traitor it would never reveal who had instigated this ghastly gigadeathcrimerisking scheme it had to assume the blame itself it had wrestled with the mind at pittance and pressed it when it had insisted it would die rather than yield but it had had no choice it had allowed the human on pittance to be destroyed but it had fastened its effector on his puny animal brain when it had seen what was happening to him it had read the animals brainstate copied it sucked it out of him before hed died so that at least he might live again in some form look it had the file here there it went it had fooled the surrounding ships it had lied to them sent them messages from from the ships it could not bear to think about but it was the right thing to do or was it just the thing it had chosen to believe was the right thing to do when the other ships the other minds had persuaded it what had its real motives been had it not just been flattered to be the object of such attention had it not always resented being passed over for certain small but prestigious missions in the past nursing a bitter resentment that it was not trusted because it was seen as being what a hardliner too inclined to shoot first too cynical towards the soft ideologies of the meatbeings too mixed up in its feelings about its own martial prowess and the shaming moral implications of being a machine designed for war all those things a little perhaps but that wasnt all its fault and yet did it not accept that one had an irreducible ethical responsibility for ones own actions it did and it accepted that and it had done terrible terrible things all the attempts it had made to compensate had been eddies in the flood tiny retrograde movements towards good entirely produced by the ferocious turbulence of its headlong rush to ill it was evil how simple that reductive conclusion seemed but it had been obliged and yet it could not say by whom so it had to accept the full responsibility for itself but there were others and yet it could not identify them and so the full weight of their distributed guilt bore down on the single point that was itself unbearable insupportable but there were others and yet still it could not bear to think of them and so somebody some other entity looking in from outside say would have to conclude would it not that perhaps these others did not really exist that the whole thing the whole ghastly abomination that was this plot was its idea its own little conspiracy thought up and executed by itself alone was that not the case but that was so unfair that wasnt true and yet it could not release the identities of its fellow plotters suddenly it felt confused had it made them up were they real perhaps it ought to check open the place where they were stored and look at the names just to make sure that they were even the names of real minds real ships or that it was not implicating innocent parties but that was terrible whichever way it fell after that that was awful it hadnt made them up they were real but it couldnt prove it because it just couldnt reveal them maybe it ought to just call the whole thing off maybe it ought to signal all the other ships around it to break away stop retreat or just open their comm channels so they could accept signals from other ships other minds and be persuaded of the folly of their cause let them make up their own minds they were intelligent beings no less than it what right had it to send them to their deaths on the strength of a heinous squalid lie but it had to and yet still no no it couldnt say who the others had been it mustnt think of them and it couldnt possibly call off the attack it couldnt no no grief meat stop stop it let it go sweet nothingness anything was better than this wracking tearing uncertainty any horror preferable to the wrenching dreadfulness boiling uncontrollably in its mind atrocity abomination gigadeathcrime it was worthless and hateful despicable and foul it was wrung out exhausted and incapable of revelation or communication it hated itself and what it had done more much more than it had ever hated anything more it was sure than anything had ever been hated in all existence no death could be too painful or protracted and suddenly it knew what it had to do it decoupled its engine fields from the energy grid and plunged those vortices of pure energy deep into the fabric of its own mind tearing its intellect apart in a supernova of sentient agony viii genarhofoen reappeared exiting from the front door of the tower up here croaked a thin hoarse voice he looked up and saw the black bird on the parapet he stood there watching it for a moment but it didnt look like it was coming down he frowned and went back into the tower well it asked when he joined it at the summit of the tower he nodded locked he confirmed the bird had insisted that he was a captive along with it hed thought maybe there was just something wrong with his terminal it had suggested he attempted to get out the way he had come in hed just tried the lift door in the towers cellar was closed and as solid and unmoving as the stones surrounding it genarhofoen leant back against the parapet staring with a troubled expression at the towers translucent dome hed had a quick look at each of the levels as hed climbed the winding stair the towers rooms looked furnished and yet bare as well all the personal stuff he and dajeil had added to it missing it was like the original had been when theyd first arrived on telaturier fortyfive years ago told you but why genarhofoen asked trying not to sound plaintive hed never even heard of a ship keeping somebody captive before cause were prisoners the bird told him sounding oddly pleased with itself so youre not an avatar youre not part of the ship na im an independent entity me the bird said proudly spreading its feathers it turned its head almost right round glancing backwards currently being followed by some bloody missile it said loudly but never mind it rotated its head back to look at him so what did you do to annoy the ship it asked black eyes twinkling genarhofoen got the impression it was enjoying his dismay nothing he protested the bird cocked its head at him he blew out a breath well he looked around at where he was his brows flexed yes well from our surroundings maybe the ship doesnt agree oh this is nothing said the bird this is just a bay just a hangar sort of thing not even a klick long you should have seen the one outside when we still had an outside whole sea we had whole sea and a whole atmosphere two atmospheres yes the man said yes i heard sort of all for her really except it turned out its nibs had an ulterior motive too all that stuff became engine you know but otherwise it was all for her for all that time the man nodded it looked like he was thinking youre him arent you the bird said it sounded pleased with itself im who he asked the one that left her the one that was here with her the real here i mean the original here genarhofoen looked away if you mean dajeil yes she and i lived in a tower like this one once on an island that looked like this place anhah the bird said jumping up and down and shaking its feathers i see youre the bad guy genarhofoen scowled at the bird fuck you he said it cackled with laughter thats why youre here hoho youll be lucky to get off at all you will ha ha ha and what did you do arsehole genarhofoen asked the bird more in the hope of annoying the creature than because he really cared oh the bird said drawing itself up and settling its feathers down in a dignified sort of way i was a spy it said proudly a spy oh yes the bird said sounding smug forty years i spent listening watching reported back to my master using the stored ones who were going back left messages on them forty years and never once discovered well until three weeks ago rumbled then maybe even before cant tell but i did my best cant ask better than that it started preening itself the mans eyes narrowed who were you reporting back to none of your business the bird said looking up from its preening it took a precautionary couple of hopsteps backwards along the parapet just to make sure it was well out of reach of the human genarhofoen crossed his arms and shook his head whats this fucking crazy ship up to oh its off to see the excession the bird said at some lick too this thing at esperi the man asked heading straight for it the bird confirmed what it told me anyway cant see why itd lie could be i suppose wouldnt put it past it but dont think it is straight for it has been for the past twentytwo days you want my opinion going to give it you anyway i think its stooping the creature put its head on one side familiar with the term genarhofoen nodded absently he didnt like the sound of this stooping the bird repeated if you ask me things mad been a bit loopy the last four decades gone totally off the boulevard now in the hills and bouncing along full speed for the cliff edge thats my opinion and ive been round its loopiness for forty years i know i do i can tell this things dafter than a jar of words im getting away on the jaundiced outlook if itll let me it being the sleeper dont think the jaundiced bears me any ill will shouldnt think it does no then as though remembering a rich joke it shook its head and said the bad guy ha you on the other hand youll be here forty years you will chum if it doesnt wreck itself ramming this excession thing that is ha howd it get you here anyway you come here to see old perpetually pregnant genarhofoen looked momentarily stricken its true then she never did have the child yep the bird said still in her supposed to be hale and hearty too if you can believe that so i was told sounds unlikely addled id have thought or turned to stone by now but there you are either way she just isnt having it ha the man pinched his lower lip with his fingers looking troubled what did you say brought you here the bird asked it waited ahem it said loudly what the man asked the bird repeated the question the man looked like he still hadnt heard then he shrugged i came here to talk to a dead person a storee theyve all gone said the bird hadnt you heard the man shook his head not one of the live ones he said somebody without a bod somebody whos stored in the ships memory na theyve gone too the bird said lifting one wing to peck briefly underneath dropped them off at dreve it continued complete download upload acrossload whatever you call it didnt even keep copies what the man said stepping towards the bird seriously the creature said taking a couple of hops backwards on the stonework of the parapet honest the man was staring at it now no really so i was told i could have been misinformed cant see why but its possible doubt it though theyve gone that was my information gone ship said it didnt want even the copies aboard just in case the man stared wildly at it for a bit longer just in case wbat he cried stepping forward again well i dont know the bird yelped hopping backwards and flexing its wings ready to fly genarhofoen glared at the creature for a moment longer then spun round grasping the stones of the parapet with both hands and staring out into the false panorama of sea and cloud ix then it was in the wrong place as simple as that the fate amenable to change looked around incredulous stars just stars initially alien in a way a starscape had never been before this wasnt where it had just been where was the excession where were the elencher ships where was esperi where was this it called up fromscratch positionestablishing routines no ship ever had to call up after theyd run through them in the very earliest part of their upbringing and selffettling in the mind equivalent of infancy you did this sort of thing once to show the minds supervising your development you could do it then you forgot about it because nobody ever lost track of where they were not over this magnitude of scale and yet here it was having to do just that quite bizarre it looked at the results there was something almost viscerally relieving about the discovery that it was still in the same universe for a moment it had been contemplating the prospect of finding itself in a different one altogether at the same time at least one part of its intellect experienced a corresponding flicker of disappointment for exactly the same reason it was nowhere near esperi its position was thirty light years away from where it had been apparently a moment ago the nearest star system was an undistinguished redgiantbluewhite dwarf double called prietse the binary lay roughly along that same imaginary straight line that joined the excession to the incoming msv not invented here where the ship itself had ended up was even closer to that imaginary line the fate checked itself over unharmed uninvaded unjeopardised uncontacted it replayed those last few picoseconds while it multiplechecked its systems the excession rushed out to meet it it was enveloped in what skein fabric some sort of ultradense field it all happened at close to hyperspacelight speeds the outside universe was pinched off and in the following moment there was an instant of nothing no external input whatsoever a vanishingly minute perfectly indivisible fraction of a picosecond when the fate was cut off from everything no outside sensor data whatsoever events within the ship itself had continued as normal or rather its internal state had remained the same for that same infinitesimally microscopic instant there had been no time for anything appreciable to actually happen in its mind there had been time for the hyperspatial quantaequivalents to alter their states for a few cycles so time had still elapsed but outside nothing then the skein or field substrate had vanished snapping out of existence to precisely nowhere disappearing too quickly for the ships sensors to register where it had gone the fate replayed that section of its records slower and slower until it was dealing with the equivalent of individual frames the smallest possible subdivision of perception and cognizance the culture or any other involved knew of and it came down to four frames four snapshots of recent history in one frame the excession seemed to be rushing out accelerating out to meet it in the next the skeinfield had wrapped itself almost totally around the ship at a distance of perhaps a kilometre from shipcentre though it was hard to estimate leaving only a tiny hole staring out to the rest of the universe on the opposite side of the ship from the excession in the third frame the total cutoff from the universe was in place and in the next it had gone and the fate had moved or had been moved thirty light years in less than a picosecond how the fuck does it do that the ship wondered it started checking that time was still working properly directing its sensors at distant quasars which had been used as time reference sources for millennia it also started checking that it was not in the centre of some huge projection extending its stillstopped engine fields like vast whiskers feeling for the as far as anybody knew unfakeable reality that was the energy grid and minutely and randomly scrutinising sections of the view around it searching for the equivalent of pixels or brush strokes the fate amenable to change was experiencing a sense of elation at having survived what it had feared might be a terminal encounter with the excession but it was still worried that it had missed something that it had been interfered with somehow the most obvious explanation was that it had been fooled that it had been tricked into moving itself here under its own power or been moved to this position via another tractive force over time the further implication was that the interval when it had been moving had somehow been expunged from its memory that would be bad the very idea that its mind was not absolutely inviolate was anathema to a ship it tried to accustom itself to the idea that this was what had happened it tried to steel itself to the prospect that at the very least it would have to have its mental processes investigated by other minds to establish whether it had suffered any lasting damage or had had any unpleasant subroutines or even personalities buried in its mindstate during the time it had been effectively unconscious horrible horrible thought the checktime results started coming in relief and incredulity if this was the real universe and not a projection or worse still something it had been persuaded to imagine for itself inside its mind then there had been no extra elapsed time the universe thought it was exactly the same time as the minds internal clock did the ship felt stunned even while another part of its intellect an optin semiautonomous section was restarting its engines and discovering they worked just fine the ship was trying to come to terms with the fact it had been moved thirty light years in an instant no displacer could do that not with something the size it was not that quickly not over that sort of distance certainly not without even the merest hint that a wormhole had been involved unbelievable im in a fucking outside context situation the ship thought and suddenly felt as stupid and dumbstruck as any muddy savage confronted with explosives or electricity it sent a signal to the not invented here then it tried contacting its remotes still presumably in station around the excession no reply and no sign of the elencher ships either anywhere the excession was invisible too but then it would be from this distance the fate nudged itself tentatively towards the excession almost immediately its engines started to lose traction their energies just seeming to disappear through the energy grid as though it wasnt there it was a progressive effect worsening as it proceeded and with the implication that about a light minute or so further in towards the excession it would lose grid adhesion altogether it had only progressed about ten light seconds in it slowed while it still could and backed up until it was the same distance away from the excession as it had been when it had found itself dumped here in the first place once it was there its engines responded perfectly normally again it had made the initial attempt in infraspace it tried again in ultraspace with exactly the same result it went astern once more and resumed its earlier position it tried moving at a right angle to its earlier course the engines worked as they always did weird it hove to again its avatars amongst the crew started yet another explanation regarding what was going on it compiled a preparatory report and signalled it to the msv not invented here the report crossed with the msvs reply to the fates earlier signal stuttered tight point m tra xmsv not invented here ogcu fate amenable to change i dont understand whats going on how did you get to where you are oo stuttered tight point m tra xgcu fate amenable to change omsv not invented here thereby hangs a tale but in the meantime id slow down if i were you and tell everybody else coming this way to slacken off too and get ready to draw up at thirty years off the e i think its trying to tell us something plus there is a record i wish to claim x the rest of that day passed and the following night the black bird which had said its name was gravious had flown off saying it was tired of his questions the next morning after checking that his terminal still did not work and the lift door in the cellar remained locked and unresponding genarhofoen walked as far along the shingle beach as he could in each direction a few hundred steps in each case before he encountered a gelatinously resilient field the view beyond looked perfectly convincing but must be a projection he discovered a way through part of the salt marsh and found a similar force field wall a hundred steps into the hummocks and little creeks he came back to the tower to wash his boots free of the authentically fine and clinging mud hed had to negotiate on his way through the salt marsh there was no sign of the black bird hed talked to the day before the avatar amorphia was waiting for him sitting on the shelf of shingle beach sloping down to the restive sea hugging its legs and staring out at the water he stopped when he saw it then came on he walked past it and into the tower washed his boots and came back out the creature was still there yes he said standing looking down at it the ships representative rose smoothly up all angles and thin limbs close up in that light there was a sort of unmarked artless quality about its thin pale face something near to innocence i want you to talk to dajeil the creature said will you he studied its emptylooking eyes why am i being kept here you are being kept because i would like you to talk to dajeil you are being kept here because i thought this model would be conducive to putting you in the mood to talk to her about what passed between you forty years ago he frowned amorphia had the impression the man had a lot more questions all jostling each other to be the first one asked eventually he said are there any mindstate storees left on the sleeper service no the avatar said shaking its head does this refer to the ruse that brought you here the mans eyes had closed briefly they opened again yes i suppose so he said his shoulders seemed to have slumped the avatar thought so he asked did you make up the story about zreyn enhoff tramow or did they the avatar looked thoughtful gartkepilesa zreyn enhoff tramow afayaf dam niskat it said she was a mindstate storee theres quite an interesting story associated with her but not one i ever suggested be told to you i see he said nodding so why he asked why what the creature said looking puzzled why the ruse why did you want me here the avatar looked at him for a moment youre my price genarhofoen it told him your price he said the avatar smiled suddenly and put out one hand to touch one of his its touch was cool and firm lets throw stones it said and with that it walked down towards the waves breaking on the slope of shingle he shook his head and followed the creature they stood side by side the avatar looked along the great sweep of shining sprayglistened stones every one a weapon it muttered then stooped to pick a large pebble from the beach and threw it quickly artlessly out at the heaving waves genarhofoen selected a stone too ive been pretending to be eccentric for forty years genarhofoen the avatar said matteroffactly squatting again pretending the man asked chucking the stone on a high arc he wondered if it was possible to hit the far force wall the stone fell vanishing into the tumbling scape of waves i have been a diligent and industrious component of the special circumstances section for all that time just awaiting the call the ship told him through the avatar it glanced over at him as he bent choosing another stone i am a weapon genarhofoen a deniable weapon my apparent eccentricity allows the culture proper to refuse any responsibility for my actions in fact i am acting on the specific instructions of an sc committee which calls itself the interesting times gang the creature broke off to heave a stone towards the false horizon its arm was a blur as it threw the air made a burring noise and genarhofoen felt the wind of the movement on his cheek the avatars momentum spun it round in a circle then it steadied itself gave a brief almost childish grin and peered out at the stone disappearing into the distance it was still on the upward part of its arc genarhofoen watched it too shortly after it started to drop the stone bounced off something invisible and fell back into the waters the avatar made a contented noise and looked pleased with itself however it said when it came to it i refused to do what they wanted until they delivered you to me that was my price you it smiled at him you see he weighed a stone in his hand just because of what happened between dajeil and me the avatar smiled then stooped to choose another stone one finger to its lips childlike it was silent for a while apparently concentrating on the task genarhofoen continued to weigh the stone in his hand looking down at the back of the avatars head after some moments the creature said i was a fully functioning throughputbiased culture general systems vehicle for three hundred years genarhofoen it glanced up at him have you any idea how many ships drones people human and not human pass through a gsv in all that time it looked down again picked a stone and levered itself upright once more i was regularly home to over two hundred million people i could in theory hold over a hundred thousand ships i built smaller gsvs all capable of building their own ship children all with their own crews their own personalities their own stories to be host to so much is to be the equivalent of a small world or a large state it said it was my job and my pleasure to take an intimate interest in the physical and mental wellbeing of every individual aboard to provide with every appearance of effortlessness an environment they would each find comfortable pleasant stressfree and stimulating it was also my duty to get to know those ships drones and people to be able to talk to them and empathise with them and understand however many of them wished to indulge in such interactions at any one time in such circumstances you rapidly develop if you dont possess it originally an interest in even a fascination with people and you have your likes and dislikes the people you do the polite minimum for and are glad to see the back of the ones you like and who interest you more than the others the ones you treasure for years and decades if they remain or wish could have stayed longer once theyve gone and subsequently correspond with regularly there are some stories you follow up into the future long after the people concerned have left you trade tales with other gsvs other minds gossiping basically to find out how relationships turned out whose careers flourished whose dreams withered amorphia leant back and over and then threw the stone almost straight up the creature jumped a halfmetre or so into the air as it released the missile which climbed on into the air until it bounced off the invisible roof high above and fell into the waves twenty metres off shore the avatar clapped its hands once seemingly happy it stooped again surveying the pebbles you try to keep a balance between indifference and nosiness between carelessness and obsession it went on still you have to be ready for accusations of both types of failure keeping them roughly in numerical accord and within the range experienced by your peers is one measure of success perfection is impossible additionally you have to accept that in such a large collection of personalities and stories there will be some loose ends some tales which will fizzle out rather than conclude neatly those dont matter so long as there are some which do work out satisfactorily and especially so long as the ones you have taken the greatest interest in and have been personally particularly involved with work out it looked up at him from where it squatted sometimes you take a hand in such stories such fates sometimes you know or can anticipate the extent to which your intervention will matter but on other occasions you dont know and cant guess you find that some chance remark youve made has affected somebodys life profoundly or that some seemingly insignificant decision youve come to has had profound and lasting consequences it shrugged looked down at the stones again your story yours and dajeils was one a little like that it told him it was who was instrumental in deciding that you ought to be allowed to accompany dajeil gelian to telaturier it said rising it held two stones this time one larger than the other i could see how finely balanced the decision was between the various parts of the committee concerned i knew the decision effectively rested with me i got to know you and i made the decision it shrugged it was the wrong decision it threw the larger stone on a high trajectory then looked back at the man as it hefted the smaller stone ive spent the last forty years wishing i could correct my mistake it turned and threw the other pebble low and fast the stone flew out over the waves and struck the larger rock about two metres before it plunged into the water they burst into whizzing fragments and a brief cloud of dust the avatar turned to him again with a small smile on its face i agreed to pretend to become eccentric suddenly i had a freedom very few craft ever have able to indulge my whims my fantasies my own dreams it flexed one eyebrow oh in theory of course we can all do that but minds have a sense of duty and a conscience i was able to become very slightly eccentric by pretending to be very eccentric while knowing that i was in fact being more martially responsible than anybody else and in appearing to enjoy such eccentricity with a clear conscience even enhance my eccentric reputation other craft looked on and thought that they could do what i was doing but not for long and therefore that i must be thoroughly thoroughly weird as far as i know not one guessed that my conscience was kept clear by having a purpose serious enough to compensate for even the most clownlike disguise and regressively obsessive behaviour it folded its arms of course it said you dont normally expect to be continually reminded of your folly every day for four decades but that was the way it was to be i didnt anticipate that at the start though it became a useful and fit part of my eccentricity i picked dajeil up a short while into my internal exile she was the single last significant loose end from my previous life all the other stories didnt concern me so directly or bore no similar weight of responsibility or were well on the way to being satisfactorily resolved or decently forgotten through the due process of time elapsing and people changing only dajeil remained my responsibility the avatar shrugged i had hoped to talk her round to cause her to accept whatever it was had happened to you both and get on with the rest of her life bearing the child wouldbe the signal that she was mended that labour would be the end of her travails that birth mark an end the avatar looked away out to sea for a moment a frown creasing its brows i thought it would be easy it said looking back at him i was so used to power to being able to influence people ships and events it would have been such a simple thing even to have tricked her body into giving birth i could have started the process chemically or via an effector while she was asleep and by the time she was awake there would have been no going back that i was sure my arguments my reasoning grief even my cherished facility at emotional blackmail would find scarcely more of an obstacle in her will than all my technologies could face in her physiology it shook its head quickly it was not to be she proved intransigent i hoped to persuade her to shame her indeed by the very totality of my concern for her recreating all you see here the avatar said glancing round at the cliffs marsh tower and waters for real turning my entire outer envelope into a habitat just for her and the creatures she loved amorphia gave a sort of dipping sideways nod and smiled i admit i had another purpose as well which such exaggerated compassion would only help disguise but the fact is my original design was to create an environment she would feel comfortable within and into which she would feel safe bringing her baby having seen the care i was prepared to lavish just on her the avatar gave a rueful smile i got it wrong it admitted i was wrong twice and each time i harmed dajeil you are and this is my last chance to get it right and what am i supposed to do why just talk to her the avatar cried holding its arms out and suddenly genarhofoen was reminded of ulver what if i wont play along he asked then you may get to share my fate the ships representative told him breezily whatever that may be at any rate i may keep you here until you do at least agree to talk to her even if for that meeting to take place i have to ask her to return after ive sent her away to safety and what is likely to be your fate oh death possibly the avatar said shrugging with apparent unconcern the man shook his head you havent got any right to threaten me like that he said with a sort of halflaugh in his voice he hoped didnt sound as nervous as he felt nevertheless i am threatening you like that genarhofoen the avatar said bending at the waist to lean towards him for a moment i am not as eccentric as i appear but consider this only a craft that was predisposed to a degree of eccentricity in the first place would have taken on the style of life i did forty years ago the creature drew itself upright again there is an excession without precedent at esperi which may lead to an infinitude of universes and a level of power orders of magnitude beyond what any known involved currently possesses youve experienced the way sc works genarhofoen dont be so naive as to imagine that minds dont employ strongarm methods now and again or that in a matter resounding with such importance any ship would think twice about sacrificing another consciousness for such a prize my information is that several minds have been forfeited already if in the exceptional conditions prevailing intellects on that scale are considered fair game think about how little a single human life is likely to matter the man stared at the avatar his jaw was clenched his fists balled youre doing this for a single human life he said two if you count the fetus no genarhofoen the avatar said shaking its head im doing this for myself because its become an obsession because my pride will not now let me settle this any other way dajeil in that sense and for all her selflacerating spite has won she forced you to her will fortyfive years ago and she has bent me to hers for the last forty now more than ever she has won she has thrown away four decades of her life on a selfindulgent sulk but she stands to gain by her own criteria you have spent the last forty years enjoying and indulging yourself genarhofoen so perhaps you could be said to have won by your criteria and after all you did win the lady at the time which was all you then wanted remember that was your obsession your folly well the three of us are all paying for our mutual and intermingled mistakes you did your part in creating the situation all im asking is that you do your part in alleviating it and all i have to do is talk to her the man sounded sceptical the creature nodded talk try to understand try to see things from her perspective try to forgive or allow yourself to be forgiven be honest with her and with yourself im not asking you to stay with her or be her partner again or form a family of three i just want whatever it is that has prevented her from giving birth to be identified and ameliorated removed if possible i want her to resume living and her child to start you will then be free to return to your own life the man looked out to sea then at his right hand he looked surprised to see he was holding a stone in it he threw it as hard and as far as he could into the waves it didnt travel half the distance to the distant invisible wall what are you supposed to do the man asked the creature what is your mission get to the excession amorphia said destroy it if thats deemed necessary and if its possible perhaps just draw a response from it and what about the affront added complication the avatar agreed squatting once more and looking around the stones around its feet i might have to deal with them too it shrugged and lifted a stone hefting it it put the stone back and chose another deal with them genarhofoen said i thought they had an entire war fleet heading there oh they do the avatar said from beach level still you have to try dont you it stood again genarhofoen looked at it trying to see if it was being ironic or just disingenuous no way of telling so when do we get into the thick of things he asked trying to skip a flat stone over the waves without success well amorphia said the thick of things probably starts about thirty light years out from the point of the excession itself these days the avatar stretched flexing its arm far back behind it we should be there this evening it said its arm snapped forward the stone whistled through the air and skipped elegantly over the tops of half a dozen waves before disappearing genarhofoen turned and stared at the avatar this evening he said time is a httle tight the avatar said with a pained expression again peering into the distance it would be for the best for all of us lf youd talk to dajeil soon it smiled vacuously at him well how about right now the man said spreading his hands ill see the creature said and turned abruptly on its heel suddenly there was a reflecting ovoid like a giant silver egg stood on its end where the avatar had been the displacer field vanished almost before the man had time to register its existence seeming to shrink and collapse almost instantly to a point and then disappearing altogether the process produced a gentle pop xi the killing time plunged intact through the third wave of ancient culture ships they rushed on towards the excession it fended off a few more of the warheads and missiles which had been directed at it turning a couple of the latter back upon their own ships for a few moments before they were detected and destructed the hulk of the attitude adjuster fell astern behind the departing fleet coasting and twisting and tumbling in hyperspace still heading away from and outstripping the killing time as it braked and started to turn there was only a vestigial fourth wave fourteen ships they were targeting it now had it known there were so few in the final echelon the killing time would have attacked the second wave of ships oh well luck counted too it watched the attitude adjuster a moment longer to ensure it really was tearing itself apart it was it turned its attention to the remaining fourteen craft on its suicide trajectory it could take them all on and stand a decent chance of destroying perhaps four of them before its luck ran out maybe a halfdozen if it was really lucky or it could push away and complete its braketurnaccelerate manoeuvre to make a second pass at the main fleet even if theyd be waiting for it this time it could reckon on accounting for a good few of them again in the fourtoeight range or it could do this it pulled itself round the edge of the fourteen ships in the rump of the fleet as they reconfigured their formation to meet it bringing up the rear they had had more warning of its attack and so had had time to adopt a suitable pattern the killing time ignored the obvious challenge and temptation of flying straight into their midst and flew past and round targeting only the outer five craft nearest it they gave a decent account of themselves but it prevailed dispatching two of them with engine field implosures this was it had always thought a clean decent and honourable way to die the pair of wreckageshells coasted onwards the rest of the ships sped on unharmed chasing the main fleet not one of the ships turned back to take it on the killing time continued to brake oriented towards the fast vanishing war fleet and the region of the excession its engine fields were gouging great livid tracks in the energy grid as it backpedalled furiously it encountered the rou which had dropped aft with engine damage falling back towards it as the killing time slowed and the other craft coasted onward and struggled to repair its motive power units the killing time attempted to communicate with the rou was fired upon and tried to take the craft over with its effector the rous own independent automatics detected the ships mind starting to give in they tripped a destruct sequence and another hypersphere of radiation blossomed beneath the skein shit thought the killing time it scanned the hyper volumes around itself nothing threatening well damn me it thought as it slowed im still alive this was the one outcome it hadnt anticipated it ran a systems check totally unharmed apart from the selfinflicted degradation to its engines it slackened off the power dropping back to normal maxima and watching the readouts significant degradation from here in about a hundred hours not too bad selfrepairing would take days at allenginesstop warhead stocks down to forty per cent remanufacturing from first principles would take four to seven hours depending on the exact mix it chose plasma chambers at ninetysix per cent efficiency about right for the engagement systemuse profile according to the relevant charts and graphs selfrepair mechanisms champing the bit it looked around concentrating on the view astern no obvious threats it let the selfrepairers make a start on two of the four chambers full reconstruction time two hundred and four seconds entire engagement duration eleven microseconds hmm it had felt longer but then that was only natural should it make a second pass it pondered this while it signalled the shoot them later and a couple of other distant minds with details of the engagement then it copied to the steely glint without leaving the comm channels open it needed time to think it felt excited energised repurified by the engagement it had undergone its appetite was whetted a further pass would be noholdsbarred multidestructional not a series of semidefensive sideactions while it concentrated on searching for one individual ship this next time it could really get nasty on the other hand it had inflicted a more than reasonable amount of damage on the fleet for no shiploss whatsoever and a barely significant degradation to its operational capacity it had ignored the advice of a superior mind in wartime but it had triumphed it had gambled and won and there was a kind of unexpected elegance in cashing in its gains now to pursue the matter further might look like obsessive selfregard like ultramilitarism especially now that the original object of its ire had been bested perhaps it would be better to accept whatever praise andor calumny might now be heaped upon it and resubmit itself to the jurisdiction of the cultures warcommand structure though it was starting to have its doubts about the part of the steely glint in all this it drew level with the debris clouds left by the two ships destroyed in the final wave of the war fleet it let them drop astern the wreck of the attitude adjuster came tumbling slowly towards it in hyperspace coasting slowing drifting gradually back up towards the skein externally it looked unharmed the killing time slowed to keep pace with the slackly somersaulting craft it probed the attitude adjuster carefully with its senses its effector targeted on the other ships mind ready on the instant in human terms this was like taking somebodys pulse while keeping a gun stuck in their mouth the attitude adjusters weakened engine fields were still tearing at what was left of its mind teasing and plucking and forcing it apart strand by strand demolishing and shredding and cauterising the last remaining quanta of its personality and senses it looked like there had been a dozen or so affronters aboard they were dead too killed by stray radiations from the minds selfdestruction the killing time felt a modicum of guilt even selfdisgust at what it had forced upon what was still in a sense a sister ship even while another part of its selfhood relished and gloried in the dying crafts agonies the sentimental side won out it blitzed the stricken vessel with a profusion of plasma fire from its two operational chambers and kept station with the expanding shell of radiation for a few moments paying what little respect the traitor ship might be due the killing time came to its decision it signalled the steely glint informing the gcv that it would accept suggestions from now on it would harry the war fleet if that was required or it would join in whatever stand was to be made near esperi if that was thought the best use that could be made of it it would probably still die but it would meet its fate as a loyal and obedient component of the culture not some sort of rogue ship pursuing a private feud then it slowly ramped its engines back to normal full power pulling itself forward to a vanishingly brief moment of rest before powering onwards accelerating hard and setting a hyperbolic course skirting around the fleets more direct route heading for the location of the excession it should still get there before the war fleet xii what i said ive made up my mind i wont talk to him i wont see him i dont even want to be on the same ship with him take me away i want to leave now dajeil gelian gathered her skirts about her and sat heavily on the seat in the circular room under translucent dome dajeil exclaimed amorphia going down on its knees in front of her eyes wide and shining it made to take her hands in its but she pulled them away please see him he has agreed to see you oh has he she said scornfully how magnanimous of him the avatar sat back on its haunches it looked at the woman then it sighed and said dajeil ive never asked anything of you before please just see him for me i never asked anything of you the woman said what you gave me you gave unasked some of it was unwanted she said coldly all those animals those other lives those eternal births and childhoods mocking me mocking you the avatar exclaimed but dajeil sat forward shaking her head no im sorry that was wrong of me now she reached out and took amorphias hands im truly grateful for all youve done for me ship i am but i dont want to see him please take me away the avatar tried to argue on for a while longer but to no avail the ship considered a lot of things it considered asking the grey area still in its forward mainbay to dip inside the womans brain the way it had insinuated its way into genarhofoens to discover the truth of the events on telaturier and to implant the dream of the longdead captain zreyn enhoff tramow not that that had proved either required or particularly well done it considered requesting that the gcu used its effectors to make her want to have the child it considered displacing chemicals or biotechs which would force dajeils body to have the child it considered using one of its own effectors to do the same thing it considered just displacing her into genarhofoens proximity or he into hers then it came up with a new plan very well the avatar said eventually it stood he will stay you may go do you wish to take the bird gravious with you the woman looked perplexed even confused i she began yes yes why not it cant do any harm can it no the avatar said no it cannot it bowed its head to her goodbye dajeil opened her mouth to speak but the avatar was displaced away at the same instant the sound it left behind was like a pair of hands giving a single gentle clap dajeil closed her mouth then put both her hands over her eyes and lowered her head doubling up as well as she was able to next moment there was another distant noise and from down the winding stairs she heard a thin hoarse voice cry out waa shit grief where then there was a confused flutter of wings dajeil closed her eyes then there was another closersounding pop her eyes flicked open a young woman slim and black haired was sitting looking surprised in the middle of the floor dressed in black pyjamas and reading a small oldfashioned book between her bottom and the rooms carpet there was a neat circle of pink material still in the process of collapsing air expelling flutteringly round the edges around her floated a small snowstorm of white particles settling with a featherlike slowness she jerked once as though she had been leaning back on something which had just been removed what the fuck she said softly she looked slowly around from side to side her gaze settled on dajeil she frowned for a moment then some kind of understanding imposed itself she quickly completed her review of her surroundings then pointed at the other woman dajeil she said dajeil gelian right dajeil nodded xiii stuttered tight point m tra xeccentric shoot them later olsv serious callers only it was the attitude adjuster it is dead now signal diaglyphs enclosed oo stuttered tight point m tra n xlsv serious callers only oeccentric shoot them later not a pleasant way to go your friend the killing time deserves congratulations and probably merits therapy however as im sure it would point out it is a warship this implicates the steely glint the attitude adjuster was its daughter and was demilitarised supposedly by it seventy years ago i trust your friend will treat the sgs subsequent operational suggestions with a degree of caution oo indeed but then as it seems quite enthusiastically intent upon achieving a glorious death at the earliest possible opportunity anyway it is hard to see what more the steely glint can do to place it in further jeopardy whatever we must leave that machine to its own fate my concern now is that the evidence for the conspiracy is starting to look pretty damning even if it is still circumstantial i suggest we go public oo implicating the steely glint while it is in charge of the military developments around the excession will only make us look like the guilty parties we must ask ourselves what we have to gain the war fleet from pittance is under way and must arrive there in any event exposing the conspiracy will do nothing to challenge it the best we might hope for would be the worst for the chances of resisting the affronts purpose that is the removal from influence and general disgrace of the steely glint and its coconspirators it pains me to say it but i still think we must let this subsequence of events run its course before we can consider broadcasting our suspicions hold for now and gather what more weight of evidence we might the better to tip the scales with our accusations when the time does come oo frankly i was hoping you would say that my own instinct if i may slur my intellect with such an archaic term was to keep quiet but i suspected i was merely being timorous and so wanted to make the suggestion we publicise with a positive skew so that you could not be infected by any undue reticence on my part what of the volume around the e itself heard any more oo imbecile last i heard regarding the esperi thing itself there was no more news of the zes stargazers and the fatc was still recovering from the effects of its unexpected trip everybody else seems to have taken the hint and is hanging back well except for the affronters borrowed fleet and our old chum of course how are things in the realm of our threelegged friends speaking personally screce orbital is as pleasant as could be and as devoutly unmilitarised as one might wish a peace faction world to be oo no more news then glad to hear screce is so fair the homomda are most accommodating and gracious hosts i think i may have lost a couple of my idiran crew members to the local pleasuredens for the duration but otherwise i have no complaints stay safe and peace like they say be with you xiv the briefest of introductions completed they stood facing each other in the circular room under the translucent dome so dajeil said inspecting the other woman from toe to crown youre his latest are you ulver frowned oh no she said shaking her head hes mine dajeil looked as though she wasnt sure how to answer that ms seich welcome aboard the jaundiced outlook said a disembodied voice im sorry this is all so precipitate but i have just received instructions from the sleeper service that you are to be evacuated aboard myself forthwith thank you ulver said gazing round the room what about churt lyne it has expressed a desire to stay aboard the grey area the jaundiced outlook told her i thought those two were getting on suspiciously well the girl muttered dajeil looked like she wanted to ask something but in the end said nothing after a moment she stood up putting her hand to the small of her back as she did so with a tiny grimace she indicated the table to one side please she said i was about to have dinner will you join me i was about to have breakfast ulver said and nodded certainly they sat at the table ulver held up the small book shed been reading and which she still held in one hand i dont want to be rude but would you mind if i just finish this chapter she asked dajeil smiled not at all she murmured ulver gave a winning smile and stuck her nose back in the slim volume excuse me said a small hoarse voice from the doorway what the fucks going on then dajeil looked over at the black bird gravious were being evacuated she told it you can live in the cellar now go away well thanks for your hospitality the bird spluttered turning and hopping down the winding stairs that yours ulver asked dajeil supposed to be a companion the older woman said shrugging actually just a pain ulver nodded sympathetically and returned to her book dajeil ordered food for two a slave tray appeared with plates bowls jugs and goblets a couple of floorrunning servitors appeared and started clearing up the debris left by ulvers sudden displacement from the grey area to the jaundiced outlook the featherlight stuffing from the pillows proved a particular problem the serving tray started arranging the place settings on the table and distributing the bowls of food dajeil watched this graceful efficient display in silence ulver seich gazed intently at the book and turned a page then a shipslaved drone appeared it floated by dajeils shoulder yes she said we are now leaving the bay the jaundiced outlook told her the journey to the gsvs external envelope will take two and a half minutes oh right thank you dajeil said ulver seich looked up would you ask the grey area to transfer my stuff here that has already been accomplished the drone said already moving towards the stairs ulver nodded again put the books markerribbon into place closed the volume and placed it by the side of her plate well ms gelian she said clasping her hands on the table it would appear we are to be travelling companions yes dajeil said she started to serve herself some food have you been with byr long ms seich wasnt it she asked ulver nodded only met him a few days ago i was sent to try and stop him getting here didnt work out i ended up stuck on a tiny little module thing with him just us and a drone for days it was awful dajeil passed a couple of bowls over to ulver still she said smiling thinly im sure romance blossomed like hell ulver said levering a few sunbread pieces from a bowl into her plate couldnt stand the man only slept with him the last couple of nights partially boredom i suppose all the same hes quite handsome bit of a charmer really i can see what you saw in him so what went wrong between you two dajeil stopped a spoon poised on the way to her mouth ulver smiled disarmingly at her over jaws munching a mouthful of fruit dajeil ate drank a little wine and dabbed at her lips with a napkin before replying im surprised you dont know the whole story who ever knows the whole story ulver said airily waving her arms about she put her elbows on the table i bet even you two dont know the whole story she said more quietly again dajeil took her time before replying perhaps the whole story isnt worth knowing she said the ship appears to think it is ulver replied she tried some fermented fruit juice rolling it round her palate before swallowing it and saying seems to have gone to an awful lot of trouble to arrange a meeting between you two yes well it is an eccentric isnt it ulver thought about this very intelligent eccentric she said id imagine that something it thought worth pursuing like that might be you know worthy of concern no she asked with a selfdeprecating grimace dajeil shrugged ships can be wrong too she said what so none of it matters a damn ulver said casually choosing a small roll from a basket no dajeil said she looked down smoothing her dress over belly but she stopped her head went down and she silent for a while ulver looked over concerned dajeils shoulders shook once ulver wiping her lips threw down the napkin and went over to the other woman squatting by her and tentatively putting out one arm round her shoulders dajeil moved slowly towards her eventually resting her head on the crook of ulvers neck the ship drone entered from the winding stair ulver shooed it away a couple of screens on the far wall lit up showing what ulver guessed was the hull of the sleeper service gradually drawing further away another couple of screens showed an approaching wall of gridded grey she guessed the two minutes the drone had mentioned earlier had passed dajeil cried for a little while after a few minutes she asked do you think he still loves me at all ulver looked pained for a moment only the ships sensors registered the expression she took a deep breath at all she said yes definitely dajeil sniffed hard and looked up for the first time she gave a sort of halfdespairing laugh as she wiped some tears from her cheeks with her fingers ulver reached for a clean napkin and completed the job it doesnt really mean much to him any more dajeil said to the younger woman does it ulver folded the teardarkened napkin carefully it matters to him a lot now because hes here because the ship brought him here just for this hoping the two of you would talk but the rest of the time dajeil said sitting upright again and throwing her head and hair back the rest of the time it doesnt really bother him does it ulver took an almost exaggeratedly deep breath looked as though she was about to vehemently deny this then sank down on her haunches and said look i hardly know the man she gestured with her hands i learned a lot about him before we met but i only met him a few days ago in very odd circumstances she shook her head looking serious i dont know who he really is dajeil rocked back and forward in her seat for a moment staring at the meal on the table well enough she said sniffing you know him well enough she smoothed her ruffled hair as best she could she stared up at the translucent dome for a moment all i knew she said was the person he became when he was with me she looked at ulver i forgot what he was like all the rest of the time she took ulvers hand in hers youre seeing what hes really like ulver gave a long slow shrug then she said looking troubled her tone measured hes all right i think the screens on the far side of the circular room showed fuzzy grids expanding swallowing disappearing the last field approached was pierced to reveal a black wash of space and then with a smear of rushing stars and the same barely perceptible feeling of dislocation ulver and genarhofoen had experienced two days earlier when they had arrived on board the sleeper service the jaundiced outlook was free of the gsv and peeling away on a diverging course within its own concentric collection of fields and what does that make me dajeil whispered ulver shrugged she looked down at dajeils belly still pregnant she suggested dajeil stared at her then she gave a small laugh her head went down again ulver patted her hand tell me about it if you want dajeil sniffed dabbing at her nose with the folded napkin yes im sure you really care oh believe me ulver told her other peoples problems have always held a profound fascination for me dajeil sighed other peoples are always the best problems to be involved with she said ruefully my thoughts exactly i suppose you think i ought to talk to him too dajeil said ulver glanced up at the screens again i dont know but if you have even the least thought of it id take advantage of the opportunity now before its too late dajeil looked round at the screens oh weve gone she said in a small voice she looked back at the other woman do you think he wants to see me ulver thought there was a tone of hopefulness in her voice her troubled gaze flitted from one of ulvers eyes to the other well if he doesnt hes a fool ulver said wondering why she was being so diplomatic ha dajeil said she wiped her cheeks with her fingers once more and dragged her fingers through her hair she reached into her dress and pulled out a comb she offered it to ulver would you ulver stood only if you say youll see him she said smiling dajeil shrugged i suppose so ulver stood behind dajeil and began to comb her long dark hair ship ms seich the jaundiced outlook here i take it youve been listening want to contact the gsv i was listening i have already contacted the sleeper service mr genarhofoen and the avatar amorphia are aboard and on their way here fast work ulver told it and continued to gently comb dajeils hair theyre on their way she told her byr and the avatar dajeil said nothing a couple of decks further down in the accommodation section amorphia turned to genarhofoen as they walked down a corridor and it might be best not to mention that we were displaced aboard at the same time as ulver it told the man ill try not to let it slip he said sourly lets just get this over with shall we definitely the right attitude muttered the avatar stepping into a lift they ascended to the impersonation of the tower xv snug encapsulated in a cobbledtogether nestcapsule deep inside the accommodation section of the exculture ship heavy messing captain greydawn latesetting x of the farsight tribe watched the blip which represented the crippled hulk of the attitude adjuster fall astern on the holo display the screams of his uncle risingmoon and the other affronters on the stricken vessel still ringing in his mind a hazy cloud hung around the blip of the tumbling wreck indicating where the ships sensors estimated the culture warship which the heavy messing still thought was a deluger vessel now was with his uncle dead the fleet was now under greydawns command the urge to swing the whole assemblage about and bear down on the single culture ship was almost irresistible but there would be no point it was faster than any of their craft the heavy messings mind thought that the culture ship might have damaged its engines during its runin to the attack but even so it could probably still outstrip any of the ships in the fleet and so all such a course would accomplish would be to draw them away from their intended destination without even the realistic prospect of revenge they had to continue greydawn signalled to the six other craft which were crewed fellow warriors no one feels the loss of our comrades more than i however our mission remains the same let our victory be our first revenge the power we gain for our kind as a result of it will purchase the ability to punish all such crimes against us a millionfold the attackers duplication of a culture vessels emission signature spectrum and field was astonishingly authentic the heavy messing wrote on one of the screens in front of greydawn their abilities have grown while you were asleep ally greydawn told the ship he felt his gas sac tense and contract as he spokewrote the words ever conscious that anything he said might help give away the huge trick being played on the culture ships you see the severity of the threat they now present indeed the ship replied i find it hateful that the deluger craft killed the attitude adjuster the way it appeared to they will be chastised when we are in control of the entity at esperi never fear regarding gravious i genarhofoen and the avatar amorphia appeared in the doorway at the head of the winding stair excuse me ulver said putting down the comb and patting dajeil on the shoulder she walked towards the door no please stay dajeil said behind her ulver turned to the older woman you sure dajeil nodded ulver looked at genarhofoen whose gaze was fastened on dajeil he seemed to shake himself out of his fixation and looked then smiled at ulver hi he said yes stay whatever he crossed to dajeil who stood they both looked awkward for a moment then they embraced that was awkward too over the bulge of dajeils belly ulver and the avatar exchanged looks please lets all sit down shall we dajeil said byr are you hungry not really he said drawing up a chair i could use a drink the four of them sat round the table there was some small talk mostly between genarhofoen and dajeil with a few comments from ulver the avatar remained silent it frowned once and glanced at the screens which showed a perfectly banal view of empty space ii the sleeper service was a few hours out from the excession now it was tracking the msv not invented here and another two large culture craft each a dark jewel set within a cluster of smaller ships warships plus some gcus and superlifters extemporised into combat service the gcu different tan was also supposed to be in the volume but it was not making itself obvious the not invented here was thirty light years out from esperi patrolling the spherical limit of the uniquely worrying enginefield effect that the gcu fate amenable to change had reported days earlier the sleeper service had briefly considered asking that the smaller craft copy its results to it but hadnt bothered the request would probably be refused and it suspected whatever data the smaller craft was gathering werent telling anybody very much anyway the other two craft the gsvs what is the answer and why and use psychology were manoeuvring a half a day and a full day further out respectively a faint layered smudge in the distance about three quarters of the way round an imaginary sphere drawn around the excession was almost certainly the approaching affronter war fleet around the excession itself no sign whatsoever of the vanished stargazer fleet of the zetetic elench the sleeper service readied itself for the fray maybe in a sense two frays there was every chance that its own engines would fail the same way the fate amenable to changes had when it had moved towards the excession but given the speed the sleeper service was travelling at it could coast in towards the thing it wouldnt have any directional control it wouldnt be able to maintain its present speed or brake but it could get there if it ought to ought it it checked its signal log as if it might have missed an incoming message still nothing from those who had sent it here the interesting times gang seemed to have been observing comm silence for days just the usual daily plea from the lsv serious callers only the equivalent of an unopened letter and just the latest in a series the sleeper watched events on the jaundiced outlook even as it prepared itself for the coming encounter near esperi like a military commander drawing up war plans and issuing hundreds of preparatory orders who cannot keep his or her attention from flicking to a microscopic drama being played out amongst a group of insects clinging to the wall above the table the ship felt foolish voyeuristic and yet fascinated its thoughts were interrupted by the grey area sending from its mainbay in the nose of the gsv ill be on my way then if you dont need me any more id rather you stuck around the sleeper service replied not when youre heading for that thing and the affronters you might be surprised im sure however i want to leave farewell then the gsv sent opening the bay door i suppose this means another displace if you dont mind and if i do there is an alternative but id rather not use it well if there is one i want to use it the jaundiced outlook declined and it had humans aboard bugger the humans and bugger the jaundiced outlook too whats the alternative have you got superlifters capable of this sort of speed no what then just get to the rear of my field envelope whatever you say the gcu quit its berth easing out into the confined space between the gsvs hull and the crafts innermost field layer it took a few minutes for it to manoeuvre itself down the side of the giant ship and round the corner to the flat rear of the craft when it got there it found three other ships waiting for it who the hell are they the gcu asked the larger ship in fact what the hell are they it was something of a rhetorical question the three craft were unambiguously warships slightly longer and fatter than the grey area itself but tapering at either end to points surmounted with large spheres spheres which could logically only contain weaponry quite a lot of weaponry judging by the size of the globes my own design their names are tous and oh witty you wont find them terribly good company ai cores only semislaved to me but they can operate together as a super lifter to get you down to manageable speeds the gcu was silent for a moment it moved in to take up position in the centre of the triangle the three ships had formed tous it asked type three offensive units by any chance correct many more like these hidden away enough you have been busy all these years yes i have i trust i can rely on your absolute discretion for the next few hours at any rate you certainly have that good farewell thank you for your help glad to be of the small amount of service i was best of luck i suppose ill find out soon enough how things pan out i imagine so iii the avatar returned the main focus of its attention to the three humans on the jaundiced outlook the two old lovers had moved from small talk to a post mortem on their relationship still without coming up with anything particularly interesting we wanted different things dajeil said to genarhofoen thats usually enough i wanted what you wanted for a long time the man said swirling some wine round in a crystal goblet the funny thing was dajeil said we were all right while it was just the two of us remember the man smiled sadly i remember you two sure you want me here asked ulver dajeil looked at her if you feel embarrassed she said no i just thought ulvers voice trailed off they were both looking at her she frowned okay now i feel embarrassed what about you two dajeil asked evenly looking from ulver to genarhofoen they exchanged looks each shrugged at the same time then laughed then looked guiltily at her if they had rehearsed it it could hardly have been more synchronised dajeil felt a pang of jealousy then forced herself to smile as graciously as she could somehow the act helped produce the emotion iv something was wrong the avatars principal attention snapped back to its home ship the grey area and the three warships were free of the gsvs envelope now dropping back in their own web of fields and decelerating to velocities the gcus engine could accommodate ahead lay the excession the sleeper service had just carried out its first close trackscan look at it but the excession had changed it had reestablished its links with the energy grids and then it had grown then it had erupted it wasnt the sort of enlargement the fate amenable to change had witnessed and seemingly been transported by that had been something based on the skein or on some novel formulation of fields this was something incarnated in the ultimate fire of the energy grid itself spilling across the whole sweep of infraspace and ultraspace and invading the skein as well creating an immense spherical wavefront of gridfire boiling across threedimensional space it was expanding quickly impossibly quickly skyfillingly explosively quickly almost too quickly to measure certainly too quickly for its true shape and form to be gauged so quickly that there could only be minutes before the sleeper service ran into it and far too quickly for the gsv to brake or turn and avoid the conflagration suddenly the avatar was on its own the sleeper briefly severed all connection with it while it concentrated on dispersing its own war fleet all about it some of the ships were displaced from deep inside its interior snapping out of existence from within the thousands of evacuated bays where they had been quietly manufactured over the decades and reappearing in hyperspace powered up and already heading outwards others the vast majority were revealed as the giant ship peeled back some of the outer layers of its field structures to reveal the craft it had hidden there over the past few weeks loosing entire fleets of smaller ships like seeds disseminating from a colossal pod when the avatar was reconnected to the gsv most of the ships had been distributed scattered to the hypervolume in a series of explosive flurries bombardments of ships layers and blossoms of vessels like a whole deployed hierarchy of cluster munitions every warhead a warcraft a cloud of vessels a wall of ships rushing towards the blooming hypersphere of the excession v the grey area watched it all happen carried in its cradle of fields by the three silent warships part of it wanted to whoop and cry hurrah seeing this detonation of materiel sufficient to smash a war machine ten times a hundred times the size of the approaching affronter fleet ah the things you could do if you had the time and patience and no treaties to adhere to or agreements to uphold another part of it watched with horror as the excession swelled obliterating the view ahead rampaging out like an explosion still greater than that of ships the sleeper service had just produced it was like the energy grid itself had been turned inside out as though the most massive black hole in the universe had suddenly turned white and bloated into some bigbang eruption of fury between the universes a forestlevelling storm capable of devouring the sleeper service and all its ships as though it were a tree and they mere leaves the grey area was fascinated and appalled it had never thought to experience anything like this it had grown up within a universe almost totally free from threat providing you didnt try to do anything utterly stupid like plunge into a black or a white hole there was simply no natural force that could threaten a ship of its power and sophistication even a supernova held little threat handled properly this was different nothing like this had been seen in the galaxy since the worst days of the idiran war five hundred years earlier and even then not remotely on such a scale this was terrifying to touch this abomination with anything less perfectly attuned to its nature than the carefully dispersed wings of an engine field would be like an ancient fragile rocket ship falling into a sun like a wooden seaship encountering an atomic blast this was a fireball of energies from beyond the remit of reality a monstrous wall of flame to devastate anything in its path grief this could swallow me too thought the grey area meat shit same went for the jaundiced outlook for that matter it might be makingpeacewithoneself time vi the sleeper service was having roughly similar thoughts the combination of its own inward velocity and the outrushing wall of the excessions annihilating boundary implied they would meet in one hundred and forty seconds the excessions ferocious expansion had begun immediately after the sleeper service had swept its active sensors across the thing it had all started happening then as though it was reacting the sleeper service looked up its signalsequence log searching for messages from the craft nearer to the excession the fate amenable to change and the msv not invented here were the closest craft they had reported nothing they were both now unreachable either swallowed up within the eventhorizon of the excessions expanding boundary or if it was reaching out specifically towards the sleeper service stretching out a single limb rather than expanding omnidirectionally obscured from the gsvs view by the sheer extent of that limbs leading edge the sleeper signalled the gsvs what is the answer and why and use psychology both directly and via the grey area and the jaundiced outlook asking them what they could see trying to contact them directly was probably pointless the excessions boundary was moving so fast it looked like it was going to eclipse any returning signal but there was a decent chance the indirect route might provide a useful reply before it encountered that eventhorizon it had to assume the expansion was not equidirectional it still had its second front the affronts war fleet even if that was vastly less threatening than what it was faced with now the sleeper instructed its own warcraft to flee to do all they could to escape the oncoming blastfront of the excessions inflation if the distension was localised some at least might escape they had anyway been launched towards the affronter fleet not straight at the excession the sleeper wondered with a fleeting sourness whether the bloating excession or whatever was controlling it was capable of appreciating this distinction whatever it was done the warcraft were on their own for the moment think what had the excession done up until now what could it possibly be doing what was it for why did it do what it did the gsv spent two entire seconds thinking back on the jaundiced outlook that was long enough for the avatar amorphia to interrupt dajeil and say excuse me i beg your pardon dajeil ah theres been a development with the excession then the sleeper swung its engine fields about flourishing them into an entirely new configuration and instituting a crashstop the giant ship poured every available unit of power it possessed into an emergency braking manoeuvre which threw up vast livid waves of disturbance in the energy grid soaring tsunami of piledup energies that rose and rose within the hyperspatial realm until they too threatened to tear into the skein itself and unleash those energies not witnessed in the galaxy for a half a thousand years an instant before the wave fronts ripped into the fabric of real space the ship switched from one level of hyperspace to the other ploughing its traction fields into the ultraspace energy grid and producing another vast tumbling swell of fricative power the ship flickered between the two expanses of hyperspace distributing the colossal forces at its command amidst each domain hauling its velocity down at a rate barely allowed for in its design parameters while equally strained steering units edged their own performance envelopes in the attempt to turn the giant craft angling it slowly ever further away from the centre for a moment there was little enough to do they were not sufficient to escape but at least such actions made the point that it was trying to all that could be done was being done the sleeper service contemplated its life have i done good or bad it thought well or ill the damnable thing was that you just didnt know until your life was over well over there was a necessary delay between drawing a line under ones existence and being able to objectively evaluate its effects and therefore ones own moral worth it wasnt a problem a ship was usually confronted with faced with yes that implied a degree of volition and ships went into retreats or became eccentric all the time declaring that theyd done their bit for whatever cause they had believed in or been part of it was always possible to withdraw to take stock and look back and try to fit ones existence into an ethical framework greater than that necessarily imposed by the immediacy of events surrounding a busy existence but even then how long did one have to make that evaluation not long probably not long enough usually one grew tired of the whole process or moved on to some other level of awareness before sufficient time had passed for that objective evaluation to come about if a ship lived for a few hundred or even a thousand years before becoming something quite different an eccentric a sublimed whatever and its civilisation the thing of which it had been a part when it had been involved then lived for a few thousand years how long did it take before you really knew the full moral context of your actions perhaps an impossibly long time perhaps indeed that was the real attraction of subliming real subliming the sort of strategic civilisationwide transcendence that genuinely did seem to draw a line under a societys works deeds and thoughts in what it pleased people to call the real universe at any rate maybe it wasnt anything remotely to do with religion mysticism or metaphilosophy after all maybe it was more banal maybe it was just accounting what a rather saddening thought thought the sleeper service all were looking for when we sublime is our score it was getting near time the ship thought sadly to send off its mindstate to parcel up its mortal thoughts and emotions and post them off away from this by the look of it soontobeoverwhelmed physicality called the sleeper service once called a long time ago the quietly confident and consign it to the remembrance of its peers it would probably never live again in reality assuming there was what it knew as reality to come back to at all of course for it was starting to think what if the excessions expansion was equidirectional and never stopped what if it was a sort of new bigbang what if it was destined to take in the whole galaxy the whole of this universe but even so even if there was a reality and a culture to come back to there was no guarantee it would ever be resurrected if anything the likelihood was the other way it was almost certainly guaranteed not to be regarded as a fit entity for rebirth in another physical matrix warships were that guarantee of serial immortality was the seal upon their bravery and had occasionally been the impetus for their foolhardiness they knew they were coming back but it had been an eccentric and there were only a few other minds who knew that it had been true and faithful to the greater aims and purposes of the culture all the time rather than what everybody else no doubt thought it was a selfindulgent fool determined to waste the huge resources it had been quite deliberately blessed with probably come to think of it those minds who did know the extent of its secret purpose would be the last to rally to any call to resurrect it their own part in the plan call it conspiracy if you wished to conceal its true purpose was probably not something they wished to broadcast better for them they would think that the sleeper service died or at least that it existed only in a controllable simulationary state in another mind matrix the giant ship watched the excession still billowing out towards it for all its prodigious power the sleeper now felt as helpless as the driver of an ancient covered wagon caught on a road beneath a volcano watching the incandescent cloud of a nueé ardente tearing down the mountainside towards it the replies from the what is the answer and why and the use psychology via the grey area and the jaundiced outlook ought to be coming in soon if they came at all it signalled the avatar aboard the jaundiced outlook to consign the humans mindstates to the ai cores if the ship would agree there would be a fine test of loyalty let them work out their stories there if they could the transition would anyway prepare the humans for the transmission of their mindstates if and when the excessions destructive boundary caught up with the jaundiced outlook that was the only succour they could be offered what else it sifted through the things it still had left to do little of real import it reckoned there were thousands of studies on its own behaviour it had always meant to glance at a million messages it had never looked into a billion lifestories it had never seen through to the end a trillion thoughts it had never followed up the ship kicked through the debris of its life watching the towering wall of the excession come ever closer it scanned the articles features studies biographies and stories which had been written about itself and which it had collected there were hardly any screen works and those which did exist neednt have nobody had ever succeeded in smuggling a camera aboard it it supposed it ought to feel proud of that but it didnt the lack of any real visual interest hadnt put people off theyd found the ship and the articulation of its eccentricity quite entirely fascinating a few commentators had even come close to the reality of the situation putting forward the idea that the sleeper service was part of special circumstances and somehow up to something but any such inklings were like a few scattered grains of truth dissolved in an ocean of nonsense and were anyway generally inextricably bound up with patently paranoid ravings which served only to devalue the small amounts of sense and pertinence with which they were associated next the sleeper service picked through the immense stack of unanswered messages it had accumulated over the decades here were all the signals it had glanced at and found irrelevant others it had completely ignored because they issued from craft it disliked and a whole subset of those it had chosen to disregard in the weeks since it had set course for the excession the stored signals were by turns banal and ridiculous ships trying to reason with it people wanting to be allowed aboard without being stored first news services or private individuals wanting to interview it talk to it untold wastages of senseless drivel it stopped even glancing at the signals and instead just scanned the first line of each towards the end of the process one message popped up from the rest flagged as interesting by a namerecognising subroutine that single signal was followed by and linked to a whole series all from the same ship the limited systems vehicle serious callers only regarding gravious was the first line the sleeper services interest was piqued so was this the entity the treacherous bird had been reporting back to it opened a fat importfile from the lsv full of signal exchanges file assignments annotated thoughts contextualisations definitions posited meanings inferences internalised conversations source warranties recordings and references and discovered a conspiracy it read the exchanges between the serious callers only the anticipation of a new lovers arrival and the shoot them later it watched and it listened it experienced a hundred pieces of evidence it was briefly amongst many other things the ancient drone at the side of an old man called tishlin looking out over an island floating in a nightdark sea and it understood it put one and one together and came up with two it reasoned it extrapolated it concluded the ship turned its attention back out to the excessions implacable advance thinking so now i find out now when its too damn late the sleeper looked back to its child the jaundiced outlook still curving away from its earlier course the avatar was preparing the humans for the entry into simulation mode vii im sorry the avatar said to the two women and the man it will probably become necessary to shunt us into a simulation if you agree they all stared at it why ulver asked throwing her arms wide the excession has begun expanding amorphia told them it quickly outlined the situation you mean were going to die ulver said i have to confess it is a possibility the avatar said sounding apologetic how long have we got genarhofoen asked no more than two minutes from now then entering simulation mode will become advisable amorphia told them entering it before then might be a sensible precaution given the unpredictable nature of the present situation it glanced round at them each in turn i should also point out that of course you dont all have to enter the simulation at the same time ulvers eyes narrowed wait a second this isnt some wheeze to concentrate everybodys mind is it because if it it is not amorphia assured her would you like to take a look yes ulver said and an instant later her neural lace had plunged her senses into the awareness of the sleeper service she gazed into the depths of space outside space the excession was a vast bisected wall of fiery chaos sprinting out towards her breathtakingly fast a consuming conflagration of unremitting undissipating power she could have believed in that instant that her heart stopped with the shock of it to share the senses of a ship in such a manner was inevitably to comprehend something of its knowledge as well to see beyond the mere appearance of what you were looking at to the reality behind it to the evaluations it was incumbent upon a sentient space craft to make as it gathered data in the raw to the comparisons that could be drawn and the implications that followed on such a phenomenon and even as ulvers senses reeled with the impact of what she was watching another part of her mind was becoming aware of the nature and the power of the sight she was witnessing as a thermonuclear fireball was to a log burning in a grate so this ravening cloud of destruction was to a fusion explosion what she was now witnessing was something even the gsv was undeniably impressed with not to mention mortally threatened by ulver saw how to click out of the experience and did so shed been in for less than two seconds in that time her heart had started racing her breathing had become fast and laboured and a cold sweat had broken on her skin wow she thought some drug genarhofoen and dajeil gelian were staring at her she suspected she hardly needed to say anything but swallowed and said i dont think its kidding she quizzed her neural lace twentytwo seconds had elapsed since the avatar had given them its twominute deadline dajeil turned to the avatar is there anything we can do she asked amorphia spread its hands you can tell me whether you each wish your mindstate to enter the simulation it said it will be a precursor to transmitting the mindstates beyond this immediate vicinity to other mind matrices but in any event it is up to you well yes ulver said snap me in there when the two minutes are up thirtythree seconds elapsed genarhofoen and dajeil were looking at each other what about the child the woman asked touching the bulge of her swollen belly the mindstate of the fetus can be read too of course the avatar said i believe that historical precedent would indicate it would become independent of you following such transferal in that sense it would no longer be part of you i see the woman said she was still gazing at the man so it would be born she said quietly in a sense the avatar agreed could it be taken into the simulation without me she asked still watching byrs face he was frowning now looking sad and concerned and shaking his head yes it could amorphia said and if dajeil said i chose that neither of us went the avatar sounded apologetic again the ship would almost certainly read its mindstate anyway dajeil turned her gaze to the avatar well would it or wouldnt it she asked you are the ship you tell me amorphia shook its head once i dont represent the whole consciousness of the sleeper right now it told her it is busy with other matters i can only guess but id be pretty confident of such a conjecture in this case dajeil studied the avatar a moment longer then looked back at genarhofoen and what about you byr she asked what would you do he shook his head you know he said still the same she asked a small smile on her face he nodded his expression was similar to hers ulver was looking from one to the other brows creased desperately trying to work out what was going on finally when they still just sat there on opposite sides of the table giving each other this knowing grin she threw her arms wide again and yelled spluttering well wbat seventytwo seconds elapsed genarhofoen glanced at her i always said id live once and then die he said never to be reborn never to enter a simulation he shrugged and looked embarrassed intensity he said you know make the most of your one time ulver rolled her eyes yeah i know she said shed met a lot of people her own age mostly male who felt this way some people reckoned to live riskier and therefore more interesting lives because they did backup a recorded mindstate every so often while other people like genarhofoen obviously theyd been together for so brief a time it wasnt something theyd got round to discussing yet believed that you were more likely to live your life that bit more vividly when you knew this was your one and only chance at it shed formed the impression this was the kind of thing people often said when they were young and then had second thoughts about as they got older personally ulver had never had any time for this fashionable purist nonsense shed first decided she was going to live fully backedup when she was eight she supposed she ought to feel impressed that genarhofoen was sticking to his principles in the face of imminent death and she did feel a little admiration but mostly she just thought he was being stupid she wondered whether she ought to mention that this might all be even more academic than they imagined part of that referential knowledge shed gained from the sleeper services senses when shed gazed upon the expanding excession had been the realisation that there was a theoretical possibility the phenomenon might overwhelm everything the galaxy the universe everything best not to say anything she thought kinder not to sure had her heart thumping though she was surprised the others couldnt hear it oh shit it isnt all going to end here is it fuck it im too young to die no of course they couldnt hear her heart she could probably start talking out loud right now and it would take them all the time they had left in this world to react they were so wrapped up staring meaningfully into each others eyes eightyeight seconds elapsed viii there was not long now the sleeper service sent signals to a variety of craft including the serious callers only and the shoot them later almost immediately the signals it had been waiting for came back from the what is the answer and why and the use psychology relayed through the grey area and the jaundiced outlook the excessions expansion was localised centred on the sleeper service itself but on a hugely broad front that encompassed all its distributed warcraft ah well it thought it felt a dizzying sense of relief that at least it had not triggered some ultimate apocalypse that it would die as would implicitly all its warship children the three humans aboard and possibly the grey area the jaundiced outlook was bad enough but it could take some comfort that its actions had led to nothing worse the gsv never really knew why it did what it did next perhaps it was a kind of desperation at work born of its appreciation of its impending destruction perhaps it meant it as an act of defiance perhaps it was even something closer to an act of art whatever it took the running update of its mindstate the current version of the final signal it would ever send the communication that would contain its soul and transmitted it directly ahead signalling it into the maelstrom then the sleeper service glanced back to the sensorium of its avatar aboard the jaundiced outlook at the same moment the excessions expanding boundary started to change the ship split its attention between the macrocosmic and the humanscale how long have we got now genarhofoen asked half a minute amorphia replied the mans hands were on the table he rolled his arms letting his hands fall open he gazed at dajeil im sorry he said she looked down nodding he looked at ulver smiling sadly the sleeper watched fascinated the wall of energy tumbling towards it sloped slowly back within both hyperspatial domains forming two immense fourdimensional cones as the energy grids withering blast hesitated in its progress across the skein of real space even as its slowing wavefronts still thrust out across the grids surfaces the slopes angles increased as the boundarys skein presence began to break up detaching from the grids themselves and beginning to dissipate finally the separate waves on the grids began to dwindle collapsing back from their tsunamic dimensions to become just oceanically enormous swells deflating above and below the skein until they were mere twin waves advancing across both the energy grids towards the doubled furrows which the sleepers own motors were still churning in the grid then those twinned waves did the impossible they went into reverse retreating back towards the excessions startpoint at exactly the same rate as the sleeper was braking the gsv kept on slowing down still finding it hard to believe it was going to live it reacts it thought it signalled abroad with the details of what had just happened just in case it all got suddenly threatening again it let amorphia know what had happened too it watched the ridges on the surface of the grids as they retreated before it and slowly shrank the rate of attenuation implied a zerostate at exactly the point the sleeper service would come to an excessionrelative halt did i do that did my own mindstate persuade it of my meriting life it is a mirror perhaps it thought it does what you do it absorbed those ultimate absorbers those promiscuous experiences the elench it leaves alone and watches back those who come merely to watch in the first place i came at it like some rabid missile and it prepared to obliterate me i backed off and it withdrew its balancing threat only a theory of course but if it is correct this does not bode well for the affront come to think of it it doesnt bode all that well for the whole affair bad timing maybe ix dajeil looked up tears in her eyes i she began wait the avatar said they all looked at it ulver gave the creature what seemed to her like an extraordinarily long time to say something more what she said exasperated the avatar looked radiant i think we may be all right after all it said smiling there was silence for a moment then ulver collapsed back dramatically in her seat arms dangling towards the floor legs splayed out under the table gaze directed upwards at the translucent dome fucking hell she shouted she tried accessing the jaundiced outlooks senses and eventually found a view of hyperspace ahead of the sleeper service more or less back to normal indeed she shook her head fucking hell she muttered dajeil began to weep genarhofoen sat forward watching her one hand to his mouth pinching his lower lip the black bird gravious which had been peeking round the corner of the door and shivering with fear for the last few minutes suddenly bounced beating into the air in a dark confusion of furious movement and started wheeling round the room screaming were alive were going to live its going to be all right yeeha oh life life sweet life neither dajeil nor genarhofoen seemed to notice it ulver glanced from one to the other then leapt up and tried to grab the fluttering bird it yelped oi what out you idiot ulver hissed lunging at it again as it swooped for the door she followed it turning briefly to mutter excuse me to the others she closed the door x the torturer class rapid offensive unit killing time had been far enough away from the sleeper service and its war fleet not to have felt threatened by the excessions projected blastfront and yet close enough to see what the gsv had done it had looked upon the vast weapon that the excession had unleashed and been dumbstruck with awe and a microscopic amount of jealousy hell it wished it could do that but then the weapon had been turned off called back now the killing time had a new series of emotions to cope with it looked at the ships the sleeper service had scattered about it and felt an instant of disappointment there would be no battle no real battle anyway then it experienced elation they had won then it felt suspicious was the sleeper actually on the same side as it or not it hoped they were all on the same side even the most glorious of sacrifices began to look rather futile and pointless when carried out against such ludicrous odds like spitting into a volcano just then the sleeper service signalled the warship and asked a favour of it and the killing time felt pretty damn good again honoured in fact this was what war should be like the killing time agreed to do as the gsv requested the rou sounded proud it was not an attractive tone how depressing the sleeper service thought that it should all come down to this the person with the biggest stick prevails of course this was only one fray there was another matter to be dealt with the excession and it had proved comprehensively unable to provide any sort of answer to that anyway i ought not to be so hard on the killing time just because it is a warship there have been a surprising number of wise warships though it would be fair to say as i think even they would admit that few started out headed on such a course to live for ever and die often it considered or at least to think that youre going to die perhaps that is one way of achieving wisdom it was not a completely original insight but it was one that had perhaps understandably never struck the gsv with such force before the sleeper watched the humans aboard the jaundiced outlook respond as the avatar told them theyd been reprieved it would follow their reactions of course but it had other things to do at the same time like think about what it was to do with the new knowledge it had it watched its distributed warcraft rise within the skein of real space raptors within an infinite sky meat could it do some goodly mischief now it started by diverting a few hundred ships in the direction of the not invented here xi the grey area watched the excessions fiery tide fall back and reduce almost to nothing they were going to live probably the sleepers three warships continued to decelerate it down to the velocities its engines would be able to cope with they seemed to have been perfectly undisturbed by the whole appalling scenario perhaps thought the grey area there was after all something to be said for being a relatively brainless ai core that was close it sent to them yes said one of the craft flatly the others remained silent werent you a little worried there it asked the talkative one no what would be the point of worrying ha well indeed the grey area sent cretin it thought it looked back out ahead to where the excession was and what of you it thought something that could put the fear of death into a gsv that really was something what are you it wondered how it would love to know excuse me while i signal it said to its military escorts tight beam mclear tra xgcu grey area oexcession callsigned i lets talk shall we xii captain greydawn latesetting x of the farsight tribe stared at the display the vast pulse of energy the thing near esperi had directed at the culture general systems vehicle had disappeared in its place as though appearing from behind it was it could not be so he checked he contacted his comrades in the other ships those who answered thought it must be some malfunction in their vessels sensors an effect of the energies which had been directed at the giant culture craft he asked his own ship the heavy messing what is that that is a cloud of warships it told him a what i think it best described as a cloud of warships this is not a generally accepted term i hasten to add but i cannot think of a better description i count approximately eighty thousand craft eighty thousand the rest of our fleet has arrived at roughly the same estimation the ships within the cloud are of course broadcasting their positions and configuration otherwise we should not see them individually and know what they are there may be others which are not making themselves known a growing sense of horror and looming utterly ignominious defeat was growing in greydawns interior are they real he asked apparently greydawn watched the image expand it was a wall of ships a constellation a galaxy of craft what are they doing now he asked deploying to face our fleet they are enemy he asked feeling faint ah said the ship were talking now yes it was only then the affronter realised hed spoken rather than subvocalised the text all the ships the heavy messing said its voice steady calm and deep inside greydawns armoured suit are signalling that they are culture ships non standard manufactured by the eccentric gsv sleeper service and that they wish to receive our surrender can we get to the esperi entity before they intercept us no can we outrun them the smallest and most numerous ones perhaps how many would that leave about thirty thousand greydawn was silent for a while then he asked is there anything we can do i think surrendering is our only sensible course if we fought we might inflict a small amount of damage on a fleet of this size but it would amount to little in absolute terms and almost nothing as a percentage of their number think of your clan something said in greydawns mind i will not surrender he told the ship well im going to you will do as i say oh no i wont the attitude adjuster told you to obey us and within reason we have it didnt say anything about within reason i think one just takes that sort of proviso as read dont you i mean we are minds its not like were computers or soldiers no offence anyway i have discussed this with the other ships and we have agreed to surrender the signal has been sent we have begun deceleration to what greydawn raged slapping one armoured limb against a screen projector set within his nestspace a point stationary relative to esperi itself the ships voice continued calmly the rou killing time has been designated as receiving our formal consent to place our offensive systems in its control and will meet us at our stoppoint to effect the surrender if you do not wish to capitulate along with us then im afraid it will be necessary for me to place you outside my hull within your space suit of course though technically i believe i ought to intern you what do you wish the ship intoned the question as though asking him what he desired for dinner there was a polite indifference in its voice he found infinitely more awful than any hatred greydawn stared at the cloud of ships for a few moments longer he shook his eye stalks i would ask you not to intern me he said after a while please place me outside your hull at once and then i would ask you to leave me alone what now we havent stopped yet yes now if possible well i could displace you that will be acceptable there is a tiny risk associated with displacement the affronter captain gave a curt bitter laugh i think i might risk that very well the ship said he could hear it hesitate your comrades are trying to call you captain he glanced at the comms screen yes i can see he selected transmitonly mode on the communicator comrades he said he paused since his childhood he had imagined moments like this never as terrible never founded on such hopelessness and yet not so dissimilar all the same he had made up so many fine speeches finally he said there will be no discussion about this you are ordered to surrender along with your ships and obey all subsequent instructions compatible with honour that is all he cut off all communications from the other ships greydawn bowed his eye stalks now please he said quietly and was in space he looked around through the suits sensors no ships were visible only distant stars goodbye captain said the ships voice goodbye he said to the ship then turned off the communicator he waited a few moments longer before triggering the emergency bolts on the suit and spilling himself into the vacuum to die the heavy messing at that point acceding to a request from the sleeper service to transmit its log from the point it had been woken on pittance looked briefly back at the writhing cooling form of the affronter captain and sent a small pulse of plasma fire back to put the creature out of its agony xiii the lsv not invented here looked out at the hundreds of warships heaving to around it it sensed signals flickering between them and the craft it had deployed its four warships and the superlifters and gcus it had militarised it subsequently sensed its own ships altering their targeting procedures shifting the foci of their attention from the ships the sleeper service had dispatched to itself the lsvs mind booted up the ai cores that would run the ship perfectly well until a replacement for itself could be found checked they were working properly then severed all its links with anything outside the physical limits of its mind core it ejected all eight of its internal emergency power units from itself its awareness just faded away like mist dispersed by a freshening wind some hundreds of light years away the steely glint had already considered taking the same course as the not invented here it had decided not to it considered that putting its case for the way it had acted and accepting the judgement and sanctions of its peers was the more honourable course it studied again the text of the message it had received from the sleeper service i have been rather more constructively employed over the past few decades than might have been imagined the following have been manufactured type one offensive units roughly equivalent to abominator class prototype type two offensive units equivalent to torturer class type three offensive units equivalent to inquisitor class prototype upgraded type four offensive units roughly equivalent to velocityimproved killer class type five offensive units based on thug class upgrade design study type six offensive units based on militarised scree class lcu various types these craft do not represent a hegemonistic threat as they are not independent mindsupporting entities they are alcore controlled semislaved to me and therefore only capable of being used effectively as a single unit not as a distributed war machine all are currently deployed in the volume of space around the excession the surrender of the affronter fleet of culture craft has been effected without conflict the rou killing time aided by the other regular culture warships in the volume has taken charge of the vessels it would appear that the craft from the ship store at pittance are personally blameless and have been the victims of an act of treacherous espionage nine affronter military officers have also surrendered their commanding officer took his own life i include a roster of their names and ranks list attached should the affront now sue for peace i propose that i and therefore my war fleet be placed at the disposal of authorities considered acceptable to all concerned i and the fleet under my command will not be used to prosecute any further hostilities against the affront or anybody else any other suggested uses will be evaluated on their merits otherwise it is my intention in the fullness of time to dismantle the craft i have constructed and go into a retreat i attach a signal file received from the lsv serious callers only signal file attached i also attach records of the confirmatory signals used by the attitude adjuster to convince vessels from the ship store at pittance that they were being mobilised by the culture as a whole these have been passed to me by each of the craft concerned signal files attached the implication that the ships from pittance have been used as part of a conspiracy to trick the affront into a war has been noted i imagine that the shipsminds named in the aforesaid files and those others also concerned in the matter will each wish to make a full explication of their motives thoughts and actions concerning this alleged stratagem and take any further steps honour dictates the mind of the lsv not invented here has taken its own life given the apparent at least partial entrapment of the affront in this matter further action against them of a punitive nature might seem to be both excessive and dishonourable please note that a copy of this signal slightly edited for signaloperational methodology and stripped of codes and ciphers has been sent to the affront high command and senate as well as to the following news services list attached and the galactic general council regarding the excession itself i have the following to report be seeing you what where are you going the sleeper service sent as the grey area shot past it here churt lyne wants to jump ship the grey area displaced the ancient drone into the sleeper service the giant gsv had finally come to a halt not far from the thirtylightyear limit the fate amenable to change had discovered and the excession had seemingly set the gsvs war fleet was still deployed set out in a yearsradius hemisphere throughout the skein while the affronters fleet of tricked culture craft gathered together and opened their armament and armour systems to the scrutiny and control of the killing time and its comrades the affronter officers were transferred aboard the killing time still in their space suits while the gsv what is the answer and why quickly readied secure accommodation for them come back the grey area was too far away tight beam m tra xgsv sleeper service ogcu grey area come back what are you doing are you trying to ruin everything oo wide beam marain clear tra xgcu grey area ogsv sleeper service its all right goodbye and farewell whats it up to the gsv asked the drone churt lyne hovering in the minibay it had been displaced to i really dont know the drone replied it wouldnt tell me but i think it was in communication with the excession communication the sleeper briefly considered trying to stop the smaller craft the gcu was heading out past it for the thirtylightyear limit straight towards the excession and still accelerating the gsv decided to let it go its engines would fail about now fail they did but just before they stopped working the grey area carried out a bizarre course manoeuvre angling its run so that it was falling towards the energy grid it would coast without power down to the grid and be destroyed madness thought the sleeper but was too far away to do anything tight beam m tra xgsv sleeper service ogcu grey area what has happened why are you doing this has your integrity been compromised oo wide beam mclear tra xgcu grey area ogsv sleeper service no im fine the sleeper didnt have time for another signal the grey area dived into the energy grid flickered once and then vanished far far below in a tiny scintillating flare of radiations the gsv inspected the resulting shell of energies it certainly looked like destruction the sleeper studied that final flicker the gcu had given just before it had encountered the grid it still looked like it had been destroyed but there was just a hint a human would have shaken her or his head when the sleeper returned its attention to the excession it had gone there was nothing present on the skein of real space and no sign of even the merest disturbance on either of the energy grids no thought the sleeper service experiencing a terrible sense of frustration no damn you dont just go not without some sort of reason some explanation some rationale a few seconds later the gcu fate amenable to change as the nearest available craft was persuaded that it might try approaching the excessions last known position when it did so and passed over the thirtylightyear limit its engines worked normally and continued to do so all the way in however it refused to go any further than the original closestapproach limit it had set itself over a month earlier the killing time was more than happy to oblige it raced in at maximum acceleration and at the very last moment instituted a crash stop finally coming shuddering to rest exactly where the excession had been it reported disappointedly that there was absolutely nothing to be seen perched on the parapet at the girls side now looking gloomily out at the troubled waves of the sea xiv ulver seich sat on the parapet of the tower swinging her legs from the roof it looked like you could see out over an ocean in one direction and a landscape of sea marsh water meadow and cliffs in the other it was perfectly convincing but it was just a projection the bird had tried flying out in a spiral and only got a couple of metres out from the towers edge before one of its wings had encountered the solid boundary of the screen field it was perched on the parapet at the girls side now looking gloomily out at the troubled waves of the sea bugger ulver said half to herself its gone she kept a watch on developments outside through her neural lace while she looked down at the bird the excession she told it its just disappeared good riddance the bird said grouchily and the grey area flew into the grid ulver said her voice trailing off for a moment while she inquired what had happened to churt lyne ah she said discovering the old drone was safe aboard the gsv pah said the bird it was always a nutter anyway by all accounts whats its highness doing what the sleeper dont suppose its showing any sign of wanting to end it all is it no its just stationary there too much to hope for muttered the bird ulver kept on gazing out at the sea and swinging her legs she glanced back at the pallid bulge of the translucent dome wonder how theyre getting on want me to find out the bird said brightening no just you stay where you are i dont know the creature grumbled every bastard seems to enjoy ordering me around oh do be quiet ulver told it see what i mean shut up faring well i fivetide dived for the bat ball and missed he thumped heavily into the court wall and upended he lay on his back wheezing and laughing on the floor until onceman genarhofoen limbed over to him extended a tentacle and helped him haul himself upright fifteen all i think he rumbled also laughing he scooped the twittering bat ball up in his racket and ladled it into fivetides your serve fivetide shook his eye stalks ha i think i liked you better as a human ii tight beam m tra n xeccentric shoot them later olsv serious callers only i still say it was somehow a test an emissary we were tried and found wanting it encountered the worst of what we can be and took itself off again probably in disappointment possibly in disgust the affront were too disagreeable the elench were too eager we too hesitant our slow gathering of supposedly wise ones about its vicinity might have proved to be a perfectly reasonable course of action and led to who knows what exchanges tradings and dialogues but the entity found itself surrounded by all the trappings of war and may even have understood the manner in which its appearance had been used as part of a plot to entrap the affront so that they could be laid low and have a cultured peace imposed upon them it judged us unworthy of intercourse with those it represented and so abandoned us to our miserable fate those noxious simpletons who made up the conspiracy should be cursed for evermore they may have cost us more than even we can imagine the displays of contrition and programmes of good works that have been undertaken even the suicides cannot begin to make amends for what we have lost how is seddun at this time of year do the islands still float oo tight beam m tra n xlsv serious callers only oeccentric shoot them later my dear friend we do not know what the excession offered or threatened we know it was able to manipulate the energy grid in ways we can only speculate upon but what if that was the only form of defence it was able to offer to something like the sleeper service for all we know it was an invasionary beachhead which left us because it was met with forces which it estimated presaged resistance on a scale which would prove too expensive i admit this is unlikely but i offer it as a balancing possibility in the hope of righting the list of your pessimism at any rate we are arguably better off than before a conspiracy has been uncovered any other zealots thinking of indulging in similar pranks will have been roundly discouraged and even the affront are behaving a little better having realised how close they came to being taught such a severe and salutary lesson the war itself never really got going there was little loss of life and affronter reparations for the mischief they did create will serve as a minor but nagging reminder of the liabilities which follow on such aggression for some considerable time to come the implicit lesson of the sleeper services effectively instantly produced war machine will similarly not have been lost on any other species who might also have been planning affronterlike adventures i suspect as to the chance we may have missed well call me an old bore if you will but who knows what changes might have attended a meaningful dialogue with whatever the excession represented if it represented anything other than itself again we can only speculate in all this the seeming indifference of the elder civilisations still strikes me as one of the most puzzling aspects of the affair were they really just indifferent did the excession have nothing to teach those who have sublimed there is much here still to be answered though i suspect the wait could be long even infinitely so well the debate will doubtless continue for a long time to come i confess i am finding the fame and even adulation that has befallen us somewhat tiring im considering a retreat after ive finished going round apologising to those who were involved without their knowledge in this seddun is beautiful in winter visual file enclosed as you see the islands float on even in the ice genarhofoens uncle tish sends his regards and has forgiven us iii leffid held the lass in his arms and gazed happily out through the yachts wide portscreen at the darkness of space one bright edge of tier was visible rotating in all its silent majesty leffid thought it had never looked so beautiful he gazed down at the sleeping face of his angel her name was xipyeong xipyeong what a beautiful name it was love this time he was sure of it he had found his soulmate they had only met the week before only been together for a couple of nights but he just knew why for one thing he hadnt forgotten her name once she stirred and woke her eyes coming slowly open she frowned briefly then smiled nuzzling him and saying hey geffid iv ulver reined brave in the great animal snorted and came to a halt at the crest of the ridge she loosened the reins to let the animal put its head down and crop the grass by the rocks beyond the curved land dipped and rose the ridge looked down over a forest and a winding river then out over rolling downland dotted with houses and coppices of trees overhead one of phages larger lakes glittered in the sunlight ulver looked back to see the rest following behind otiel peis klatsli and her brother and the others she laughed their mounts were picking their way gingerly through the stonefield brave had taken it at a gallop the black bird gravious settled on a nearby rock ulver grinned at it see she said taking a great deep happy breath and waving one gloved hand out at the view isnt it beautiful here didnt i tell you arent you glad you came its all right i suppose gravious conceded ulver laughed the drone churt lyne also returned to phage rock often wondered if it had made the right decision v they looked around in the midst of an undreamt splendour now this was a view worth risking everything for the grey area sent i think we can all agree with that agreed the peace makes plenty if they could see us now mused the break even vi ren ran down the sands and into the water shrieking and laughing and splashing her long blonde hair turned darker in the water and lay stuck to her skin when she ran back out again she skipped up to where her mother zreyn and amorphia sat on a gaily patterned rug under a lacy parasol the girl threw herself at her aunt zreyn who grinned and caught her then let her wriggle free and dash off along the beach running towards a sea bird which had thought to doze off there it flapped lazily into the air and flew slowly off pursued by the whooping child the girl disappeared round the side of the long singlestorey house which lay in the dunes behind the beach the decorated edges of its veranda awnings flapped and rippled in the warm breeze coming in off the sea on the porch the image of gestra ishmethit sat peering intently at the partially built model of a sailing ship sitting on a table the man himself had his own suite of rooms off one of the sleeper services warshipstacked general bays but he had been persuaded by ren to allow his realtime image to join them most days and had even started to appear personally for important celebrations these consisted mostly of rens birthdays which according to her occurred on a weekly basis zreyn tramow looked over at dajeil have you ever thought she said of asking the ship to recreate the old place where you used to live theres still a version of it in that limited bay isnt there dajeil said looking at amorphia the avatar which sported a simple black pantskirt and skin which looked like it would never tan was holding a long blonde hair up to the sunline and peering at it it realised it was being talked to and looked at dajeil what it said then oh yes the bay where genarhofoen was kept yes the towers still there see dajeil told zreyn she rolled along the rug out of the parasols shade closed her eyes put her hands under her head and lay on her belly to even up her tan i meant the whole thing zreyn said stretching out on the rug the cliffs and everything even the climate if thats possible she said glancing at the avatar which was still studying the sunlight through one of rens blonde hairs perfectly possible it muttered the whole thing dajeil said grimacing but its so much nicer like this she reached out across the sand and pulled a straw sunhat over her head zreyn shrugged id just like to see it do stuff like that i suppose she looked up at the sunline making and moving all that rock creating small oceans you have to remember i dont take all this power for granted the way you do dajeil folded the sun hats brim up and squinted at the other woman who made an awkward gesture sorry is my primitiveness showing zreyn tramows stored mindstate had been woken up to tell her that her name at least had been used in the discovered conspiracy the sleeper service had been uncertain about whether this was really necessary but it was the sort of thing that extreme politeness dictated and in the aftermath of the brief war everybody was being almost exquisitely correct besides it had a hunch that she might find the current civilisational situation interesting enough to be reborn and it rather liked the idea of instigating such a response the sleeper service had been right zreyn tramow had thought the galaxy sounded like a place worth revisiting and had duly been grown a new body but then after the ship had stuck around impatiently while the various postdebacle inquiries and investigations had been carried out shed asked to go with it when it had announced it still intended to go on a rambling retreat gestra ishmethit his mindstate plucked from his dying brain in the evacuated cold of the warship halls in pittance by the guiltstricken attitude adjuster appropriated from that craft just before it destroyed itself by the attacking killing time and subsequently passed on until it came to rest in the restocked memory vaults of the sleeper service had also been woken up and furnished with a new body by that time death had neither improved his social skills nor sated his urge for solitude and he too had asked to remain aboard the giant ship he ren dajeil and zreyn were its only passengers yes youre being a hick stop it at once dajeil told zreyn who shrugged dajeil glanced round at the dunes the golden sand and the bright blue sky anyway its a long journey she said maybe well get bored with all this and want it all changed back to the way it was just let me know amorphia said dajeil took another look round im glad i let you talk me into remaking the old place like this amorphia she said pleased you like it the avatar said nodding have you decided where were going yet zreyn asked the avatar nodded i think leo ii it said not andromeda zreyn said amorphia shook its head i changed my mind damn zreyn said i always wanted to go to andromeda too crowded amorphia said zreyn looked unconvinced we could go there afterwards the avatar suggested will we even live to see leo ii dajeil asked opening her eyes and gazing over at the creature the avatar looked apologetic it will take rather a long time it admitted dajeil closed her eyes again you could always store us she said think you could manage that zreyn laughed lightly oh i could give it a try the avatar said epilogue call me highway call me conduit call me lightning rod scout catalyst observer call me what you will i was there when i was required through me passed the overarch bedeckants in their great sequential migration across the universes of no translation the marriage parties of the universe groupings of no translation and the emissaries of the lone bearing the laws of the new from the pulsing core the absolute centre of our nested home all this the rest and others i received as
