anne perry dark assassin book in the william monk series one waterloo bridge loomed in the distance as william monk settled himself more comfortably in the bow of the police boat there were four men himself as senior officer and three to man the four oars rowing randan it was called monk sat rigid in his uniform coat it was january and bitterly cold as he and his companions patrolled the thames for accidents missing craft and stolen cargo the wind ruffled the water and cut the skin like the edge of a knife but he did not want anyone to see him shivering it was five weeks since he had accepted the position leading this section of the river police it was a debt of honor he already regretted profoundly the more so with every freezing sodden day as turned into and the winter settled ruthlessly over london and its teeming waterway the boat rocked in the wash of a string of barges going upriver on the incoming tide orme at the stern steadied the boat expertly he was a man of average height but deceptive suppleness and strength and a kind of grace exhibited as he managed the oar perhaps he had learned in his years on the water how easy it was to capsize a boat with sudden movement they were pulling closer to the bridge in the gray afternoon before the lamps were lit they could see the traffic crossing dark shadows of hansoms and fourwheelers they were still too far away to hear the clip of horses hooves above the sound of the water a man and woman stood on the footpath close to the railing facing each other as if in conversation monk thought idly that whatever they were saying must matter to them intensely for it to hold their attention in such a bleak exposed place the wind tugged at the womans skirts at that height where there was no shelter she must have been even colder than monk was orme guided the boat a little further out into the stream they were going downriver again back towards the station at wapping where they were headquartered six weeks ago inspector durban had been commander and monk had been a private agent of enquiry monk still could not think of it without a tightening of the throata loneliness and a guilt he could not imagine would ever leave him each time he saw a group of river police and one of them walked slowly with a smooth ambling stride a little rounded at the shoulder he expected him to turn and he would see durban s face then memory came back and he knew it could not be the bridge was only two hundred feet away now the couple were still there against the balustrade the man held her by the shoulders as if he would take her in his arms perhaps they were lovers of course monk could not hear their wordsthe wind tore them from the couples mouthsbut their faces were alive with a passion that was clearer with every moment as the boat drew towards them monk wondered what it was a quarrel a last farewell even both the police oarsmen were having to pull hard against the incoming tide monk looked up again just in time to see the man struggling with the woman holding her fiercely as she clung to him her back was to the railing bending too far instinctively he wanted to call out a few inches more and she would fall orme too was staring up at them now the man grasped at the woman and she pulled away she seemed to lose her balance and he lunged after her clasped together they teetered for a desperate moment on the edge then she pitched backwards he made a wild attempt to catch her she flung out a hand and gripped him but it was too late they both plunged over the side and spun crazily like a huge brokenwinged bird until they hit the racing filthy water and were carried on top of it not even struggling while it soaked into them dragging them down orme shouted and the oarsmen dug their blades in deep they threw their backs against the weight of the river heaving hurtling them forward monk his heart in his mouth strained to keep the bodies in sight they had only a hundred feet to go and yet he knew already that it was too late the impact of hitting the water would stun them and drive the air out of their lungs when at last they did gasp inward it would be the icy water laden with raw sewage choking them drowning them still senselessly he leaned forward over the bow shouting faster faster there no there they drew level turning a little sideways the oarsmen kept the boat steady in the current and the changing balance as orme heaved the body of the young woman over the gunwale awkwardly as gently as he could he laid her inside monk could see the other body but it was too far away to reach and if he stretched he could tip the boat port he instructed although the oarsmen were already moving to do it he reached over carefully to the halfsubmerged body of the young man whose coat was drifting out in the water his boots dragging his legs downwards awkwardly straining his shoulders monk hauled him up over the gunwale and in laying him on the bottom of the boat next to the young woman he had seen many dead people before but the sense of loss never diminished from the victims pale face smeared with dirt from the river water and plastered with hair across the brow he appeared about thirty he had a mustache but was otherwise cleanshaven his clothes were well cut and of excellent quality the hat he had been wearing on the bridge was gone orme was standing balancing easily looking down at monk and the young man nothing we can do for either of em sir he said drown quick going off the bridge like that pity he added softly looks no moren twenty she does nice face monk sat back on the bench anything to indicate who she was he asked orme shook his head if she ad one of em little bags ladies carry its gone but theres a letter in er pocket addressed to miss mary avilland o charles street its postmarked already like its bin sent and received so could be its er monk leaned forward and systematically went through the pockets of the dead man keeping his balance with less ease than orme as the boat began the journey downstream back towards wapping there was no point in putting a man ashore to look for witnesses to the quarrel if that was what it had been they could not identify the traffic that had been on the bridge and on the water they themselves had seen as much as anyone two people quarrellingor kissing and partingwho lost their balance and fell there was nothing anyone could add actually as far as monk could remember there had been no one passing at exactly that moment it was the hour when the dusk is not drawn in sufficiently for the lamps to be lit but the light wanes and the grayness of the air seems to delude the eye things are half seen the imagination fills in the rest sometimes inaccurately monk turned to the mans pockets and found a leather wallet with a little money and a case carrying cards he was apparently toby argyll of walnut tree walk lambeth that was also south of the river not far from the girls address on charles street off the westminster bridge road monk read the information aloud for orme the boat was moving slowly as only two men were rowing orme squatted on the boards near argylls body on the shore the lamps were beginning to come on yellow moons in the deepening haze the wind had the breath of ice in it it was time to trim their own riding lights or they would be struck by bargesor the ferries going crosscurrent carrying passengers from one bank to the other monk lit the lantern and carefully moved back to where orme had laid the woman she lay on her back orme had folded her hands and smoothed the hair off her face her eyes were closed her skin already graywhite as if she had been dead longer than just the few minutes since they had seen her on the bridge she had a wide mouth and high cheekbones under delicately arched brows it was a very feminine face both strong and vulnerable as if she had been filled with high passions in life poor creature orme said softly spose well never know wot made er do it mebbe e were breakin orff an engagement or somethin the expression on his face was all but masked by the deepening shadows but monk could hear the intense pity in his voice monk suddenly realized he was wet up to the armpits from having lifted the body out of the water he was shuddering with cold and it was hard to speak without his teeth chattering he would have given all the money in his pocket for a hot mug of tea with a lacing of rum in it he could not remember ever being this perishingly cold on shore suicide was a crime not only against the state but in the eyes of the church as well if that was the coroners verdict she would be buried in unhallowed ground and there was the question of the young mans death as well perhaps there was no point in arguing it but monk did so instinctively was he trying to stop her the boat was moving slowly against the tide the water was choppy slapping at the wooden sides and making it difficult for two oarsmen to keep her steady orme hesitated for several moments before answering i dunno mr monk an thats the truth couldve bin couldve bin an accident both ways his voice dropped lower or couldve bin e pushed er it appened quick do you have an opinion monk could hardly get the words out clearly he was shaking so much youd be best on an oar sir orme said gravely get the blood movin as it were monk accepted the suggestion senior officers might not be supposed to row like ordinary constables but they were not much use frozen stiff or with pneumonia either he moved to the center of the boat and took up one of the oars beside orme after several strokes he got into the rhythm and the boat sped forward cutting the water more cleanly they rowed a long way without speaking again they passed under blackfriars bridge towards the southwark bridge which was visible in the distance only by its lights the wind was like a knife edge slicing the breath almost before it reached the lungs monk had accepted his current position in the river police partly as a debt of honor eight years ago he had woken up in hospital with no memory at all fact by fact he had assembled an identity discovering things about himself not all of which pleased him at that time he was a policeman heartily disliked by his immediate superior superintendent runcorn their relationship had deteriorated until it became a debatable question whether monk had resigned before or after runcorn had dismissed him since the detection and solving of crime was the only profession he knew and he was obliged to earn his living he had taken up the same work privately but circumstances had altered in the late autumn of last year the need for money had compelled him to accept employment with shipping magnate clement louvain his first experience on the river subsequently he had met inspector durban and had become involved with the maude idris and its terrible cargo now durban was dead but before his death he had recommended monk to succeed him in his place at the wapping station durban could have had no idea how monk had previously failed in commanding men the former policeman was brilliant but he had never worked easily with others either in giving or taking orders runcorn would have told durban that would have told him thatclever or not brave or notmonk was not worth the trouble he would cost monk had been mellowed by time and circumstance and above all perhaps by marriage to hester latterly who had nursed in the crimea with florence nightingale and was a good deal more forthright than most young women she loved him with a fierce loyalty and a startling passion but she also very candidly expressed her own opinions even so runcorn would have advised superintendent farnham to find someone else to take the place of a man like durban who had been wise experienced and profoundly admired but durban had wanted monk and monk needed the work during his independent years hesters friend lady callandra daviot had had the money and the interest to involve herself in his cases and support them in the leaner months now callandra had gone to live in vienna and the grim choice was either for monk to obtain regular and reliable employment or for hester to return to private nursing which would mean most often living in the houses of such patients as she could acquire one could not nurse except by being there all the time for monk to see her as little as that was a choice of final desperation so here he was sitting in the thwart of a boat throwing his weight against the oar as they passed under london bridge heading south towards the tower and wapping stairs he was still boneachingly cold and wet to the shoulders and two dead bodies lay at his feet finally they reached the steps up to the police station carefully a little stiffly he shipped his oar stood up and helped carry the limp watersoaked bodies up the stairs across the quay and into the shelter of the station house there at least it was warm the black iron stove was burning giving the whole room a pleasant smoky smell and there was hot tea stewed almost black waiting for them none of the men really knew monk yet and they were still grieving for durban they treated monk with civility if he wanted anything more he would have to earn it the river was a dangerous place with its shifting tides and currents occasional sunken obstacles fastmoving traffic and sudden changes of weather it demanded courage skill and even more loyalty between men than did the same profession on land however human decency dictated they offer monk tea laced with rum as they would to any man probably even to a stray dog at this time of the year indeed humphrey the station cat a large white animal with a ginger tail was provided with a basket by the stove and as much milk as he could drink mice were his own affair to catch for himself which he did whenever he could be bothered or nobody had fed him with other titbits thank you monk drank the tea and felt some resemblance of life return to his body warmth working slowly from the inside outwards accident sergeant palmer asked looking at the bodies now lying on the floor faces decently covered with spare coats dont know yet monk replied came off waterloo bridge right in front of us but we cant be sure how it happened palmer frowned puzzled he had his doubts about monks competence anyway and this indecision went towards confirming them orme finished his tea went off together he said looking at palmer expressionlessly ard to tell if e were trying to save er or couldve pushed er know what killed em all right poor souls it the water ard like they always do but i daresay as well never know for certain why palmer waited for monk to say something the room was suddenly silent the other two men from the boat jones and butterworth stood watching turning from one to the other to see what monk would do it was a test again would he match up to durban get the surgeon to look at them just in case theres something else monk answered probably isnt but we dont want to risk looking stupid drownded palmer said sourly turning away come orff one o the bridges yer always are anybody knows that water shocks yer an so yer breathes it in kills yer quicks almost the only good thing to it and how stupid will we look if we say shes a suicide and it turns out she was knifed or strangled but we didnt notice it monk asked quietly i just want to make sure or with child and we didnt see that either look at the quality of her clothes shes not a street woman she has a decent address and she may have family we owe them the truth palmer colored unhappily it wont make them feel no better if shes with child he observed without looking back at monk we dont look for the answers that make people feel better monk told him we have to deal with the ones we find closest to the truth we know who they are and where they lived orme and i are going to tell their families you get the police surgeon to look at them yes sir palmer said stiffly youll be goin ome to put dry clothes on no doubt he raised his eyebrows monk had already learned that lesson ive got a dry shirt and coat in the cupboard theyll do fine orme turned away but not before monk had seen his smile monk and orme took a hansom from wapping westward along high street the lights intermittently flickered from the river and the hard wind whipped the smell of salt and weed up the alleys between the waterfront houses they went around the looming mass of the tower of london then back down to the water again along lower thames street they finally crossed the river at the southwark bridge and passed through the more elegant residential areas until they came to the sixway crossing at st george s circus from there it was not far to the westminster bridge road and walnut tree walk informing the families of the dead was the part of any investigation that every policeman hated and it was the duty of the senior man it would be both cowardly and the worst discourtesy to the bereaved to delegate it monk paid the driver and let him go he had no idea how long it would take them to break the news or what they might find the house where toby argyll had lived was gracious but obviously was let in a series of rooms as suited single men rather than families a landlady in a dark dress and wearing an apron opened the door immediately nervous on seeing two men unknown to her standing on the step orme was of average height with pleasant ordinary features but he wore a river policemans uniform monk was taller and had the grace of a man conscious of his own magnetism there was power in his face leanboned with a highbridged broad nose and unflinching eyes it was a face of intelligence even sensitivity but few people found it comfortable good evening maam he said gently his voice was excellent his diction beautiful he had worked hard to lose the northumbrian accent that marked his origins he had wanted passionately to be a gentleman that desire was long past but the music in his voice remained evenin sir she replied warily my name is monk and this is sergeant orme of the thames river police is this the home of mr toby argyll she swallowed yes sir never say theres bin an accident in one o them tunnels her hand flew to her mouth as if to stifle a cry i cant elp yer sir mr argylls not at ome no maam there hasnt been so far as i know monk replied but im afraid there has been a tragedy im extremely sorry does mr argyll live alone here she stared at him her round face paler now as she began to understand that they had come with the worst possible news would you like to go in and sit down monk asked she nodded and backed away from him allowing them to follow her along the passage to the kitchen it was full of the aroma of dinner cooking and he realized absently how long it was since he had eaten she sank down on one of the hardbacked wooden chairs putting her elbows on the table and her hands up to her face there were pans steaming on the top of the huge black range and the savory aroma of meat pie came from the oven beneath it copper warming pans glimmered on the wall in the gaslight and strings of onions hung from the ceiling there was no point in delaying what she must already know was coming im sorry to tell you that mr argyll fell off the waterloo bridge monk told her mrs she looked at him face blanched eyes wide porter she supplied i looked after mr argyll since e first come ere ow could e ave fallen orff the bridge it dont make no sense theres railings yer dont fall orff are yer sayin e was the worse for wear an went climbin or summink daft she was shivering now angry i dont believe yer e werent like that very sober ardworkin young gentleman e were yer int got the right person yer made a mistake thats wot yer done she lifted her chin and stared at him yer oughter be more careful scarin folks all wrong theres no reason to suppose he was drunk mrs porter monk did not prevaricate the young man we found had cards saying he was toby argyll of this address he was about my height or perhaps a little less fairhaired cleanshaven except for a mustache he stopped he could see by her wide fixed eyes and the pinched look of her mouth that he had described argyll im sorry he said again her lips trembled wot appened if e werent drunk owd e come ter fall in the river yer aint makin no sense it was still a challenge she was clinging to the last shred of hope as if disbelieving could keep it from being true he was with a young lady he told her they seemed to be having a rather heated discussion they grasped hold of each other and swayed a little then she fell back against the rail they struggled a little more wot dyer mean she demanded yer sayin as they was fightin or summink this was worse than he had expected what had they been doing what had he seen exactly he tried to clear his mind of all the ideas since then the attempts to understand and interpret and recall exactly what had happened the two figures had been on the bridge the woman closer to the railing or had she yes she had the wind had been behind them and monk had seen the billowing skirts poking between the uprights of the balustrade the woman had waved her arms and then put her hands on the mans shoulders a caress or pushing him away he had moved his arm back and up pulling away from her or making a motion to strike her he had grasped hold of her to save her or to push her mrs porter was waiting hugging herself still shivering in the warm kitchen with its dinnertime smells i dont know he said slowly they were above us outlined against the light and almost two hundred feet away she turned to orme was you there too sir yes maam orme replied standing upright in the middle of the scrubbed floor an mr monks right the more i think on it the less certain i am as to what i saw exact it was in that sort of darkening time just before the lamps are lit you think you can see but you make mistakes oo were she she asked the woman wot went over with im was there someone you might expect it to be monk parried if they were quarrelling she was clearly unhappy well i dont like ter say her voice trailed off we know who it was mrs porter monk told her we need to know what happened so we dont allow anyone to be blamed for something they didnt do yer cant urt em now she responded the tears trickling unheeded down her cheeks theyre dead poor souls but theyll have family who care he pointed out and burial in hallowed ground or not she gasped and gave a convulsive shudder mrs porter were it miss avilland she asked hoarsely what can you tell me about her it were er course it would be e dint never look at no one else not ever since e met er he was in love with her of course that could mean many things from the true giving of the heart unselfishly through generosity need all the way to domination and obsession and rejection could mean anything from resignation through misery to anger or rage and the need for revenge perhaps even destruction she hesitated mrs porter yes she said quickly they was betrothed at least e seemed to take it they was then she broke it orff not that it were formal like there werent no announcement do you know why she was surprised me course i dont was there another person not for im an i dont think for er neither least thats wot i eard im say she gave a long sniff and gulped this is terrible i never eard o such a thing not wi quality folk wot would they want ter go jumpin orff bridges for mr argyllll be broke ter pieces when e ears poor man mr argyll his father monk asked no is brother quite a bit older e is least i should say so she sniffed again and fished in her apron pocket for a handkerchief i only seen im five or six times when e came ere fer mr toby like very wealthy gentleman e is owns them big machines an things wots diggin the new sewers mr bazalgette drew ter clean up london so we dont get no more typhoid an cholera an the like took poor prince albert ter die of it an the poor queens eart broke before they do it wicked i say monk could remember the great stink of very clearly when the overflow of effluent had been so serious the entire city of london became like a vast open sewer the thames had smelled so vile it choked the throat and caused nausea simply to come within a mile of it the new sewer system was to be the most advanced in europe it would cost a fortune and provide work and wealth for thousands tens of thousands if one considered all the navvies brick makers and railwaymen involved the builders carpenters and suppliers of one sort or another most of the sewers were to be built by the open cutandcover method but a few were deep enough to require tunneling so mr argyll was a wealthy young man oh yes she straightened up a little this is a very nice class o place mr monk dont live ere cheap yer know and miss havilland he asked oh she were quality too poor creature she responded immediately a real lady she were even with er opinions i never disagreed wi airin opinions meself fer all as some might say it werent proper for a young lady having married a woman with passionate opinions about a number of things monk could not argue in fact he suddenly saw not mary havilland as she was now whitefaced in death but instead the slender fierce and vulnerable figure of hester with her shoulders a little too thin her slight angularity brown hair and eyes of such passionate intelligence that he had never been able to forget them since the day they had met and quarrelled he found his voice husky when he spoke again do you know why she broke off the relationship mrs porter or was it perhaps a generous fiction mr argyll allowed and it was actually he who ended it no it were er she said without hesitation e were upset an e tried to change er mind she sniffed again i never thought as itd come to this we dont know what happened yet he said but thank you for your assistance can you give us mr argylls brothers address we need to inform him of what has happened i dont suppose you know who miss havilland s nearest relative would be her parents i expect i wouldnt know that sir but i can give you mr argylls address all right no bother poor mans goin to be beside isself very close they was alan argyll lived a short distance away on westminster bridge road and it took monk and orme only ten minutes or so to walk to the handsome house at the address mrs porter had given them the curtains were drawn against the early winter night but the gas lamps in the street showed the elegant line of the windows and the stone steps up to a wide carved doorway where the faint gleam of brass indicated the lionheaded knocker orme looked at monk but said nothing breaking such news to family was immeasurably worse than to a landlady however sympathetic monk nodded very slightly but there was nothing to say orme worked on the river he was used to death the door was answered by a short portly butler his white hair thinning across the top of his head from his steady unsurprised gaze he clearly took them to be business acquaintances of his master mr argyll is at dinner sir he said to monk if you care to wait in the morning room i am sure he will see you in due course we are from the thames river police monk told him having given only his name at first i am afraid we have bad news that cannot wait it might be advisable to have a glass of brandy ready in case it is needed im sorry the butler hesitated indeed sir may i ask what has happened is it one of the tunnels sir its very sad but such things seem to be unavoidable monk was aware that such mighty excavations as were at present in progress brought the occasional landslip or even cavein of the sides burying machines and sometimes injuring men there had been a spectacular disaster over the fleet only days ago quite so he agreed but this happened on the river and i am afraid it is bad personal news for mr argyll he needs to be informed as soon as possible oh dear the butler said quietly how very terrible yes sir he took a deep breath and let it out silently if you will come to the morning room i shall bring mr argyll to you the morning room was very somber in shades of browns and golds the fire had been allowed to go out but it was now well into the evening and presumably the room would not normally be used at this hour monk and orme stood in the center of the aubusson carpet waiting neither of them spoke monk noted the picture of highland scenery over the mantelshelf and the small stuffed rodent in a glass case on the table by the wall they were selfconscious suggestions that argylls wealth was old money which brought to his mind that therefore it was probably not the door swung open and alan argyll stood in the entrance palefaced his eyes dark in the lamplight he was of more than average height and lean with a suggestion of physical as well as mental power his features were wellproportioned but there was a coldness in them as if he did not laugh easily monk took a step forward my name is william monk of the thames river police sir this is sergeant orme i am deeply sorry to tell you that your brother mr toby argyll fell off the westminster bridge earlier this evening and although we reached him within a few minutes he was already dead argyll stared at him swaying a little as if he had been struck you were there why in gods name didnt you he gasped finding it difficult to catch his breath he looked as if he was on the edge of collapse we were in a boat on patrol on the river monk answered im sorry sir there was nothing anyone could have done in such circumstances a man drowns very quickly i think he probably felt nothing at all i know that is little comfort but it may help in time he was twentynine argyll shouted at him he came further into the room and the light shone on his face monk could not help seeing the resemblance to his brother the line of his mouth the color of his wellshaped eyes the way his hair grew how do you fall off a bridge he demanded was there a crime and youre not telling me was he attacked rage flared in his voice and his fists clenched he wasnt alone monk said quickly before argyll should lose control grief he was used to even anger but there was a thread of violence just under the surface in this man that was fast unraveling a young woman named mary havilland was with him argylls eyes flew wide open mary where is she is she all right what happened what are you not telling me man dont just stand there like an idiot this is my family youre talking about again the fists were tight skin on his knuckles stretched pale across the bone im sorry miss havilland went over with him monk said grimly they went over holding on to each other what are you saying argyll demanded that they both went over sir monk repeated they were standing together by the railing having what appeared to be a heated discussion we were too far away to hear the next time we looked they were at the railing and the moment after they overbalanced and fell you saw a man and woman struggling and you looked away argyll said incredulously his voice highpitched what at for gods sake what else could possibly be we were on patrol monk cut across him we watch the whole river we wouldnt even have seen that much had they not been so close to the rail it appeared an ordinary conversation perhaps a lovers quarrel then made up again if wed have continued watching it could have been intrusive argyll stood motionless blinking yes he said at last yes of course im sorry toby toby was my only relative at least he ran his hand over his face almost as if to steady himself somehow clear his vision my wife you say mary havilland is dead also yes im sorry i believe she was close to your brother close argylls voice rose again dangerously a note of hysteria in it she was my sisterinlaw toby was betrothed to her at least they were going to be she she called it off she was very disturbed monk was confused she would have been your sisterinlaw no she was mary was my wifes sister argyll said with a small indrawn breath my wife will be devastated we were hoping he stopped again monk needed to prompt him painful as it must be for him to answer further questions this was an unguarded moment when he might reveal a truth that later he would for decency or compassions sake have covered based on the landladys words mary was a woman of spirit who had passionate opinions yes sir you were hoping he prompted oh argyll sighed and looked away he fumbled towards a chair and sat down heavily he appeared to be in his midforties considerably older than his brother but that bore out what mrs porter had said monk sat as well to put himself on a level with argyll orme remained standing discreetly a couple of yards away argyll looked at monk marys father took his own life almost two months ago he said quietly it was very distressing actually both mary and jenny my wife were bitterly grieved their mother had died many years before and this was a terrible blow my wife bore it with great fortitude but mary seemed to lose her her mental balance she refused to accept that it was indeed suicide even thought the police investigated it naturally and that was their finding we we were hoping she was im sorry monk found he meant it with savage honesty he imagined mary as she must have been when she was alive the pale riverwet face animated with emotion anger amazement grief thats a very hard thing for anyone to bear like a physical blow he remembered that hesters father had also taken his own life and the pain of it was close and real in a way that no power of words alone could have given argyll looked at him with surprise as if he had heard the emotion through the polite phrases yes yes it is it was clear he had not expected monk to allow his feelings to show i i dont know how poor jenny will deal with this its he failed to find the words for what he was struggling to say perhaps even to himself would it be easier for mrs argyll if we were here so that she could ask us any questions she wishes to monk asked or would you prefer to tell her privately argyll hesitated he seemed torn by a genuine indecision monk waited the clock on the mantel struck the quarter hour otherwise there was silence perhaps i should not deny her the chance to speak with you argyll said at last if you will excuse me i shall inform her alone and then see what she wishes he took monks acquiescence for granted and rose to his feet he walked out of the room a little unsteadily only saving himself from bumping into the doorjamb at the last moment and leaving the door itself gaping open poor man orme said softly wish we could tell im it were an accident he looked at monk with a question in his eyes so do i monk agreed it began to look as if mary havilland had at least temporarily lost her mental balance but he did not want to say so even to orme the butler came in and stood like a black shadow just inside the door mrs argyll asked me to see if there is anything i could bring for you gentlemen perhaps a glass ofhe consideredale he was not going to offer them a glass of good sherry they would not appreciate and certainly not the best brandy monk realized how achingly hungry he was orme must be also perhaps that was at least in part why he was still cold thank you he accepted weve come straight from the river a sandwich and a glass of ale would be very gracious of you the butler looked faintly uncomfortable as if realizing he should have thought of it himself immediately sir he acknowledged would cold roast beef and a spot of mustard be right it would be perfect monk answered orme thanked him warmly as soon as the door was closed ope it comes afore mr argyll gets back he added wouldnt be decent to eat it in front of im specially if mrs argyll comes too dont reckon as she will though most ladies take bad news ard the sandwiches arrived and were consumed ravenously just before argyll returned but orme was mistaken in his second guess jenny argyll chose to see them she came in ahead of her husband a handsome woman with eyes and mouth startlingly like those of her dead sister but darker hair and not the same high cheekbones now she too was bleached of color and her eyelids were puffy from weeping but she was remarkably well composed given the circumstances she was wearing a dark red woollen dress with a wide skirt and her hair was elaborately coiffed in a style that must have taken her ladys maid at least half an hour to accomplish she regarded monk with civility but no interest at all argyll closed the door behind them and waited until his wife was seated monk expressed his condolences again thank you mrs argyll said briefly my husband says that mary fell off westminster bridge toby was with her perhaps he tried to stop her and failed poor toby i think he still loved her in spite of everything the tears filled her eyes again but she ignored them and her face remained under control it was impossible to tell what the effort cost her she did not look at her husband nor did she reach to touch him monk should have accepted the answer implicit in her words and yet in spite of all sense he refused to when hesters father had shot himself because of the unanswerable debt he had been cheated into she had returned from the crimea where she had been serving as a military nurse and redoubled her efforts to strengthen her family and to fight all the wrongs she encountered it had been her resolve that had strengthened monk to struggle against the burden that had seemed impossible to him she was acidtonguedat least he had thought soopinionated and unwise in her expression of it hasty to judge and quicktempered but even he who had found her so irritating had never doubted her courage or her iron will of course he had seen the passion the laughter and the vulnerability in her since then was he imagining in mary havilland something she had never possessed whatever the cost to mrs argyll he wanted to know i understand that your father met his death recently he said gravely and that miss havilland found it very difficult to come to terms with she looked at him wearily she never did she answered she couldnt accept that he took his own life she wouldnt accept it in spite of all the evidence im afraid she became obsessed she blinked mary was very strongwilled to put it at its kindest she was close to papa and she couldnt believe that something could be so wrong and he would not confide in her im afraid perhaps they were not as as close as she imagined could she have been distressed over the breaking of her betrothal to mr argyll monk asked trying to grasp on to some reason why a healthy young woman should do something so desperate as plunge over the bridge and had she meant to take argyll with her or was he trying even at the risk of his own life to save her did he still love her so much or was it out of guilt because he had abandoned her possibly for someone else they really did need the surgeon to ascertain if she had been with child that might explain a great deal it was a hideous thought but if he would not marry her perhaps she had felt suicide the only answer and had determined to take him with her he was in a sense the cause of her sin but that would be true only if she were with child and certain of it no mrs argyll said flatly she was the one who broke it if anything it was toby who was distressed she she became very strange mr monk she seemed to take against us all she became fixed upon the idea of a dreadful disaster that was going to happen in the new sewer tunnels that my husbands company is constructing she looked very tired as if revisiting an old and muchbattled pain my father had a morbid fear of enclosed spaces and he was rather reactionary he was afraid of the new machines that made the work far faster i imagine you are aware of the urgency of building a new system for the city yes mrs argyll i think we all are he answered he did not like the picture that was emerging and yet he could not deny it it was only his own emotion that drove him to fight it a completely irrational link in his mind between mary havilland and hester it was not even anything so definite as a thought just words used to describe her by a landlady who barely knew her and the protective grief over the suicide of a father my father allowed it to become an obsession with him she went on he spent his time gathering information campaigning to have the company alter its methods my husband did everything to help him see reason and appreciate that deaths in construction are unavoidable from time to time men can be careless landslips happen the london clay is dangerous by its nature the argyll company has fewer incidents than most others that is a fact he could have checked with ease and he did he could point to no mishaps at all on this job in fact but it did not calm his fears reason does not calm irrational fears argyll said quietly his voice hoarse with his own emotion unable to reach towards hers perhaps he feared that if he did they might both lose what control they had dont harrow yourself up anymore he went on there was nothing you could have done then or now his terrors finally overtook him who knows what another man sees in the dark hours of the night he took his life at night monk asked it was argyll who answered his voice cold yes but i would be obliged if you did not press the matter further it was thoroughly investigated at the time no one else was in the least at fault how could anyone have realized that his madness had progressed so far now it appears that poor mary was also far more unstable than we knew and it had preyed upon her to the point where she herself could not exercise her human or christian judgment anymore jenny turned to look at him frowning christian she challenged him if anyone is so sunk in despair that they feel death is the only answer for them cant we have a little pity there was anger in her eyes im sorry argyll said quickly but without looking at her i did not mean to imply blasphemy against your father we shall never know what demons drove him to such a resort even mary i could forgive if she had not taken toby with her that that is he was unable to continue the tears spilled over his cheeks and he turned away shadowing his face jenny stood up stiff and unsteady thank you for coming mr monk i think there is little of any use that we can tell you perhaps you would excuse us pendle will see you to the door she went to the bell rope and pulled it the butler appeared almost immediately and monk and orme took their leave after having given mr argyll a card and requested that he formally identify the bodies the following day when he was a little more recovered poor devil orme said with feeling when they were outside on the icy footpath again mist was veiling the streetlamps as if in gauze a frail sickleshaped moon sailed between the stars high above the rooftops both of em lost family in the one night funny ow an instant can change everything dyou think she meant to go over herself or take him monk asked beginning to walk down towards the westminster bridge where they would be more likely to find a hansom he was still hoping it had been an accident not sure as i know orme replied keeping step with him dint look to me as if she were trying to jump facing the wrong way for a start jumpers usually face the water monk felt a rush of warmth even though the slick of moisture on the footpath was turning to ice under his feet he was not going to let go of hope not yet monk reached home before nine oclock his return was far later than it would have been on a more usual day but there was little that was routine in his new job even his best effort might not be enough second best certainly would not every day he learned more of the skills the knowledge and the respect that durban had had he admired the qualities that had earned that respect and they awed him he felt continually a step behind durban no that was absurd he was yards behind him he knew people and crime he knew how to smell fear how to probe lies when to be confronting and when to be oblique however he had never known how to inspire the love and loyalty of men under his command theyd admired his intelligence his knowledge and his strength and theyd been frightened of his tongue but they did not like him thered been none of the fierce honor and friendship he had sensed from the beginning between durban and his men he had crossed the river by ferrythere were no bridges this far downand he was on the south bank now where he and hester had moved after accepting the new job they could hardly live in grafton street anymore it was miles from police headquarters in wapping he walked up paradise street the lamps misted and he could smell the river and hear the occasional foghorn as the mist drifted across the water there was ice on the thin puddles in the street it was still strange to him nothing familiar he put his key into the lock in the door and pushed it open hester she appeared immediately apron tied around her waist her hair pinned hastily and crookedly she was carrying a broom in her hand but she dropped it as soon as she saw him and rushed forward she drew in breath perhaps to say that he was late then changed her mind she studied his face and read the emotion in it what happened she asked he knew what she was afraid of she had understood why he had to accept the job in durban s place both morally and financially with callandra gone to vienna they could not afford the freedom or the uncertainty of taking on only private cases sometimes the rewards were excellent but too often they were meager some cases could not be solved or if they were then the clients had the means to reward him only modestly they could never plan ahead and there was no one to whom they could turn to in a bad month as they had before nor it must be said honestly at their ages should they need to it was time to provide not be provided for what is it whats wrong she asked when he did not answer a suicide off waterloo bridge he replied in fact two in a way a young man and woman went off together but we dont know if it was partly accidental or not relief flashed across her face then instantly pity im sorry were you called to it no we were actually there saw it happen she smiled gently and touched his face with the back of her fingers perhaps aware her hands were dusty had she been still occupied with housework this late in the evening to keep her mind from worrying about him thats horrible she said bleakly they must have been very desperate to jump into the river at this time of the year theyd die whatever time it was he replied the tide is very strong and the rivers filthy to another woman he would have moderated his answer avoided the facts of death but she had seen more people dying and dead than he had police work no matter how grim at times hardly compared with the battlefield or the losses afterwards to gangrene and fever yes i know that she answered him but do you suppose they knew before they jumped suddenly it was immediate and painfully agonizingly real mary havilland had been a woman like hester warm and full of emotions capable of laughter and pain now she was just an empty shell with the soul fled nobody anymore he put his hands on hesters shoulders and pulled her towards him holding her tightly feeling her slender body yield almost as if she could soften the awkward bones and shape herself to him i dont know if she meant to jump and he tried to stop her he whispered into her hair or if he pushed her over and she clung on to him and took him with her or even if she meant to i dont know how im going to find out but i will she held on to him for a few minutes longer silently then she pulled back and looked at him youre frozen she said suddenly practical and i dont suppose youve eaten the kitchen is still not really finished but i have hot soup and fresh bread and apple pie if youd like it she was right he was still cold from the long ride and the even colder river crossing afterwards the butlers sandwich seemed a long time ago he accepted between mouthfuls he asked her about her day and her progress in redecorating the house then he sat back realizing how warm he was in all the ways that mattered who was she hester asked mary havilland he replied her father took his own life a couple of months ago he saw the shadow of grief in hesters eyes and the tightening of her mouth her sister believes that she did not recover from it he added im sorry she looked away its over she said quietly she was referring to her own father not havillands why did he do it she asked was it debt too apparently not he replied he believed there was some danger of an accident in the tunnels theyre building some of the new sewers and not before time she said fervently what sort of an accident i dont know he explained the family relationships briefly argyll says his fatherinlaw had a terror of landslips caveins and so on he became obsessed lost his senses a bit and is that true she pressed clearly still forcing herself to think only of the present case i dont know he went on to tell her about marys proposed engagement to toby argyll and that she had broken it off but no reason had been given except her distress over her fathers death and that she refused to believe that he had caused it himself she could not let the matter go what was it then hester asked accident or murder she was being severely practical but he saw the stiffness in her the deliberate control and the effort i dont know but the police investigated it it was runcorns patch he looked at her steadily with a bleak smile she understood why that added irony and pain to the case more than he wished she had seen his ambition for authority the way he had fought with crushed and infuriated runcorn in the past she did not know the flashes of memory and shame that monk had had since then the realization of how he had used runcorn in his own climb to success before the accident that had taken his memory there were things that it was kind for forgetfulness to cleanse from the mind but youre going to find out she said watching him yes i have to shell be buried in unhallowed ground if she meant to do it i know tears filled hesters eyes instantly he wished he had not uttered this bit of truth he should have lied if necessary hester saw that too theres no such thing as unhallowed ground really she swallowed all the earth is hallowed isnt it its just what people think but some people care very much about being buried with their own belonging even in death see what you can find her sister may need to know the truth poor woman two the tide was high the next morning and the river with its smells of mud and salt dead fish and rotting wood seemed to be lapping right at the door as monk walked across the dockside the wind had fallen and it was calm the surface of the water barely rippled as it seeped higher around the pier stakes and up the stone steps that led to the quaysides and embankments the rime of ice overnight had melted in places but there were still patches as slippery as oiled glass morning sir orme said briskly as monk came into the station the stove had been burning all night and the room was warm good morning orme monk replied closing the door behind him there were three other men there jones and kelly busily sorting through papers of one kind or another and clacton standing by the stove his clothes steaming gently monk greeted them and received dutiful acknowledgment but no more he was still a stranger a usurper of durban s place they all knew that it was in helping monk that durban had contracted the terrible disease that had brought about his death and they blamed monk for it that durban had gone on the mission both because he wished to understanding the enormity of the danger and because he considered it his duty was irrelevant to their anger and the sense of unfairness that lay behind it monk had gone on the same mission and he was alive they could not excuse that they would have chosen monk to die every man of them kelly a softspoken irishman smallboned and neat handed him the reports of crime overnight nothin out o the usual sorr he said meeting monks eyes then looking away barge ran aground at low tide but they got it off run aground intentionally monk asked yes sorr id say so no doubt the ownersll be reportin some o their cargo missin kelly gave a bleak smile dragging it up through the mud at low tide monk questioned if they worked as hard at something honest theyd probably make more clever an wise was never the same thing sorr kelly said dryly turning back to his work monk took reports from jones and clacton as well and spoke briefly to butterworth as he came in kelly made tea hot and as dark as mahogany it would take monk a long time to drink it with pleasure but it would set him apart to refuse additionally tea had the virtue of warming the inside and lifting the spirits even when it was not laced with the frequently added rum when the last patrols had landed and reported and the next were gone out monk told them of his decision the two people off waterloo bridge yesterday he began suicides clacton said with a pinched expression lovers quarrel i expect seems stupid for both of em to jump he was a slender strong young man of more than average height who took himself very seriously and was prone to take offense where it was not intended he could be helpful or obstructive depending upon his opinion which he rarely changed whatever the circumstances monk found him irritating and was aware of his own temper rising he had caught the other men watching him to see how he would handle clacton it was another test yes it does he agreed aloud which makes me wonder if that was what happened thought you saw it clacton challenged moving his weight a little to stand more aggressively sir he added as an afterthought from the river monk replied it could have been accidental during a quarrel or she jumped and he tried to stop her or even that he pushed her clacton stared at him why would e do that no one else said so i thought it could be orme contradicted him he was visibly irritated by clactons attitude as well his blunt weathered face showed a quiet anger if e was goin to push er in why wouldnt e wait alf an our until dark clacton demanded his expression tightening he moved a little closer to the stove blocking it from orme don make sense an with a police boat right in front of im no she jumped and e tried to stop er and lost is own balance clear as day don suppose e saw us jones answered him ed a bin lookin at er not at us was on the water below still make more sense ter wait until dark clacton retorted wot if she werent goin ter stand there on the bridge waitin until it were dark jones countered mebbe she werent that obligin he helped himself to more tea deliberately taking the last of it if e planned to push er over ed ave planned to get there at the right time clacton said angrily looking at the teapot then moving to block the fire from jones rather than from orme and o course plans always go exactly right jones added sarcastically i seen at there was a guffaw of laughter probably occasioned by some failure of clactons in the past monk was still trying to learn not only the job itself but at times even more important the relationships between the men their strengths and their weaknesses lives could depend on it the river was a more dangerous place than the city even the worst slumswith their creaking dripping tenement houses blind alleys and occasional trapdoorsgave you ground to stand on and air to breathe it had no tides to rise to slime the steps to carry things up or downstream it was not full of currents to pull you under and drifting wreckage just beneath the surface to catch you we dont know monk said to all of them mary havillands father died recently and according to her sister mary was convinced that he was murdered i have to investigate that possibility if he was then perhaps she was murdered also or her death and toby argylls may have been a quarrel that ended in a tragic accident not suicide by either one of them kelly put down the final pieces of paper and then we could have them buried properly their familiesd want that very much monk agreed but if she wasnt murdered its not our job clacton looked at kelly then at monk monk felt his temper rising one day he was going to have to deal with clacton its my job now he replied an edge to his voice that should have been a warning to clacton and anyone else listening when ive done it ill give the results to whomever needs themfamily church or magistrate in the meantime attend to the theft on horseferry stairs and then see if you can trace the lost barge from watson and sons yes sir clacton said unhesitatingly with that monk departed on the long cab journey from wapping to mary havillands address in charles street just off lambeth walk the house was not ostentatious but it was handsome enough and had an appearance of considerable comfort there was a mews behind for the keeping of carriages and horses so presumably the residents were accustomed to such luxuries as he expected the curtains were drawn and there was a wreath on the door someone had even laid sawdust in the street to muffle the sound of horses hooves the door was opened by a footman of probably no more than eighteen years his face was so white his freckles stood out and his eyes were pinkrimmed it took him a moment or two to collect his wits when he saw a stranger on the step yes sir monk introduced himself and asked if he might speak to the butler he already knew there was no other family resident jenny argyll had said that mary had been her only relative inside the house was in traditional mourning the mirrors were covered the clocks stopped lilies in vases giving off a faint hothouse perfume their very unnaturalness in january was a reminder that familiar life had ended the butler came to monk in the formal morning room it was bitterly cold no fire having been lit and the glass fronts of the bookcases reflected the cold daylight that came under the halfdrawn curtains like ice on a deep pond the butler cardman was a tall spare man with thick irongray hair and a bony face that might have been handsome in his youth but was now too strong in the planes of his cheek and nose his light blue eyes were intelligent andunlike the footmanhe had mastered his emotions so they barely showed yes sir he said closing the door behind him how may i help you monk began by expressing his sympathy not only did it seem appropriate even to a butler but it was natural thank you sir cardman acknowledged he seemed about to add something then changed his mind we are not certain what happened monk began for many reasons we need to know a great deal more a shadow of pain crossed cardmans impassive face mr argyll told us that miss havilland took her own life sir is it necessary to intrude further into her unhappiness his delicacy was admirable but this was an enquiry that could either define guilt or pronounce innocence and even to the dead that was important monk could not afford to leave anything unprobed or go about his questions in the least offensive way if it was also the least efficient you were aware of her unhappiness he asked as gently as he could mr havilland died less than two months ago cardman said stiffly grief does not heal so soon it was a socially correct answer giving away nothing and delivered with as much disapproval as a butler dared show monk was brutal is your father still alive mr cardman cardmans face tightened the light of understanding flaming in his eyes bright and angry no sir monk smiled im sure you grieved for him but you did not despair he thought briefly that part of the loss of his memory from the accident included complete obliteration of anything about his own father or mother for that matter he knew only his sister beth and that only because she had tried to keep in touch he wrote seldom the shame of that bit into him without warning and he felt the heat in his face no sir cardman said stiffly monk sat down in one of the big leather armchairs and crossed his legs mr cardman i mean to find out whether this was suicide or something else he said levelly i have investigated deaths of many kinds and i do not give up until i have what i seek you will assist me willingly or not you can remain standing if you wish but i prefer that you sit i dont like staring up at you cardman obeyed monk noticed a rigidity in his movement as if he were unused to sitting in the presence of a guest and certainly not in this room he had probably been a servant all his life perhaps starting as a boot boy forty years ago or more yet he could have spent time in the army there was a ramrod stiffness to him a sense of dignity as well as selfdiscipline were you surprised monk asked suddenly cardmans eyes widened surprised that miss havilland should throw herself off waterloo bridge yes sir we all were what was she like retiring or opinionated intelligent or not monk was determined to get a meaningful answer from the man not the bland words of praise a servant would normally give his employer or anyone would accord to the dead was she pretty did she flirt was she in love with mr argyll or did she perhaps prefer someone else might she have felt trapped in a marriage to him trapped cardman was startled oh come now monk retorted you know as well as i do that not all young women marry for love they marry suitably or as opportunity is offered them he knew this from hester and from some of the cases he had taken in his private capacity the pressure and the humiliation of it barely touched the edges of his experience but he had seen the marriage market at work young women paraded like bloodstock for farmers to bid on cardman was caught in an impossible situation his expression registered his embarrassment and his understanding perhaps grief and the knowledge that he no longer had a mistress to serve broke down his resistance yes sir he admitted uncomfortably i think miss havilland did feel rather that she was taking the best offer that she had and it would be the right thing to do in accepting mr toby monk had expected that answer and yet it grieved him the young woman with the passionate face whom he had pulled from the river deserved better than that and would have hungered for it more than some and she broke the agreement after her fathers death yes sir cardmans voice dropped and there was a huskiness that once again betrayed his emotion she was very distressed by his death indeed we all were how did it happen cardman hesitated again but he seemed to know that monk would not allow him to go without first answering the question like monk cardman was a leader in a tightly knit hierarchical community with some of the most rigid rules on earth and perhaps there was something in him that wanted to share his bewilderment and his pain with at least one other person mr havilland was a gentleman in the old sense of the term sir he began not titled you understand and not with great wealth he was fair to everybody and he never carried a grudge if any man wronged him and apologized mr havilland forgot the thing entirely he was a good friend but he never put friendship above what he thought was right and he respected a poor man as much as a rich one if that man was good to his word monk was aware that cardman was watching him to see if he caught the unspoken thread bright between the words i see monk acknowledged much to be admired but not one to take the way of many in society or in business either he did not remember his days in merchant bankingthey were gone with all the rest of his memorybut he had learned piece by piece much about the cost and the dishonor of some of his own acts and those of people he had loved who had been ruined no sir im afraid not cardman agreed he had many friends but i think perhaps he had enemies as well he was much worried before his death that the rebuilding of the sewers to mr bazalgettes plans was going ahead rather too hastily and the use of the big machines was going to cause a bad accident he became most concerned about it and spent all this time looking into matters trying to prove he was right and did he prove it monk asked not so far as i know sir it caused some unpleasantness with mr alan argyll and mr toby as well but mr havilland wouldnt stop he felt he was right that must have been very difficult for him with both his daughters concerned with the argyll brothers monk observed indeed sir there was some unpleasantness im afraid feelings ran rather high miss mary sided with her father and that was when matters between her and mr toby became strained and she broke off her arrangement no sir not then cardman was obviously wretched speaking about it and yet monk could feel the weight of it inside like a dam needing release before the pressure of it burst the walls mr havilland was very concerned monk prompted you must have seen him frequently even every day did he seem to you on the edge of losing his grip on selfcontrol no sir not in the slightest cardman said vehemently his lean face alive with sudden undisguised emotion he was not in a mood anything like despair he was elated if anything he believed he was on the brink of finding proof of what he feared there had been no accident you see rather he felt one might occursomething appalling costing scores of livesand he wanted above all things to prevent it admiration shone in his eyes admiration that was deeper than mere loyalty have you always been in service cardman monk said impulsively i beg your pardon cardman was taken by surprise monk repeated the question no sir i served for six years in the army i dont see what that has to do with mr havillands death only your judgment of men under pressure cardman was embarrassed and did not know how to accept what he realized was a compliment he colored faintly and looked away were you surprised that mr havilland took his life monk asked yes sir especially cardman took a moment to master himself he sat perfectly still his knuckles white especially in his own house where miss mary was bound to know about it a man can make such things look like an accident he breathed in and out slowly it broke her heart she was never the same afterwards there was anger in his face now a man he admired had inexplicably let him down more than that he had let them all down most of all the daughter who had trusted him but you did believe it nonetheless monk asked he felt like a surgeon cutting open a man still conscious and feeling every movement of the knife he thought of hesters battlefield surgery she had steeled herself to do it knowing the alternative was to let the men die i had no choice cardman said quietly the stable boy found him out there in the mews in the morning a bullet through his brain and the gun by his hand the police proved hed bought it himself from a pawn shop just a few days before there was obviously a great deal more he could have saidthe feelings were naked in his eyesbut a lifetimes discretion governed him did he leave a note as to why he had done such a thing monk asked no sir and he said nothing to you or any of the other servants no sir simply that he wanted to wait up that night and we should not concern ourselves but retire as usual and you detected nothing out of the ordinary in his manner even with the wisdom of knowing now what happened i have considered it naturally wondering if there was something i should have seen cardman admitted he had the air of a man who has lived through a nightmare he seemed preoccupied as if he was expecting something to happen but in all honesty i thought then that it was an irritation that plagued him not a despair irritation monk pressed anger cardman frowned i would not have put it as strongly as that sir rather more as if an old friend had disappointed him or something was wearisome i formed the opinion it was a familiar problem rather than a new one he certainly did not seem afraid or desperate so you were shocked the next morning yes sir and miss mary cardmans face was pinched and his eyes were bright with tears he could not allow himself to shed ive never seen anyone more deeply hurt sir mrs kittredge the housekeeper feared miss mary might meet her own death she was so beside herself with grief she refused to believe that he could have done it himself monk refused to picture mary havillands face what in heavens name had driven havilland to do this to his daughter at least with hesters father it was the only way for him to answer the shame that had been placed upon him through his own goodness of heart he had been deceived like so many others he had considered death the only act left to an honorable man what had havilland feared or despaired of that had driven him to such an act why did she find it so hard to believe he said more sharply than he had meant to cardman started with surprise at the emotion in monks voice there was no reason he said gravely that is why miss mary believed he had been murdered more and more she became convinced that either he had found something in the tunneling works or he was about to and for that he had been killed what made her more convinced monk said quickly did something happen or was it simply her need to clear her father of suicide if i knew sir id tell you cardman replied looking directly into monks eyes there was a kind of desperation in him as if he was clinging to a last thread of hope too delicate to name miss mary read all through her fathers papers sat all day and up half the night over and over she searched them manys the time id go to his study and find her there at his desk or fallen asleep in the big chair one of his books open in her hands what kind of book monk did not know what he was looking for but cardmans emotion caught him also engineering cardman said as if monk should have understood monk was puzzled engineering did you say mr havilland was a senior engineer and surveyor for mr argylls company until the day of his death thats why they quarrelled mr argylls company has never had a bad accidentin fact theyre better than most for safetybut mr havilland believed it would happen and he told mr argyll cardman shifted position slightly yes of course but mr argyll said it was just his feelings about being underground closed in as it were mr havilland was embarrassed to admit to them argyll as much as called him a coward albeit politely of course he never used that word was that what miss havilland was doing also enquiring into engineering as regards the tunnels yes sir im certain of it but she found nothing either cardman looked chagrined no sir not so far as i am aware did she continue to see mr toby argyll she broke off their agreement but of course she still saw him socially now and then she could hardly help it since he was miss jennifers brotherinlaw and the argyll brothers were very close do you know mrs argylls feelings on the subject monk asked she was surely caught in the middle of a most unfortunate development cardmans lips pressed together before he spoke she was loyal to her husband sir she was convinced that her fathers fears had unbalanced his judgment and she was annoyed with miss mary for pandering to him rather than encouraging him to abandon the matter there was a wealth of anger and distress in his voice monk was bitterly aware that the house in which cardman lived was the center of a double disgrace and there seemed no one left to care except the butler and the other servants for whom he was responsible i see thank you very much for your honesty monk said rising to his feet just one more thing who investigated mr havillands death a superintendent runcorn cardman replied he was very civil about it and seemed to be thorough i cannot think of anything more that he could have done he stood also runcorn that was the worst answer cardman could have given the past returned to monk like a draft of cold air how many times had he secondguessed runcorngone over his work corrected a flaw here and there and altered the conclusion it seemed as if he had always needed to prove himself the cleverer increasingly he disliked the man he had been then the fact that he disliked runcorn even more mitigated nothing mr argyll did not doubt the correctness of the verdict he asked aloud his voice rasping with emotion no sir just miss mary grief filled cardmans face and he seemed unashamed of it as if at least in front of monk he felt no need to mask it anymore he swallowed hard sir i would be most grateful if you could inform us when when she is if mrs argyll doesnt he did not know how to finish i will make certain you are told monk said hoarsely but you might consider whether the female staff wish to attend burials can be very arduous you are telling me it will be in unhallowed ground i know sir if miss mary was strong enough to go to her fathers burial we can go to hers monk nodded tears in his throat for mary havilland for hesters father for uncounted people in despair cardman saw him to the door in silent understanding outside in the street monk began to walk back down the hill towards westminster bridge it would be the best place to catch a hansom but he was in no hurry he must face runcorn in his own station and yet again challenge his judgment but he was not ready to do it yet were it not for the thought of mary havilland buried in the grave of an outcast her courage and loyalty to her father credited as no more than the dementia of a bereaved woman he would have accepted the verdict and consider he had done all that duty required but he remembered her face the white skin the strong bones and the gentle mouth she was a fighter who had been beaten he refused to accept that she had surrendered at least he could not yet he wanted to prepare what he would say to runcorn weigh his words to rob them of criticism perhaps even gain his support the wind was cold blowing up off the river and the damp in it stung the flesh it crept through the cracks between scarf and coat collar and whipped trousers around the ankles the magnificent gothic lines of the houses of parliament stood on the far bank big ben indicated that it was twenty minutes before eleven he had been longer with cardman than he had realized he hunched his shoulders and walked more rapidly along the footpath hansoms passed him but they were all occupied should he have asked cardman outright if he believed the havillands had committed suicide he thought the butler was a good judge of character a strong man no he was also loyal whatever he thought he would not have told a stranger that both his master and then his mistress had committed such an act of cowardice before the law of man and of god his own judgment might have been wiser and gentler but he would not have left them open to the censure of the world he reached the middle of the bridge and saw an empty cab going the other way he stepped out into the road and hailed it giving the police station address the journey was too short he was still not ready when he arrived but then perhaps he never would be he paid the driver and went up the station steps and inside he was recognized immediately mornin mr monk the desk sergeant said guardedly what can we do for you sir monk could not remember the man but that meant nothing except that he had not worked with him since the accident nearly eight years ago now had he really known hester so long why had it taken him years to find the courage within himself and the honesty to acknowledge his feelings for her the answer was easy he did not want to give anyone else the power to hurt him so much and in closing the door on the possibility of pain of course he had closed it on the chance for joy as well good morning sergeant he replied stopping in front of the desk i would like to speak to superintendent runcorn please it concerns a case he handled recently yes sir the sergeant said with a hint of satisfaction at the lack of authority in monks voice that will be on behalf of whom sir monk forbore from smiling although he wanted to the man had not recognized his police coat on behalf of the thames river police he replied opening his jacket a little so that his uniform showed beneath the sergeants eyes widened and he let out his breath slowly yes sir he said turning on his heel and retreating and monk heard his footsteps as he went upstairs to break the news five minutes later monk was standing in runcorns office it had a large comfortable desk in it and the air was warm from the stove in the corner there were books on the shelf opposite and a rather nice carving of a wooden bear on a plinth in the middle it was all immaculately tidy as alwayspart of runcorns need to conform and impress runcorn himself had changed little he was tall and barrelchested with large eyes a fraction too close together above a long nose his hair was still thick and liberally sprinkled with gray he had put on a few pounds around the waist so its true he said eyebrows raised voice too carefully expressionless youre in the river police i told watkins he was daft but seems he wasnt his face stretched into a slow satisfied smile at his own power to give help or withhold it well what can i do for you inspector it is inspector isnt it there was a wealth of meaning behind the words monk and runcorn had once been of equal rank long ago it was monks tongue that had cost him his seniority he had been more elegant than runcorn cleverer immeasurably more the gentleman and he always would be they both knew it but runcorn was patientprepared to play the game by the rules bite back his insolence curb his impatience climb slowly now he had his reward in superior rank and he could not keep from savoring it yes it is monk replied he ached to be tart but he could not afford it down at wapping live there too runcorn pursued the subject of monks fall in the world wapping was a less elegant less salubrious place than grafton street had been or at least than it had sounded yes monk agreed again well well runcorn mused would never have guessed youd do that like it do you only been there a few weeks monk told him again runcorn could not resist the temptation got tired of being on your own then bit hard i should imagine he was still smiling after all most people can call the police for nothing why should they pay someone knew youd have to come back one day what do you need my help with out of your depth already he oozed pleasure now monk itched to retaliate he had to remind himself again that he could not afford to james havilland he answered about two months ago charles street runcorns face darkened a little the pleasure draining out of it i remember poor man shot himself in his own stables what is it to do with the river police its nowhere near the water do you remember his daughter mary monk remained standing runcorn had not offered him a seat and for monk to be comfortable would seem inappropriate in this conversation given all the past that lay between them of course i do runcorn said gravely he looked unhappy as if the presence of the dead had suddenly intruded into this quiet tidy police room from which he ruled his little kingdom has has she complained to you that her father was murdered monk was stunned not by the question but by the fact that he could see no outrage in runcorn no sense of territorial invasion that monk of all people should trespass on his case who did she think was responsible he asked runcorn was too quick for him did she he challenged him why did you say did she fell off waterloo bridge yesterday evening monk replied runcorn was stunned he stood motionless the color receding from his face for an absurd moment he reminded monk of the butler who also had grieved so much for mary havilland yet runcorn had hardly known her suicide he said hoarsely im not sure monk replied it looked like it at first she was standing near the railing talking to a man they seemed to be arguing he took hold of her and a moment or two later they both were pressed hard against the railing and then both overbalanced and fell a man runcorns eyes widened who argyll why do you think it was argyll monk demanded runcorn lost his temper color flooding up his cheeks dont play your damn fool games with me monk he said harshly you always were a heartless bastard that young woman lost her father and now shes dead too its my case and ill have you thrown out of the river police and every other damn force in london if you try to use that to prove yourself fit to be an officer again do you hear me monks temper flared also then died again even more rapidly he went on in a perfectly level voice if youre fit to be a policeman of any rank at all let alone superintendent youll care about the case and not guard your little patch of authority he retorted i dont know whether mary havilland jumped fell or was pushed i was watching when it happened but i was looking upwards from two hundred feet awaytoo far to see in the dark he was not going to explain to runcorn why he cared so much runcorn had no right to know about hesters history that was another grief another time if i knew exactly what happened to james havilland it might help me runcorn grunted then took a deep breath and let it out slowly his shoulders sagged a little oh well i suppose you do need that sit down he waved at a wooden chair piled with papers and eased himself into his own leatherpadded seat behind his desk monk moved the papers onto the floor and obeyed runcorns face became somber he had dealt with death both accidental and homicidal all his adult life but this one apparently moved him even in memory stable boy found him in the morning he began looking down at his large hands rather than at monk seems the boy lived a mile or so away and used to walk to work every morning mews are small there and the room above the stable was kept for harnesses and the like he could have slept in the straw but seems he had an aunt with a lodging house in the area and he helped out there too and got fed and looked after for it he seemed like an honest lad but we checked it all and it was the truth he was home all night and havillands butler said theyd never had a days bother with him monk nodded boy arrived about six runcorn went on found his master on the floor of the room where they keep the hay and feed lying on his back shot through the head one clean bullet into the brain mustve been standing near the middle of the room and fell backwards blood exactly where youd expect it to be gun fallen out of his hand but not more than a foot away monk felt a chill settle over him boy went in and told the butlercant remember his name runcorn went on carter or something like that cardman monk supplied thats right runcorn agreed blinking several times he went out to look saw just what the boy had said and sent the footman for the police it was nearer eight oclock by the time i got there didnt know havilland personally but i knew him by repute a very decent man hard to believe hed taken his own life he looked up at monk suddenly but one thing police work teaches you you never know what goes on in somebody elses mind loves and hates that their own families dont ever dream about monk nodded for once he had no quibble at all he tried to imagine runcorn and the scene the small stable the straw the sound and smell of horses the leather harnesses the gleam of lantern light on polished brass the dead man lying on the floor the sickly smell of blood were the horses frightened he asked any injuries runcorn frowned no bit nervous theyd smelled blood and they must have heard the shot but nothing was disturbed as if thered been a fight no wounds no wood kicked no cuts neither of em really spooked and before you ask there were no other marks on the body no bruises clothes as neat as you please id lay my reputation no one struggled or fought with him before he was shot and the way he was lying either he shot himself which everything pointed to or whoever else did it stood within a couple of feet of him because there was nowhere else to stand in a room that size and nothing was taken nothing missing monk asked without hope now he had outwitted runcorn many times in the past but that was years ago they had both learned in the time between monk to be a little gentler and more honest in his reasons for cleverness runcorn to think a little harder before coming to conclusions perhaps also to keep his attention on the case more and less on his own vanity nothing to take in the stables runcorn replied unless you count the odd horse brass but the stable boy said they were all there coachman agree monk put in seems a footman doubled as coachman runcorn answered he was handy and with a butler and junior footman who doubled as boot boy that was all that was necessary and the house monk pressed anyone intrude in the night or impossible to tell if havilland had left the door open had he yes the butler says he sat up late told them he wanted to work in his study and sent them all to bed but a thorough search was made and both miss havilland herself and the housekeeper said nothing at all was missing or even moved and there were plenty of nice things easy to carry if a burglard wanted easy to sell what time did he die monk was not yet willing to give up although it was beginning to look more and more as if mary havillands belief in her fathers murder was simply a desperate young womans refusal to accept the truth that he had killed himself police surgeon reckoned between midnight and about three close as he could tell pretty cold in the stables late autumn the thirteenth of november to be exact frost was sharpish that night i remember it was still white all around the edges of the leaves on the garden bushes we passed going in runcorn was hunched up as if the memory chilled him no one heard a shot no runcorn gave a tiny bleak smile which was unusual youd think someone wouldve tried shooting the thing myself and it was loud enough could hear it clear a hundred yards off on a still night like that i followed that one all the way but if anyone heard they wouldnt admit to it there was long experience in his face and fighting against it a very faint quickening of hope monk realized with surprise that runcorn wanted mary havilland to be right he simply could not see the possibility muffled by something monk asked runcorn shook his head no more than an inch or two nothing there powder burns on his skin if hed wrapped a towel or a cloth around it to deaden the sound thatd account for why nobody heard it or maybe didnt recognize it for a shot but then the cloth would still be there and it wasnt unless somebody took it away he did not quite make it a question but it was in his eyes no sign of anyone else there monk asked seeking the same hope not a thing and i looked myself monk believed him not only was runcorn not easily a liar there was a painful hunger in him to believe better of havilland than the circumstances justified even now two months later it was still there monk asked the next obvious question why what was so wrong that hed shoot himself in his own stables in the middle of the night runcorn pressed his lips together and hunched his shoulders a little more i looked there was an edge of defense in his voice as far as anyone knew his health was excellent he ate well slept well enough walked often we checked into his affairs he certainly was more than comfortably off no unaccounted expenditure he didnt gamble and if anyone was blackmailing him it wasnt for money if he had a mistress we never found her if he had bad habits we saw no sign of them either he drank very little never been seen the worse for it wife died seven years ago had two daughters jenny the elder is married to alan argyll a very successful businessman runcorn took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh havilland worked for argylls company as an engineer in the big rebuilding of the sewers well respected well paid seemed to get on all right at least until recently when havilland took it into his head that the tunnels were dangerous and there was going to be an accident one day we couldnt find any evidence for it argylls safety record is good better than most and we all know the new sewers are necessary urgently so and mary monk asked he wanted to fault runcorn to find something the superintendent had forgotten or done badly but he couldnt runcorns face softened the poor girl was beside herself with grief he said defensively as if he felt he needed to protect her memory from monks intrusion monk liked him the better for that she couldnt believe he would do such a thing runcorn went on said he was on a crusade and people in crusades get killed sometimes but they dont shoot themselves she said he was on the edge of finding out something about the tunnels and someone killed him to stop him doing that lots of money at stake fortunes to be made and i suppose lost in all this and reputations what do you believe monk asked asked a few questions about him runcorn said unhappily according to the men in the works hed gotten a bit eccentric scared stiff of tunnels and holes so they said used to shake and go white as a ghost break out in a sweat he lifted one shoulder very slightly happens to some people others its heights or spiders or snakes whatever usually think of women being frightened of that sort of thing but it doesnt have to be worked a case once with a woman who fainted at the sight of a mouse cant think why but it doesnt have to have a reason knew another one terrified of birds even a harmless little canary he stopped all the lines of his face sagged making him look older more tired than before he did seem obsessed with the dread of an accident and as far as i could see there was no reason for it what did mrs argyll think of her father in this monk asked remembering jenny argylls stiff back and carefully controlled face blamed herself for not seeing how far his madness had gone runcorn answered weariness and confusion in his eyes said she would have had him better looked after if shed known not that there was a thing she couldve done as her husband told her as long as he breaks no lawsand havilland didnta mans entitled to go as daft as he likes and mary runcorn sighed thats the thing poor girl refused to accept it determined her father was right and wouldnt let it rest started reading all his books asking questions broke off her engagement to toby argyll and devoted herself to clearing her fathers name wanted him buried in consecrated ground if it took her her lifes work to do it his voice sank even lower now it looks as if the poor soulll lie beside him do you know when theyre going to do that because he stopped abruptly and cleared his throat then glared defensively at monk as if challenging him to mock monk had no desire to in his minds eye he could see again and again the figure of mary tipping over the rail clinging on to toby argyll and the two of them plunging down into the icy river he still did not know what had happened nothing was clear and he ended up not remembering but imagining because he wanted her not to have done it herself and he remembered the strong bones and the gentle mouth of the white face they pulled out of the river and that mrs porter had said she was a woman of opinions and the courage to declare them no not yet but ill tell you when i do have to tell the butler cardman as well runcorn nodded then looked away his eyes too bright you said you found where he bought the gun monk changed the subject runcorn did not look at him pawnshop half a mile away owner described him close enough he was wearing a good coat dark wool and a scarf nothing odd in that especially on a november night not very specific could have been anyone could have except it was the same gun had one or two marks and scratches on it he was certain enough but why would havilland have killed himself monk persisted runcorn shook his head alan argyll told me he was becoming an embarrassment to the company he was reluctant to say so but he was going to have to dismiss him havilland was upsetting the men causing trouble argyll felt very badly about it but he had no choice couldnt let everyone suffer because of one mans obsession said he hadnt told his wife and certainly mary didnt know but he had intimated as much to havilland himself he begged us not to tell them especially mary it wouldnt alter his suicide and it would reduce him in their eyes in fact it would make suicide seem more rational maybe he did tell her after all there was no relief in his face no sense of resolution poor man monk said if he told her at last and she went off the bridge taking toby argyll with her hes going to feel a guilt for the rest of his life what else could he do runcorn said reasonably his face still puckered in distaste if havilland was murdered who did mary think was responsible her brotherinlaw runcorn replied unhesitatingly but he wasnt we checked uphe was out all evening at a function and went home with his wife a little after midnight shell swear for him and so will the servants footman waited up so did the ladys maid no way he could have been there same for his brother before you ask he lives close by no servants to swear for him monk pointed out he was out of london that night runcorn responded wasnt within a hundred miles checked on that too i see there was nothing left to argue he stood up with a strange hollowness inside him thank you runcorn rose as well are you giving up it sounded like a challenge there was a note in it close to despair no monk exclaimed in truth though he had no idea where else to look for evidence inevitability closed in on him tell me runcorn said frowning if you find anything and yes i will monk promised he thanked him and left before it could grow any more awkward there was nothing else for them to say to each other and the brief truce was best unbroken by not trying monk returned to wapping station and spent the afternoon in the general duties that were part of his new job he disliked the routine especially writing reports and even more reading other peoples but he could not afford to do less than his best any error or omission could be the one that spelled failure he must succeed he had no other skills than for his work and most certainly no other friends like callandra daviot who could or should help financially at five oclock it was completely dark worse than that there was a heavy fog rolling in from the east shrouding the river so closely he knew he would not find a boatman to attempt rowing him across already the streetlamps were dimming blurred yellow ghosts fading altogether after twenty yards so the night was impenetrable the mournful baying of the foghorns on the water broke the silence and there was little else to be heard but the steady drip of water and the slurp of the tide on the steps and against the embankment monk left at half past five to begin the long walk up towards london bridge where if he was very fortunate he might find a hansom to take him over and as far as southwark park and home he buttoned his coat pulled his collar up and set out he had gone about a quarter of a mile when he was aware of someone behind him he stopped just beyond one of the mistshrouded lamps and waited an urchin came into the pale circle of light he looked about nine years old as much as one could see of his face through the grime he was wearing a long jacket and odd boots but at least he was not barefoot on the icy stone hello scuff monk said with pleasure the mudlark had been of help to him in the maude idris case and monk had seen him a dozen times since then albeit briefly twice they had shared a meat pie this was the first time he had seen the boots new find he asked admiring them found one bought the other scuff replied catching up with him monk started to walk again it was too cold to stand still how are you he asked scuff shrugged i got boots you all right the second was said with a shadow of anxiety scuff thought monk was an innocent a liability to himself and he made no secret of it not bad thank you monk replied do you want a pie if we can find anyone open yer wont scuff said candidly its gonna be an ard winter you wanna watch yerself its gonna get bad its pretty bad every winter monk replied he could not afford to dwell too long on the misery of those who worked and slept outside because he was helpless to do anything about it what was a hot pie now and then to one small boy this int the same scuff replied keeping step with monk by skipping an extra one now and then them big tunnels wot theyre diggin is upsettin folk down there toshers int appy toshers were the men who made their living by hunting for and picking up small objects of value that found their way into the sewers including a remarkable amount of jewelry they usually hunted together for fear of the armies of rats that could rapidly strip a man down to the bone if he was unlucky enough to lose his footing and injure himself and there was always the possibility of a buildup of methane gas given off by the sewer contents and of course a wave of water if the rain was torrential enough why are the toshers unhappy monk asked therell always be sewers just better ones change scuff said simply and with exaggerated patience everybodys got their stretch their beat if yer like seen as yer a policeman o sorts im a perfectly regular policeman monk defended himself scuff treated that assertion with the silence it deserved in his opinion monk was a dangerous novice who had taken durban s position out of a misguided idea of loyalty he was miserably unsuited for it and was much in need of the guidance or protection of someone who knew what they were doing such as scuff himself he had been born on the river and at nine years oldor possibly ten he wasnt surehe knew an enormous amount and was not too proud to learn more every day but it was a heavy responsibility to look after a grown man who thought he knew so much more than he did is there going to be a fight over the new stretches monk asked course there is scuff replied sniffling an lots o folk gotta move their places owd yer like it if some bleedin great machine came an crashed your ole street down wiout a word eh scuff was referring to the entire communities on the edge between honest poverty close to destitution and the semicriminal underworld who lived nearly all their lives in the sewers tunnels and excavations beneath london to drive a new tunnel through the old was like putting a hot poker into a wasps nest that had been ormes analogy i know monk replied mr orme has already warned me im not doing this alone you know he looked from left to right through the thickening fog to see if he could see the lights of any kind of food or hotdrink peddlers the cold was like a tightening vise around them crushing the heat out of their bodies how did an urchin like scuffso thin he was merely skin and bonesurvive the baleful cry of the foghorns was growing more frequent on the water and it was impossible to place the sound in the distortion of the mist otchestnut seller that way scuff said hopefully sniffing again tonight monk doubted it it would be a bad night for barrows no one would be able to see them in this charlie scuff said as if that were explanation enough do you think so course i cant see anything which way don need ter i know where ell be yer like chestnuts there was a definite lift in scuff s voice now hot id eat anything yes i do scuff hesitated as if considering whether to strike a bargain then his charity got the better of his business sense ill take yer he offered magnanimously it was clear that monk needed all the help he could get thank you monk accepted perhaps you would join me i don mind if i do three the portpool lane clinic was a large establishment not with the open wards that made nursing easy but with numerous separate bedrooms however it had the greatest advantage any establishment that was devoted to the treatment of the penniless could have it was rentfree it had once been a highly disreputable brothel run by one squeaky robinson a man of many financial and organizational skills he had in the past made one serious technical error and it was that upon which hester with the help of the brilliant barrister oliver rathbone had capitalized on it was then that the brothel had been closed down its extortion business ended and the building turned into a clinic for the treatment of any street woman who was either injured or ill some of its former occupants had remained to work at the more tedious but far safer occupations of cleaning and laundering sheets squeaky robinson himself lived on the premises and under vociferous and constant complaint kept the books and managed the continuing finances he never allowed hester to forget that he was there under duress and because he had been tricked in turn she was aware that he had actually against his better judgment developed a fierce pride in the whole enterprise after the terrible period during which claudine burroughs had come and experienced such a change in her life margaret ballinger had also finally accepted sir olivers proposal of marriage both women were working at the clinic and fully intended to remain so leaving hester with far less responsibility for its welfare either in the raising of funds to pay for the food fuel and medicines or in the daytoday chores the same bitter morning that monk began investigating the death of james havilland hester was checking the account books in the office at the clinic for the last time after the appalling weeks of the previous autumn when hester had so nearly died monk had demanded that she give up working at the clinic although it meant far more to her than a simple refuge for street women who were ill or injured and it filled a need in her to heal she ultimately acquiesced to monks wishes even so she dragged out the last duties in the clinic putting off the moment of having to leave she would greatly have preferred to perform this task in the familiar kitchen where the stove kept the whole room warm and the lamps gave a pleasant yellow glow on old pans polished with use and odd china of varying colors and designs strings of onions hung from the bare beams along with bunches of dried herbs and at least one airing rack was festooned with laundered bandages ready for use on the next disaster but the ledgers bills and receipts as well as the money itself were all in the office so she sat at the table feet cold and hands stiff adding up figures and trying to make the results hopeful there was a brisk knock on the door and as soon as she answered it claudine came in she was a tall woman narrowshouldered and broad at the hips her face had been handsome in her youth but years of unhappiness had taken the bloom from her skin and marked her features with an expression of discontent a couple of months of dedicated purpose and the startling realization that she was actually both useful and liked had only just begun to change that she still wore her oldest clothes which were of good quality but out of fashion now the newer ones were left at home to be worn on her increasingly rarer forays into society her husband was annoyed and puzzled by her preference for good work over the pursuit of pleasure but she no longer believed he had earned the right to inflict further unhappiness upon her and very seldom spoke of him if she had any friends of her own aside from those at the clinic she did not refer to them either except insofar as they might be persuaded to donate to the cause good morning claudine hester said trying to sound cheerful how are you claudine still did not take pleasantries for granted good morning she replied even now unsure whether to address hester by her christian name im very well thank you but i fear we can expect a good deal of bronchitis in this weather and pneumonia as well got a stab wound in last night stupid girl hasnt got the wits she was born with working out of a place like fleet row can we save her hester asked anxiously unintentionally including herself in the cause oh yes claudine was somewhat smug about her newly acquired medical knowledge even if it came from observation rather than experience what i came about was new sheets we can manage for a little longer but youll have to ask margaret about more funds soon well need at least a dozen and thatll barely do can it wait another few weeks hester regarded the column of figures in front of her she ought to tell claudine that she was going but she could not bring herself to do it yet three perhaps claudine replied i can bring a pair from home but i dont have twelve thank you hester meant it for claudine to provide anything out of her own home for the use of street women was a sevenleague step from the wounding distaste the woman had felt only three months earlier the charity work claudine had been used to was of the discreet untroublesome kind where ladies of like disposition organized fetes and garden parties to raise money for respectable causes such as fever hospitals mission work and the deserving poor some profound disruption to her personal life had driven claudine to this total departure she had not confided in anybody what it had been and hester would never ask breakfast will be ready in half an hour claudine responded you should eat and without waiting for a reply she went out closing the door behind her hester smiled and returned to her figures the next person to come in was margaret ballinger her face pink from the cold but with nothing of the hunched defense against the weather that one might expect there was a confidence about her an unconscious grace as of one who is inwardly happy all external circumstances being merely peripheral breakfasts ready she said cheerfully she knew hester was going but she refused to think of it and suttons here to see you he does look a little concerned hester was surprised sutton a ratcatcher by trade occasionally did odd jobs for hester she stood up immediately is he all right hes not hurt margaret began and snoot hester was referring to the ratcatchers eager little terrier margaret smiled in excellent health she assured hester whatever concerns sutton it is not snoot hester fait immeasurably relieved she knew how sutton loved the animal he was possibly all the family he had certainly all he spoke of downstairs in the kitchen there was porridge on the large castiron stove two kettles were boiling and the door to the toasting fire was closed while an entire loaf of bread sliced and browned on the fork sat crisping in two wooden racks there was butter marmalade and blackcurrant jam on the table the clinic was obviously quite welloff in funds at the moment sutton a lean man not much more than hesters height sat on one of the few unsplintered kitchen chairs he stood up the moment he saw her the brown and white jack russell terrier at his feet wagged his tail furiously but he was too tightly disciplined to dart forward suttons thin face lit up with pleasure and what looked like relief mornin miss ester ow are yer im very well mr sutton she replied how are you im sure you could manage some breakfast couldnt you im having some thatd be very civil of yer he watched her sitting down as soon as she had margaret had already eaten at home she never ate the clinics rations unless she was there for too long to abstain she collected most of the clinics funds through her social acquaintances and she was far too sensitive to the difficulty of that to waste a farthing or consume herself what could be used for the sick she would make an excellent mistress of this in hesters place sutton devoured his porridge and then toast and marmalade while hester had just the toast and jam they were both on their second cup of tea when claudine excused herself and they were left alone much against her own better judgment claudine had given snoot porridge and milk as well and he was now happily asleep in front of the hearth shell spoil im rotten that woman sutton said as claudine closed the door wot goodll e be fer rattin if es anded is breakfast on a plate hester did not bother to answer it was part of the slow retreat by which claudine was going to allow sutton to understand that she granted him a reluctant respect she was a lady and he caught rats she would not bring herself to treat him as an equal which would have made both of them uncomfortable but she would be more than civil to the dog that was different and they both understood it perfectly what is it hester asked before they should be interrupted again by some business of the day he did not prevaricate they had come to know each other well during the crisis of the autumn he looked at her earnestly his brow furrowed i dunno as theres anythin yer can do but i gotta try all i can we all knows about the great stink an ow the river smells summink evil an theyre doin summink about it at last an thats all as it should be he shook his head but most folks oo live aboveground int got no idea wot goes on underneath no she agreed with only a faint gnawing of concern should we if yer gonna go diggin around in it wi picks an shovels an great machines then yeah yer should there was a sudden passion in his voice and a fear she had not heard before he had been so strong in the autumn this was something new something over which he felt he had no control what sort of thing is there she asked you mean graveyards and plague pitsthat sort of thing there are but wot i were thinkin of is rivers theres springs and streams all over the place london s mostly on clay yer see his face was tense eyes keen i learned em from me pa e were a tosher one o the best knew every river under the city from battersea ter greenwich e did an most o the wells too yer any idea ow many wells there is miss ester there must be she tried to think and realized she had no idea hundreds i suppose i dont mean where we get water up he explained i mean them wots closed over and goes away secret like are there she did not know why it troubled him still less why he should have come to her about it he understood and grimaced at his own foolishness thing is miss ester theres undreds o navvies workin on all this diggin as bin for years wot with one tunnel an another for sewers roads trains an the like its ard work an its dangerous an theres always bin accidents part o life but its got worse since all this new diggins bin goin on everyones after a bit o the profit an its all in a terrible urry cos o the typhoid an the big stink an all an mr bazalgettes new drawings but its gettin more dangerous people are usin bigger and bigger machines an goin faster all the time cos o the urry an they int takin the time ter learn proper where all em streams an springs is his face was tight with fear get it wrong an clay slips somethin orrible weve ad one or two caveins but i reckon as therell be a lot more an worse if folks dont take a bit more care an a bit more time she looked at his drawn tired face and knew that there was more behind his words than he was able to tell her what is it you think i could do mr sutton she asked i dont know how to help injured workmen i dont have the skill and i certainly dont have the ear of any person with the influence to make the construction companies take more care his shoulders slumped a little looking narrower under his plain dark jacket she judged him to be in his fifties but hard workmuch of it dangerous and unpleasant plus many years of povertymight have taken more of a toll on his strength than she had allowed he might be younger than that she remembered how he had helped all of them at the clinic but most especially her tenderly and fearlessly what would you like me to do she asked he smiled realizing she had given in she hoped profoundly that he did not know why if anyoned said ter me a year ago as a lady ood bin ter the crimea would take ol squeaky robinsons place an turn it inter an ospital fer tarts off the street he answered an then get other ladies ter cook and clean in it id a throwed a bucket o water at em till they soberd up but if anyone can do somethin ter get them builders ter beave a bit safer its you he finished his tea and stood up if you can come wi me i can show you the machines wot im talkin about she was startled itll be quite safe he assured her well go ter one o em thats open but yer can think wot itd be like underneath some tunnels is dug down then covered over cut and cover they call em but some is deep down like a ratole under the ground all the way he shivered very slightly its em that scares me the engineers might be clever wi all kinds o machines an ideas but they dont know alf o wots down there secret for undreds o years twistin an seepin she felt a chill at the thought a coldness in the pit of her stomach the daylight was coming in brighter now through the windows into the scullery there was a sound of footsteps across the cobbled yard where deliveries were made she stood up how close will they let me come borrer a shawl from one o yer patients an keep yer eyes down an yer can come right up close wi me ill go and speak to miss ballinger but it was claudine she met just outside the kitchen door she began to explain that she was going to be away for a few hours the books would have to wait she was happy enough to stretch out the task as long as she could i heard claudine said gravely her face puckered into lines of concern she was unaware of it but her anger was so fierce that her sense of social class had temporarily ceased to register its monstrous if people are being injured by hasty work we must do what we can to fight it unconsciously she had included herself in the battle we can manage perfectly well here theres nothing to do but the laundry and the cleaning and if we cant manage that then we need to learn just be careful this last warning was given with a frown of admonition as if claudine were somehow responsible for hesters safety hester smiled i will she promised aware for the first time that claudine had become fonder of her than perhaps she herself knew sutton will look after me claudine grunted she was not going to admit to trusting sutton that would be a step too far in spite of there being little wind it was fiercely cold outside the narrow streets seemed to hold the ice of the night footsteps sounded loud on the stones and the brittle crack of puddles was sharp in the close air this was the time of year when people who slept huddled in doorways could be found frozen to death at first light she walked beside sutton snoot trotting at their heels until they came to farringdon road and the first omnibus stop the horses were roughcoated for winter and steamed gently as they stood while passengers climbed off and on hester and sutton went up the winding steps to the upper level since they were going to the end of the line snoot sat on suttons knee and she envied him the warmth of the little dogs body they talked most of the way because she asked him about the rivers under london he was enthusiastic to tell her his face lighting up as he described the hidden streams such as the walbrook tyburn counters creek stamford brook effra and most of all the fleet whose waters once ran red from the tanneries he talked of springs such as st chad s st agnes st brides st pancraswells and holywell all had been reputed as sacred at one time or another and some became spas like hampstead wells and sadlers wells he knew the underground courses and bridges some of which were believed to date back to roman times walbrooks as far up as yer could get a boat when the romans was ere he said with triumph he animatedly recounted earlier travels including the danger of highwaymen until they reached their stop they alighted into a busy street workmen crowding around a peddler selling sandwiches and hot pies they were obliged to slip out over the gutter onto the cobbles to pass them and were nearly run down by a cartload of vegetables pulled by a horse whose breath was steam in the air at the corner half a dozen men huddled around a brazier talking and laughing tin mugs of tea in their hands not sure as i like so much change sutton said dubiously still cant be elped hester did not argue they had only a few yards further to go before she saw the vast crater of the new tunnel it would carry not only the sewer but beside it the gas pipes for the houses that had such luxuries skeletons of woodwork for cranes and derricks poked above it like fingers at the sky there was a faint noise from far within of grinding and crushing scraping slithering and the occasional shouts and the rattle of wheels hester stood on the freezing earth and felt the freshening wind from the tide on the river with its smell of salt and sewage she turned to her left and saw the roofs of houses in the near distance and closer the broken walls where they had been flattened to make way for the new works to the right it was the same streets cut in half as if they had been chopped by a giant axe she looked at sutton and saw the pity in his face as well as the fury he was trying to suppress to build the new they had broken so much of the old keep close and dont meet no ones eyes he said quietly well just walk through like we got business theres em as knows me and he led the way making a path through the rubble and keeping wide of the groups of men every now and again he put out his hand to steady her and she was grateful for it because the rubble was crumbling and icy snoot trotted along at their heels there was a thick fence around the actual pit in which the men worked possibly to keep out the idle and to prevent the careless from falling in got ter go round the end there sutton pointed and then led her through a shifting slithering wasteland of debris the line of pipes was easy enough to trace with the eye by the wreckage that lay in its path twice they were stopped and questioned as to who they were and if they had any business there but sutton answered for them both she kept silent and followed him patiently at lasther feet sore and her boots and skirt splatteredshe reached the point below which the men were actually working by flares at the face of the tunnel the earth was excavated deeper than she had expected she was close to the edge of the drop and a feeling of vertigo overcame her for a moment as she stared down almost a hundred feet to the brickworks at the bottom of the abyss she could quite clearly see the floor of what would be the new sewer and the arching brick sides already laid and cemented there was scaffolding over it holding the walls apart all the way up here and there other pipes crossed it fifty yards away well on the other side a steam engine hissed and thumped driving the chains that held heavy buckets and scoops to draw up and empty the rubble and broken brick she turned and met suttons eyes he pointed down to where she could see men below foreshortened to funny little movements of hands and shoulders they walked pushing barrows others swung pikes or heaved on shovels of soil and rock look sutton directed her eyes towards the walls on the far side the earth itself was held firm by planks of heavy wood supported by crossbeams every few yards then she followed suttons gaze and saw the water seeping throughjust a dribble here and there or a bulge in the wood where the boards had been strained and were coming away on the bank opposite stokers were keeping the great steam engine going she could hear the wheeze and thump of its pistons and smell the steam the oil she was aware of sutton watching her she tried to imagine what it would be like to work down in that cleft in the earth seeing nothing but a slit of sky above you and knowing you couldnt get out wheres the way up she asked almost involuntarily alf a mile away he answered quietly all right ter walk ter if yer in no urry nasty if yer need ter move quickishlike if em sides spring a leak a leak you mean a stream or something you dont mean just rain the picture of that bulging wall giving way filled her minda jet of water gushing out not just dribbling as it was now would it fill the bottom enough to drown them of course it would who could swim in a crevasse like that with freezing water coming down on top of you thats a sewer he said quietly standing close to her the sewers o london takes everythin all the waste from all the ouses an middens in the ole city an from the sinks an gutters an overflows everywhere if yer a tosher or a ganger yer know the tides an all the fivers an springs an keep an eye ter the rain cos if yer dont yerll not last long an o course theres the rats never go underground alone slip and fall an the ratsll ave yer strip a man ter the bone if yer unlucky an fetch up where they can reach yer undreds o thousands o em down there there are snoot had pricked up his ears at the word rats hester said nothing an theres the gas sutton added is that what that pipe is she asked gesturing to the one that crossed the deep gash in the earth about fifteen feet down going diagonally on a quite different track from the cutting sutton smiled no miss ester thats gas fer lights an things in there im talkin about the sort o gas that collects up under the ground cos o wot sewers is for carryin gives off methane it does an if the air or water dont carry it away its enough ter suffocate a man or if some fool lights a spark with a tinder or a steel boot on stone then whoomph he jerked his hands apart violently fingers spread to indicate an explosion or theres the chokedamp wot yer gets in coal mines an the like thatll kill yer too again she said nothing trying to imagine what it would be like to have no skill except one that obliged you to labor in such conditions and yet she had known navvies before in the crimea and a braver harderworking group of men she had never seen they had built a railway for the soldiers across wild almost uncharted terrain in the depth of winter in a time most others had considered totally outside any possibility and an excellent railway it was too but that had been aboveground the great steam engine was still pounding away shaking the earth with its strength hauling as men and beasts never could foot by foot were forming the sewers that would make london clean safe from the epidemics of typhoid and cholera that had carried away so many in appalling deaths its that damn great thing wot worries me sutton said staring at the steam engine theres other ones like that even bigger wot i cant show yer cos o where they are everyones in an urry an they int takin care like they should a wheel gets away from yer chain breaks loose on one o them things an before yer knows it a mans arms ripped out or a beam o woods broke wots oldin up alf the roof o somethin theyre in a hurry because of the threat of typhoid and cholera such as we had in the great stink she said quietly i know but cos theyre tryin ter beat each other an get the next order too he added an no one says nothin cos they dont want ter lose their jobs or ave other folks think theyre scared and are they scared course they are he looked at her ruefully yer must be froze ill take yer to see someone not a mile from ere ooll give us a decent cup o tea cmon and without waiting for her to accept or possibly not he turned and began walking back from the crevasse the way they had come through the rubble and piles of timber much of it rotted as always the little dog was beside him jumping over the stones his tail wagging hester followed after him having to hurry to catch up she did not resent his pace she knew it came from the emotion driving him the fear that a tragedy might occur before he could do anything to stop even the smallest part of it they did not talk in the half hour it took them to weave their way through the narrow streets and alleys but it was a companionable silence he was very careful to keep step with her and now and then to warn her of a particularly rough or slippery stretch of road or of the steepness of the step up to an occasional pavement she wondered if this was where he had grown up during the brief space they had known each other there had been no time for talk of such things even had either of them wished to before today she had not known that his father was a tosher but hunting the sewers for accidentally flushed treasures and keeping down the worst of the vast rat population that emerged from that underworld were closely allied trades though ratcatching was the superior the tosher would have been proud of his son he should have been even prouder of his courage and humanity the streets were busy a coal cart trundled over the cobbles a costermonger was selling fruit and vegetables on the corner where they crossed a peddler of buttons brought to her mind the need to replenish her sewing basket but not now she hurried to keep up with suttons swift pace women passed them carrying pails of water bundles of clothes or groceries they skirted around half a dozen children playing games tossing knucklebones or skipping rope for an instant she ached to be able to do something for themfood boots anything she dismissed it from her mind with force cats and dogs and even a couple of pigs foraged around hopefully it was still appallingly cold the door where sutton finally stopped was narrow with peeling paint and no windows or letter box in some places that would indicate that it was a facade placed to hide the fact that there was a railway behind it rather than a house but here it was that no letters were expected none of the other doors had knockers either sutton banged with the flat of his hand and stood back a few minutes later it was opened by a girl of about ten her hair was tied with a bright length of cloth and her face was clean but she had no shoes on her dress was obviously cut down from a longer one and left with room to fit her at least another couple of years alio essie yer mam in sutton asked she smiled at him shyly and nodded turning to lead the way to the kitchen hester and sutton followed driven as much by the promise of warmth as anything else essie led them along a narrow passage that was cold and smelled of damp and old cooking and into the one room in the house that had heat the warmth came from a small black stove with a hob just large enough for one cauldron and a kettle her mother a rawboned woman who must have been about forty but looked far older was scraping the eyes and the dirt from a pile of potatoes there were onions beside her still to be prepared in the corner of the room nearest the stove sat a large man with an old coat on his knees the way the folds of it fell it was apparent that most of his right leg was missing hester was startled to see from his face that he was probably no more than forty either if that sutton ordered snoot to sit then he turned to the woman mrs collard he said warmly this is mrs monk oo nursed some of the men in the crimea an keeps a clinic for the poor in portpool lane he did not add specifically what kind of poor an this is andrew collard he turned to the man e used ter work in the tunnels how do you do mrs collard mr collard hester said formally she had long ago decided to speak to all people in the same way rather than distinguish between one social class and another by adopting what she felt would be their own pattern of introduction there was no need to wonder why andrew collard did not work in the tunnels anymore collard nodded answering with words almost indistinguishable he was embarrassedthat was easy to seeand perhaps ashamed because he could not stand to welcome a lady into his own home meager as it was hester had no idea how to make him at ease she ought to have been able to call on her experience with injured and mutilated soldiers she had seen enough of them and enough of those wasted by disease racked with fever or unable even to control their bodys functions but this was different she was not a nurse here and these people had no idea why she had come for an instant she was furious with sutton for the imposition upon them and upon her she did not dare meet his eyes or he would see it in her she might then even lash out at him in words and be bitterly sorry afterwards she owed him more than that whatever she felt as if aware of the rage and misery in the silence sutton spoke we just bin and looked at the diggin he said to andrew collard freezin at the moment and not much rain but its drippin quite a bit all the same ow long dyer reckon itll take some o that wood ter rot mrs collard glanced from one to the other of them then told essie to go outside and play theyre movin too fast for it ter matter collard answered int the wood rottin as is the trouble its them bleedin great machines shakin everythin ter bits does it even more if they int tied down like they should be only gawd isself knows whats shiftin around underneath them bleedin great things tied down hester asked quickly arent they dug in staked he answered but they shake loose if yer dont do em real ard an careful miss them machines is stronger than all the orses yer ever seen stakes look tight ter begin wi but arter an hour or two they int yer need ter move the ole engine a dozen yards or so ter fresh ground an start over but that takes time means that i understand she said quickly theyre losing loads going up and down when they take up the bolts and move the machine then stake it and start it up again and the more firmly they bolt it the longer it takes to move it yeah thats right collard looked slightly taken aback that she had grasped the point so quickly dont all companies work the same way she said most he agreed somes more careful somes less couldnt all get engines the same but moren that the earth int the same from one place ter nother if yer ever dug it yerself you know chelsea int the same as lambeth an rotheride int the same as the isle o dogs he was looking at her now his eyes narrow and tired with pain theres all sorts clay rock shale sand an o course theres rivers an springs but sutton knows that moren em theres old workings o all sorts drains gutters cellars tunnels an plague pits goes back ter roman times some of em yer cant do it quick he stared into the middle distance hester could only imagine what it was like for him sitting helpless in a chair while the world narrowed and closed in on him he saw disaster ahead and was unable to do anything to prevent it he was telling her because she asked and she had come with sutton but he did not believe she cared or could help either his wife lost patience why dont yer tell em straight she demanded ignoring the boiling kettle except for a swift movement to remove it from the heat if she had intended to make tea it was forgotten now were a cavein wot took my usbands leg she said to hester one o them big beams fell on im only way ter get im out before the ole lot caved in were ter take is leg orff if they go on usin them great machines shakin everythin ter bits up on top like that sooner or later the sides is gonna cave in on top o the men wots diggin an aulin down the bottom or when we get rains like we ave in febuary one o em sewers bursts an oos gonna get the men out before it floods eh she demanded her voice high and harsh i know a score o women like me oose husbands a lorst arms an legs ter them bleedin tunnels an widders as well too many o them damn railways is built on blood an bones thereve always been accidents hester said reluctantly is any contractor especially bad collard shook his head angrily his face dark not as i know course theres accidents no ones gurnin about that yer do ard work yer take ard chances the wifes just bellyachin cos it int easy fer er is it lu int no better bein a coal miner or seaman or lots o other things he smiled mirthlessly dont spose its always rum an cakes bein a soldier is it he waited for her answer no she agreed what is it then that you are concerned about the smile vanished im moren concerned miss im downright scared they got ole lengths o new sewer built an o course theres still most o the old bein used get a couple o slides mud caveins an yer got men cut off down there if yer dont get drownded it could be worseburned burned gas theres ouseold gas pipes in em sewers as well get a shift in the clay an one o them cracks an first spark youll ave not only the gas from the sewage but back up inter every ouse as as gaslight see wot i mean yes hester saw only too well it could be a second great fire of london if he was right surely theyve thought of that too they had to have no one was irresponsible enough not to foresee such a catastrophe a few navvies drowned or suffocated she could believe there had been a cavein when the crown of the arch of the fleet sewer had broken the scaffolding beams had been flung like matchwood into the air falling crashing as the whole structure subsided and the bottom of the excavation moved like a river rolling and crushing and burying sutton was watching her too yer memberin the fleet he asked she was startled of course he had told her about the fleet river running under london in the tales his father had told him now she knew why he had described the whole network of shifting sliding seeping running waters doesnt everybody know this she said incredulously it was lu collard who answered course they do miss but oos gonna say it eh lose yer job then oo feeds yer kids collard shifted uncomfortably in his imprisoning chair his face was more wasted with pain than hester had appreciated before he was probably in his midthirties he had been a goodlooking man when he was whole aw andy she can see it his wife said wearily int no use pretendin thats wot them bastards count on everyone so buttoned up wi pride nobdys gonna say theyre scared o bein the next one urt be quiet woman collard snapped yer dont know nothin their men int course they is she turned on him they int stupid they know its gonna appen one day an gawd knows ow manyll get killed they dont say nothin cos theyd sooner get crushed or drownded termorrer than starve terday an let their kids starve shut yer eyes an wot yer dont see dont urt yer yer gotta live he said looking away from her sutton was watching hester his thin face anxious of course you have hester answered and the new sewers have got to be built we cant allow the great stink to happen again or have typhoid and cholera in the streets as we had before but no one wants another disaster like the fleet sewer only worse theres too much money involved for anyone to do it willingly there needs to be a law involved one that can be enforced they wont never do that collard said bitterly only men wots got money can vote and parliament makes the laws hester looked at him gently sewers run under the houses of men with money more than they do under yours or mine i think we might find a way of reminding them of that at least we can try collard sat perfectly still for a moment then very slowly he turned to look at sutton to try to read in his face if hester could possibly mean what she said exactly sutton said very clearly then turned to mrs collard ow about a cup o tea then lu its coldern a witchs he stopped suddenly remembering hesters presence eart he finished collard hid a smile lu glared at him then smiled suddenly at hester showing surprisingly good teeth yeah o course she replied that evening hester spent a couple of hours cleaning and tidying up after the plasterer who was now finished not only were the walls perfectly smooth ready for papering there was also elegant molding where the wall met the ceiling and a beautiful rose for the pendant lamp but all the time her hands were busy with brooms dustpans scrubbing brushes and cloths she was thinking about her promise to andy collard and more important to sutton as collard had observed parliament made the laws that was the only place worth beginning she must find out who was the member most appropriate to approach when monk came home she proudly showed him how the house decorating was going and asked after the success of his day she said nothing about sutton or her interest in the building of the new sewers it was not difficult to conceal it nor did she feel deceitful she was deeply concerned over the apparent suicide of mary havilland the young woman who had so recently lost her father in a way hester could understand far more than she cared to remember she had thought her own loss had been dealt with in her mind and the wound of it healed over now it was like a bone that was broken long ago but aches again with the cold weather a pain deep inside wakening unexpectedly too covered over with scars to reach again and yet sometimes hurting as sharply as when it had been new she wanted to hide it from monk she could see in the shadow in his eyes the line of his lips that he was aware of the memory in her and that he was pursuing the havilland case at least in part because mary made him think of hester inside he was reacting to the old injustice as well as the new she wanted to smile at him and tell him that it did not hurt anymore but she would not lie to him and it was going to hurt more in the loneliness of the house with only chores to keep her busy no challenge nothing to fight she reached out to touch him to be close to him and say nothing sometimes explanations intruded into understanding that was better in silence in the morning hester visited a gentleman she had once nursed through a serious illness she was delighted to see that he was in much improved health although he tired more quickly than earlier she had gone principally for the purpose of learning from him which member of parliament to seek out regarding the method and regulations of the new construction of sewers she came away with the conviction that it was unquestionably morgan applegate she even obtained a warm letter of introduction so that she might call upon him immediately since she was already dressed in the best clothes she had and incidentally the warmest she bought herself a little luncheon from a street peddlersomething she had become used to lately by early afternoon she was at the front door of the home of morgan applegate mp it was opened by a short extremely plump butler who took her letter of introduction he showed her into a morning room with a roaring fire that gleamed red and gold on the polished furniture and in the copper globes that decorated the handsome fender it was a full quarter hour before morgan applegate himself appeared he was a most agreeablelooking man of average height with an aquiline face that yet managed to look mild in spite of a very obvious intelligence his fairish hair was receding and he was cleanshaven he greeted hester courteously invited her to sit then asked what he might do to be of assistance to her she told him of her visit to the excavations the previous day without mentioning suttons name or occupation he stopped her in midsentence i am aware of this problem mrs monk her heart sank the fear of typhoid was everywhere and the queen was in the grip of a desperate almost uncontrollable grief since prince albert s death from typhoid if applegate was a man of any ambition he would not risk his career by stating an opinion that must be bound to anger and offend many mr applegate she said earnestly i do understand the very immediate need for new and adequate sewers i nursed men dying of typhoid in the crimea and it is something i could never forget or take lightly but if you had seen the dangers mrs monkhe interrupted her again leaning forward a little in the chair he had taken opposite heri am aware of the matter because it was drawn to my attention by someone else someone even more disturbed by the possibility of disaster than you are she gave her whole time and attention to it and i fear perhaps even her sanity his face was very grave and there was an acute consciousness of pain in his eyes my wife was very fond of her and i held her in high regard myself held hester said with a chill what happened to her now there was no mistaking his distress of that i am not certain i was informed only of the merest details and since they are unclear i prefer not to repeat them it is no slight upon you mrs monk it is a respect for the dead she was a young woman of great courage a kind of high daring in spite of personal loss and forfeit of much chance of happiness she placed honor first and it seems to have exacted from her a terrible price please do not press me to say more but it was impossible for hester to leave it she was the equal of anyone on earth for compassion and had the fire and courage to make it of practical use but she had never excelled in tact she was too fierce and too impatient if she placed honor first then it is all the more urgent that we should follow her she said intently how can you wish to say nothing of her are you not proud of her do we not all owe her something now he seemed embarrassed and very clearly uncertain how to answer mrs monk there are some tragedies that that should remain unexplained i can think of no better word please she saw the great crevasse in the ground in her minds eye again and her stomach turned at the thought of its collapse she imagined how it would be for the men at the bottom possibly even seeing it begin to bulge and give way knowing what would happen and yet unable to do anything but watch they would see the water explode through carrying earth and timber with it to crash down on top of them bruising breaking burying them in the filth and darkness she could not keep silent mr applegate there is no time for the niceties of feeling if she saw what i did today and understood what could happen to these men almost certainly will happen one day sooner or laterwould this woman really wish you to respect her delicacy now she is dead think of their lives of those who still have a chance if we act if we achieve what she began is not the greatest compliment to her the greatest service that we take up her cause he was looking at her with profound indecision in his eyes he was a kind man torn by conflicting principles of overwhelming power hester realized she was leaning forward as if to physically touch him reluctantly she sat back not in apology but because it might be a bad strategy and certainly bad manners without explanation applegate stood up excuse me he said huskily and left the room hester was crushed she had liked the man instinctively and it seemed she had driven him to the point where he had found her so oppressive he had actually retreated from her presence as if not knowing how else to deal with her was she really so insensitive was she dragging out the memory of a woman he had perhaps loved and treating it with unbearable disrespect how ugly and how stupid she did not know what to do next then the door opened and a woman came in she was tall perhaps even an inch or so taller than hester and equally slender she had a most unusual face it was handsome in its own way but far more than for the beauty it was remarkable for its great readiness for the enjoyment of life the woman was immediately followed by applegate himself who introduced her to hester as his wife then by way of explanation added we were both fond of mary but my wife the more so before i break confidence i felt i should consult her opinion how do you do mrs monk rose applegate said warmly then she glanced at her husband nice of you to consult me but quite unnecessary she invited hester to resume her seat since she had naturally stood up when mrs applegate came in rose sat opposite leaving her husband to sit where he would mary died a couple of days ago and we are all very distressed about it and angry i dont believe for an instant it was as simple as they say she wouldnt do it she just wouldnt my dear applegate began she did not exactly say hush to him but almost it was apparent that he was devoted to her and that she was sufficiently confident in that devotion not to defer to him when she felt passionately suddenly hester had a flash of understanding mary havilland she said quickly are you speaking of mary havilland it would make perfect sense with the little that monk had told her of the death on the river morgan applegate and rose looked at each other then at hester rose was now pale her hazel eyes troubled the news has spread so widely already she asked softly applegate reached over to put his hand on her arm it was an extraordinarily protective gesture as gentle as if he touched some wound no hester answered lowering her own voice aware now that she was dealing with real and present pain i know of it only because my husband is in the river police and was the one who actually saw it happen rose gave an involuntary gasp and applegates hand tightened slightly on her arm hester could see in their eyes that they wanted to ask more but dared not afraid of the finality of the answer he isnt sure what happened hester told them it wasnt possible to see from that distance and of course they were looking upwards she knew why monk was so reluctant to believe it but she could not tell these people of her own loss she had thought the pain of it was healed safe as long as it was not touched she had not tried to remember her fathers face for a long time perhaps not since she had learned to believe that monk loved her enough to let go of his own fears my husband is trying to find out precisely what happened she added rose blinked you mean it might not be taken as suicide there was a flare of hope in her eyes she would never have killed herself id stake anything on that rose applegate began she shook him off impatiently without taking her eyes from hesters if you had known mary i wouldnt have to tell you that she had far too much courage to give up she simply wouldnt she was too too angry to let them get away with it hester saw applegate wince but was beginning to appreciate already that he had no control over his wifes passion if rose was outspoken that was part of her nature and part of what he loved in her angry with whom hester asked circumstances or people the big stink was appalling we cant allow it to happen again and the typhoid was even worse some of the soldiers died of typhoid in the crimea i wouldnt wish it on satan himself oh i know we must build the new sewers rose agreed but mary was sure that some of the machines were being used without regard to safety people are so determined to be faster than their competitors that they are ignoring the rules and sooner or later the navvies are going to pay the price you know about the collapse of the fleet sewer of course you do it was in all the newspapers that will be nothing compared to what could happen if rose you dont know that applegate interrupted her at last mary believed it and she may have been right but she shes still right rose corrected him but she had no proof he finished exactly rose said as if that sealed her point she stared at hester she knew there was proof and she intended to get it she was certain she could does that sound to you like someone who would take her own life she leaned towards hester just as hester had done towards applegate unconscious of it impelled by her fervor she loved her father mrs monk they understood each other in a way few people do who are of different generations she had a strong clear mind and immense courage i dont know why people think women cant be like that its our skirts that stop us from running not our legs rose applegate expostulated you are not shocked are you rose asked hester with a flicker of anxiety hester wanted to laugh but it might hurt their feelings as if she did not take death seriously she did infinitely seriously but she knew that in the drowning suffocating horror of war or epidemic disease laughter however black was sometimes the only bulwark against defeator madness but one could not say so in a london withdrawing room or morning room or any part of the house at all no no she assured rose in fact i would like to remember it to say again there will be countless times when it will be appropriate would you like attribution or prefer i forget who said it first rose blinked but it was with pleasure as well as selfconsciousness i think it might be better for my husbands position if you forgot she replied reluctantly the house of commons is extremely robust in its opinions but then there are no ladies speaking and that makes all the difference her mouth pulled in an expression of wry distaste hester understood she had been freer to say what she thought on the fringes of the battlefield and had found the return to england painfully restrictive she went back again to the subject of mary havilland did you know her family she asked rose shrugged slightly i liked mary very much and it was difficult to do that and be more than civil to the rest of them they were at odds oh yes you see jennythat is her elder sister jenny argyllis completely devoted to her husband and children as she has to be an expression of both irritation and surrender crossed her face has to be hester asked quickly i have no children to depend upon me and a husband whom i would trust to the ends of the earth but few women are as fortunate as i am and jenny argyll is certainly not among them rose shrugged again i believe alan argyll is reasonable enough but if he has faults jenny may naturally prefer not to be more aware of them than she is obliged to be she will not appreciate her sister finding them for her since she cannot afford to address them when you are helpless ignorance is a great comfort and mary did that hester asked either his faults were very grave indeed or she was very insensitive a darker picture was forming at the back of her mind i dont know rose admitted of course when we love someone we dont always exercise the best sense when warning them of what we perceive to be a danger i do know that mary broke off her own betrothal to toby argyll alans younger brother she was candid about it to me candid hester pressed uncertain what rose meant you mean she told you why she broke it off was it something she learned of him she would rather not have known but it could not be avoided now was that what oh no rose said quickly you mean did she learn that toby had some part in her fathers death and she couldnt bear it is that what you are thinking yes hester admitted it might be enough to break ones spirit even that of someone very strong not mary rose had no doubt in her voice at all she was sitting upright in the chair now back straight she wasnt in love with toby not really in love where her world would be plunged into darkness without him she liked him well enough she thought his was probably the best offer she would get after all how many of us really fall headlong in love with someone we can marry she smiled as she said it her hands relaxed in her lap and hester knew that she was not including herself when she spoke most women make an acceptable bargain rose continued and mary was realistic enough to do that but believe me breaking it off did not cast her into despair she lowered her voice confidentially in fact i think that part of it was no small relief to her she could refuse him with an easy conscience no one would expect her to marry so soon after her fathers death poor soul my dear you should not repeat that applegate warned i shant she promised apparently she felt that telling hester was a matter of honor a debt to mary she had no intention of neglecting she did not take her own life mrs monk nor did she believe that her father had done so for him it would have been not only a sin against the church but far worse than thata sin against himself and if it was true for him then it must be true for her i dont know what happened but i will do anything and everything i can to help you find out any information i can find any door i can open you have but to tell me perhaps we can still effect the reform she was working on and save the lives of at least some of the men who would be killed if there were further accidents in the construction thank you hester said warmly i will call on you the moment i have a clearer idea of what to do she turned to applegate what information was mary havilland going to bring you what do you need to know before you can act proof that the safety rules are not being kept he replied and i am afraid that proof will be very hard to find engineers will say that they have surveyed the ground and the old rivers and streams as well as is possible men who work with the machines are accustomed to danger and know that a degree of it is part of life just as men who go to sea or down into the mines live with danger and loss without complaining so do navvies they would consider it cowardly to refuse or to show selfpity and would despise any man who did more than that they know they would lose their jobs because for every man who says he will not there are a dozen others to take his place and lose arms or legs or be crushed to death rose demanded surely she stopped looking to hester for support hester remained silent what applegate said was true there were tens of thousands like the collards proud angry stubborn desperate she stood up thank you mr applegate i will do all i can to find the proof mary havilland was looking for as soon as i have something i shall return or if we can help rose added thank you for coming mrs monk no monk said firmly when she told him that evening ill pursue it until i find what happened to both mary havilland and her father theres going to be a disaster if nothing is done william she argued urgently do you expect me to sit by and let that happen she made no reference to giving up portpool lane but it hung unsaid between them they were standing in the kitchen the dishes cleared away and the kettle pouring steam into the air as hester prepared to make the tea hester mary havilland may have been murdered to prevent her doing precisely that monk said angrily for the love of heaven isnt that what youve just been telling me of course i can see it she retorted as she yanked the kettle off the hob are you going to stop your investigation am i no of course not whats that got to do with it it has everything to do with it she answered raising her voice to match his you can risk your life every day but if i want to do something i believe in suddenly im not allowed to that is completely different you are a woman i know how to protect myself he said as if it were a fact beyond dispute you dont she drew in a deep breath you pompous she began then stopped afraid she would say too much and let all her frustration and loss pour through she would never be able to retract it because he would know it was true she forced herself to smile at him instead thank you for being afraid for me its really very kind of you but quite unnecessary i shall be discreet for a moment she thought he was going to lose his temper entirely instead he started to laugh and then laughed harder and harder until he was gasping for breath it is not all that funny she said waspishly yes it is he replied wiping his eyes with the back of his hand youve never been discreet a day in your life he took her by the shoulders quite gently but with thorough strength that she could not escape and you are not going to pursue mary havillands path finding proof that any of the construction machines are being used dangerously she said nothing but when she turned her attention back to the tea she realized that the kettle was almost empty it had boiled nearly dry she would have to refill it and begin again william she said gently im afraid the tea will have to wait a little ill bring it through to you when its ready if you like if he wanted to think that was any kind of admission of defeat or of obedience this was not the time to point out to him that it was nothing of the sort thank you that is a good idea he turned and went back into the sitting room really she said under her breath but glad it was over for the moment and she could be alone to gain control of her feelings again four monk was in the stern of the ferry next morning as it made its way across the choppy waters waves were slapping the sides of the small boat and the damp raw wind stung the skin freezing the cheeks and arms the boatman needed not only his strength but his skill to keep from catching crabs with the oar blades and drenching them both at least the wind had driven the fog away and the long strings of barges were going downriver on the tide carrying goods from the pool of london to everyplace on earth he had spoken to hester last night as if he was afraid for her safety and indeed that was his concern he did not want to prevent her from doing what she believed was right but when she became involved in a cause she lost all sense of proportion more than once it had endangered her he looked at the choppy water dark turgid and filthy perhaps if he could remember all his youth his other experiences of women of love he would be more realistic but he remembered nothing and he wanted hester as she was naive rash stubborn vulnerable passionate opinionated loyal sometimes foolish always honesttoo honestnever mean of spirit and never ever a coward but he wanted her alive and if she did not have the sense to protect herself then he must do it for her he would find out what happened to mary havilland and to her father because hester would despise him if he did not how had she felt seven years ago over her own fathers suicide he had only just met her then and they had scraped each other raw to begin with she had found him cold and arrogant perhaps he had been but he had also been bewildered by the unknown world around him because of his memory loss increasingly aware he was disliked it was hesters strength and courage that had constantly buoyed him had she felt guilty that she was not in england and at home when her parents both so desperately needed her was that at least in part why she was determined now to fight for mary havilland and through her for her father he had not even thought of that before they were at the wapping shore he paid the ferryman climbed the steps up into the harsher wind and strode over to the door it was warm inside but it took several minutes before the heat thawed his numb flesh it made his hands tingle as the blood circulated again and he was aware of the men putting on heavy overcoats and then caps as they went out to begin the next patrol he spoke to them briefly listening to the report of the nights events a couple of robberies and several fights one ending in a knifing the victim had died but they had the man who had done it and apparently it was the culmination of a long feud anyone else involved he asked clacton gave him a sideways look eloquent of contempt and monk realized his mistake he was treating clacton as an equal as he would orme clacton was spoiling for a fight inching around and around to find a weakness to jab monk held his temper with an effort a man who loses his temper at a subordinates rudeness isnt fit to command no one must manipulate him nor must he be seen to need ormes help he was alone orme wanted him to succeed clacton wanted him to fail for none of them would he ever take durban s place he did not mind that he must make his own place and none of them could admire durban more than he did for it was monk who understood what he had done better than they and who carried a far greater burden of guilt for it he would not correct himself and rephrase the question he must retrieve the station another way he turned to butterworth mr clacton seems unwilling to reveal their names friends of his perhaps or informants perhaps you can be more enlightening clacton moved his mouth to protest then looked at monks face and decided better of it yes sir butterworth said barely concealing his smile no one else injured sir far as we know no witnesses admittin but we know oo they worked for it was more likely personal been grumblin on for a couple o months since a scrap downriver a bit drink an bad temper most like do you expect any revenge monk asked no sir but well keep an eye good anything else he dealt with a few other details and then the men went out butterworth with a grin clacton scowling the other two noncommittal monk found orme in one of the small offices he closed the door as orme looked up from the ledger he was writing in mornin sir he said regarding monk solemnly got the doctors reports on miss avilland and mr argyll nothin we dint know about ceptin for sure she couldntve bin with child she was just like she shouldve bin no man ad touched or there was a deep sadness in his eyes theyre gonna bury er this mornin er sister dint even ask the church to elp let alone give er a place i spose she knows it dint do no good for er pa poor soul monk sat down at the other side of the small wooden table suddenly he felt sick it was no use raging against the blindness the arrogance to judge or the lack of human pity that had ruled mary unfit for a decent burial none of it would do any good thank you he said quietly where on the land outside st marys church on princes road its just opposite the lambeth workouse he added nothing but his voice was thick and he lowered his eyes thank you monk repeated eleven oclock orme added youll ave time ter see mr farnham an then go no i wontnot if i go tell the butler and superintendent runcorn orme looked at him gravely please tell mr farnham ill see him when i return yes sir would that be superintendent runcorn o the metropolitan police yes he was the one who investigated james havillands death he told him what runcorn had said and about the superintendents clear sadness over marys death as well including his reluctance to believe it was suicide but there werent no doubt er father killed isself orme said quietly his round blue eyes held no hope that monk could be wrong but he did not hide his disappointment couldnt find any monk admitted except that she didnt believe it she was certain that he was a fighter and would never have given up ormes mouth tightened well she wouldnt easy think er own pa were the kind ter shoot isself would she it was not a question mebbe she eld out as long as she could and when somethin turned it fer er so she couldnt kid erself any longer that was what broke er poor creature poor little soul at the time did you think she jumped monk asked orme blinked funny way ter go over backwards like but she was strugglin wi young argyll you mean was e tryin to stop er or ter make sure as she went why cos she turned im down thats a bit he spread his hands not able to find the right word no monk said because she was looking for the proof of danger that she thought her father was on the brink of finding whyd they do that seems daft nobdy wants a cavein orme pointed out costs a fortune to repair an argyll stands out as a man oo likes his pennies every one of em you think so yes mr monk i do i done a bit of askin about im just cos o that poor girl does very well fer isself mr argyll but all proper and careful you found nothing ugly no an i looked he did not need to explain why yer gonna go on a bit longer sir a bit monk forced himself to trust orme hoping he was not going to regret it later orme might even prefer not to know the reason monk was going to continue keeping the distance between them might be more comfortable but monk disregarded it my wife was approached by someone concerned about the chances of a really bad cavein orme did not need to know about hesters involvement with the clinic at portpool lane or that the friend was a ratcatcher he took her to see one of the big tunnels very deep the man knew all the underground rivers and wells and hes afraid the tunnelers are going too fast orme was watching him with anxiety now his attention complete she promised to help if she could monk went on she found the member of parliament chiefly concerned and went to see him he ignored ormes amazement it seems mary havilland had been there already and had impressed both him and his wife most favorably they were distressed about her death and keen to do all they can to assist in reform if anyone can find proof that there is a real danger well well orme sat back in his chair so she was really doin summink his face filled with a sudden pity so sharp he became conscious of it he blinked and turned away as if needing to shelter himself from monks eyes im going to pursue it at least another day or two monk said tersely see if i can find out exactly what havilland was looking at and what he found i need to know if it was real or just his own fear of being closed in orme nodded mr farnham isnt going to like it he warned e likes ter be tellin us what ter do an theres plenty o theft same as always all this diggin o new sewers an tunnels is makin folks restive so many navvies arounds makin it arder ter move stolen goods too the fat mans one o the biggest fencers o the good stuffjewelry gold ivory silks an the like es unappy with so much comin an goin i know jus sayin orme replied thank you theft is important but murder if it is murder is more so orme gave a little downward smile e wont say its murder an its the people oore stole from oo run the river thats where the money is youre a wise man monk conceded remind me of that again in a day or two meantime its dead women like mary havilland to whom we owe justice as well monk took a hansom to the burial and picked up both runcorn and cardman they rode in silence to the church they were early but it seemed appropriate to stand on the short strip of withered grass and wait three men united in anger and grief for a woman one had known all her life one only the last two months of it and the third not at all they stood stiff in the icy wind each in his thoughts oblivious of the traffic or the bulk of the workhouse black against a leaden sky the gravediggers had done their job the earth gaped open the small cortege was led by the minister whose unsmiling countenance was like the face of doom followed by jenny argyll in unrelieved black and so heavily veiled her face was invisible monk knew her only because it could be no one else with alan argyll although she took no notice of him at all nor he of her they looked as isolated as if the other were not there was argyll thinking only of his dead brother the bitterness in his face suggested it there was no service nothing said of the hope of resurrection it was without mercy the wind whipped the mens coattails and the ice it carried stung the bare skin of their cheeks making them red in contrast with white lips and hollow eyes monk looked once each at runcorn and cardman then did not intrude further on their bereavement monk turned to the minister and wondered what manner of god he believed in whether he did this willingly or under protest because he had a wire and children to feed monk was overwhelmingly grateful that his own faith was not hostage to financial need his own or anyone elses he should pity the man his bondage and yet there were no questions in the ministers face it was over almost before monk realized it without a word the cortege departed in silence runcorn cardman and monk left in opposite directions suicide monks superior said brusquely when monk went into his office early in the afternoon for gods sake man she jumped right in front of you and took with her the poor devil who was trying to save her dont make it even worse for the family by drawing it out farnham was a big man broadshouldered and heavybellied his longnosed face could break into a sudden smile and there were those who spoke of certain acts of kindness but monk felt uneasy in his presence as if never certain he would be true to the best in himself farnham had sought authority and won it and now he wore it with intense pleasure arguments of belief or intuition would only be mocked anything monk put forward would be seen as enlightened selfinterest for the river police it probably is suicide sir he agreed aloud but i think we should make certain farnhams eyebrows rose he had trusted durban and known where he was with him or at least he had assumed he did he resented the fact that now he had to learn the strengths and weaknesses of a new man he was sufficiently aware of what had really happened not to hold monk accountable for durban s death but monk had survived and farnham blamed him for that not much is ever sure in police work monk he said sourly thought you would have known that the criticism was implicit monk swallowed his impatience not about what happened on the bridge sir im thinking of what she was investigating to do with the sewer tunnels and their construction not our concern farnham snapped thats the metropolitan police the distaste with which he said that was exactly what monk had expected had already seen in him in the few weeks he had been here it was part of what farnham disliked in monk himself and the fact that he had been dismissed from the metropolitan police was conversely a point in his favor yes sir monk agreed with difficulty but if there is something and it causes a real disaster and we knew about it or at least had a chance to find out do you think theyll see it that way farnhams eyes narrowed you can have a couple of days he warned if you find something worth pursuing then give it to them on paper and keep a record of it here understood yes sir monk thanked him and left before farnham could change his mind or add any further restrictions he began by learning as much as he could about the vast network of new and old sewers and how they interconnected it was an immense complex intended to take the ocean of waste from london s three million people eastwards away from the city and its present egress into the river and instead process it through large purification works closer to the sea then the surplus water could be released comparatively clean and the solid waste otherwise disposed of it was a brilliant feat of engineering costing a kings ransom of money but for the capital of the empire and the seat of government for a quarter of the world it was absolutely necessary it took more time to find the exact place of the argyll company in it and he was surprised how large it was it must have cost a considerable effort and influence to obtain it and no doubt would not be easily forfeited they had three sites close to one another two were cutandcover like the crevasse that hester had described but one was too deep for that method they were actually tunneling burrowing like rabbits under the ground scraping out the earth and rock and carrying it back to the entrance to get rid of it the necessity for this was created not only by the depth but also by the fact that other rivers and gas lines crossed above it in several places and could have collapsed had they been exposed by the more open method he searched but could find no adequate map that charted all of london s old wells springs and submerged rivers or the old gutters drains and waterways that had altered over the course of the centuries clay slipped some earth absorbed water some rejected it some old drains dating back to the roman occupation had survived some had been broken or had caved in and the land had subsided diverting them deeper or sideways the earth was a living thing changing with time and usage no wonder sutton whose father had been a tosher and knew all the waterways large and small was now frightened by the vast steam engines that shook the ground and by the knowledge that men were digging shoveling and moving earth disturbing what was settled monk was circumspect about mentioning the havillands name but he would not learn anything further of use if he did not it gave him a wry halfsour pleasure that it was far easier now than in his independent days because he could use the power of the river police to ask for what he wanted he was cramped by rules hemmed in and robbed of freedom by the necessity of answering both upwards to farnham and in a sense downwards to orme and the other men he could not lead if he could not inspire men to follow him the mere holding of office could force obedience for a while but it could not earn the respect or the loyalty that were what mattered he would not replace durban anywhere except in the records on paper he made detailed enquiries of clerks at the construction offices regarding old maps earlier excavations waterways the nature of soil graveyards and plague pitsanything that might affect new tunneling he was told of james havillands investigations and miss mary havilland he insisted did she explain her involvement werent you curious that a young woman should know anything about such matters or care yes i was the clerk agreed thats ow come i remember as e were er father she told me an e were dead she were doin what she could ter finish is work e worked fer one o the big companies argyll company she told you that no i know that meself not that i knew im like but i seed im on the works once or twice dint look well sort o pale an sweatin mind i seen men like that when they as ter go down deep scared o bein closed in an o the rats an the water he shuddered dont like em much meself monk pressed it a little further noting down the details then thanked the clerk and left the rest of the day yielded nothing new mary havilland had followed in the footsteps of her father in half a dozen places obviously havilland had believed that the steam engines were dangerous but had he learned anything that proved it monk turned it over in his mind as he walked back along the dockside towards the station it was dark and there was a fine rain the smell of the tide was harsh but he was becoming used to it even the constant slurping of the water against the embankment and on the steps down to the ferryboats and barges assumed a kind of familiar rhythm the foghorns were booming again because the rain blinded vision lights loomed out of the darkness before there was time to change course he wondered about scuff where was he on a night like this had he eaten he had shelter monk knew that but had he any warmth then he remembered that the chief booty of mudlarks was coal very often the lightermen would deliberately knock pieces off their barges into the shallow water for the small boys to get perhaps he had a fire the riverside was full of children scraping by the best they couldlike the rest of the city it was irrational to worry about one he forced his mind back to the case had havilland found anything to make it necessary for someone to kill him it seemed unlikely what could it be argylls had had no serious accidents but havilland had been an engineer himself and he knew exactly what their huge machines were capable of what safeguards were taken and that alan argyll of all people would not want injuries or time lost an unforeseen incident might kill dozens of men but it would ruin the company so what had havilland imagined had he really learned something so dangerous he had been murdered to hide it and then mary had followed in his footsteps and found it also and in turn been murdered or was havilland simply a man who had lost his mental balance become obsessed and imagined danger where there was none were the diverted streams and the threat of slippage an excuse rather than a reason in order to close that tunnel and avoid ever going down there again was it even possible he had some kind of a grudge against the argylls personally mary devoted to him had believed his view and then when she had finally been forced by the evidence to face the truth had she been unable to bear it only for her it was worse first her father s error his suicide her own broken betrothal to toby argyll then an estrangement from her sister the shame of her false accusations and nothing to look forward to in the future not even financial security had toby told her some truth so bitter it had broken her at last could she even have lashed out at him because of it hester would be hurt to know that he winced and shuddered in the cold as he thought of having to tell her perhaps tomorrow or the day after the next day he decided to go directly to the deepest tunnel again using his authority to oblige them to allow him in it was a vast hive of labormen wheeling digging hacking and shoring up the entrance where load after load of earth clay stones and shale came out in wagons each cart was hauled up the fortyfoot cliff face to the level above the tunnel itself was like the entrance to a mine high enough for a man to walk in but it would be far less when the brickwork was laid it would become a hollow tube with occasional holes for storm drains to empty ironringed ladders would lead up to the street and daylight so sewer men could go down and clean out any blockages that would impede the flow a huge steam engine pounded shuddering the ground drawing the chain that pulled up the loads of debris and carried them away to a pile where they were emptied it hissed and belched steam and the noise of it caused the men to shout to each other within twenty or thirty yards of it the stokers shoveled more coal into the furnace then returned to hauling and tipping monk showed his police identification grudgingly they gave him access to the bottom down a steep cutting but no one went with him he found himself slipping and losing his balance several times only just avoiding falling into the wet clay beneath him several times he banged against the loosely timbered sides once at the bottom he could walk more easily on the boards laid on the rubble and clay the swill of dirty water seeped from the sides and gathered in puddles trickling slightly down towards the tunnel mouth he looked upwards quickly how deep was he he felt a flutter of panic the walls towered up to a narrow strip of sky and the movement of clouds across it made him reel he was sharply aware of the smell of it all around himwet earthy moldy as if nothing was ever dry and the wind never cleansed it he faced the dark hole ahead of him with a reluctance that startled him he had never before felt such a crowding sense of being enclosed he had to force himself to keep walking and try to dull his imagination the shadow closed over him the winter daylight did not penetrate far beyond a few yards it was lit by covered gaslight a naked flame could ignite the fumes in the air he had heard of mine explosions and men buried forever in collapsed shafts could that possibly happen here no of course not this was one straight tunnel which was going to be bricked around held with steel sewers did not collapse the noise of hammering and shoveling was ahead of him he kept on walking the water slopping underneath the boards where were the nearest rivers did anybody even know for certain how much did the rivers secretly change course because of subsidence the great engines above the ground shaking the earth compressing it down or rattling it loose he was sweating and his heart was pounding in his chest he was still walking at exactly the same speed along the boards the steadiness of his pace gave him an illusion of being in control at least of himself dripping water seemed to be everywhere a sheen on the walls in the gaslight a rat appeared from nowhere making him start it ran along beside him for a dozen yards then the shadows swallowed it up ahead there were brighter lights shouts and the noise of pick blades striking with a sharp clang against rock and a dull thud against clay he saw it a machine like a huge drum almost the size of the tunnel itself the power of it thrumming as if it were the heartbeat of the earth there were at least twenty men laboring at one task or another and not one of them looked up or took the slightest notice of monk the air was stale and cold and had a strange taste to it a man trundled past him with a barrow load of debris another rat shot out of the shadows and then back in again the sides of the tunnel beyond the last of the boards gleamed wet and here and there were dribbles of water running down to the sodden earth if the diggers broke into a small underground stream it would gush in here like an open tap except there would be no way of turning it off he must not allow himself to think of that or he might panic he could feel the sweat on his body now he strode forward and deliberately drew the attention of the bestdressed man present one of the only two wearing jacketspresumably they supervised rather than performed the labor themselves the man was broadshouldered and already spreading a little at the waist although he looked no more than in his middle forties his features were regular even handsome except that his mouth was a trifle large his hair was dark with a heavy wave and he had a thick dark mustache when he turned to face monk his eyes were blue yes he said with surprise he spoke loudly but that was necessary to be heard above the din of the machine and the crushing and grinding of earth and falling stones monk river police monk replied i need to talk to the man in charge here thats me aston sixsmith the man told him what is it mr monk monk waved his arm to indicate that they should go back towards the entrance away from the noise and he had to concentrate deliberately in order not to turn immediately and walk ahead he began to feel far more sympathy for james havilland than he had even an hour ago he could understand any man who felt oppressed by these walls the darkness and above all the close stale air on his face and in his lungs sixsmith walked in front of him and stopped a hundred feet away from the digging well mr monk what can i do for you he looked curious you said river police we havent any trouble here and i havent taken on any new men in the last month or so are you looking for someone id try the thames tunnel if i were you theres a whole world down there some people live pretty well all their lives underground this time of the year its drier than up above but i imagine you know that yes i do monk replied although the world of the thames tunnel was one he had not yet had time to explore the river itself kept him constantly alert always learning finding the vast gaps in his knowledge and little stupid mistakes made out of ignorance his face was hot with the memory of the times orme had rescued him albeit always discreetly he could not go on like that im not looking for a man he faced sixsmith squarely meeting the clear blue eyes i believe you used to work with james havilland sixsmiths expression darkened with a sudden sadness his face was more mobile more easily marked with emotion than monk had expected he looked not unlike the navvies himself and blended with them easily but his voice both in tone and in diction placed him as far different a man of more gentleness and considerable education whether formally acquired or not yes poor man he replied in the end the tunnels got to him his eyes searched monks and monk had the distinct feeling that his own fear was sensed if not seen what can you tell me about him monk asked was he a good engineer excellent if a little oldfashioned sixsmith answered he wanted new ideas tested more thoroughly than i think was necessary but he was a sound man and i know no one who didnt both like and respect him i certainly did you said the tunnels got to him monk continued what did you mean he was glad when they started to move towards the entrance again even if it was to a crevasse rather than the level ground sixsmith sighed and moved his hands in a slight gesture of regret despite the dirt on them both the power and the grace were visible some men cant stand closedin places he explained youve got to have a special kind of nerve to work underground he hadnt oh he tried his best but you could see him losing control he sighed and pulled his wide mouth tight i attempted to persuade him to stay up top but he wouldnt listen pride i suppose was there anything in particular he was afraid of monk asked as innocently as he could sixsmith looked at him carefully his gaze was very direct and it was impossible to miss the intelligence in his eyes i suppose theres no point in trying to conceal it now he said resignedly the poor mans dead and the world knows his weaknesses yes he was afraid of a stream bursting through and sending the whole side caving in if that happened of course men would be buried alive or drowned he became obsessed with the idea of lost underground navvies just waiting to find a way in almost like an evil presence he looked at monk defensively its not insane mr monk not entirely its just the exaggeration of something realfear taken beyond reason so to speak tunnel engineering is a dangerous business men died in building the thames tunnel you know crushed gassed all sorts of things its a hard profession and its not for everyone but you liked him personally monk was shivering in spite of his heavy coat he clenched his teeth trying to hide it yes i did sixsmith said without hesitation he was a good man he pushed his hands in his pockets he walked easily even casually did you know miss mary havilland monk pursued a shadow of exasperation crossed sixsmiths expressive face yes i did not well she took her fathers death very hard im afraid she was a bit less wellbalanced than he was or her sister mrs argyll very emotional monk found himself resenting sixsmith which was unreasonable he had never known mary havilland in life and sixsmith had he must remember that her likenesses to hester were superficialmatters of circumstance not nature and yet her face had looked so gentle and so sane emotional certainly but her passions were those of a strong woman not the fancies and indulgences of a weak one it was difficult for him to speak of her death to this man who saw her so differently he hesitated looking for the words he wanted even for an instant forgetting how far ahead the light still lay sixsmith was there before him is that why you are here you said river police she died in the river didnt she he pursed his lips im deeply sorry about that and young toby too what a terrible tragedy he was looking at monk intently now are you assuming that she killed herself because of her father you are almost certainly right she couldnt accept the truth fought against it all the way poor soul he shrugged slightly maybe i would have if it had been my father its hard to face something like that about your own family monk swung to face him but there was nothing but a crumpled pity in sixsmiths face everyone was very sorry for her sixsmith went on turned a deaf ear to her questions and accusations hoped shed grow out of it but it doesnt seem to have helped perhaps she finally saw the truth and it was too much for her monk looked into his powerful sad face and felt the weight of his conviction and pity thank you ill come back if there seems anything further he held out his hand sixsmith grasped it with a sudden smile so warm it entirely changed him they could have been friends met again after a long separation do come back he said letting monks hand go any help i can be in spite of what sixsmith had said monk still went to check one more time on james havillands suicide even as he rode in a hansom along the embankment he was aware that farnham would have expected him to attend to the urgent crime on the river which was his job but he knew orme would deal with all the regular accidents and the crimes he realized ruefully that orme did that much of the time anyway he was teaching monk more than he was learning from him mary havilland and toby argyll had died in the river had she really believed that he and his brother were responsible for her fathers death if so then perhaps she had taken toby with her over the edge intentionally as alan argyll had implied in the shock of his loss if that was so then it was murder monk decided to spend one more day seeking to lay to rest the doubts that swirled around in his mind then he would have to tell hester the truth however sad or brutal it was last time at the havilland house he had spoken only to cardman who was intensely loyal perhaps if he spoke to a different servant someone who had been there less time and would very shortly be seeking another place anyway he would hear a different story it was a gray day with sleet on the wind he was glad to reach the house again and be permitted into the kitchen where he was offered a hot cup of tea and some madeira cake the reason for such hospitality was quickly revealed yer police the law the cook asked him offering a second piece of cake he accepted as it was excellent yes he agreed with his mouth full an upwards lift in his voice to encourage her to continue can yer tell us whats goin to appen ter us mr monk mr argylls too upset oer the death of is brother ter take up any business matters an mrs argyll must be broke to pieces about poor miss mary its just that we dont know our position like me and mr cardmanll stay as long as were needed but we ave ter tell some o the maids an the footmen it int always that easy ter find a good place an comin from a tragedy like this dont elp he looked at her plump anxious face her fair hair was graying pulled back into a loose knot she was trying hard not to sound callous but one suicide in the house was damaging enough two could make domestic reemployment far harder than held any justice the fear was in her eyes i dont know mrs plimpton but i will find out and see that you are informed as soon as possible we are not sure yet how miss havilland came to fall into the river he stopped seeing the wordless emotion in her face it would take great delicacy to draw from her what she really believed she might not even have put it into words herself or mr toby argyll he added watching her he saw the flicker of angera flashand then she hid it again she was a woman whose position in life had never allowed her to leave her feelings uncontrolled he read the dislike of toby that she dared not tell him thank yer sir she replied he needed more i imagine you knew miss havilland a long time since she was born mrs plimpton replied her voice thick with grief monk tried a different approach was she extremely fond of mr argyll no she said abruptly then realized she had been too forthright i mean i mean o course she liked im but it were she as broke it orff not im she gulped mr monk she would never ave taken er own life if yerd ave known er yer wouldnt even think on it she were that determined to prove as poor mr avilland were killed not took isself an she were on the edge o doin it at excited she were she stopped sniffing and turning away if she didnt take her own life mrs plimpton what do you think happened he asked he said it gently letting her know he took her opinion seriously she looked back her eyes were redrimmed and puffy her nose pink i think she found out oo sent that letter to er father lurin im inter the stable ter be shot she said defiantly the masterd never ave shot isself any moren shed go jumpin off bridges she took a deep breath an dont yer go sittin there eatin my cake an tellin me as they would he was startled no one else had spoken of a letter what letter mrs plimpton he said quietly controlling the urgency in his voice with an effort letter as come ter im the night e died she answered mr cardman didnt mention it cos e didnt know she replied reasonably automatically refilling his cup from the big brown teapot it came ter the back door an lettie took it to im we didnt find it after so i spose e didnt keep it but it was right after that that e told mr cardman as ed decided ter sit up an no one was ter bother waitin fer im ed lock up isself it were somebody as was goin ter meet im id set me life on it she drew in her breath in a little gasp as if realizing suddenly that she was right havilland had done just that and lost his life you are quite sure course i am she was shaking now but her eyes did not waver may i speak to lettie monk asked yer think im makin it up she accused him her face pinched her breathing heavy no i dont he assured her if i did there would be no point in my speaking to lettie would there i want to see what she remembers of it paper ink handwriting id like to know if she saw mr havilland open it and how he reacted was he surprised afraid alarmed or excited even pleased was he expecting it or not oh yes well she could not bring herself to apologize but she pushed the cake plate across the table to him well ill send for lettie she walked to the door and called the kitchen maid to fetch the housemaid lettie appeared and answered his questions she was about fifteen and stood in front of him twisting her fingers in her apron she could not read and had no idea about the paper or the writing but she remembered quite clearly that mr havilland was both surprised and disturbed by the letter after reading it he had put it straight into the fire and then told her to send cardman to him he had written no reply have you any idea whom the letter was from he asked no sir i aint what did he say as clearly as you can remember ter send mr cardman straightaway sir thats all yes sir have you ever seen the handwriting before i dunno sir i dint never look monk thanked her and mrs plimpton he left the house through the scullery door and the tradesmans yard heading past the coal and coke sheds and up the area steps into the bitter wind slicing down the street who had written to havilland disturbing him so much was it to arrange a meeting in the stables that evening or something completely different certainly havilland had dismissed the servants immediately after receiving it and apparently decided not to retire as normal it would even explain his presence in the stables but whom would he meet in such a place on a winter night rather than in his house where it was warm and dry but presumably less private why would he need such extraordinary privacy was his own study not sufficiently discreet with the servants in bed and presumably mary also had he taken the gun in order to protect himself expecting an attack why from whom perhaps mary havilland had been right if so then certainly she also would have been killed deliberately and it could have been only by toby argyll it was now impossible to turn his back on the chance that mr havilland had found some real danger in the tunnels and been murdered to silence him before he could ruin the argylls business by making it public but the visitor had then taken the gun from him and shot him with it a man younger and stronger more ruthless and with the element of surprise havilland was frightened but he had come essentially to talk the other man had come intending to kill alan argyll and was that what mary learned and why toby argyll had killed her too he bent forward into the wind feeling the ice in it sting his face he began to walk a little faster five when monk arrived home that evening hester could see that he was in some mental turmoil he was shivering from the river crossing and he concentrated on warming at least his hands and feet before he even attempted to say anything beyond a greeting he ate the bowl of soup she brought him and gradually he stopped shaking she wondered yet again if they would have been wiser to have found a house on the northern bank of the thames even if the area was less to their liking when she had gone to portpool lane she had taken the omnibus westwards and over whichever of the bridges was appropriate but since they were directly opposite wapping it made sense for monk to cross by ferry and be at the police station in fifteen minutes or so sometimes the patrol boat picked him up directly from the steps but the cold was intense and on a night like this with its drifting sleet she wished profoundly he did not have to be on the open water she sat opposite him looking at the red glow of the fire on his face the soup bowl in his hands and wondered if it had been a good idea for him to join a regular force again she had offered to apply for a regular nursing job at one of the big hospitals even though nursing in those circumstances was actually almost nothing to do with the care of patients one was rather more like a domestic servant in circumstances where a usual household maid would refuse to go she had tried it before their marriage and it had made her full of zeal to reform the practice of hospital nursing after her experience in the crimea she had failed spectacularly very nearly incurring legal action against herself for insubordination and worse but still she would have swallowed her pride and applied again if it would have helped monk had refused outright now she looked at him relaxing at last in the chair opposite her and worried that he was finding the obedience to authority harder than he had expected and the restrictions and demands of leadership too cramping to both his nature and his abilities she was trying to think of the words to ask him when he spoke sixsmith whos in charge of the practical side of the tunneling is certain that havilland committed suicide when he couldnt cope with the claustrophobia of working underground he said watching her face she felt herself tighten ready to argue but kept her temper waiting for what else he would say he smiled slightly just an easing of the tiredness in him i went back to the havilland house and spoke to the cook and one of the maids he went on they said havilland received a note that night handdelivered to the back door as soon as he read it he burnt it and then told the butler to go to bed and he would lock up himself he was going to meet someone in the stable she said instantly sitting upright and staring at him whom he looked rueful they had no idea the envelope had only his name on it the cook saw it briefly and the maid who carried it doesnt read well who could it be she said eagerly at last there was something to grasp hold of she felt a surge of hope which was absurd it should not matter to her so much she had never known mary havilland she might not have liked her in the least if she had she was remembering her own grief the feeling of having been bruised all over stunned by confusion when she had first stood on the dockside at scutari and read the letter from her brother telling her of her fathers suicide and then her mothers death from what was termed a broken heart she could not help imagining mary havilland feeling the same searing pain except that hester had believed it and mary had not had mary been wrong making it harder for herself and for her sister by refusing to accept the inevitable who could it be she repeated monk was watching her his eyes soft with knowledge of her pain i dont know except that since he immediately made arrangements to meet the person it must have been either someone he knew or at the least someone he was not surprised to hear from nor did he seem to need to answer it so whoever it was knew he would come you must find out she said unhesitatingly it was unreasonable and she knew it as she spoke but he did not argue was that for her or was the anger at his loss the sense of incompleteness still raw inside him too or worse was it the challenge that he must be perfect at his new job equal to his own vision of what durban would have done william she started i know he smiled do you she asked doubtfully his eyes were gentle amused yes however in the morning hester set out on her own path towards learning what she hoped would be both more about mary havilland and something to further the cause in which she had promised to help sutton first she called at the clinic in portpool lane to complete the books and ledgers and pass them to margaret thats complete and up to date she said when shed finished suddenly finding it difficult to hide her emotion she was going to miss the work the struggles and victories and most of all the people the sense of loss was even worse than she had expected margaret was looking at her aware for the first time that there was something new and harsh still unsaid what is it hester her voice was so gentle it brought hester to the edge of tears how much could she say that it was monk and not she who was forcing this decision i have agreed to stay at home for a while she began williams new job is different she swallowed hard youre managing very well now claudine is excellent and bessie i could never raise money as you do margaret looked stunned a while how long a while she bit her lip you mean always dont you i think so margaret stepped forward and put her arms around hester hugging her tightly she did not say anything it was as if she understood perhaps knowing monk and remembering last year she did hester did not want to say goodbye to bessie and the others girls especially claudine but it would have been cowardly not to she promised to call in occasionally and she would keep her word monk could not object to that she left into the cold sharp morning again not as confident or light of foot as she had come that was foolish even vain she must shake herself out of it she arrived at the applegates house still a little early for the most civil calls especially to someone she barely knew however she had been in the morning room only a matter of minutes when rose applegate came sweeping in she was dressed extremely elegantly as if she was expecting important company hesters heart sank perhaps roses original enthusiasm was more an intention of kindness than a real desire to become involved and hester had misread it because she wanted to certainly roses highnecked gown with its gorgeous lace collar and tiny velvet bows on the skirt was uptotheminute fashion by comparison she herself was dowdy she was acutely aware of the social gulf between them it seemed at the moment an uncrossable abyss good morning mrs monk rose greeted her her curious face alight with pleasure has there been news is there something we can do then she looked a trifle selfconscious im sorry that is most discourteous of me how are you it was not customary to offer refreshment of any kind at this hour and it seemed rose observed the proprieties exactly the room was formal the maid had been immaculate in starched cap and apron the hall was already polished and swept hester had smelled the pleasant damp aroma of wet tea leaves scattered and taken up to collect the dust and of lavender and beeswax to shine the wood good morning mrs applegate she replied no im afraid there is little fresh so far she had nothing to lose by telling the truth it was probably all lost anyway my husband learned a bit more about mr havillands anxieties but if marys father found out anything precise we do not know what it was according to mr sixsmith who is in charge he had something of an obsession about enclosed spaces and finally became quite irrational about it mr sixsmith said that was what finally unhinged his reason and brought about his death rose was clearly startled good heavens she sat down rather suddenly disregarding the crumpling of her skirt and motioned for hester to sit also that sounds so terribly reasonable doesnt it but its not true hester recounted what monk had told her the previous eveningat least regarding the cooks opinion of mary though not yet about the letter that is the mary i know rose agreed quickly she leaned forward she was not a sentimental sort of person mrs monk she was very practical and quite able to stand up to a truth she did not wish to hear if it was indeed the truth i dont know where to begin but if you have any idea at all please let us do something to establish her innocence innocence of having killed herself rose said quickly the emotion now clear in her face her eyes very bright as though on the brink of tears and if the account is truegod forgive meinnocent of having taken toby argyll with her that is a terrible thing to think of anyone and i refuse to let it be said by default because it would be easier for us all to pretend it was over hester was suddenly heartened what are the alternatives she asked what did happen how can we demonstrate it so it cannot be denied oh dear rose sat bolt upright i see what you mean if it was not suicide then it was an accident or it was murder that is a very dreadful thought it seems to me to be inescapable hester pointed out the door opened and morgan applegate came in his eyes went immediately to his wife then to hester he was polite and to judge from the expression on his face pleased to see her however there was something faintly protective in the way he went to rose and remained standing by her chair as if without even giving it a thought he would make certain hester did not somehow distress or disturb her how are you mrs monk he said agreeably has there been progress so soon rose swung around to look at him in essence there has morgan she replied we came facetoface with irrefutable logic and we must go forward actually mr monk allowed the possibility of accident but i do not two such accidentsit is absurd either mr havilland and mary both took their own lives or toby argyll tried to kill mary and fell in himself rose he started to say his face now heavy with concern oh its inescapable she said brushing aside his interruption and turned again to hester the question is who killed mary and it must be whoever killed james havilland your logic is at fault my dear applegate said gently but his voice was quite firm according to the police there was no one involved in poor marys death apart from toby argyll and he poor man went off the bridge with her if he was responsible then he has already paid the ultimate price rose looked at him patiently you have missed the point morgan i am not concerned with trying to have someone pay i wish to clear mary of the sin of suicide and of tobys death also if any might suppose she meant to pull him over and i want to vindicate her father as well which is what she wanted above all things but he started and possibly even more important she went on as if he had not spoken i want to show that they were both right in their fear of some terrible accident so that we can still prevent it so you see we are anything but finished is that not so mrs monk she turned her steady bright gaze on hester rose applegate said exasperatedly you are placing mrs monk in an impossible position please you must not embarrass her i am not embarrassed hester lied quickly but if i were it could hardly matter we are speaking of other peoples deaths and of the possible deaths and mutilation of scores of men even hundreds if there should be a major cavein or a flood you see rose said with finality we must do everything we can and we shall begin by learning whatever it was that mary already knew applegate looked at hester with some desperation you seem to have an understanding of logic mrs monk either you are right or you are mistaken in this if you are mistaken there is no point in pursuing it and you may damage the reputations of good men who have already suffered deeply in the loss of those they loved i speak in particular of alan argyll he spread his hands but if you are right then he has been the cause of havillands death and now of marys and his own brothers albeit he did not intend the latter surely you must see that in that case he is a most dangerous man and will not hesitate to harm you if he has the chance and please do not be rash enough to suppose you can outwit him he turned to his wife touching her shoulder and for you my dear i am afraid i forbid you to endanger yourself in this way he smileda sweet gentle gesture that lit his face making his emotions unmistakable or in any other way roses eyebrows shot up good gracious what on earth do you imagine i am going to do go down a sewer and accuse some engineer of carelessness or perhaps visit mr argyll in his mourning and tell him i think he is a murderer really morgan credit me with a little sense mrs monk is primarily concerned with the safety of navvies and that is a very right and proper thing for a member of parliaments wife to care about as wellespecially the wife of the member who is most involved with this work she rose to her feet and stood facing him very patiently i shall be sociable and charitable mrs monk does great work for the poor and has served with miss nightingale nursing soldiers who more appropriate to take with me when considering the injured he looked bewildered she had robbed him of argument and yet he was obviously unhappy hester wondered why he was still quite clearly afraid for her i promise you we shall not behave inappropriately hester said to him wishing to make him feel less apprehensive but also knowing that without roses knowledge of alan argyll and of what mary had already discussed she had little chance of success there was something applegate wished to say and yet obviously he felt restrained he looked at rose again please be careful of course i shall be careful she said with the very slightest edge of irritation i am merely going to visit some of the men who have been injured in the past and to whom mary might have spoken she looked at hester what could we take them that would be useful and not condescending honesty hester replied she took a deep breath and perhaps a less fashionable gown oh rose blushed glancing down at her beautiful dress yes of course this is quite inappropriate isnt it will you excuse me for fifteen minutes im sure i can find something better morgan please dont spend the time trying to persuade mrs monk that i am not suitable for this task it would be humiliating for me i like her and i wish to impress her as competent she gave him a dazzling smile and kissed his cheek thank you my dear hester mastered her expression with difficulty reaching very quickly for a handkerchief and coughing into it to hide her smile morgan applegate blinked also but he did not say anything after rose had changed hester suggested that although it would take a little longer and definitely be a great deal less comfortable it would be wiser if they were to travel by public omnibus rather than in roses carriage the day was viciously cold with intermittent sleet and snow piling in dirty drifts at the edges of gutters and walls and causing the drains to overflow so everything was wet underfoot of course rose agreed her face reflecting momentary distaste i shall appreciate my carriage more next time i suppose then she realized that hester almost certainly did not have a carriage im sorry she said a tide of color washing up her cheeks hester laughed i had a carriage before i went to the crimea she told her before the war my family had very comfortable means you lost it in the war they were walking briskly down the street towards the omnibus stop my father did hester replied as they passed two women going in the opposite direction he was cheated out of it by a man who made a fortune doing that he was an exarmy officer invalided out a hero so people trusted him there was a quick sympathy in roses face but she did not interrupt my father took his own life hester found it difficult to say even so many years after but there was no question about it he felt it was the only honorable way to act in the circumstances my mother died shortly afterwards oh rose stopped still in the street ignoring the spray of icy water from a passing carriage how unbearable for you one has to bear it hester replied taking roses arm and moving her away from the edge of the curb doing something helps a great deal the days pass and it gets better do you think that was what mary havilland was doing they started to walk again nono i dont think so rose said gravely she was too excited she grieved terribly for her father of course but she really believed she was going to prove his innocencei mean of oh it was a wail of horror at herself she was aghast at her own clumsiness in piling one pain on top of another hester was forced to smile there was a ridiculous humor to it in spite of the tragedy i never thought my father acted dishonorably she said truthfully in his mind he was paying the price for his error what happened to the soldier who he was murdered very violently by someone else he had robbed hester answered then changed the subject what was mary like please tell me the truth not what kindness dictates because she is dead rose thought for a long time in fact until they reached the omnibus stop and stood side by side waiting i liked her she began which means that my opinion is probably not accurate she was brave in her opinions and in fighting for what she cared about but she was afraid of certain kinds of failure i think we all are hester agreed there are things we can afford to lose and things we know we cant and still stay whole at heart rose looked at her then lowered her glance i think mary was afraid of being alone but also of marrying someone she did not love and she did not love toby i am not certain if in the end she even liked him she preferred the safety of being a good daughter she did that superbly and she thought there was no risk in it hester added exactly rose met her eyes again but she never thought of her own danger in defending her father i think her courage may have cost her her life you think toby meant her to go over the bridge i know the argyll brothers only socially weve met maybe a dozen times in the last few months but anyone could see they were very close toby was clever and ambitious alan was proud of him but alan was a success already very much he is quite wealthy and well regarded so my husband says she frowned actually his companys record of safety is excellent better than that of many other companies if mary found anything untoward then she must have been either very lucky or extraordinarily clever the omnibus arrived and they climbed onboard awkwardly struggling to hold wet skirts out of the way they did not continue talking until they had found seats and the horses moved off again then it wont be easy hester observed i cannot help assuming that mary was unusually intelligent and of a very practical turn of mind yes absolutely rose agreed in fact she was a little unfeminine in her grasp of logic mathematics and such things as engineering at least she was told so and i think she believed it did she care yes she was a little selfconscious rose admitted she was defensive about it so i suppose that means she did but that is the thingthe week or so before she died she was more fully herself than ever before she had realized that she had her fathers gift for engineering and was happy with it her face was very earnest mrs monk she really was not going to kill herself even if she had discovered her father to be mistaken hester hated having to say it but it would be not only dishonest but destructive of all they hoped to do for themselves and for others to conceal it now i believe so rose said without hesitation the omnibus reached the end of the line they dismounted and walked briskly around the corner to the stop for the next one which would take them as far as the hospital where most injured men would have been taken after the collapse of the fleet sewer on this journey they discussed tactics and decided that rose should begin the conversation as the wife of a member of parliament but when it came to medical details then she would ask questions as hester prompted her it was a long time since hester had been inside such an institution but it was exactly as she remembered in the long hallway she smelled again the forced cleanliness masking the odors of sickness alcohol coal dust and blood almost immediately she saw junior doctors excited selfconscious walking with a mixture of arrogance and terror that betrayed the fact that they were on the verge of actually practicing surgery cutting into human flesh to healor kill she found herself smiling at her own innocence in the past imagining she could change everything except for a few individual people here and there it took them half an hour to gain access to the appropriate person rose was magnificent standing a little behind her hester could see her hands knotted with tension and she already knew rose well enough to be very aware of how much she cared however much she might lie with candid and superb ease at least on the surface how kind of you dr lamb she said charmingly when they were in the chief surveyors office my husband wished me to learn a few facts so that he will not be caught out if asked questions in the house lamb was a middleaged man with a quiff of sandygray hair and rimless eyeglasses and not quite as tall as rose so he was obliged to look up at her of course miss mrs applegate what is it the honorable gentleman wishes to know its really fairly simple rose replied still standing in front of his desk thus obliging him to remain on his feet also it is a matter of the nature and frequency of serious injuries to men involved in the work on the new sewer system absolutely vital lamb said earnestly the state of public hygiene in the city of london is a disgrace to the empire anyone would think we were the edge of the world not the center of it rose drew in her breath then let it out again you are quite right she agreed diplomatically quite right it is so very important that we must be absolutely certain that we are correct in all we say to mislead the house is an unpardonable sin you know yes yes he nodded pushing his eyeglasses up to the bridge of his nose what is it you wish from me mrs applegate i am sure figures are already known from the companies concerned rose and hester had already decided on the answer to that naturally but they have a powerful interest in the number of injuries being as low as possible and there is the world of difference between an engineers estimate of an injury and a surgeons of course please be seated mrs applegate and miss mrs he waved at hester without looking at her we would like specifics rose continued sitting upright with a ramrodstiff back and smiling at him descriptions of actual injuries and the names of the men concerned so that it is apparent that we have investigated the matter more than superficially lamb looked uncomfortable rose waited with an air of expectancy eyes wide her mouth in a half smile ready to beam upon him if he should do as she wished as full a list as possible she added so we do not seem to be singling out any particular company that would not do reluctantly lamb reached into his waistcoat pocket and took out a small key he rose opened a file cabinet and from one of the drawers took out a folder of papers he returned to the desk and read from them selectively i cannot see what use this will be in the house of commons he said finally he had described accidents and injuries in the blandest terms using laymens words making them seem slighter than they were rose might not know that he was being evasive but hester did she spoke for the first time there was an albert vincent his right leg was crushed when a load overturned on him breaking his femur i think you said in two places that is correct he agreed frowning at her puzzled as to why she had spoken at all he had assumed her to be there merely as chaperone or perhaps a maid of some sort you did not mention the treatment given him was that because he died died he looked appalled why ever should you think that mrs mrs monk she supplied because from the description the load have torn the femoral artery which would have meant he bled to death in a matter of minutes if there had been anyone there on the scene to amputate the limb and rescue him surely it would have been mentioned he was clearly flustered the details are not there young lady and i hardly think it is something about which you would have any knowledge even if you can read a little and bandy words around as if you understood them oh she does rose said with a sweet smile mrs monk was in the crimea with miss nightingale she is acquainted with battlefield surgery in the most distressing circumstances you didnt say so he accused the color now hot in his face that is if i may be candid most deceiving of you is it rose said ingenuously im so sorry i had imagined you would say exactly the same to whomever you spoke to had she been of a delicate disposition and likely to faint i would not have brought her of course but that is quite different i cannot imagine what you would have said differently had you known mrs monk is very practiced in such tragic and terrible things he glared at her but apparently could think of nothing to escape from the pit he had unwittingly dug for himself i shall just make a few notes so that we cannot find ourselves mistaken it would be dreadful to quote figures that are not true and embarrassing rose continued keeping her smile fixed she looked straight at him his face was tightlipped but he did not argue outside on the steps with the wind tugging at their skirts victory seemed already fading rose turned to hester now what do we do we have addresses hester replied we find a cup of tea or better chocolate if we can then we go and see some of these people and find out which of them if any mary havilland asked also fortified by a cup each of thick rich cocoa and a ham sandwich bought from a peddler then hot chestnuts a hundred yards farther on they set out to the nearest of the addresses the early afternoon turned colder the sleet changed into intermittent snow but still the street was too wet for it to stick except on the windowsills and lower eaves of course the roofs were white except for around the chimneys where the heat melted the snow and sent it in dribbles down the slates cab horses looked miserable peddlers shivered the wind flurried scattering newspapers and gray smoke hung in the air like shadows of the night to come at the first house the woman refused to allow them in at the second there was no answer at the third the woman was busy with three children the oldest of whom looked barely five hester glanced at rose and saw the pity in her eyes however rose masked it before the woman could recognize its nature i int got time ter talk to yer the woman said bitterly wot dyer think i am i got washin ter do wot int never gonna dry in this weather an summink ter find fer tea wots a member o parliament ter me i int got no vote nors any o me famly we int never ad an ouse wots ours let alone big enough ter let us vote anyway me mans crippled she started to push the door closed pushing the small girl behind her and moving her skirts awkwardly we dont want your vote hester said quickly we just want to talk to you ill help im good at laundry the woman looked her up and down disbelief growing into anger at being mocked i ear yer misses ladies oo talk like you all proper don know a scrubbin brush from an airbrush she pushed the door again hester pushed it back im a nurse and i keep a clinic for street women in portpool lane she remembered too late that it was no longer true ill wager you a good dinner ive done more dirty washing than you have she added the womans hand went slack with surprise allowing the door to swing open and rose took full advantage of it inside the house was bare and cold with the sort of poverty that teeters on the edge of starvation hester heard rose draw in her breath then very carefully let it out silently while she tried to compose her face as if she saw such things every day it was like the collards again only worse this man was sickly pale his eyes hollow and defeated he had been crushed from the waist but his legs were still there deformed andfrom the way he lay and the pinching around his moutha constant agony patiently and with trembling gentleness rose tried to elicit facts from him and he refused no one was to blame it was an accident could have happened to anyone no there was nothing wrong with the machines what was the matter with them that they could not understand that he had told the others the same hester half listened as she started on the laundry with lye soap and water that was almost cold the physical misery of it did nothing to assuage her sense of guilt even as she did it she knew that was ridiculous her hour or two of discomfort would be pointless but the biting cold on her skin pleased her and the drag on her shoulders when she heaved the wet sheets out and tried to wring them by hand at the clinic at least they had a mangle it was the fourth house after that before they learned anything further mary havilland had been there also you are certain hester said to the handsome weary woman busy sewing shirts all the time she was talking to them her fingers never stopped she barely needed to look at what she was doing course i am don forget summink like a young lady an she were a lady comin an askin about sewers an drains an water wot runs under the ground knowed about it too she didengines too knew one from another rose stiffened glancing at hester then back at the woman she knew about underground streams hester asked trying to keep the urgency out of her voice summink the woman replied queer though she shook her head she wanted ter know more i said me pad bin a tosher afore e got took an she wanted ter know if i still knew any toshers now or gangers i tol er me bruvver were a tosher but i int seen im in years she asked me is name now wotd a nice young lady like that wanna find a tosher fer to learn more about hidden streams rose suggested the womans eyes opened wide wot fer yer don think one o thems gonna break through do yer did she say that no course she dint dyer think id be sittin ere wi a needle in me and if she ad me sisters usbands down there diggin she made no reference to her own husband onearmed who was out somewhere in the streets trying to earn a living running errands for people is this wot yer on about wot appened to er anyway why are yer ere hester debated only for an instant she fell off westminster bridge and drowned we are concerned it may not have been an accident we need to know what she learned nothin from ere thatd get her topped i swear that on me muvvers grave they stayed another ten minutes but the woman could add nothing outside it was dark and the snow was beginning to accumulate even though it was only shortly after six do you suppose she went looking for toshers rose said unhappily what for to tell her where the underground streams were surely argyll would have done all that he cant want a disasterit would ruin him most of all i dont know hester admitted beginning to walk towards the omnibus stop moving was better than standing still it doesnt make any sense and she must have known that but she learned something what could it be other than that they are somehow using the machines dangerously in order to be the fastest and therefore get the best contracts are argylls machines different from other peoples we need to find out could they be more dangerous rose stopped shuddering with cold it seems they work fasterso maybe they are what can we do these men wont tell us anythingthey darent there was anguish in her cry i dont know hester answered all we can do is find out what happened to mary maybe if she found proof of some sorti mean something that would have shut down the works until the machines were made safe even if it were slowerwhom would she have told morgan rose said straightaway she didnt she never came back they started walking again as it was too cold to stand perhaps she wasnt certain hester suggested if it was almost complete perhaps lacking one point they reached the bus stop and stood side by side moving their weight from one foot to the other to prevent themselves from freezing toby hester pressed she might have told him rose shook her head she didnt trust him he and alan were very close toby worked in the company yes she said he was very ambitious and at least as clever as alan with engineering at any rate perhaps not as good at handling men and as quick in business half an idea flashed into hesters mind but it dissolved before she grasped hold of it so he would understand the machines oh yes so others said roses eyes widened you mean she might have been been deliberately playing him drawing information from him to get her final proof mightnt she hester asked would she have had the courage to do that rose did not hesitate yesby heaven she would and he was playing her to see how much she knew but it was too much he had to kill her because in the end his loyalty was to his brother and to his own ambition hester retorted she saw lights along the road and prayed it was the omnibus at last her teeth were chattering with the cold how will we ever know rose said desperately i absolutely refuse to let them get away with it whatever it costs the omnibus stopped and they climbed on being obliged to stand jammed between tired workmen and women with bags of shopping followed by exhausted children with loud voices and sticky hands at the changeover to the second omnibus rose gave a wry blisteringly honest smile as she climbed onto the next platform and inside i shall never be rude to a coachman again she whispered fiercely i shall never insult the cook outrage the maids or argue with the butler and above all i shall never let the fire go out even if i have to carry the coal in myself hester swallowed a laugh that was a little on the edge of hysteria what are we going to do rose demanded hesters mind raced struggling between the practical and the safe safety won at least for rose you are going to see what chances there are of passing some kind of law to help the injured mary might have thought of that it was probably why she approached mr applegate in the first place ill attempt to locate the toshers mary spoke to and see what they told her if anyone knows where the old sunken rivers are or if anything s changed course itll be them be careful rose warned i will hester assured her but she did not tell monk anything other than that she had visited some of those injured in past caveins and other machine accidents she certainly did not reveal her plans and she lost no time in composing a brief letter to sutton telling him of her need to learn more from the toshers who knew the old system best only after she had sent it did she realize that she had no idea whether sutton could read or not he did all his business in cash perhaps even the best houses did not wish a bill or a receipt from a ratcatcher she waited all day for an answer busying herself with chores cleaning up after the plasterer sutton came just after dark at about half past four yer sure he asked carefully studying her face in the kitchen gaslight he sipped a steaming cup of tea and had accepted a piece of fruitcake he was scrupulous to give snoot a tiny portion just so he felt included it probably amounted to no more than a couple of raisins snoot took them delicately and licked his chops waiting hopefully for more thats yer lot sutton told him shaking his head then turned back to hester well if yer sure yer really want ter know wots appened someone asll tell yer the truth wed best go under the thames tunnel an find some o the folks wots not still opin fer work or got loyalties to them as is he looked her up and down anxiously but yer cant come like that if i take yer with me yer gotta look like yer belong if i bring yer the clothes can yer come as me lad wot im teachin she was taken aback for a moment amusement replaced by the sudden jar of reality yes she said soberly of course i can ill tie my hair back and put a cap on it was an unreasonably displeasing thought that with a change of attire she could be taken for a ratcatchers apprentice and yet had she been more buxomly built with a rounder more womanly face then she would not have been able to go at all then she thought of the faces of the women she had seen yesterday worn out and old long before their time color and softness taken from them suddenly selfregard seemed not only ridiculous but disgusting ill be ready she said firmly what time shall we begin ill come ere he said still uncertain of himself at breakfast well start early not as it makes much difference under the ground she knew he had been going to say river but stopped himself at the last moment in case the thought should be too much for her especially since they had been talking of caveins floods and gas ill be here she said with a smile catching his eye and seeing the answering humor in it and a flicker of admiration that pleased her quite unreasonably he nodded and rose to his feet by the next morning the clothes that sutton provided had been laundered they were still shabby and badly patched however hester found them more comfortable than she had expected it was an oddly naked feeling to have no skirts even on the battlefield she had been used to the nuisance of skirts around her legs making striding difficult especially in wind or rain trousers were marvelous even if she did feel indecent scraping her hair back into a knot and clipping it tight so it appeared short was not difficult but it was certainly unflattering but there was no help for it a flat cap on her head covered most of it anyway even down over her ears sutton had been thoughtful enough to provide a thick woollen muffler that made her feel considerably warmer the coat which came almost to her knees was the last item apart from a pair of weatherbeaten and awkwardly fitting mens boots she left the room where she had changed and walked selfconsciously along the passage towards the staircase yer done wonders sutton said approvingly come on snoot we got business she explained to him as they walked what she and rose had learned about mary havilland thats funny he said considering it carefully were she lookin fer streams an the like or trying ter find out wot er pa knew if e knew summink ter kill im for but why fer streams int no secret leastways if they cross one an it makes a cavein the ole worlds gonna know it doesnt make any sense she agreed walking quickly in order to keep up with him theres something major in this that we dont know either that or somebody is very stupid they traveled by omnibus again until they reached the northern entrance at wapping hester was startled to see that the building in which it was situated was large and very handsome so much so that she felt as if she were entering the hall of some concert chamber she glanced sideways at sutton who bent and picked up snoot then solemnly carried him down the long circular steps to the level below where the tunnel itself opened onto something rather like a hallway with a dawning of amazement she realized that no vehicle could get out into the open air the only way up or down was the great stair sutton put snoot down and the little dog trotted obediently at his heels across the paved floor to the tunnel entrance because of the many windows there was plenty of light in this part but hester realized that as soon as they were any distance inside there would be only such light as was afforded by gas jets stay close to me sutton warned theres lots o folk down ere an most is armless enough but the livin is ard an people fight for a scrap o food or a yard o space so dont do nothin but look she kept pace with him obediently the light became dimmer as they progressed the air took on a hazy quality and she was acutely aware of the damp on her skin and the changed smell the ceiling was far higher than she had expected and after a few yards it was lost from sight giving a sensation of being closed in that was felt rather than seen she knew that only a little farther on above it was the teeming filthy water of the thames she refused to dwell on how the arch resisted the weight of earth and then the river itself not to mention the currents and the tides the air smelled stale and was bitterly cold but then one would hardly heat the tunnel with fires there was no possible ventilation here to create any sort of outlet to the open air would undermine the safety of the tunnel if it fell in they would be entombed here forever hester chided herself for the ridiculous thought if you were dead they buried you anyway so what difference would it make or perhaps dante was right death was not a ceasing to exist but an endless journey through hella pit like this full of strange halfheard noises whispers without words not human anymore all senses were distorted damp clung in the nose and on the skin there were gas jets on the walls and in the dusklike light she could see people moving like shadows most of them women they seemed to be buying and selling by touch as much as by sight in the flickering gloom as if it were one nightmare arcade of stalls a sort of hells market sound was heavy and unnatural a susurration of feet and skirts and snatches of voices dont stare sutton warned her under his breath yer ere ter catch rats not sightseein miss ester im sorry she apologized who are they all do they come down here every day most of em dont never go up he answered we might ave alf a mile ter go whom are we looking for they were keeping to the middle of the way but as her eyes became accustomed to the gloom she was more aware of alcoves to the side those hollows must be where people might eat and sleep andfrom the rank odor that now filled the airconduct other aspects of their lives it was a whole subterranean world always damp and yet without natural water she tried to ignore the scurrying of inhuman feet the rattle of claws or the pinpoint of red eyes in the shadows people oo live in one tunnel often know things about other tunnels sutton said in answer to her question everythin ere as to be fetched from somewhere else ill find yer a tosher oo knows the idden rivers as well as the ones on the maps an mebbe someone oo knows a navvy or two oos bin urt an int so quick to defend is old bosses jus leave the askin ter me right right she said only the single word keeping her voice low as if the shadows could remember her they continued deeper under the river where the silence was broken only by voices so low that they seemed wordless amid the scraping and the hiss of the gas jets every now and then there was the clang of metal on metal or the duller thud of wood as someone worked it was an eerie world where daylight was unknown sutton pressed on stopping now and then to greet someone by name ask a question make a wry bitter joke hester hated it there was no wind no plants no animals except rats and the occasional dog snoot trembled with excitement at the scent of so much prey looking up at sutton and waiting for the word that never came they had already spoken to five people and were nearly half a mile under the river when sutton found the man he most wanted in the yellow glare of the gas his face looked cast of metal it was scarred down one side his ear torn and his hair tufted where the scalp had been ripped away he was lean and his hands were gnarled and hugeknuckled with rheumatism alio sutton he said with surprise not enough rats fer yer in the palace then he grinned showing strong teeth alio blackie sutton replied i done such a good job theyre all gorn ow are yer stiff blackie replied with a shrug cant get arter em fast enough no more got elp ave yer he looked at hester curiously not much use yet sutton told him but ell do int built fer navvyin blackie looked at hester thoughtfully and she stared back at him refusing to lower her eyes blackie laughed it was a wheezy cheerful sound ope es clever then e int good fer much else eh hester wanted to respond but she remembered just in time that she could not mimic the accent she would have if she were really learning to be a ratcatcher nor could her voice sound like that of a boy of the height she was navvyin int so clever sutton shook his head too chancy these days railways are one thing tunnels is nother yer damn right blackie agreed sutton looked at him closely yer reckon one of ems goin ter cave in blackie thats wot theyre sayin blackie curled his lip making his lopsided face look less than human in the yellow light word is em stupid sods is gonna keep on cuttin till they cross a river an drown alf the poor devils wot are diggin there like a lot o bleedin moles hester drew in her breath to ask him to be more specific then gasped as sutton kicked her sharply she shut her mouth and bit her lip with pain to stop crying out oose works sutton asked casually i dont wanna get caught in it go down do yer blackie squinted at him bin known ter sutton acknowledged think itll be bracknell and is lot mebbe more like paterson s argyll blackie gave him a keen look you eard summink ave yer whispers they true they move fastern most but sixsmiths a canny bastard very careful e is but the engines wot e uses are big an stronger than most i reckon they done summink ter em made em better could slice through an old sewer wall an bring a cavein quick as spit hester was aching to ask for details but her leg was still smarting from where sutton had kicked her so i eard sutton agreed but i thought it were just daft talk o some girl er pa were scared o the dark or summink lost is nerve an shot isself they said mind she never believed it said someone else done im in blackies eyes narrowed and he leaned forward sharply id keep yer face shut about that if i was you sutton he said very quietly stick ter rattin eh its nice an safe an yer know wot yer doin dont go down no oles in the ground an don go askin no questions o course they ave safety rules an o course they don use em fastest one through gets the next contract easy as that better buried alive fer maybe than starved or froze fer sure he dropped his voice still further i owe yer sutton an i owed yer pa so ill tell yer for nothin stick ter rattin its clean an yer don upset no one but the rats theres things about tunnels as yer don want ter know an people in em sure as ells burnin yer don want as should know you one feller special so keep yer nose ter yerself got it sutton nodded mebbe yer right he conceded dont you go down no oles in the ground neither blackie if they bump inter a river accidental it int gonna care that yer a tosher an ave worked these ways all yer life itll come down there like a train faster than a man can run an pushin everythin in front o it i don go there no more blackie said with a twist of his mouth i know which ones is safe an which int but yer listen ter me sutton water gas fire an rats int all there is ter watch fer theres money in this so theres men asd commit murder keep out o it see go an take that lad there wi the eyes out of ere i dunno wot yer come fer but theres nothin ere fer you i reckon not sutton agreed taking hester by the arm holding her hard he turned and started back the way they had come they had gone a hundred yards before hester dared speak mary cant have come down here surely she asked a little shakily mebbe mebbe not but they know about er sutton replied she must ave asked a lot o questionsthe right ones by the sound o it but they wouldnt tell her anything she protested what harm could she have done that they killed her i dunno he admitted unhappily but if anyone killed er it musta bin toby argyll thing is oo told im ter i need to know she insisted otherwise how do we prove that she didnt kill herself i ave ter know too he agreed or ow do we stop em from goin on faster and faster till they bring the ole bleedin roof in an mebbe bury an undred men alive or worse n that set the gas alight an start nother great fire o london she said nothing she did not know the answer but it troubled her if mary had been right could she possibly have been the only one to see the danger surely her questions alone would have been sufficient to alarm other people was that what alan argyll had been concerned about not the actual situation but the fears and suspicion mary was stirring up was there ever cause to think it could have started a panic they dont seem afraid she said aloud they dont really think itll happen do they sutton looked at her afraid o wot he said gently think about it too ard an yerll be afraid o the ole o life bein urt bein ungry bein cold bein alone or yer mean bein drownded or buried alive dont think too far ahead just do terday is that what argyll counts on poor mary dunno he confessed but it dont make sense like it is she did not argue and they walked in companionable silence to the bus stop six monk was standing in the kitchen when he heard hester come in at the front door he spun around and strode into the hall he immediately saw how she was dressed and that her face was pinched and weary her hair was straggling as if she had tied it in a knot rather than bothered dressing it at all and her sleeves and trousers were wet where in hell have you been he said abruptly alarm making his voice sharper than he had meant he was very close to her almost touching her whats happened she did not even try to prevaricate ive been in the tunnels with sutton im perfectly all right but theres something terribly wrong there she said looking directly at him it isnt as easy as i thought the engines are enormous and theyre shaking the ground its nothing to do with what james havilland or mary discovered they all know its dangerous its part of the job her eyes were searching his face now looking for help explanations to make sense of it they all know about the fact that there are streams underground and wells and that the clay slips hundreds of people live down there but mary was going from one person to another asking questions what could she have been looking for and why did it matter monk forced himself to be gentle as he accompanied hester into the warmth of the kitchen he was not in the least domestic by nature but he had nonetheless cleaned out the stove and relit it with hesters absences in the clinic caring for the desperately ill and dying he had been obliged to learn he took her coat from her and hung it up on the peg where it could dry she made no attempt to be evasive which in itself alarmed him she must be very badly frightened he could see it in her eyes in the brightness of the kitchen gaslight where did you learn all this he asked the thames tunnel she answered not alone she added hastily i was perfectly safe involuntarily she shuddered her body in a spasm of uncontrollable memory she pushed a shaking hand through her hair william there are people who live down there all the time like rats they never come up to the wind or the light i know but its probably no more a root of crime than the waterside slums or the docks places like jacobs island he put his arms around her and held her close youre not setting up any clinic for them she laughed in spite of herself and ended up coughing i hadnt even thought of it but now that hester she smiled brightly at him he breathed out slowly forcing himself to be calmer then he put more water in the kettle and slid it onto the hob there was fresh bread and butter and cheese and a slice of decent cake in the pantry william he stopped and faced her waiting at last she spoke mary went to all sorts of places and asked questions about rivers and clay and how many people had been hurt but she asked about engineers as well and apparently she knew something about themknew one sort from another she took terrible risks either she didnt realize or her eyes suddenly filled with tears she was so tired her skin was white and in spite of his holding her she had not stopped shivering do you think she was foolish enough to be unaware of the dangers he asked no she said in a soft unhappy voice but she did not pull away from him i think she cared about the truth so passionately that she preferred to take the risk rather than run away i think she was afraid of a real disaster worse than the fleet because its in a tunnel fire she told him gas pipes go up into houses aboveground as well he understood the possibilities were terrifying and they know she nodded and moved back a step at last as the shivering eased it looks like it she just couldnt prove it yet or maybe she could do you think thats why she was killed it could be he said gently and it also might be why her father was killed so dont imagine they would give a moments thought as to whether or not they should kill you if they see you as a threat so i know that i have no intention of going back there again i promise he looked at her closely steadily and saw the fear in her eyes she would keep her word he did not need to ask her for a promise not only your life he said his voice softer the lives of others too i know what are you going to do make the tea he said ruefully then im going to consider who had the opportunity to kill james havilland as for marys deathwell never prove that toby meant to kill her and since he died as well the matter of justice has been rather well settled do you think she held on to him and took him with her on purpose she asked yes he said i think she could do that it isnt enough though is it he could never lie to her she could see right inside him whether she meant to or not no it doesnt make sense that alan argyll would take a risk like that it would ruin him theres something else that we dont know we havent got all of it she put her arms around him again holding him more tightly in the morning the situation seemed less clearcut if it had been toby argyll young and ambitious who was behind it all then he was beyond anyones reach now and blackening his name would be seen as pointlessly cruel alan argyll would do everything possible to prevent that and monk would earn for the river police a bitter enemy his proof would have to be absolute no one would care about rescuing the reputation of james havilland and even less about marys naturally farnham would see no purpose in it at all monks accountability to farnham was one of the prices to pay for the authority and regular income his uniform gave him he did not fear financial insecurity this winter as he had last thinking of ways to skirt around farnham s prejudices was a small enough price to pay he needed to know a lot more about both toby and alan argyll it was difficult to form an opinion of someone who was dead especially if he had died young and tragically no one liked to speak of such individuals except in hushed and careful tones as if death removed all weaknesses from them not to mention actual sins perhaps a good place to begin would be with those who had cared for the other dead people james and mary havilland this time he would see the housekeeper mrs kitching he might even ask cardman again and persuade him to be rather less stiffly discreet cardman greeted monk with courtesy he stood in the morning room to answer monks questions and if his mask slipped it was only to show a swift anger that mary havilland was regarded by the church as a sinner who by the finality of death had forfeited her chance of repentance monk felt helpless to reach out to the mans hard isolated grief cardman was intensely private perhaps it was his only armor monk had no wish to breach it instead he asked if he might see the housekeeper and was conducted along the corridor and after a brief enquiry shown into her room good morning mrs kitching he began hmph she replied her back straight as a ruler as she sat opposite him in her small neat sitting room she looked him up and down noting his police uniform jacketa sartorial burden he bore with difficulty and then his white shirt collar and beautiful leather boots police officer is it more of the officer and less of the police maybe and what is it youre wanting now ill not say ill of miss havilland so you can save your time ill go to my own grave saying she was a good woman and ill tell the good lord so to his face im investigating why she died and who was the cause of it mrs kitching id like to know a little more about the other people concerned in her life for example did you know mr toby argyll i imagine he called here to see her quite often especially after her fathers death and before she said quickly were they very close depends what you mean it was not a prevarication she wished to be exact her eyes were more direct than those of any servant he had questioned before at least as long as he could remember a thought flashed across his mind will you be looking for another position after this mrs kitching ive no need to ive saved a bit im going to live with my brother and his wife in dorking im just staying here till matters are settled he smiled she was exactly the witness he was looking for and so he returned to his earlier question what i mean mrs kitching was he in love with her and she with him she gave a little sigh she certainly wasnt in love with him but she started out liking him well enough he was very personable and he had wit and intelligence and how did he feel about her oh she was handsome miss mary she blinked and took a deep breath it was very clearly difficult for her to govern her distress she glared at him as if waking her grief were his fault thats what most gentlemen like until they know you a little better and then he kept his expression perfectly bland then theyd rather you didnt have too many opinions of your own she said tartly the tears standing out in her eyes the thought flashed to him that perhaps she was thinking not only of mary havilland but perhaps of some grief of her own now long in the past but still tender still haunting her with loss many cooks and housekeepers were given the honorary title of mrs even if they had never married it was a mark of adulthood rather than marriage just as when a man moves from being master to mister it was a distinction that had not occurred to him before but then women were not legal entities in the same way that men were again he found his sympathy for mary clouding his judgment he was imagining her as someone with courage honor and witsomeone he would have liked but it might not have been so at all in the beginning he had loathed hester no that was not truehe had been fascinated by her attracted to her but afraid of his own weakness he had been certain that he wanted someone far more comfortable a soft woman who did not challenge him did not force him to live up to the best in himself sometimes even beyond what he believed was in him hesters gentleness was deeper than mere agreeability it was a passion a tenderness of honesty not of indifference or lack of the courage or interest to argue never ever was it the lack of an opinion of her own before her he had fallen in love with quiet discreet women who never argued and then realized he was desperately soulachingly lonely nothing within them touched anything deeper than his skin what had happened to toby argyll had he had the courage to love mary or had he found her too challenging too thwarting of his vanity you say he did not like her opinions mrs kitching but was he in love with her for the first time in their interview her uncertainty was sharp in her face he smiled bleakly my wife and i frequently disagree yet she would be loyal to me and love me through anything good or bad i know this because she has done so without ever telling me i was right if she thought otherwise she stared at him shaking her head then you wouldnt have liked mr toby she said with conviction he expected obedience he had the money you see and ambitions and he was clever cleverer than his brother he said quickly i dont know but ive a fancy he was beginning to think so she suddenly realized how bold she was being in so speaking her mind a flash of alarm crossed her face then disappeared again she was tasting a new and previously unimagined freedom in spite of the gravity of their discussion monk found himself smiling at her cardman would have been horrified she was perhaps a year or two older than he monk wondered what the relationship had been between them superficial or had their station in life prevented what would have been a testing but rewarding love he thrust the notion from his mind mr alan argyll was different he asked and was mrs argyll at all like her sister mrs kitchings face hardened mr alans a very clever man a lot cleverer than mr toby realized she answered without hesitation mr toby might have thought hed get the upper hand in time but he wouldnt miss mary told me that not that i didnt think so myself just seeing them in the withdrawing room miss jennys a realist never was a dreamer like miss mary easier to get along with never asks for the impossible or fights battles she cant win been a good wife to mr alan i suppose mr toby thought miss maryd be the same well he thought wrong she said that last with considerable satisfaction then she remembered again that mary was dead the tears washed down her cheeks and this time she was unable to control them monk was embarrassed and angry with himself for being so why should he mrs kitchings was an honest grief there was nothing in it to apologize for he thanked her with deep sincerity and then excused himself by midday monk was back across the city at the construction works again this time he found aston sixsmith aboveground and able to speak more easily there was no point in asking him about mary he would be unlikely to know anything of use but he might know something of the relationship between the two brothers he would have to be far more circumspect here sixsmith would be loyal out of the need to guard his job even if not from personal regard was mr toby argyll aware of havillands fear of tunnels he asked they were standing on the bare clay at least a couple of hundred yards from the nearest machine and the noise of it seemed distant in the brief winter sun sixsmith pulled his wide mouth tight im afraid we all were if you were watching the man you couldnt miss it and to be honest mr monk its part of your job to look for the man wholl crack because hes a danger to everyone else especially if hes in charge of anything im sorry his highly expressive face was touched with sadness i liked havilland but likings got nothing to do with safety if hed gone barmy or started telling the men that there was a river going to break through the walls or chokedamp in the air or a cavein coming hed have started a panic god knows what could have happened he looked at monk questioningly to see if he understood monk understood completely a man of havillands seniority and experience losing his nerve would be enough to create hysteria that could bring about the precise disaster he was afraid of at the very least it would disrupt work perhaps for days and consequently the next project would be sure to go to a rival did you suspect it could be deliberate he asked sixsmith was momentarily puzzled deliberate weakness hed make himself unemployable anywhere else which would be stupid why would any man do that and he and both the argyll brothers were friends family in fact i meant sabotage for a suitable reward monk explained but it sounded ugly as he said it and he saw the revulsion in sixsmiths face from another company sixsmiths lips curled if youd known havilland you wouldnt even ask he might have hid his weaknesses and he might even have been something of a coward but he was absolutely honest hed never have sold out id lay my own life on that and believe me mr monk when you work with a man on things like thathe jabbed his thumb downwards towards the tunnels beneath themyou get to know who to trust and who not to get it wrong and you dont always live to talk about it so both of the argyll brothers must have known of havillands fears and that he was possibly a danger sixsmiths face tightened and he pushed his hands into the pockets of his jacket im afraid so and was mary a danger also sixsmith considered for a moment before answering not really she had very little idea of what she was talking about cant you call it an accidentmarys death i mean monk noticed that he had not mentioned tobys death both of them he asked mary and toby argyll too a flash of understanding lit sixsmiths eyes would have to be wouldnt it well if hers wasnt suicide then his wasnt either monk said reasonably the only alternative would be murder could he have meant to push her over she went over backwards hanging on to him sixsmith breathed out slowly trying to save herself or trying to pull him in with her you mean his face brightened changed her mind and trying to save herself there you are unfortunately she was too late already lost her balance and his too tragedy simple you didnt say but toby would never hurt her monk observed sixsmith looked at him very steadily and now his expression was unreadable didnt i no i suppose i didnt got to get back to work now mr monk cant afford delays costs money good day he walked away easily with a long swinging stride monk stood still for a moment sharply aware again of the cold and the noise of engines the next thing he needed to ascertain was the exact time james havilland had died or as near as the police surgeon could tell him what the devil for the surgeon demanded when monk found him in his consulting rooms he was a lean man with a harassed air as if constantly put upon and always trying to catch up with himself you come to me two months afterwards and ask me what time the poor man shot himself he glared at monk havent you anything better to do go and catch some thieves my neighbors house was broken into last week what about that metropolitan police monk replied not without pleasure im thames river police well poor havilland died of a gunshot the surgeon snapped not a drop of water anywhere near him even tap water never mind the damn river he glared at monk with triumph none of your business sir monk kept his temper with difficulty and only because he wanted the information his daughter believed he was murdered i know that the surgeon interrupted him the grief unhinged her a great shame but we dont have a cure for grief unless the priest has not my field her death was very definitely from drowning in the river monk went on i saw her go in myself and that could have been murder he saw the doctors startled look with satisfaction unfortunately the young man who may or may not have pushed her overbalanced and went in himself he continued both were dead when we pulled them out i need to investigate her accusation even if only to lay it to rest for both families sakes why the devil didnt you say so man the surgeon turned away and began to look through a stack of papers in a drawer behind him fool he muttered under his breath monk waited finally the man pulled out a couple of sheets with triumph and waved them in the air there you are very cold night lay on the stable floor warmer than outside colder than the house should say he died no later than two in the morning no earlier than ten but as i remember the household staff say they heard him up at eleven so that gives you something anything medical to prove he shot himself monk asked like what for gods sake thats police work gun was on the floor where it would have fallen if youre asking if he was shot at pointblank range then yeshe was doesnt prove he did it himself or that he didnt any sign of a struggle or didnt you look of course i looked the surgeon snapped and there was no struggle either he shot himself or whoever else shot him took him by surprise now go and bury the dead decently and leave me to get on with something that matters good day sir thank you monk said sarcastically its as well you deal with the dead your manner wouldnt do for the living good day sir and before the doctor could respond he turned on his heel and marched out it was already approaching four oclock and the winter dusk was closing in funny how the weather always became worse as the days began to lengthen after christmas it was snowing lightly in the street and within an hour or two it would start to accumulate he began to walk hands in his pockets shoulders hunched so there had definitely been no fight there was no evidence of a breakin and nothing had been stolen someone had sent havilland a note almost certainly requesting a meeting in the stable either that person had taken havilland by surprise and shot him making it look like suicide or havilland had shot himself presumably after the unknown party left if it was the former then the person had gone to some considerable trouble to make it look like suicide rather than a quarrel or a burglary interrupted why surely it would have been simple enough to make it seem as if havilland had seen or heard something and disturbed a thief that would not have implicated anyone so why the appearance of suicide the answer was glaringly obvious to shame him to discredit anything he might have been saying during the last few weeks of his life if that was the case then it had to be alan or toby argyllor both mary had known it had possibly been on the verge of finding proof and had paid for it with her life as well without realizing it monk had been walking towards the police station as if he had already made up his mind to go back why could it not have been anyone in charge of the case but runcorn any other police superintendent would have been easier at least he assumed it would he might have made many enemies and he was absolutely certain he had no friends he could call upon if there were any debts of kindness to be collected from the past he had forgotten them along with everything else the crimes he had solved as a private agent had not endeared him to the police he was still walking because it was too cold to stand still he increased his speed and five minutes later he was outside the police station ten minutes after that he was telling runcorn what he had found out and what he feared runcorn sat silently his face furrowed with thought im going ahead with it monk said then instantly wished he had not in one sentence he had excluded runcorn and made a challenge of it he saw runcorns body stiffen his shoulders hunch a little he must retrieve the mistake whatever it cost and quickly i think you will too he said swallowing hard now that you know about the letter well do more if we do it together that sounded like an offer and he meant it as one runcorn stared at him metropolitan police and river police his bluegray eyes were filled with amazement memory something that could almost have been hope monk felt the old guilt back like a wave they had been friends once watched each others backs in times of danger with an unquestioning trust it was he who had broken that trust not runcorn now runcorn must be wondering if this was just another trick runcorns face set hard if one of the argyllsor bothhad a man murdered to hide what he knew then ill see that justice is served he said grimly and i wont let that girl stay buried as a suicide if she was murdered right monk he rose to his feet well start again along the street where havilland lived i know neither of the argylls was havillands actual killer because they were both well accounted for i got that far on marys word toby was in wales a hundred miles away and alan was at a party on the other side of the city with a hundred witnesses his wifes word i wouldnt believe but twenty members of parliament i have to but whoever shot havilland must have been there maybe someone saw him heard him noticed something come on monk followed eagerly there was an element of recapturing the past in walking the dark bitter streets beside runcorn they moved from one place to another finding offduty hansom drivers huddled around a brazier or local police on the beat they separated to ask the questions and waste less time but still they learned nothing it was snowing again now big lazy flakes drifting out of the sky into the lamplight and settling feather light on the ground monk began to wonder more honestly what time had given runcorn in the years since they had started out as equals monk himself had been badly hurt lost his profession been to the edge of an abyss of fear of a selfknowledge unendurable even now at the last moment it was hester who had helped him prove to everyoneabove all to himselfthat he was not the man he dreaded he might be monk had little enough materially his reputation was dubious he was still clumsy when it came to command he had much to regret to be ashamed of but he had won far more than he had lost he had solved many cases fought for the truth and mostly he had won far above any of that he had personal happiness an ease of heart that made him smile in repose and look forward to going home at the end of the day certain of kindness of trust and of hope what did runcorn have what gave him pleasure when he closed the office doors and became merely a man monk had no idea they stopped at a public house where they each drank a pint of ale and ate a pork pie with thick crumbly pastry then they set out again they left black footprints on the white of the pavement the reflection of the pale street made the lamps look yellow like eerie moons on stalks their breath was visible like smoke carriages passed them in the street hooves muffled by snow it was midnight been to the theater most likely runcorn remarked as another carriage passed them looming out of the darkness and then was swallowed again between the lamps reappearing outlined against the falling snow one of them may have witnessed something monk said eagerly mews runcorn said what mews he repeated we need the coachmen people will have gone inside and be in no mood to help us at this hour coachmenll still be up got to unharness cool the horses rub them down put everything away itll be another hour before they can go to bed of course monk should have thought of it himself in trying to wrench his mind into the habits of river boats he had forgotten the obvious right he agreed turning to follow runcorn who was still hesitating the rank that runcorn had attained over the years had not taken from him the inner conviction that somehow monk was the leader his brain knew better but his instinct was slower by sheer force of will monk deliberately walked half a step behind they were sheltered for a few yards along the alley then as they turned into the mews the snow caught them again all the stable lights were on the doors open three men were busy along the length of it working hard backing vehicles into coach houses soothing animals and unharnessing them trying to get finished as fast as possible and get out of the biting cold to warm up before going to bed names and addresses runcorn said unnecessarily well not get much more than that out of the poor devils at this hour monk smiled to himself the poor devils were going to get home into the warmth a long time before he was evening runcorn began cheerfully as they approached the first man who was busy unfastening a harness on a handsome bay horse evenin he replied guardedly the horse threw its head up and the man caught the rein steadying it quiet now i know yer want ter go ter bed so do i boy steady now what is it sir yer lorst runcorn introduced himself nothing wrong he said mildly just wonder if youve been to the theater or something like that and if you have if you go quite often you might have seen something helpful to us well come back at a better time to look into it the man hesitated in the carriage lights his face was marked with weariness and the snow was dusting his hat and shoulders prince o wales theater he answered guardedly go often runcorn asked couple o times a week if theres somethin good on excellent which number house do you belong to and whats your masters name not ternight the man shook his head course not runcorn agreed tomorrow maybe at a decent hour whats his name monk gave a half salute and moved on to the next coachman who was clearly visible in the lights about four houses along in half an hour they collected a reasonable list they agreed to resume the following evening a little earlier next time monks mood was considerably deflated when he arrived at the station in wapping a little late the next morning mr farnham wants to see you sir clacton said with a smile composed far more of satisfaction than friendliness the smile broadened es bin waitin a while monk could think of no reply save one that would not play straight into clacton s hands but the resolve hardened inside him to deal with clacton decisively as soon as he could create the opportunity this time he simply thanked him and went to report to farnham cold getting to you monk farnham said unsympathetically before monk had closed the office door sir the room was warm and comfortable smelling slightly of woodsmoke and there was a cup of tea steaming on the desk next to a pile of papers fancy your bed more than a brisk river crossing farnham elaborated didnt see that thats what the job would need on the water monk thats where the work is he did not add that durban would have been here long before this hour but it was implicit in his expression yes sir it was a cold night monk agreed biting his temper with great difficulty private work might leave him frighteningly short of money but it afforded him the luxury of not putting up silently with remarks like that he had to remind himself with cruel bluntness what it would cost him to retaliate now it was a harsh night he added it was snowing quite hard when i got home at half past one farnham looked irritated chasing that suicide again do i have to remind you that river crime is up which is our businessyour business monk there arent many passenger boats on the water this time of year but the few there are are experiencing more thefts than usual and we arent doing anything about it some people are suggesting that is because we dont care to his face was hard and there were blotches of color in his cheeks monk realized farnham was losing control of his anger again because the emotion inside him was too powerful to govern it was fear the possibility of disgrace to the police force he loved and which was his source not only of income and power but of his belief in himself im sorry to hear that sir monk said dutifully that perception is completely wrong we care very much and we must prove it yes you damned well must farnham agreed vehemently suicides are tragic but they happen its hard enough for the surviving family members without you nosing around asking pointless questions and keeping it in the forefront of everybodys minds he started to pace up and down he had apparently forgotten his tea people are saying that the river police are corrupt the pink deepened in his cheeks that has never happened before since ive been in the force they even said were taking a rakeoff ourselves he stopped midstride and glared at monk his eyes bright and hot i wont have my force destroyed by that slander i lost my best man in durban he was wise brave and loyal and above all he was honest he knew this river like his own backyard and he knew its people good and bad he jabbed his finger at monk no one would have said such a monstrous thing about us if he were alive i dont expect you to take his place you wouldnt know where to begin but youll clear up this mess and prove we dont look the other way at crime any crime and we take nothing out of it but our pay which is hard earned by the best bunch of men who ever wore her majestys uniform do you understand me yes sir i do good then get out and begin to do what you are hired for good day good morning sir monk went back to the outer room and his own desk where the reports were of monetary theft none of the men commented but he felt clacton s eyes on him the patrol had already gone out before monk had arrived he read the account of the nights events the usual minor thefts disturbances and accidents there was only one major incident but it had narrowly avoided becoming a disaster largely due to the rapid action of the river police on duty monk made a note to himself to congratulate the men concerned and to do it as publicly as possible farnham was not exaggerating the thefts reported on the passenger boats going up and down the river had increased alarmingly he had read the old reports from the same time last year in durban s neat strong hand and it had more than doubled since then the escalation had come since monk had taken over was that coincidence or had the thieves taken advantage of a new and slacker regime a commander who was ignorant of a great deal of their names and habits their connections with one another their methods and tricks a commander who also did not know his own men and whose men in turn had little confidence in him then a darker and even uglier thought forced itself into his mind were durban s figures a good deal less than accurate was it possible that for his own reasons he had altered them either to hide the true degree of crime ora thought that was even more painfulbecause the accusers were right and the police were pocketing some of the takings themselves no he refused to think that durban would not have stolen monk had known durban only briefly and had not only admired him but liked him as a friend and companion but who knew what other friends he had or enemies what debts paid and unpaid he realized with surprise that he intended to protect durbanfrom farnham from whoever it was that accused them of corruption even from orme if necessary it was not a matter of paying his own debt it was simply out of friendship how to build such a defense was a great deal more difficult he sat looking through the figures of recent crime again reading and rereading them trying to see a pattern in order to understand what had changed half an hour later he was forced to accept that he did not know any more than when he had begun he could not afford the luxury of pride and would have to ask one of his men he sent for orme confiding in him was a risk if he did not understand what monk was trying to do he might feel confused and defensive fearing that he was seeking to undermine durban and establish himself on the ruin of another mans reputation if he already knew of the corruption and even was a party to it then monk would have left himself vulnerable in a way that might prove his ultimate defeat with orme against him he could not succeed in any part of his job yes sir orme stood in front of him his jacket buttoned straight his clean collar fastened a little tightly around his neck he looked anxious close the door and sit down monk invited indicating the wooden chair near the far side of his desk mr farnham says that thefts have gone up alarmingly on the passenger boats he said when orme had obeyed looking at the figures in all the reports hes right theyre much higher than this time last year is that coincidence or is there something i have neglected to do orme stared at him evidently confused by his candor perhaps in the work they had done together he had already realized that monk was a proud man and had difficulty relying on anyone else all monks instincts were to retreat but he could not afford to he had everything to gain from winning ormes trust and everything to lose without it he forced himself to speak gently mr farnham says that there are people suggesting we are corrupt we have to clear this up and prove them wrongor liars if thats what they are orme paled his body stiff his eyes met monks in a puzzled unhappy gaze the river police have had a name for honesty for over half a century monk went on his own voice quiet and angry i wont have it changed now how do we stop this mr orme orme snapped to attention suddenly he realized monk was asking his help not somehow challenging him and far less blaming him theres a lot fer us to do sir he said carefully as if testing monks intent there is monk agreed there are the usual fights and robberies in the docks and along the barges and moored ships the accidents the dangerous wrecks or cargoes the thefts fights sinkings and fires and murders orme added watching monks eyes and murders monk agreed do you reckon as she meant to go oer mr monk so he was thinking of mary again as if he too was haunted by her courage her loneliness the unsolved questions no i dont he was being more honest than he had intended but there was no help for now but to go on if he could not rely on orme he was lost anyway i think she knew of something in the tunneling more dangerous than just the engines or even the speed with which theyre cutting i dont know what it is yet but i think someone killed herand her fatherover it argyll orme said with surprise not directly no i think he probably paid someone to kill james havilland and mary found that out too ormes face was grim with the anger a normally gentle man feels when he is outraged there was something frightening in it unselfish and implacable i think as you should keep followin that until you find out oo it was sir he said levelly its wrong ter let that go by if we dont see it right fer a woman like that wot use are we and the thefts from the passenger boats monk asked our reputation matters too its part of our ability to do the job if people dont trust us were crippled we got to do wots right an trust itll be seen as right orme said stubbornly i cant find out oo killed er i avent got the skill fer that never done it with people o that class give me a river fight dockers thieves lightermen sailors even an i can sort it out but not ladies like that you done that fer years mr monk you know murders wot are quiet i know a punch in the face you know a knife in the back well get it all between us what about a hand in the pocket a slit in the purse and your money gone monk asked ormes mouth tightened ill take care o that an o people with big mouths an small minds i know a lot o people oove got secrets you cant help gettin enemies in this job but if yer careful an keep yer promises you get friends as well i dont know where the enemies are yet monk admitted orme smiled mirthlessly not yet you dontbut i do theres a few i can use an i will believe me sir em boat thievesll wish they adnt started you find oo killed that poor girl ill be beind you an ill watch yer back against mr farnham thank you monk said with utmost sincerity seven later in the afternoon monk and runcorn were in charles street again they were about to begin the task of knocking on the doors of those who had been to the theater the night before and might possibly have returned at about that same hour the night when james havilland had died the days rain had turned the snow to slush but now it was freezing again and the pavements were slippery underfoot the pall over the city from so many domestic fires and factory chimneys blocked out the stars the streetlamps glowed yellowish white with a halo of mist around each one and the cold of the night caught in the throat the noise of hooves was sharp and loud and carriage wheels crunched on the frozen slush monk and runcorn walked as swiftly as it was safe to do without losing ones footing they kept their heads down out of the wind their hats low coat collars turned up runcorn glanced at monk as if about to speak then seemed to change his mind monk smiled partly to himself he knew that runcorn was thinkingjust as he was himselfthat they were almost certainly wasting their time but having come this far they might just as well try every house whose front door servants entrance or mews might possibly have allowed one of the occupants to see someone come or go to havillands mews that night monk had earlier checked with the library of past newspapers exactly which theaters had been open and the hours when the curtains had come down better get on with it runcorn said grimly approaching the first door and climbing the steps that attempt was abortive as was the second the third took a little longer but also yielded nothing the man who came to speak to them was polite but quickly made it apparent that he did not wish to become involved in anything that had happened in the street or anyone elses home they left feeling more despondent than if he had simply denied being out runcorn pulled his coat collar up higher and glanced at monk but he did not say anything they were now four doors away from havillands house and on the opposite side of the street monk continued the investigation from habit in the perverse refusal to surrender rather than any hope of achieving anything he and runcorn walked up to the step side by side but it was runcorn who knocked on the door the footman who answered was young and somewhat flustered he had very clearly not been expecting a caller at this hour of the night yes gentlemen he said with some alarm nothing wrong runcorn soothed him is your master at home yes the young man blinked he should have been more circumspect even at this hour of the night and he realized it the moment the words were out of his mouth the color washed over his face at least that would be mr barclay and mrs ewart the lift of puzzlement was barely discernible in runcorns voice yes sir the footmans face was pink he was plainly embarrassed and trying very hard to find a way out of his predicament he was still struggling when a man in his middle thirties came across the hall behind him and into the vestibule he was tall and rather elegant and dressed in evening clothes as if he had only lately returned from some formal event what is it alfred he asked with a frown who are these gentlemen i dont know sir i was john barclay the man said brusquely who are you and how may we be of assistance are you lost superintendent runcorn mr barclay runcorn introduced himself and inspector monk of the thames river police sorry to disturb you so late sir but since youve been out at this hour we wondered if you might do so quite often barclays eyebrows rose what of it and what on earth can it have to do with the river police i havent been anywhere near the river except across the bridge of course did something happen not tonight sir runcorn was shivering so his words were a trifle blurred monk sneezed i havent seen anything to interest the police at any time barclay said a little impatiently im sorry i cant help you he glanced at monk for heavens sake man go home and get a hot toddy or something its nearly one in the morning something in the mans attitude irritated runcorn monk saw it in the tightening of the muscles of his jaw and a slight alteration to the angle of his head were you acquainted with mr james havilland four doors up across the road sir he asked barclay stiffened i was but not more than to be civil to we had little in common but you knew him runcorn was determined either to keep barclay on the step or to be invited inside the night was bitter and the wind was coming from the northeast and blowing right into the house ive told you inspector or whatever your rank is barclay began superintendent sir runcorn corrected him yes superintendent i knew him as one casually knows neighbors one is civil but one does not mix with them socially if they are not of the same interests there was a light tap of heels across the parquet floor of the hall behind him and the door opened showing a woman of about his own age she too was slender with brown hair blue eyes and winged brows that gave her face a highly individual look its nothing melisande he said hastily go back into the warmth its a filthy night then dont keep the gentleman on the step john she said reasonably she looked beyond him at runcorn and then at monk please come in and speak in comfort perhaps you would like something hot to drink as my brother says its a rotten night your feet must be frozen at least i know mine are for heavens sake mel theyre police barclay hissed in what might have been intended as an aside but was perfectly audible probably as far as the street oh dear has something happened she came closer monk could see in the vestibule light that her face was lovely but there was a patience and even a sadness in it that suggested that life was not as easy for her or as rich as superficial judgment might assume nothing that needs to concern you my dear barclay said pointedly they are merely looking for witnesses she did not move away it must be urgent to bring you out at this time of night she looked to runcorn who was standing more in the light than monk was what is it you need to know mr runcorn maam he replied suddenly sounding a trifle selfconscious there was something in the elegance of her gown the flawless curve of her throat that seemed to make him more than normally aware of her not only professionally but personally she smiled what is it that we might have seen mr runcorn runcorn coughed as if his throat was tight theres not much chance maam but were pursuing everything we can its about mr james havilland im afraid i didnt know him well she began you didnt know him at all barclay exclaimed then turned to runcorn again we really have no idea what happened or why except that the poor man shot himself frankly i cant imagine why youre wasting your time delving into it is there not enough crime to keep you busy if you dont know where it is i can certainly tell you john she remonstrated then looked at runcorn as if in apology what is it you think we may have seen there was a sudden gentleness in runcorns face monk was beginning to realize how much he had changed in the last two years some kind of confidence within him had enabled him to look outwards with less need to defend himself more awareness of the hurt of others anyone else in the street or coming out of the mews he answered her apart from your own immediate friends and servants any stranger at all or person you wouldnt expect to see actually anyone else at all because they might have seen something and be able to help help what barclay asked scathingly let the dead rest in peace at least grant them that much decency his poor daughter took her own life as well i presume you know that monk spoke for the first time with an edge to his voice i was there on patrol on the river she went over the bridge i am not certain that she intended to barclay looked surprised no one else seems to have any doubt but even if she fell by accident that has nothing to do with us it was miles from here and we cant help you im sorry good night he stepped back melisandes gown was light and she was obviously cold but she refused to step out of his way she looked at monk is there some chance she did not take her life her face was soft her eyes lit with hope i didnt know her very well but i would so much like to think that she was not so filled with despair that she would do such a thing and of course also that she could have a proper burial the other is so brutal yes there is a chance maam monk replied that is part of what we are still investigating and if we saw anyone in the street the night of her fathers death that might help yes runcorn was staring at her with a steady unwavering gentleness had he too seen the sadness in her the vulnerability as if aware of it she turned and answered as though it were runcorn who had elaborated rather than monk we were at the theater that night she told him i cant remember what we saw and it doesnt matter now it went right out of my head when i heard the next day what had happened but we did return about half past midnight and we saw a man coming out of the mews opposite he wasnt coming out barclay contradicted her with a wince he was on the footpath staggering around he had clearly been overindulging ive no idea who he was so i couldnt tell you where to find him but even if i could he would be useless to you he couldnt even see where he was going let alone be a credible witness to anything his brow furrowed his expression sharper but even if hed seen havilland put the gun to his head and pull the trigger how would that help anyone you know what happened let it be mercifully forgotten its no ones fault and nothing whatever to do with us monk was freezing his body and runcorns were to some extent sheltering barclay and his sister but even so he felt a stiffening of anger a heat of resentment rise inside him it is possible sir that mr havilland did not kill himself he said sharply dont be absurd barclay was angry now rattled are you suggesting theres some maniac going around shooting people in their own homes in the middle of the night here he put his arm out as if to protect his sister she moved fractionally away from him just out of his reach her eyes still on runcorn it was runcorn who answered not to contradict barclay so much as to reassure melisande no sir if it was someone else then it was deliberately planned and arranged and it was to do with his work there is no need at all for anyone else to be alarmed if we are right then the man concerned is miles away from here and the last thing hed be likely to do is draw attention to himself by coming back melisande smiled thank you she said quietly and he did come out of the mews he staggered around a little as if he was drunk and he said he was he said he was runcorn was startled what did he say exactly he had a stain on his jacket she touched her shoulder about the place where she would have pinned a corsage about here quite a large stain three or four inches across dark as if it was wet he saw me looking at it only briefly i suppose that was rude but it was such an odd place to have a stain so large he said he had tripped and fallen in the mews heshe made a slight gesture as if brushing herself downhe said he didnt know what he fell in and would prefer not to think of it then he apologized and went on down the road she glanced at her brother if he fell in the mews then he should have smelled of horse manure barclays eyes showed not only his disgust but also his impatience i daresay he did mel he said sharply dirt and horse dung he made a guttural sound in his throat im perished standing out here there really isnt anything more to say good night officers melisande refused to move disregarding his growing anger but he didnt she insisted he didnt smell at all he was very close to me he passed only a foot away and he didnt smell of anything except sweat and something a little sickly and something else quite strong but i didnt recognize it again she was looking at runcorn monk felt a tingle of excitement the first scent of meaning he glanced at runcorn and had to bite his lip to keep silent runcorn let out his breath slowly what kind of smell maam he was achingly careful not to suggest anything to her can you describe it really barclay lost his temper whats the matter with you man asking a lady to describe the precise stink of a beggar i dont know what kind of person you are used to the color washed up melisandes cheeks her brothers rudeness clearly embarrassed her far more than the nature of the question runcorn blushed alsofor her not for himself monk could see that in the anger and confusion in his eyes he longed to help her and he had no idea how to something in her manner her particular kind of loneliness had found his sympathy and he was utterly and wholly in her defense runcorn stared at barclay with cold dislike it matters sir he said his voice was shaking a little but that could have been attributed to the cold they were shuddering now their feet almost numb this man may have seen a murder i dont willingly distress anybody but it sometimes happens that those who can help the most are also those who are sensitive to the unpleasant details please john dont try to protect me from doing my duty that would not be a service to me melisande looked at runcorn gratitude in her smile it was rather an acrid smoky kind of smell not very pleasant but not sour or dirty probably picked up someones old cigar end barclay wrinkled his nose no she replied i know tobacco smoke it definitely wasnt that but it was rather smoky she paled suddenly oh you mean it was gunsmoke it might have been runcorn agreed you cant base a charge of murder on that barclay protested i dont runcorn could not conceal his dislike again he looked at barclay coldly there are other reasons for believing that mr havilland might not have shot himself he turned back to melisande and his eyes softened do you recall anything of this mans appearance maam of what height was he a big man or a small man anything about his face she took a moment to bring it back to her mind he was very lean she replied his face was thin what i could see of it he had a scarf she made a gesture around her throat and chinand a hat on his hair was longlong onto his collar i think he was very dark it was the middle of a winter night barclay said with an obvious effort to be reasonable in spite of everyone elses unreason he was of very average height and build and he had a dirty old coat on with his collar turned up as anyone would on such a night thats all if his coat was dark how did you see the wet stain on it runcorn asked then it wasnt dark barclay snapped it was a light coat but it was still dirty now weve told you everything we can and you have kept my sister standing here in the cold for more than long enough good night melisande drew in her breath perhaps to point out that it was he who had chosen to remain on the step she had tried to invite them inside but she might have remembered it was barclay she was dependent upon not runcorn or monk good night she said with a swift apologetic glance then turned to go inside the door closed leaving them in sudden darkness they were so numb from the icy wind that their first few steps were almost stumbling runcorn walked in silence for almost a hundred yards still lost in his own thoughts better see if anyone else saw him monk said at last might be a groom from one of the houses runcorn gave him a sideways look might be he agreed dryly im betting it was an assassin hired by one of the argyll brothers to get rid of havilland but weve got to rule out everything else so tomorrow wed best ask all around i can put my men on that i suppose youve got river things to attend to monk smiled the sudden appreciation of his position was an oblique way of thanking him for not showing off in front of melisande ewart yes spate of robberies actually thank you runcorn stared at him for a moment as if to make sure there was no mockery in his eyes then he nodded and began walking again monk was late to wapping station again in the morning he had not meant to be but he had fallen asleep again after hester had wakened him and even her noisy riddling of the ashes from the stove had not wakened him it was nearly ten oclock when he climbed the steps from the ferry they were slicked over with ice and dangerously slippery he reached the top and saw orme coming out of the station door had he been waiting for him why another warning that farnham was after him he felt cold inside orme came towards him quickly his coat collar up wind tugging at his hair mornin sir he said quietly like to walk that way a bit he inclined his head to indicate the stretch southwards good morning orme what is it monk took the hint and turned to keep in step did a good bit of lookin around yesterday mr monk asked a few questions collected a favor or two orme answered in a low voice he led monk away from the station and within a few moments out of sight of it its right enough theres been a lot more thievin in the last month or twoneat like all tidy passenger standin talkin then a piece goes watch or bracelet or whatever it is like as not it isnt noticed fer a little while then o course its too late could be anywhere theres always someone beside you as couldnt ave done it an they always say as they saw nothin several people working together monk judged one to distract one to take it a passer another to block the way with offers of help and maybe a fifth to take it and disappear yer right an from what i eard im pretty certain at least one of em was a kid ten or eleven each time not the same child no just that sort of age people take em for beggars mudlarks just strays anging around for a bit of food likely or to keep warm better in a boat than on the dockside in the wind monk thought of scuff he would probably rather work than steal but what was there for a child to do on the river in midwinter the thought of hot food a dry place out of the wind and a blanket would be enough to tempt anyone he was brave imaginative quickthe ideal target for a kidsman one of those who took in unwanted children and made thieves of them it was afar from ideal life but in return the children ate and were clothed and to some extent protected the thought of scuff ending like that sickened him there was no leniency in the courts for children a thief was a thief any idea who he found the words difficult to say orme must have heard the emotion in his voice he looked at him quickly then away again some only the arms and legs o the gang so to speak need to catch the ead to be any use wont be easy well have to plan monk replied see if theres any pattern in the reports of theft any of the goods turn up whod take that kind of stuff opulent receivers they took the valuable things and knew where and how to dispose of them durban would not have had to ask he would have known their names their places of business and storage the goods in which they specialized yes sir orme did not add anything monk realized as if he had suddenly come to a yawning hole in the earth in front of him how much orme missed durban and how far short monk still was of filling that space perhaps he could never earn that loyalty or give the men cause to accept him as they had durban but he could earn their respect for his skill and in time they would come to know that they could trust him for now it was orme they trusted orme they would be loyal to and obey monk would get no more than lip service and less than that from clacton that was a problem that still had to be addressed and they would all be waiting to see how monk handled it sooner or later clacton himself would provoke a confrontation and monks authority would hang on whether he won and how he tried to think of other plans he had used in the past to catch rings of thieves but since the accident that had taken his memory he had worked largely on murder cases petty thieving belonged to a past before thatin the early years when he and runcorn had worked together he thought wryly not against each other he had had flashes of going into the rookeries those vast slums which were part underground tunnels part sagging tenements there were passages trapdoors sudden drops and blind endsa hundred ways to get caught and to get your throat cut your corpse would possibly go out on the tide or if it finished in the sewer most of it would be eaten by rats that world was violent and ugly the poverty in it was so absolute that only the strongest and the luckiest survived police seldom went there at all but if they did they took with them someone they trusted not only in loyalty but in skill speed and nerve as well and above all courage he and runcorn had trusted each other like that once in the rotting tenements of the waterlogged patch on the south bank known as jacobs island there could be a hundred men hidden in the wrecks of buildings sinking slowly into the mud the same was true of the teeming slums of the docks the evershifting tides of the pool of london with its great ships its cargoes here one day and gone the next the opium dens of limehouse or the wrecks on the long stretches towards the sea might conceal anything he would need to trust orme with his life as orme would have to trust him it would not come quickly or without testing ill work on a plan he said aloud at last if youve got one tell me yes sir i was thinkin orme stopped go on monk prompted id like to catch the fat man orme said thoughtfully owe im a lot that one over the years i assume you mean a lot of harm not a lot of good oh yes sir a lot o harm indeed there was an edge of emotion in ormes voice that was extraordinarily sharp as if from an accumulation of pain monk was overwhelmed by how much he did not know about these men orme seemed not to resent him in fact he had deliberately steered him away from the station just now so that farnham would not see him come in late he had covered for him yesterday so that he could pursue the havilland case an icy thought passed through monks mind that orme was deliberately allowing him to do those things in order to betray him to farnham giving him enough rope to hang himself why had orme himself not got durban s job he was extremely able and the men trusted him and admired him he was far better qualified for it than monk why had durban suggested monk was that a betrayal too he was floundering his ignorance was like a vast black tide carrying him towards destruction i was thinkin sirorme was still talkingthat if we get rid of the fat man oos the best opulent receiver on the river then someone elsell take is place i reckon that someonell be toes an toes is someone we can keep better under control es greedy but thats all at least fer now the fat man is different e as streaks of cruelty we need to get rid of e isnt above gettin people cut up slow if they really cross im up clever with a knife e is knows ow to urt without killin monk looked at ormes grave pinched face and read the pain in it again very well lets get rid of him he agreed orme looked at him steadily yes mr monk an no private scores settled no favors and no revenge thats what mr durban used to say he turned away quickly his breath catching in his throat and monk knew that the ghost of durban was always going to be there so he would use it he would spend the day going through all durban s records until he had worked out what durban would have done to trap the kidsmen and trace the goods to the fat man legitimately no favors no revenge he also wanted to know why orme had not been made commander perhaps he would be better off in ignorance but he had to find out it might matter one day his life might even depend upon it most of the cases that he studied were routine crimes exactly like those he had dealt with since he came the only unusual thing in durban s notes was that they were briefer than monk would have expected and more personal his handwriting was strong but occasionally untidy as if written hastily or when he was tired there were flashes of humor and discreet asides that suggested to monk that durban had not been especially fond of clacton either the difference was that durban had known how to keep him under control largely because the other men would not tolerate clacton s disloyalty monk smiled at least he had found that solution if he could work out how to use it he read carefully the reports of thefts from passenger boats they seemed to vary but in no particular pattern that he could detect there were various other crimes some very serious one durban had written on for many pages and it had apparently disturbed him greatly the writing was sprawling and many of the letters only half formed there was a kind of jaggedness to it monk read it because the urgency in it held him it had nothing to do with theft or with passenger boats at all it concerned the murder of a prosperous man in his early forties his body had been found in the river apparently shot to death some time the night before and dumped into the water he was identified as roger thorwood of chelsea a barber of considerable wealth and influence he was mourned by his wife beatrice and three surviving children durban had put a great deal of time and energy into the investigation and followed every lead his hope and frustration were clearly marked in his notes but after nearly three months he had learned nothing of value and been obliged to abandon his concentration on it and turn his entire attention to other duties the death of roger thorwood remained a mystery durban s last entry on the subject was scribbled and in places almost illegible i have spoken to mrs thorwood for the last time there is nothing more i can do all trails are closed they had either nowhere or into a hopeless morass i never thought i would say of any murder that it is better left but i do of this and it is wrong to expect orme to carry the responsibility here any longer it is not even as if one day he might be justly rewarded for his work or his loyalty he owes it not to me but because that is his nature nonetheless i am profoundly grateful to him there is no more to say monk stared at the page it was oddly difficult to turn over and continue with the murders robberies fights and accidents that occurred later there was something painfully unfinished about it not only the mystery of roger thorwood s death but durban s obvious involvement his anger and disappointment were there and something else less obvious which he was too guarded to name guarding someone else or himself there was also his oblique reference to orme never receiving appropriate recompense for his work it seemed he had covered for durban as well as for monk it raised the question again as to why he had not received the promotion his skill had earned him it seemed that durban knew the reason monk realized that perhaps he ought to in order to make a better judgment of orme but he was glad there was no time to search now what he needed was a plan to catch the thieves on the passenger boats more important he wanted to trace them back to the opulent receiver who was organizing them and probably the kidsmen as well it was two oclock in the afternoon when orme returned together without mentioning durban at all they carefully constructed their strategy orme looked nervous but he did not argue with monks intention to be present and clacton monk added orme looked at him quickly monk smiled but he did not explain himself ormes mouth tightened and he nodded monk met runcorn by the hotchestnut stand just off westminster bridge road it was four in the afternoon and already dark a heavy cloud hung like a pall over the city there was the smell of chimney smoke in the air and the wind held the sting of snow to come downriver on the incoming tide was a drift of fog and monk standing within sight of the dark flat water could hear the boom of foghorns drifting up although there were several of them it was an eerie sound of utter desolation now it echoed vaguely when the fog came in it would be swallowed cut off half finished like a cry strangled in the throat found the cabbie runcorn said blowing on a hot chestnut before putting it into his mouth took the man as far as piccadilly remembers him quite well because he did an odd thing he got out of his cab and crossed the circus which was pretty quiet at that time in the morning all the theaters on haymarket and shaftesbury avenue being out long since then he got straight into another cab and disappeared east along coventry street towards leicester square he looked up from his chestnut watching for monks reaction why would a man change cabs when theres nothing wrong with the one hes in because he wants to disappear monk replied i expect he changed again maybe twice before he got where he wanted to be exactly runcorn agreed taking another chestnut and smiling he wasnt drunk he wasnt a beggar he certainly wasnt anyones groom he could have been monk started runcorns eyebrows rose with the price of a cab fare from westminster bridge road to the east end monk could have bitten his tongue he looked away from runcorn no of course not whoever he was he had money exactly runcorn repeated i think mrs ewart saw the man who shot james havilland she gave us quite a good description of him and the cab driver added a bit seems he has black hair rather long onto his collar and at least at that time he was cleanshaven the cabbie had the impression of a hollow sort of face and long nose thin between the eyes a very observant cab driver monk remarked a little skeptically you sure he wasnt just trying to get on the good side of the police no thats accurate runcorn replied looking down and concentrating on the few pieces of chestnut he had left in his hand what we have to do is find out who hired him itll be the same person who wrote to havilland to get him out of the house and into the stables in the middle of the night havilland had not been afraid of whomever he expected to meet and whoever it was had not taken advantage of his opportunity to rob the house either he had panickedwhich did not seem to be the caseor he was compensated for what he did in some other way monk said as much to runcorn money runcorn replied bitterly someone paid him to kill havilland that sort of arrangements usually handed over in two halves monk pointed out first before the deed second after we might be able to trace the money its a risk to commit murder in an area like this it cant have come cheap who sent that letter thats what i want to know thats whos guilty who really betrayed him runcorn looked at monk searching his face for agreement thats whom he was expecting to meet neither of them said it aloud but monk knew runcorn was thinking of alan argyll just as he was himself alan was married to one of havillands daughters and toby was betrothed to the other havilland might disagree with them distrust their engineering skills or business practices but he would not fear personal violence from them why midnight and why the stables he asked runcorns eyebrows rose could hardly shoot him much earlier and obviously he wouldnt want to do it in the house i mean what reason would argyll give for meeting in the stables at midnight and why did havilland agree runcorn took the point immediately we need to find that letter or learn at the very least who sent it monk took one of the chestnuts and ate it it was sweet and hot the maid said havilland burnt it maybe he didnt burn the envelope runcorn was still hopeful monk ate the last chestnut come on he turned and started to walk cardman was surprised to see them again but he invited them in what can i do for you gentlemen the hall had a bare look the black crepe had been taken down along with the wreaths but the clock was still stopped and there was no heating it was monk who spoke first this time i know the maid said that mr havilland destroyed the note that took him to the stables the night he was killed but it is extremely important that we learn everything about it that we caneven the envelope if it still exists cardmans eyes widened he had heard the one word that had mattered to him his voice trembled a little you said he was killed sir did you mean that someone else was responsible after all miss mary was right yes mr cardman it looks very like it monk replied cardmans face tightened and if you cant find the envelope sir does that mean you wont be able to prove who did it somebody lured him to the stable monk told him gravely we are certain it was someone else who actually killed him whether we can catch the second person i dont know but its the first we want most im afraid weve long ago disposed of all the rubbish in the study cardman said there are only mr havillands papers there now and of course household bills and receipts miss mary took care of everything like that no one has been here yet to to see to he trailed off swamped by the small realities of loss again im sure mr argyll will appoint someone monk said then the moment the words were spoken he realized the appalling urgency of searching the study which is the study runcorn asked cardman showed them would you like a pot of tea sir he offered im afraid the room is extremely cold they both accepted speaking together two hours later they knew a great deal about both havillands domestic arrangements and how efficiently mary had continued with them everything had been precisely and carefully dealt with the bills had been checked and paid on time there were also no unnecessary papers kept no unanswered letters no notes made on envelopes or scraps of paper perhaps it was always going to be a waste of time runcorn said wearily damn he swore with sudden fury id stake my life it was argyll how the hell do we catch him come on monk youre so clever you could tie an eel in knots how do we get the bastard monks mind was racing thered have been a lot of blood on his clothes he began thinking aloud runcorn did not see the point the irritation flickered across his face so there would what does it matter now probably too much to clean off anyway whod want the clothes a man was wearing when he committed suicide no one oh you mean theyre still somewhere there might be something in the pockets runcorn stood up as if suddenly regaining energy he walked towards the door then remembered that there was a bell in the room for summoning servants avoiding monks eyes he turned back reached for it and pulled cardman answered and five minutes later they were in james havillands dressing room the clothes he had been wearing at his death were piled neatly on one of the shelves in the tallboy it was obvious that mary had never had the stomach to come into the room since that night and had not permitted the servants to either perhaps she would have done so after she had proved that he was not a suicide everything seemed to be waiting the trousers were marked only by dust and a few pieces of hay the jacket was quite heavya natural enough choice for a man going out to the stables in the middle of a winter night possibly to wait a little while until someone arrived the question rose again why the stables if havilland wished to be private it was easy enough to send the servants to bed and open the front door for the guest himself monk had a crowding sense that there was some major fact that had escaped him completely runcorn was waiting watching him he unrolled the jacket and laid it on the dresser there was blood thick and dark on the left lapel and over the shoulder it was completely dried now and stiff a few spots had fallen on the sleeve though not a great deal after all it had been a shot to the head and havilland must have died almost instantly look runcorn instructed without hope of finding anything monk pushed his hands into the inside pocket his fingers closed on paper and he pulled it out it was folded up but unmarked an envelope on the back a wordtyburnwas scrawled and some figures and then no name and some more figures in the same grouping he turned it over on the front was his name mr james havilland there was no address it had been handdelivered he looked up at runcorn runcorns eyes were bright thats it he said excitement making his voice tremble thats the envelope from the note he got he held out his hand monk passed it to him womans writing runcorn said after only a second or two disappointment so keen he could not mask it he looked up at monk pain and confusion naked was it an assignation after all who the devil shot him a husband did the man in the two cabs have nothing to do with it monk was unhappy too but for an entirely different reason jenny argyll he said if it was she who wrote he would go out there to meet her dont forget mary was in the house maybe he wanted to speak with jenny without mary knowing or jenny with him runcorn looked around for the bell he found it and rang it and cardman answered a few moments later runcorn held out the envelope do you know whose handwriting that is he asked cardman looked stiff and miserable his eyes haunted but he did not hesitate yes sir that is miss jennifers handwritingmrs argyll that is thank you monk acknowledged then he realized what cardman might think possibly runcorn would disapprove but he intended to tell cardman anyway there was a man seen leaving the mews at about the time mr havilland was shot he passed two people returning from the theater who say he smelled of gunsmoke we traced his movements he took a cab as far as piccadilly then changed cabs and went east it seems very possible it was he who actually killed mr havilland cardmans voice was hoarse barely a whisper thank you sir he blinked gratitude showing in his eyes jenny argyll greeted them far more coolly at this time of the day her husband was either at his office or at one of the sites the matter is closed she said bluntly she had received them in the withdrawing room because the morning room fire was not lit after such a double bereavement they were still not receiving callers everything was draped in black there were wreaths on the doors leading into the hall the mirrors were covered and the clocks were stopped presumably in this house the state of mourning was more for toby argyll than for mary although jenny might well grieve privately for her sister monk had not forgotten argylls rage on hearing the news of their deaths and his instant blaming of mary if toby had killed her had it been at his brothers command this time runcorn allowed monk to take the lead i am afraid the matter is not closed mrs argyll monk said firmly she was wearing black it was completely unrelieved and it drained from her what little color she might have had he judged that she would normally be an attractive woman but she had not the strength or the passion he had seen in marys face even when it had been lifeless and wet from the river there had been something in the bones the curve of her mouth that had been unique i cannot help you she said flatly she was standing staring away from them out of the window into the flat winter light and i cannot see what good turning our pain over and over can do please allow us to grieve in peaceand alone we are not at the moment concerned with the deaths of miss havilland and mr argyll monk replied it is the events on the night your father died that we are investigating there is nothing more to say her voice was quiet but the hurt and the anger were plain in her face her shoulders were stiff straining the shiny black fabric it is our familys tragedy for pitys sake leave us alone havent we suffered enough monk hated having to continue he was aware of the same distress in runcorn standing near him but he could not let it go you wrote a letter to your father and had it handdelivered the night of his death mrs argyll he saw her start and draw in her breath with a little gasp please dont embarrass us all with a denial the letter was seen and your father kept the envelope i have it she was ashen and she turned to face him angrily then what do you want from me her voice was so stifled in her throat that it was barely audible her eyes burned hot with hatred of them for the shame they were inflicting on her i want to know what was in the letter mrs argyll you arranged for your father to go to the stablesaloneafter the middle of the night he did so and was killed he killed himself she burst out her tone rising dangerously for the love of heaven why cant you leave it alone he was mad he had delusions he was terrified of closed spaces and at last he couldnt face it anymore what else do you need to know do you hate us so much that you gain some kind of pleasure from seeing us suffer do you have to open the wounds again and again and again she was almost out of control her voice shrill and loud sit down mrs monk started i will not sit down she snapped back do not patronize me in my own home you she gasped in a breath again lost for a word she might dare use there was nothing for monk to do but tell her the truth before she became hysterical and either fainted or left the room and refused to see them again he had little enough authority to be here farnham would not back him up a man was seen leaving the mews just after your father was shot mrs argyll he smelled of gunsmoke he was a stranger in the area and left immediately traveling in several cabs back to the east end do you know who that man was she stared at him incredulously of course i dont what are you sayingthat he shot my father i believe so she put her hands up to her mouth and sank rather too quickly into the chair as if she had lost her power to remain standing she stared at monk as if he had risen out of the carpet in a cloud of sulfur im sorry he said and meant it more than he had thought he could what did you write in your letter that sent your father out into the stable at midnight mrs argyll i i he waited she mastered herself with intense difficulty the struggle was naked and painful in her face i asked him to meet my husband to allow a proper discussion of the tunnels they were building without mary knowing and interrupting she was very excitable at midnight monk said with surprise why not in the offices in the morning because papa was concerned there was going to be an accident and he would not come into the offices to discuss it anymore she said immediately he was going to speak to the authorities they would have had to close down the works until they had investigated and of course discovered that it was completely untrue but they could not afford to take my husbands word for it when mens lives are at risk my father was mad mr monk he had lost all sense of proportion so you arranged this meeting yes but your husband didnt go monk pointed out he was at a party until long after midnight you told the police that you attended it with him was that not true yes it was true i i thought my father must have refused to meet alan he was stubborn her gaze did not waver from his is that what mr argyll said he asked she hesitated but only for a moment yes i see he did see he had never supposed that alan argyll intended to shoot havilland himself he had paid the assassin with the black hair and the narrowbridged nose to do that thank you mrs argyll do you suppose he paid the money himself or had someone else whom he trusted do it monk asked when they were outside matching his step to runcorns on the icy pavement toby probably but not necessarily who would even know where to find an assassin for money runcorn thought for a while walking in silence whom else would he trust he said at last can you trace the funds monk asked him unless hes been saving it up penny by penny over the years certainly i can havilland found something and alan argyll couldnt wait he had to have got the money out of the bank or wherever he kept it and paid the assassin within a day or two of the actual murder its my case monk ive got the men to put on it and the authority to look at bank accounts or whatever it takes ill find out where argyll was every minute of the week before havilland was shot and after unless hes a fool he wont have paid all of it until the deed was done what do you want me to do the words were not easy for monk to say but runcorns plan made sense he could deploy his men to search to question to force out answers that monk could not and monk needed to return to wapping and start earning some of the loyalty he was going to need from his own men havillands death was nothing to do with them runcorn smiled go back to your river he replied ill send you a message after two days the letter came written in runcorns careful overly neat hand it was brought by a messenger and given to monk personally dear monk traced the money came from alan argylls bank but be gave it to sixsmith for expenses argyll can account for all his time both before and after the event clever devil no second sum paid could be lots of reasons for thatbut if sixsmith cheated him then hes a fool i am sure argyll is the man behind it but it was sixsmith who actually handed it over whatever he believed he was paying for followed his movements found where he did it i have no choice but to arrest him straightaway i am not happy we have the servant not the master but i have to charge him we still have work to do runcorn monk thanked the messenger and scribbled a note of acknowledgment back dear runcorn i understand but we damned well do have work to do everything i can do i will count on me monk he gave it to the messenger then when the door was closed he swore with a pentup fury that shocked him argyll had cheated them they had followed the trail and ended by being forced to arrest a man they knew was innocent while argyll watched them and laughed damn him eight it was three days before monk had time to consider the havillands case again there was a large fire in one of the warehouses in the pool of london and the arsonists had attempted to escape by water it was brought to a successful conclusion but by the end of the second day monk and his men were exhausted filthy and cold to the bone at half past eight with the wind howling outside and the woodstove smelling of smoke monk was sitting in his office and finishing the last of his report when there was a knock on the door he answered and clacton walked in closing the door behind him he came over to stand in front of the desk looking casual and more elegant than perhaps he was aware what is it monk asked worked pretty ard the last couple o days clacton observed we all did monk replied if clacton was expecting any leave he would be disappointed yeah clacton agreed you most of all sir monk was uncomfortable he saw the gleam of anticipation in clacton s eyes you didnt come in here to tell me that oh but i did sir clacton responded i know ow ard it must a bin for you wot with your own business on the side an all cant ave ad much time for that what the hell are you talking about monk demanded clacton blinked and smiled yer bit o private work for mr argyll is it findin out oo killed is painlaw and get em off the ook worth a bit i shouldnt wonder he left the added suggestion hanging in the air monks mind raced he had envisioned all kinds of attack from clacton even the remote possibility of physical violence he had not foreseen this insinuation how should he deal with it laughter anger honesty what would clacton s next move be dint think i knew did yer clacton said with satisfaction look down on the rest of us like were beneath you not as clever as the great mr monk oo dont know a damn thing when it comes ter the river come to ave orme old yer and or yerd fall in well the rest of em might be stupid but im not i know wot yer doin an if yer dont want farnham ter know as well yerd be wise ter let me ave a bit o the price there was no time to weigh the consequences i doubt mr argyll will pay me for anything ive found out so far monk said dryly it looks like hes responsible for havillands death yeah clacton s fair eyebrows rose but its sixsmith theyve arrested now why would that be dyer think a bit o shiftin around of evidence mebbe monk was cold and tired and his bones ached but now he was assailed by fear also he recognized both cunning and hatred in the young man in front of him there was no loyalty to durban or anyone else just pure selfinterest monk had no time to care why clacton was dangerous do you think you can find this supposed evidence he asked bluntly clacton s eyes were bright and narrow yer bettin i cant ill be happy if you can monk replied its argyll i want for the first time clacton was thrown off balance thats stupid ooll pay yer her majesty monk replied theres a conspiracy behind havillands death thousands of pounds in the construction business and a lot of power to be gained go and tell mr farnham what you think by all means but youd be better to go and get on with your job and be glad you still have one clacton was confused now he was the one needing to weigh his chances and it angered him the tables had turned and he had barely even seen it happen i still know yer crooked he said between his teeth an ill catch yer one day no monk told him you wont youll fall over yourself now get out slowly as if still unsure whether he had another weapon left clacton turned and walked out leaving the door open behind him monk could see that as soon as he was in the main room his swagger returned monks tea was cold but he did not want to go and get more his hand was trembling and the breath caught in his throat clacton s accusation had been worse than he expected the following morning he went to sir oliver rathbones office monk was prepared to wait as long as necessary but it proved to be no more than an hour rathbone came in elegantly dressed in a wool overcoat against the biting east wind he looked surprised to see monk but pleased since he had realized how much he loved margaret ballinger his rivalry with monk had softened considerably it was as if he had reached a kind of inner safety at last and was now open to a gentler range of emotions monk how are you rathbone was very different from monk a man of excellent education comfortable with himself his elegance was entirely natural monk smiled in the beginning rathbone had discomfited him but time and experience had shown monk the humanity beneath the veneer i need your help in a case of coursewhy else would you be here in the middle of the morning rathbone made no attempt to conceal his amusement or his interest if monk was out of his depth legally then it offered an interesting problem which was exactly what he craved sit down and tell me monk obeyed very briefly he described mary havillands fall from the bridge with toby argyll then his discovery of james havillands earlier death and the course of the investigation that had led to the arrest of aston sixsmith surely you dont want me to defend sixsmith rathbone said incredulously no at least not to act as defense for him monk replied he was beginning to wonder if what he was intending to ask was impossible again fury at argyll washed over him and a sense of helplessness in the face of the skill with which argyll had manipulated both sixsmith and the police into the position he wanted them in monk could picture argylls angry slightly arrogant face marred by grief as if he had seen him only moments ago i want you to prosecute sixsmith but in such a way that we get the man behind him he answered rathbone i dont think sixsmith had any idea what the money was for argyll told him what to do and he did it either blindly or out of loyalty to the argylls believing it was for some legitimate purpose rathbones fair eyebrows rose such as what for example tunneling is a hard trade i dont say he wouldnt cut corners or pay bribes to some of the more violent of those who know the sewers and the underground rivers and wells i dont know rathbone thought for a moment or two clearly his interest was caught he looked at monk you believe the elder argyll brother used sixsmith to pay an assassin to kill havilland because havilland was a threat to him who found this assassin if not sixsmith monk felt as if he were on the witness stand it was more uncomfortable than he had anticipated it would be impossible to escape with inaccurate or incomplete answers alan argyll himself or perhaps toby he answered alan has taken great care to account for all his own time before and after havillands death but toby was several years younger and spent more time on the sites and knew some of the tougher navvies according to whom rathbone said quickly monk smiled but without pleasure according to sixsmith but it can be easily verified youll need to do it rathbone warned the money came from argyll you say yes if he says it was for wages or a new machine and that sixsmith misappropriated it can you prove hes lying monk felt his muscles tighten defensively no not beyond a doubt reasonable doubt i dont know what doubt is reasonable im certain myself not exactly relevant rathbone said dryly why would argyll want havilland dead so much that he would be prepared to use sixsmith to hire an assassin knowledge that the tunnels were dangerous and work should be stopped monk replied isnt all such work dangerous the fleet sewer collapse was appalling thats cutandcover monk told him imagine that underground possibly collapsing at both ends with water or worsegas is gas worse i would have thought water would be pretty dreadful the gas would be methane thats flammable it would only need one spark and the whole thing would be ablaze if it came up through the sewers it could start another great fire of london rathbone paled yes i have the idea monk why do you think that is anything more than a madmans nightmare surely argyll wouldnt want that any more than havilland or anyone else if it were a real danger hed stop the work himself what was he afraid ofthat havilland would frighten the workforce and theyd strike why not just bar him from the site isnt murder excessive not to mention dangerous and expensive if it wasnt the navvies havilland was going to but the authorities that would be different he couldnt stop that so easily and even an unfounded fear could close the excavations for enough time to delay the work seriously and cost a great deal of money to a ruthless man one perhaps running rather close to the edge of profit and loss or with an overlarge investment that could be motive for murder rathbone frowned but motive is not enough monk which you know as well as i why not suppose it was sixsmith exactly as it appears to be because it was argylls wife who sent the letter to her father asking him to be in the stable after midnight monk answered decisively at argylls request and if argyll says he did not ask her to write it rathbone asked you cannot force her to incriminate him it would be profoundly against her interest others will swear it is her handwriting you have the letter i dont i have the envelope the envelope for gods sake monk anything could have been in it did anyone see the letter is the envelope postmarked monk felt the argument slipping out of his grasp the envelope was hand delivered he replied levelly but it is beyond reasonable doubt that it was the one he received that evening because he made notes on it in his own hand and it was in the pocket of the jacket he was wearing thats where we found it could it have belonged to another letter sent at an earlier time there were notes on it relating to events that happened that evening monk replied with satisfaction good so mrs argyll sent him a note if she swears it was an invitation to dinner in a weeks time and she is willing to what have we a woman prepared to lie to two police officers under oath to save her husband her home her source of income and her position in societyand thus also her children rathbone puckered his mouth into a tight bleak smile not an unusual phenomenon monk and not one you would find it easy or popular to destroy you would not win the jurys favor with that i want their belief not their favor monk snapped juries are driven by emotion as well as reason rathbone pointed out youre playing a dangerous game i can see about charging sixsmith as an accessory possibly an unknowing one as far as murder is concerned and hope to draw out enough to implicate argyll but youd have to come up with a lot more than you have so far his face pinched a little it happens sometimes you can catch everyone but the real culprit it looks as if argylls protected himself pretty well to reach him youll have to destroy this man sixsmith who may be completely innocent of anything except a fairly usual business bribe youll also destroy argylls wife who is doing what any woman would do to protect her children perhaps even to protect her belief in her husband as a decent man and she may need that to survive with any kind of sanity monk hesitated was it worth it should he destroy the slightly tarnished those culpable only of ordinary human weakness in order to reach the truly guilty for whatvengeance or to protect future victims you dont have a choice now rathbone said quietly at least not as far as sixsmith is concerned ill prosecute by all means and uncover everything i can meanwhile you find out more about this mysterious assassin show who contacted him if he ever took the second payment if he knows who employed him above all you need to show what havilland was going to do that was sufficient to make argyll want to kill him so far all you have is an engineer who lost his nerve and became a nuisance sane men dont commit murder for that give me chapter and verse of what argyll would lose and connect it to him not just to sixsmith monk stood up ill find it how long have i till it comes to trial three weeks then id better start he moved towards the door monk he turned back yes if youre right and it is argyll be careful hes a very powerful man and you work in a dangerous job monk stared at rathbone with sudden surprise there was a gentleness in his face he had not expected to see i will he promised i have good men around me monk began by going back to speak with runcorn the superintendent was probably as aware as rathbone of the thinness of the case nevertheless monk outlined it in legal terms while runcorn sat behind his desk and listened grimly need to know more about this man in the mews he said when monk had finished might get a better description of him if we ask the cabbie again and well have to ask mrs ewart to see if she can say anything more she was surprised to see them again but it was apparent that she was not displeased she was wearing a woollen dress of a dark rich wine color and she looked less tense than she had the previous time monk wondered if that was in any part related to the fact that her brother was not at home at this hour she received them in the withdrawing room where there was a bright fire sending its heat into the air the room was not what monk would have expected there was a pretentiousness about it that took away something of the comfort the paintings on the walls were big and heavily framed the kind of art one chooses to impress rather than because one likes it there was an impersonal feel to them as there was to the carved ivory ornaments on the mantelpiece and the few leatherbound books in a case against the wall the volumes sat together uniform in size and color immaculate as though no one ever read them then he remembered that mrs ewart was a widow and this was barclays house not hers he wondered for a moment what her own choice would have been she was looking at runcorn her face in the morning light was less tired than the first time they had seen her but it still held the same sadness at the edge of her smile and behind the intelligence in her eyes im sorry to bother you again maam runcorn apologized looking back at her steadily but weve looked into the matter further and it seems very much like the man you saw could have shot mr havilland theres a man arrested for hiring him coming to trial soon but if we dont find a good deal more information he might get off of course she said quickly you must catch the man who did it for every reason i have no idea where he went except towards the main road i imagine he would find a hansom and leave the area as fast as he could oh he did maam we traced him as far as piccadilly and the east end after that runcorn agreed not once did he glance at monk its just that the cabbie didnt look at him except for an instant and he isnt all that good at description if you could remember anything else at all about him it could help she thought for several moments withdrawing into herself she gave a little shiver as if thinking not only of the cold of that night but now also of what had taken place less than a hundred yards from where she had stood runcorns admiration of her was clear in his eyes but it was the vulnerability in her the sadness that held him monk knew that because he had seen a flash of it before and knew runcorn better than he realized there was a softness in runcorn he had never before allowed a capacity for pity he was only now daring to acknowledge or was it monk who had only just developed the generosity of spirit to see it mrs ewart was answering the question as carefully and with as much detail as she could he had a long face she began a narrow bridge to his nose but his eyes were not small and they were heavylidded suddenly she opened her own eyes very wide as if startled they were light his skin was sallow and his hair was black at least it looked black in the streetlights and his brows too but his eyes were lightblue or gray blue i think and his teeth then she shivered and there was a look of apology in her face as if what she was going to say was foolish his eyeteeth were unusually pointed he smiled when he explained the the stain i she gulped i suppose that was poor mr havillands blood she looked at runcorn waiting for his reaction although it was inconceivable that it should matter to her yet monk could not help but believe that it did had she seen that gentleness in runcorn or was it just that she needed someone to understand the horror she felt runcorn continued to probe what about the mans clothes had he worn gloves no had she noticed his hands strong and thin boots she had no idea if she thought of anything else he told her she should send for him and he gave her his card then they thanked her and left monk had barely spoken a word even outside in the bright air wind iceedged off the river runcorn kept his face forward refusing to meet monks eyes there was no purpose in forcing communication where none was needed later they could discuss what each would do next they walked side by side heads down a little collars high against the cold the only place monk could begin was with the nature and opportunities of the man who had paid the assassin was it alan argyll who had found him or toby or perhaps sixsmith had actually contacted him first for the task he had claimed that was an obvious place to start he could speak to toshers who combed the sewers for lost valuables or to gangers who led the men who cleared the worst buildups of detritus and silt that blocked the narrower channels they were all displaced it would take a while before their services were needed and there was no trade in which to earn their way in the meantime he was walking from the wapping station towards one of the cutandcover excavations when scuff caught up with him the boy still had his new odd boots on and the coat that came to his shins but now he also had a brimmed cloth cap that sat uncomfortably on his ears the hat needed something inside the band to make it a little smaller monk wondered how he could tell scuff this without hurting his feelings good morning monk said scuff looked at him yer doin all right monk smiled improving thank you he knew the enquiry was nothing to do with his health it was his competence in the job that scuff was concerned about mr orme is a good man scuff appeared unsure whether he would go so far as to call any policeman good but he did not argue clacton s a bad un he said instead you watch im or ell ave yer i know monk agreed but was startled that scuff knew so much scuff was not impressed do yer yer don look ter me like yer know much at all yer int got them thieves yet ave yer that was a challenge not a question an don let em talk yer inter takin on the fat man nobdy never done that an come out of it he looked anxious his thin face pinched with anxiety perhaps it was enlightened selfinterest given all the hot pies they had shared but monk still felt a twist of pleasure inside him and guilt actually ive been busy on something else he answered to divert scuffs attention he and orme had agreed on some preliminary plans which orme had been carrying out but there was no point in frightening scuff needlessly right now im busy trying to find out about a man who was killed just over a couple of months ago int yer a bit late scuff was concerned his young face puckered monks incompetence clearly puzzled and worried him for some reason or other he seemed to feel responsible monk was both touched and stung he found himself defending his position trying to regain respect the police thought at the time that it was suicide he explained then his daughter fell off the bridge and that was my case in looking back at that i found out about the father and it began to look as if it wasnt suicide after all wotcher mean fell orff the bridge scuff demanded nobody falls orff bridges yer cant theres rails an things somebdy kill er too or she jump im not sure about that either monk smiled ruefully and i saw it happen but when two people are struggling a distance away in the halflight just before the lamps go on its difficult to tell but er pa were killed by someone else scuff persisted yes the man was seen leaving i know pretty well what he looks like and that he went east beyond piccadilly scuff let out a sigh of despair that all yer got i dunno wot ter do wi yer he sniffed and wiped his nose on his sleeve monk hid his smile with difficulty scuff had apparently adopted him and felt every parents exasperation with an impossible child monk found himself ridiculously caught in an emotion that all but choked him well you might give me a little advice he suggested tactfully forget about it scuff replied you wont give me any advice monk was surprised scuff gave him a widening look thats me advice yer int gonna find im maybe not but im going to try monk said firmly he murdered a man and made it look like suicide so the man was buried outside christian ground and all his family believed he was a coward and a sinner it nearly broke his younger daughters heart so she spent all her time trying to prove that it wasnt so and now it looks as if she might have been killed for it too only they buried her outside christian ground as well and marked her as a suicide scuff skipped a step or two to keep up with monk yer daft you are but there was admiration in his voice well if you wont be told i spose id better elp yer wots e like this man wot killed the girls pa monk thought for a moment what risk was there in telling scuff if he kept it vague none at all thin dark hair he replied scuff looked at him his eyes hurt his mouth pinched yer don trust me he accused monk felt a twist of guilt knot inside him how could he undo the insult the rejection i dont want you to get involved he admitted if he kills people for money he wont think twice about getting rid of you if you get anywhere near him me scuff was indignant im not alf as green as you are i can look arter meself yer don think i got no brains i think youve got plenty of brainsquite enough to get close to him and get hurt monk retorted leave it alone scuff its police business and youre right he added ill probably never find him but its the man who paid him i want most scuff walked in silence for fifty yards or so they crossed the road and started along the next stretch will they bury that girl proper then he asked finally ill see that they do monk answered pleased that scuff had seen the heart of the matter so quickly im cold do you want a hot drink don mind if i do scuff said but grudgingly he was still hurt if this man werent killed on the river why int the reglar rozzers doin it they are as well they turned the corner away from the river and out of the worst of the wind the pavements were slick with ice a coal cart rattled sharply over the stones the horses breath steam in the air spose yer don trust em neither scuff said dourly it isnt a matter of trust monk told him we need all the help we can find were searching for one man in all london who makes a living killing people i know what he looks like but thats all he shot one man and caused the death of the mans daughter an innocent man may go to prison for the murder and the one who paid him is going to get away with it worse than that well never prove the real reason for it and there could be a cavein in one of the new sewer tunnels that would kill scores of men so no matter how difficult it is ive got to try now lets get a hot cup of tea and a hot pie each and stop sulking scuff digested that in silence for a few minutes as they walked don yer know nothin cept es thin an got black air he asked finally giving monk a sunny smile somebdy saw im so yer gotta know moren that he had a narrow nose and quite big eyes monk replied blue or gray and his teeth were unusually pointed scuff shrugged oh well mebbe youll find suffink then theres a man wi real good pies round there on the other side o the road and tea scuff rolled his eyes in exasperation o course es got tea pies int no good wiout tea in the afternoon monk went back to his river patrol duties forcing the havilland case and all its implications out of his mind the thefts had to be dealt with he owed that to durban but more than that to orme there was also the question of clacton he was very well aware that he had dealt with him only temporarily clacton was watching awaiting his chance to catch monk in another weakness or error it was about more than money his own promotion to please someone else simply to gain another commander one he could manipulate more easily the reason mattered little it could not wait much longer orme at least was expecting him to act maybe they all were had runcorn dreaded monk the same way as one of the burdens that comes with leadership to be endured until it can be dealt with he winced at the thought the river was cold the incoming tide swift and choppy and he was kept very fully occupied dealing with a warehouse theft at half past six it was solved and he stood alone on an old pier beyond king edwards stairs it was totally dark in the shelter of a halfburned warehouse across the water the shore lights glittered as the wind blurred them lightermen were calling out to each other below him on the river gusts of wind snatching their voices and distorting their words he heard the boat bump against the steps and someones feet climbing up then ormes solid figure was silhouetted against the faint light on the water monk moved forward found the cargo he said quietly did you get the boat they used yes sir butterworths gone to assist em now orme paused then said i ear as the mets arrested sixsmith that true at monks nod he sighed must say i believed it were argyll not as clever as i thought i were his voice was rueful i thought it was argyll too monk agreed i still do he told orme briefly of his intention to find the assassin orme was dubious yerll be lucky ter see ide or air of im mr monk but ill elp you all i can if anyoned know im itd be river men or folks that live in the tunnels or jacobs island e could be just a passing seaman off to burma the fever jungles o panama or the cape o good ope by now he wasnt a seaman monk said with conviction pale face thin and he used a gun in fact he used havillands own gun there was a good deal of careful planning in this i think he kills for a living theres im as do orme agreed the subject turned to the careful laying of the trap that would not only catch the actual thieves on the passenger boats but would lead with proof to the hand behind them monk and orme sincerely hoped that that was the fat man itll be dangerous orme warned it could turn ugly monk smiled yes im sure it could theres been something ugly about it from the beginning monk expected orme to respond perhaps to deny it but he remained silent why did he not understand what monk was alluding to or did he already know the answer why should he trust monk a newcomer to the river police he barely knew him they had never faced a real danger togethernothing more than choppy weather the odd barge out of control or night work when a ship in the dark could be lethal it was not enough to test a mans courage or loyalty to his fellows trust needed to be earned and only a fool placed his life in another mans hands blindly or was he protecting someone could he want monk to fail spectacularly so orme could take his place orme deserved it the men trusted him durban had which brought monk back to the old question why had durban recommended monk for the post it made no sense and standing here in the dark on the windy embankment with the constant slap of the water against the stones he felt as exposed as if he had been naked in the lights still he asked the question who put out the word that we are corrupt it came from someone i dunno sir ormes voice was low and hard but certain as death i mean ter find out they heard the boat bump against the steps it was time to go on patrol neither said anything more the plan would begin the following afternoon there was much to go over and prepare before then in order to catch the fat man himself they needed the thieves to steal one article of such value that they could neither divide it as they would a haul of money nor break it up as they would a piece of jewelry selling the separate stones it had to be something that was of worth only if it remained whole yet too specialized and too valuable to sell themselves monk and orme had obtained farnhams permission to borrow an exquisite carving of ivory and gold intact it was worth a fortune broken its only value was in the weight of the gold which wasnt much even at a glance a pickpocket would know that such a carving in good condition was worth enough to keep him for a decade if fenced successfully farnham had insisted that monk himself carry it you can look the part he said with a curl of his mouth as he passed over the figure wrapped in a soft chamois leather cloth he surveyed monks beautifully cut jacket and white shirt with its silk cravat and then his trousers and polished boots such clothes were a legacy from monks earlier years before the accident when most of his money went to his tailor they were not the fashion of a season as a womans gown would have been but timeless elegance they spoke of old money the kind of taste that is innate not put on to impress others farnham might not have been able to describe it but he knew what it meant it was inappropriate in a subordinate which was why farnhams smile troubled monk he remembered how runcorn had hated his attire and it made him even more uneasy thank you sir he took the carving and slipped it into the inside pocket of his coat it made a slight bump pulling it out of shape take care of it monk farnham warned the river police will go out of business if you lose that with the word going around now no one will believe we didnt take it ourselves monk felt odd was he walking straight into a trap knowing it and yet still stupid enough to step in or caught tightly enough to have no choice yes sir his voice was rasping as if the night air off the river had caught in his throat already orme will give you a cutlass later farnham added cant let you have a weapon yet even a knife a thief would feel and know there was something wrong its a shame leaves you a bit vulnerable but cant be helped he was still smiling thinlipped barely showing his teeth good luck thank you monk turned and left going to the outer room where the other men were waiting two of them were dressed as passengers in order to keep a firsthand watch on the thieves the rest were to remain in their own police boats close at hand so they could follow anyone easily if they were to escape by water orme nodded and signaled the men to go monk noticed with a chill and an anxious dryness in his mouth that they all carried cutlasses in their belts three of them carried extra weapons as well to arm those who were disguised should the whole operation end in violence monk had no idea if he had ever fought hand to hand in his years before the accident and certainly he had not since then he was a detective not a uniformed officer it was too late now to wonder if he was up to itstrong enough quick enough even if he had any skill with a cutlass he followed the men out into the hard cold wind each was prepared knowing his duty the main plan and the contingency there was nothing more to say outside on the quay orme divided his armed men into three boats and they pulled out and headed upriver monk and the two others who were dressed as passengers took a hansom up to westminster where they boarded the next ferry down towards greenwich the tide was slack but the wind was raw as they pulled out into the river monk was glad to go with the other passengers below deck into the cramped cabin where there was some shelter there were at least fifty other people on board men and women and several children everyone was wrapped up in winter coats that offered a host of places easy enough to hide the proceeds from picked pockets one obese gentleman wore a furcollared coat that flapped as he walked he could have hidden half a dozen onepound bags of sugar without causing any further bulges on his person a thin woman with voluminous shawls scolded three children who trailed after her she looked like an ordinary housewife but monk knew perfectly well that she could also be a passer of stolen goods one to whom the pickpocket gave them until he was safely free of suspicion and could take them back she would get her cut in time the plan was that if no one robbed him on the way down to greenwich he was to meet with one of the other policemen who was dressed as a passenger and show him the carving as if intending to sell it to him the policeman would pretend to decline and monk would return to westminster he refused even to imagine the possibility of the thieves taking it and not being caught on the other hand if they were arrested too soon then the whole operation was abortive the police would have the thiefthe fingers of the crimebut not the brain or the heart a man bumped against him apologized and moved on monks hands went to his pocket the carving was still there it happened again and again he was so nervous his fingers were stiff and trembling butterworth bumped into him and apologized using the password to let him know that he had been robbed why was the carving not gone without the theft they would not need to find the fat man they were past the surrey docks and heading down the limehouse reach ten minutes later monks pocket was empty and he had not even felt it panic broke over him in a wave the sweat hot and then cold on his skin he had no idea who had taken it not even whether it was man or woman he spun around where was butterworth thin man mustache sad face like a rat constable jones said almost at his elbow over there by the way up to the deck monk found himself gasping with relief barely able to draw enough air into his lungs should he say he knew who had taken the statue the lie died on his lips jones would see in his reaction that he had not thank you he said instead hes the one we have to watch never mind the others butterworth was almost six feet from the man with the mustache he was pretending to look for something in his coat pocket but his eyes were on the man he had seen too he and jones were good quicker than monk the boat reached the dog and duck stairs and the man with the carving got off monk jones and butterworth got off behind him as did half a dozen others the man walked down the quay back towards the greenland dock it was dark and there was a smell of rain in the wind here and there the streetlamps were lit it was in some ways the most difficult time to keep anyone in sight the shadows were deceptive you thought you saw someone and suddenly you didnt there were pools of light and long stretches of gloom the sound and movement and shifting reflections of water were everywhere monk jones and butterworth moved separately trying to give themselves three chances not to lose him it would be better to arrest him and catch no one else than lose the carving but then the whole exercise would have been a failure one thief was hardly here or there they would have betrayed their hand for nothing they were moving south again orme and his men should be keeping pace with them along the river there was another man in the shadows monk stopped abruptly afraid of catching up and being seen then he realized he should not have stopped it drew attention to him it was years since he had done this sort of thing he retraced his steps a couple of yards and bent down as if to pick up something he had dropped then went forward again the new man had caught up with the thief his outline under the lamppost looked familiar he was short and fat with a long overcoat and a brimless hat he had been on that boatanother thief a third man had joined them by the time they turned right and reached another ancient set of steps down to the water a boat was waiting for them and almost immediately the darkness swallowed them monk stood alone shifting from foot to foot desperately searching the darkness for orme where the devil was he there were barges moving upstream their riding lights glittering an icecold wind was whining among the broken pier stakes there was a noise behind him he spun around a man stood ten feet away he had not even heard him coming the slurp of the water masked his footsteps monk had no weapon and his back was to the river a boat scraped against the steps he strode over and saw several men in itrandan police formation there was room for two more which would be cramped although not dangerous orme was in the stern monk could not see his face but he recognized the way he stood outlined solid black against the shifting dimly reflecting surface of the water monk went down the steps as fast as he could his feet slithering on the wet slimecoated stone orme put out his hand and steadied him as he all but pitched forward on the last step he landed clumsily in the boat and scrambled to take one of the seats the next moment his hands closed over an oar and he made ready to throw his weight against it on the order butterworth came down the steps boarded and crouched in the stern the word was given and they pulled out into the stream they heaved hard to catch up with the thieves boat no one spoke each man was listening to the beat of the oars in the stern orme was straining to see ahead and to steady them against the wash of barges going up or downstream and to avoid any anchored boats waiting to unload on the wharves at daylight where were they going monk guessed jacobs island he tried to distinguish through the gloom the chaotic shapes of the shore there were cranes black against the skyline and the masts of a few ships there was a break in the roofs signaling the inlet to a dock then more warehouses again this time jagged some open to the sky walls askew as they sank into the mud he was rightjacobs island ten minutes later they were all on the soggy rubblestrewn shore creeping forward a few inches at a time feet testing the ground for litter traps where the planking had rotted and given way under the weight and broken timbers protruded through somewhere ahead of them the thieves were gathering from the thefts they had counted ten monk had a cutlass in his hand given him by orme the weight of it was unfamiliar but deeply reassuring please god he would know how to use it if he should have to they continued forward ten river police surrounding an unknown number of thieves and perhaps their receivers as well they were inside the first buildings now the remnants of abandoned warehouses cellars already flooded the sour stench of tidal mud and sewage refuse and dead rats was thick in the throat everything seemed to be moving dripping creaking as if the whole edifice were slipping lower into the ooze drowning inch by inch a rat scuttled by its feet scraping on the boards then it plopped into a puddle of water and the empty sounds of the night closed in again there was no living slap of the tide here only the groan of timber settling and breaking and sagging lower there were voices ahead and lights monk cutlass ready stood half behind a doorway and watched he could see the squat shapes of the men now no more than humps a deepening of the shadows but the man with the ivory carving was there he froze barely breathing he did not catch the words they said but flight actions were plain they were dividing the spoils of the day his stomach knotted at the sight of how much they had it was far more than he had known about he waited orme was somewhere to the left of him butterworth to the right jones and the others had gone around behind the chairs to encircle them the thieves were arguing over how to sell the ivory carving it seemed to go on interminably there were nine of them not ten monk must have miscounted earlier he was cold to the bone his feet numb his teeth chattering the odds were against them but the statue was what mattered above all he must get that back that and the fat man the stench of the mud almost choked him why didnt they agree with the obvious and take the carving to the fat man he was the king of the opulent receivers he would give them the best price for it because he would be able to find a buyer they werent going to they knew he would take half so they were going to try to sell it themselves then all monk would get would be the carving back and a handful of petty thieves it would stop the robberies for perhaps a week or two but what was that worth instinctively he turned towards orme and saw his face for an instant in the faintest light from the thieves candles the defeat in him twisted inside monk as if he himself were responsible for the failure another rat squeaked and ran claws rattling on the wood then there was a different sound softer heavier monks heart pounded in his chest and his mouth was dry orme turned the same instant as he did and both saw the shadow of a man blend into the sagging walls and disappear monk swiveled around the other way to his right butterworth was rigid listening he too had heard something and was straining his eyes but not to where monk had seen the man disappear butterworth was staring at least fifteen feet away monk was freezing his hand clenched on the hilt of the cutlass was like ice clumsy all thumbs his body was shaking he had been right the first time there had been ten but one of them had left betraying his fellows to whom the answer was already emerging into the pool of candlelight in what remained of the room a grotesquely fat man stepped forward his distended stomach swathed in a satin waistcoat his bloated face wreathed in smiles his eyes like bullet holes in white plaster silence gripped the thieves as if by the throat well said the fat man in a voice little more than a whisper what a pretty piece of work monk was not certain if he meant the betrayal or the ivory one man squeaked half a word then stifled it instantly the fat man ignored him discipline discipline he shook his head and his massive jowls wobbled without order we perish how many times have i told you that if you had given that to me openly and honestly as we agreed i would have sold it and given you half his mouth hardened he stood motionless but as i have had to take the trouble of coming for it myself and bringing my men with me i shall have to keep all of it expenses you see no one moved and discipline always discipline cant have things getting out of control no he barked the last word as one of the thieves made to stand up his hand going to his waist for a weapon very foolish doyle very foolish indeed do you imagine i have come unarmed now you know me better than that or perhaps you dont or you would not have tried such a stupid piece of duplicity but the man was too angry to heed a warning he drew a dagger out of his belt and lunged forward the fat man shouted and the next moment the shadows came alive there was a melee of heaving bodies flying arms and legs and the candlelight on the sudden bright arcs of knives and cutlasses it took less than a minute to realize that the fat mans followers were getting the better of it there were more of them and they were better armed orme was staring at monk waiting for the word for a sick blinding instant monk wanted to escape how many men could he lose in a swordfight in the candlelight with the thieves and the fat mans men against them then his mind cleared what were the odds to do with anything they were policemen they wore the queens uniform the fat man would take the carving and the police would have stood by like cowards and watched monk knew exactly how many men he would lose thenall of them forward he said and charged heading for the fat man the next moments were violent painful and terrifying monk was in the thick of it and at first the cutlass felt strange in his hand he was not sure whether to stab with it or hack a thin man scrawny but surprisingly powerful swung at him with a cudgel and caught him a glancing blow on the arm the pain of it jerked him into reality and hot anger he swung back with the cutlass and missed a knife tore the flesh of his right shoulder and he felt the hot blood this time his cutlass did not miss and the jar of its blade on bone rocked him but beyond the first taste of bile in his mouth there was no time to think what he might have done orme was to his right in trouble and clacton beyond was struggling jones came to his rescue where was the fat man monk turned and slashed at ormes attacker catching only his sleeve then again and again the metallic clash of steel the smells of sweat and blood fresh over the stink of slime he was hit from behind and fell forward managing at the last moment to hold his blade clear he rolled over and scrambled up again he lashed back and this time struck flesh there was a yell and curses all around him at least his own men were easier to recognize by the outline of their uniform tunics although most of their hats had been lost in the battle some memory within his own muscles brought back the skill to balance and lunge to duck keep upright push forward and strike his blood was hot and in some wild way he was almost enjoying it he barely felt his own pain then suddenly he was backed into a corner there were two men in front of him not one and then a third fear was sick and real he could not fight three men how had he been so careless a blade arced up he saw it gleam in the candlelight and beyond it for an instant clacton s face a couple of yards away smiling he could see him and clacton was not going to help there was nowhere for monk to run no room to step left or right hed take on one of them at least two if possible he dared not raise his arm to slash there was no space to swing he checked and lunged forward skewering the man to his left expecting any second to feel the blade through his own chest and then darkness oblivion he tried to yank his blade out but there was someone on top of it heavy lifeless pinning his arm down then he saw orme pulling his own blade free and understood what had happened better be quick sir orme said urgently weve done a good job one of the fat mans men killed the thief with the carving and now the fat mans got it himself weve got to get back to the boats monk responded without hesitation the thieves could fight it out among themselves he must get the fat man and the carving they could still win perhaps more swiftly and completely than in the original plan he snatched up the thiefs cutlass that moments ago would have meant his own death shuddering and stumbling he went back through the wreckage of the building after orme he blundered into wreckage and tripped falling headlong more than once but when he emerged into the winter night which was clearmooned and stinging with frost orme was a couple of yards in front of him twenty feet beyond the fat man floundered coat waving like broken wings his right fist held high with something clenched in it it had to be the carving orme was gaining on him monk forced himself to run faster he almost caught up with them just as they reached the edge of the rotted pier jutting twenty feet out into the river the boat was already waiting for the fat man and ormes men were beyond sight the fat man turned with a wave of triumph good night gentlemen he said with glee his voice rich and soft with laughter thank you for the ivory he pushed it into his pocket and swiveled there was a crack as the last whole piece of timber snapped under his vast weight for a hideous instant he did not understand what had happened then as it caved in he screamed and flailed his arms wildly but there was nothing to grasp only rotting crumbling edges the black water sucked and squelched below swallowing him with one immense gulp the moment after there was only the rhythmic slurp again as if he had never existed his heavy boots and his immense body weight had dragged him down and the mud beneath had held him as if in cement orme and monk both stopped abruptly the fat mans boatman saw them and scrabbled for the oars sending the craft back into the night in the moons glow the water was silverflecked and they were easily visible one of the police boats appeared from around the stakes of the next pier and went after them a second came for monk and orme and then a third hes got the ivory monk said it made the victory hollow farnham would consider it too high a price to pay for the evenings triumph and he would not let monk forget it well get im up orme assured him quietly up how we cant go down there a diver would be lost in minutes its mud grapples orme answered get em this tide well find im es got it in is pocket itll be safe enough he looked monk up and down with concern you got a nasty cut sir best get it attended to you know a doctor now that he thought about it monk was aware that his arm hurt with a steady pounding ache and that his sleeve was soaked with blood damn it was an extremely good coat or it had been yes he said absently it would be the sensible thing to do but what about the fat man that ooze could pull him down pretty far dont worry sir ill get a crew with grapples straightaway i know what that carvings worth he gave a grin so wide his teeth gleamed in the moonlight an itd be nice to pull the old bastard up an show im off bettern just tellin folk be careful monk warned sodden wet and covered in mud hell weigh half a ton oh at least orme started to laugh it was a rich happy sound a little high as if he was now realizing how close they had all come to defeat and he still did not know how badly any of the rest of his own men had been injured or even whether any had been killed then monk remembered clacton did orme know that he had deliberately held back if he did would he do anything about it would he expect monk to even as the thought came to him monk half made up his mind to face clacton not as a betrayer but as a coward it might be the better way he held out his left hand a good night he said warmly yes sir orme agreed taking it with his own left very good bettern i thought thank you it was not a formality he meant it orme caught the inflection yer welcome sir we done good but yerd best get that arm seen to its a nasty one monk obeyed and got into the waiting boat a little awkwardly his arm was stiffening already it was nearly an hour later on the north bank again and close to midnight when he finally sat on a wooden chair in the small back room of a young doctor known as crow monk had met him through scuff when durban was alive and they were working on the louvain case crow shook his head he had a high forehead and black hair that he wore long and cut straight around his smile was wide and bright showing remarkably good teeth so you got em he said examining the gash in monks arm while monk studiously looked away from it concentrating his anger on the wreck of his jacket yes monk agreed gritting his teeth and the fat man youll be clever if you get to jail him crow said pulling a face very monk agreed wincing hes dead dead without meaning to crow pulled on the thread with which he was stitching monks arm sorry he apologized really are you sure the fat man absolutely monk clenched his teeth tighter he fell through a rotted pier on jacobs island went straight down into the slime and never came back up crow sighed with profound satisfaction how very fitting ill tell scuff hell be glad at least you got that sorted hold still this is going to hurt monk gasped and felt a wave of nausea engulf him for several moments as the pain blotted out everything else then there was a sharp acrid sting in his nose that brought tears to his eyes what the hell is that he demanded smelling salts crow replied you look a bit green smelling salts monk was incredulous crow grinned all teeth and good humor thats right good stuff so you got the fat man thatll help your reputation no end nobody ever did that before our reputation was rather in need of help monk said his eyes still stinging somebodys been spreading the word that we were not only incompetent but very probably corrupt as well id dearly like to know who that was i dont suppose youve any idea he looked at crow as steadily as his groggy condition would permit crow shrugged and turned his mouth down at the corners you want the truth of course i do monk said tartly but with a touch of fear who was it i cant survive blind actually it wasnt so much the whole river police as you personally crow answered everybody that matters knows it was never mr durban and mr orme s pretty good me monk felt dizzy again and the wound in his arm throbbed violently it was hard to believe it was only a cutnothing to worry about crow had insisted it would heal up nicely if he gave it a chance youve got enemies mr monk youve upset somebody with a lot of power obviously monk snapped he clenched his fist then wished he hadnt crow gave him a sudden dazzling smile but youve got friends as well mr orme made sure you all stood together crow monk began crow blinked and the smile remained you look after mr orme hes a good one loyal worth a lot loyalty ill get a cab to take you home youll only fall on your face and you dont want to have to explain that you a hero an all monk glared at him but actually he was gratefulfor the ministration for the cab but above all for knowing of ormes loyalty he made up his mind that from now on he would try harder to deserve it but who had spread the word that he was corrupt personally argyll again nine it was well into february when aston sixsmith came to trial he had been free on bail since shortly after his arrest having been charged only with bribery but you are going to be able to prove argylls complicity arent you monk said to rathbone the evening before testimony began monks wound was healing well and they were comfortable before a brisk fire in rathbones house rain was beating against the windows and the gutters were awash they still had not found the actual assassin in spite of every effort and river police duties had consumed most of monks time since the death of the fat man it had been a hideous job catching grapples into the corpse and hauling it up through the jagged hole in the pier but the carving had been retrievedto monks intense relief and to mixed emotions in farnhams case if it had been lost farnham would have blamed monk not himself as it was monk was now more firmly entrenched in his new position than was entirely comfortable for him and clacton was inexplicably subdued he obviously loathed monk but something compelled him to treat his new commander with respect monk had yet to learn what this new element was argylls guilty of murder monk insisted to rathbone and more important than that there is still the danger of the disaster in the tunnels that havilland feared but you cant tell me what it is rathbone pointed out they are using the same engines as before and nothing has happened i know monk admitted ive searched everything i can find but no one will talk to me all the navvies are afraid for their jobs theyd rather face a possible cavein sometime in the future than certain starvation now ill do what i can rathbone promised but i have no idea yet how to disentangle the guilty argyll from the relatively innocent sixsmith not to mention argylls wife who is no doubt afraid to face the truth about him not to mention public disgrace and the loss of her home plus theres the mp applegate who gave argyll the contract and the totally innocent navvies who operate the machines and theres also superintendent runcorn who conducted the original enquiry into havillands death he will be blamed for having called it suicide and closing the case are you prepared for all of them to go down as well tarred with the same brush guilty by association no monk said flatly no im not the thought was so ugly it twisted inside him well it might be a choice between having them all to be sure of getting the guilty one or letting them all go to be sure of saving the innocent rathbone told him if it comes to that then ill let them go monk said harshly but not without damn well trying rathbone looked at him sadly accusation without proof will damn the innocent and let the guilty go free monk had no argument what rathbone said was true and he understood it were too late to back out now i could drop the charge against sixsmith driven by something more than anger at argyll or the need to win monk said aloud we have to do everything we can to find out if havilland was afraid of a real disaster or just of tunneling in the dark and if mary learned it too and was killed for it then we cant walk away he knew as he said it that that was not entirely what was impelling him it was mary havillands white face smeared with river water that haunted his mind even if all those other elements were solved it would never be enough until her name was cleared and she and her father were buried as they would have wished but rathbone did not need to know that it was a private wound deep inside him inextricably wound into his love for hester rathbone was looking at him ive investigated the argylls engines theyre pretty much the same as everyone elses better because theyve been modified with great skill and considerable invention but no more dangerous theres something monk insisted then bring it to me rathbone said simply in the old bailey the next morning after the jury was appointed and the opening addresses were delivered oliver rathbone began the case for the prosecution his first witness was runcorn monk sat in the public gallery with hester beside him neither of them was a witness so it was permissible for them to attend he glanced at her grave face it was pale and he knew she was thinking of mary havilland he imagined what she must be remembering of her own grief and the sense of helplessness and guilt because she had not been there for her father and mother with such events monk knew there was always the belief however foolish that there was something one could have said or done that would have made a difference but he had not seen anger in her or heard her blame her brother james for not somehow preventing it she had never lashed out at him that monk knew of how did she keep at bay the bitterness and the sense of futility then a sudden thought struck him how incredibly stupid he was not to have seen it before was her need to throw herself into fighting pain injustice and helplessness her way of making the past bearable was her readiness to forgive born of her own understanding of what it was to fail she worked with all her strength at portpool lane not only to meet a fraction of the womens needs but to answer her own as well anything short of her whole heart in the battle could never be enough for her he was guarding her from the danger without because he was afraid for himselfafraid of what losing her would mean he was thinking of his own sleepless nights his imagination of her danger all the time he was increasing the danger within impulsively he reached across and put his hand over hers holding her softly after a moment her fingers responded he knew what that moment meant it was the loss of something inside her which he had taken away he would have to put it back as soon as he could however afraid he was for her or for himself without her right now runcorn was climbing the twisting steps to the high exposed witness stand he looked uncomfortable in spite of the fact that he must have testified in court countless times over the years he was neatly dressed even excessively soberly as if for church his collar starched and too tight he answered all rathbones questions precisely adding nothing his voice was uncharacteristically touched with grief as if he too was thinking not of james havilland but of mary rathbone thanked him and sat down runcorn turned a bleak face towards mr dobie counsel for the defense who rose to his feet straightened his robes and walked forward into the well of the court he looked up at the high witness stand with its steps and squinted a little at runcorn as if uncertain exactly what he saw he was a young man with a soft face and a cloud of curly dark hair superintendent runcornthat is your rank isnt it he asked his expression was bland almost timid yes sir runcorn replied just so that implies that you are considerably experienced in investigating violent deathsaccidental suicidal and murderous yes sir you are good at it runcorn was startled i apologize dobie shook his head that was an unfair question modesty forbids that you reply honestly i will accept that you are he glanced momentarily at rathbone as if half expecting an objection rathbone would not object and they both knew it i have no quarrel with mr dobie s conclusion my lord even if it seems a little premature the judge s face tightened in appreciation of his predicament in the dock high above the proceedings and where those in the gallery had to crane their necks sideways to see him aston sixsmith sat gripping the rails with his hands his knuckles were white his eyes unmoving from dobie s figure dobie looked at runcorn may we assume that you took the death of james havilland very seriously of course runcorn could see where this question was leading but still he could not avoid the trap he had long since learned not to add anything he did not need to and you concluded that he had taken his own life yes sirthe first time runcorn was forcing himself not to fidget he stood as if frozen dobie smiled i will ask you in due course why you judged it necessary to consider it a second time you did judge it necessary didnt you it was not some other sort of reason that drove you to go back again to a closed casea favor owed or a sense of pity for example no sir but runcorns face betrayed that the answer was less than the whole truth monk moved uncomfortably in his seat he ached to be able to help runcorn but there was nothing at all he could do what made you conclude that havilland had killed himself the first time that is dobie asked with gentle interest the gun beside him the fact that nothing was stolen and no sign of a breakin runcorn said miserably was there anything of value a thief could have taken yes sir did you find any evidence that mr havilland had been anxious or distressed recently no one expected him to take his own life runcorn insisted people seldom do dobie gave a slight shrug it is always difficult to imagine whose gun was it that he usedim sorry that was used superintendent runcorns face was tight his jaw clenched his large hands gripped the rail of the stand his own and of course you verified that yes perhaps you would be good enough to tell the court what on earth made you go back two months later and question your first decision that initial decision seems eminently sensiblein fact the only decision you could have reached runcorns face was deep red but his gaze back at dobie did not waver his daughter also died in tragic and questionable circumstances he replied questionable dobies eyebrows rose and his tone was one of disbelief i thought she also took her own life have i misunderstood is she not also buried in a suicides grave it was dobies first tactical error beside monk hester closed her eyes and the delicate corners of her mouth tightened she sat motionless old memories clearly raw inside her in the rest of the gallery there was a slight sigh monk turned to see the jurors faces and found pity and distaste they might not disagree but they found the reference cruel dobie had not realized it yet he was waiting for runcorn to answer runcorns face was bleak his voice soft and startlingly full of emotion it was the haste and possible injustice of that decision that made me look at mr havillands death again he replied i knew mary havilland because of her fathers death she was always certain he was murdered i didnt believe her then but her own death drew me to go back and look at her fathers once more there was a flush of anger on dobies lineless face are you being strictly honest with us superintendent was it not actually a visit from a certain mr monk that caused you to look at it again he is a friend of yours is he not and please do not be disingenuous runcorn was tightlipped monk and i served together some years ago he answered hes now with the river police and since he was investigating mary havillands death and heard about her father yes of course he came to me to find out in more detail what had happened and you told him what you had originally concluded that havilland shot himself i told him the details of our investigation in light of the daughters death as well we looked into it again runcorn said doggedly in case you were mistaken superintendent i hope not but if i am im man enough to own it a second tactical error there was a rumble of applause in the gallery hester smiled her eyes bright with approval dobie ridiculed runcorn a little further then realized he was doing his case more harm than good and let him go the police surgeon gave a very wide range for the time of havillands death in answer to rathbones questions dobie picked it out but did not argue rathbone called cardman who stood in the witness box ramrod stiff like a soldier facing a firing squad his lips were tight and his skin almost bloodless monk could only imagine how he must loathe this in as few words as possible he answered rathbones questions about the letter that had been delivered and given to havilland he described havillands response dismissing the servants to retire and expressing the intention to stay up late and secure the house for the night himself he identified the handwriting on the envelope as that of havillands elder daughter mrs argyll rathbone thanked him dobie rose to his feet a slight smile on his face this must be very unpleasant for you cardman did not answer did you see the contents of the envelope cardman was startled no sir of course not the suggestion that he would read his masters mail was clearly repugnant to him did mr havilland tell you what was in it perhaps no sir so you have no idea as to its contents no sir do you know where this letter is now mr havilland destroyed it i believe you believe that is what the maid said who took it to him destroyed it i see dobie smiled perhaps that accounts for why sir oliver has not given us the privilege of reading it mr cardman have you any reason whatever to believe that this letter had anything whatever to do with mr havillands death cardman took a deep breath and let it out soundlessly no sir neither have i dobie agreed he gave a little shrug and turned out his hands palms upwards neither has anyone the first witness of the afternoon was melisande ewart runcorn having given his own evidence was free to remain in the courtroom he sat on the other side of the aisle in the gallery monk was acutely conscious of his stiff shoulders clenched hands eyes never moving from melisandes face she stood in the witness box calm but for two spots of color high in her cheeks rathbone was gentle with her drawing from her bit by bit the account of runcorn and monks visit to her and exactly what she had told them finally he had her describe the man who had emerged from the mews and bumped into her thank you mrs ewart he concluded please remain where you are in case mr dobie wishes to speak to you monk looked again at the jury and saw sharp interest in their faces and approval also she was a woman of gentleness and considerable beauty and she had conducted herself with quiet grace dobie would be a fool to attack her nevertheless he did you were returning from the theater you said maam he began yes she agreed at about midnight yes a little late did you attend a party after the final curtain no the traffic was very heavy it must have been what play did you see obviously he already knew the answer hamlet she answered a great tragedy perhaps the greatest but full of violence and unnatural death he observed murder after murder including hamlets own father as he finally succeeded in proving i am familiar with the plot she said a little coldly runcorns knuckles were white and his big hands clenched and unclenched slowly and just as you arrived home dobie went on late and emotionally drained by one of the most powerful plays in the english language you see a man emerge from the mews near your home he sounded reasonable even soothing it is dusk he almost bumps into you he apologizes for being clumsy and a little drunk and goes on his way have i summarized correctly what actually happened mrs ewart she hesitated her eyes going to rathbone as if for help runcorn half rose in his seat and then subsided his face tight with anger hester grasped monks arm her fingers digging into him you are not incorrect sir so much as incomplete melisande replied to dobie the man was a stranger in the area and he had no legitimate business in the mews there was a large dark stain on the shoulder of his jacket i did not ask about it but he saw that i had noticed it and he told me that it was manure he had tripped and fallen in the mews but it was a lie i was close enough to him to have smelled manure it smelled more like blood even if it was blood that does not mean he was guilty of murder dobie argued melisandes eyes widened you mean he might have been in mr havillands stable and fallen over his dead body innocently without thinking he should mention it dobies face flamed and there was a titter of embarrassed laughter around the courtroom bravo hester whispered to monk runcorn was smiling his eyes bright his cheeks red dobie returned to the attack but he was losing and he knew it moments later he retreated rathbone thanked melisande again and then called the first of his nervous uninteresting but very necessary witnesses who were going to prove the trail of the money aston sixsmith had paid to the assassin they detailed every move from argylls bank to its final destination this line of enquiry was tedious but essential it would continue for the rest of the dayand if dobie wanted to contest any of it it would go on probably longer than that when the court adjourned there was no time for private conversation monk excused himself from hester and caught up with rathbone in the corridor outside i need to speak with sixsmith he said urgently can you manage it persuade him to see me how rathbone looked tired in spite of the victory with melisande ewart such as it was ive already gone over every argument i can think of with sixsmith the man is desperate and numb with what has happened to him he has worked for argyll for years and feels totally betrayed so he should monk answered matching his stride with rathbones and if we prove it was murder but not that argylls the one who hired the assassin then sixsmith will pay for it on the end of a rope all right rathbone said quickly you dont need to labor the point but dont give him false hope monk there was warning in his eyes even fear i dont intend to monk replied hoping he could keep his promise exactly the opposite it took rathbone half an hour to arrange the meeting in a room off the corridor leading away from the court itself sixsmith looked somehow smaller than he had in the tunnel when monk had seen him before dressed in an ordinary suit he was broadshouldered and solid but not so tall his hair was neatly barbered his shirt white his hands clean his nails were unbrokenremarkably so considering the surroundings in which he usually worked he sat in the chair opposite monk putting his hands on the table between them his skin was pale and he had cut himself shaving a tiny muscle twitched in his temple on the left side what is it he said bluntly havent you done enough there was no time for monk to soften any of what he must say however harsh it sounded sir oliver rathbone can tie every detail of the money all the way from argylls bank to you passing it to the man who murdered havilland if you think im going to plead guilty you are wasting your time sixsmith said angrily and more to the point youre wasting mine as well i never denied that i paid the money i thought it was to bribe a bunch of ruffians to see off some of the toshers who were giving us a hard time and spreading rumors about uncharted underground rivers and scaring the hell out of some of the navvies then say so monk challenged him sixsmiths heavy lip curled admit to bribing thugs to knock around a few men who are no more than a nuisance theyll have me in jail so fast ill barely see the ground are you a fool no but you are monk responded rathbone will prove it anyway if you want to come out of this alive youll admit to the attempt to bribe it didnt work so there was no crime actually committed there was murder sixsmith said savagely his face dark with emotion if thats not a crime what in gods name is did you know it was going to be murder no of course i didnt sixsmiths voice was harsh desperate i know beating the toshers was illegal though but what the hell do the men in parliament know about the real world would they bend their backs to a days labor hacking and piling earth and rocks winching them up to the surface or living all the daylight hours in some stinking dripping ratinfested hole burrowing like a damn rat yourself so the sewers can run clean he took a deep breath his chest heaving weve got to get rid of the toshers who are spreading fear just to keep their old beats in the sewers that are left do you know what a toshers beat is worth yes monk said tartly and i know they hate change so tell the court that tell them that argyll knew it too and couldnt afford to let it go on sixsmith looked exhausted as if he had been battling the same arguments in his head for weeks monk felt an intense pity for him im sorry he said gently to be betrayed by someone you trusted is one of the worst pains a man can know but you have no time now to dwell on it you must save yourself by telling not just the truth but all of it sixsmith raised his head and gave him a smile that was more a baring of the teeth argyll will simply say that he gave me the money to buy off the toshers so they would leave the navvies alone and i am the one who used it to have havilland killed why would you do that sixsmith hesitated a moment why monk repeated its argylls company not yours your reputation is excellent if he went under you could find a new position in days you know my reputation sixsmith sounded surprised of course argyll couldnt afford to have havilland sabotage his tunnel he must have contacted the assassin but got you to hand the money to him why would he do that except to incriminate you if anyone ever discovered havillands death was murder it was deliberate sixsmith blinked rapidly his face a mask of pain still fighting not to believe it were you the first to speak to the assassin monk pressed he hated forcing sixsmith to see it but his life could depend on it or did argyll set up the meeting give you the money and tell you to pass it over of course he did sixsmith said in a whisper do you know who the assassin was do you know where to find him now or anything about him at all monk asked no sixsmith stared at him no i dont who asked mrs argyll to write to her father and have him go out and wait in the stables at midnight you believe there really was a letter sixsmiths eyes widened did anyone see it yes i believe there was monk answered she admitted it but we cant force her to testify against her husband sixsmith dropped his head in his hands as if someone had offered him hope then dashed it from his lips we can try to persuade her monk wanted passionately to help him to give him the strength to go on for your own sake he said urgently tell the truth about the money tell dobie everything he cant help sixsmith whispered he thinks he can but hes young and imagines hell always win he wont this time argylls surrounded himself with too many people who are innocent theres jenny poor mary havilland the navvies who carried out his orders to fight the toshers now and then the poor devils dont have a choice its work or starve and we have to meet the deadline in the contract or we wont get another he looked at monk as if trying to discern if he understood and theres the mp morgan applegate who gave us the contracts for those sites he could be implicated in bribes and profit argyll knows all that he arranged it that way i havent a chance mr monk id best go down for bribing someone to murder a man and not take all those others with me ill go anyway hes seen to that he faced monk with haunted eyes still clinging to a hope beyond reason and on the edge of losing it monk did something he had sworn he would not do rathbone doesnt want to convict you he said quietly its argyll hes after he knows as well as you do that hes the man behind it tell the truth fight for your life and hell help you sixsmith stared at him aching to believe him the struggle was naked in his eyes in the bruised planes of his face and the twist of his mouth at last very slowly he nodded hester had been to see rose applegate more than once since developing their mutual plan to do what they could to clear mary havillands name from the stigma of suicide two days before the trial they had gone together to a charity afternoon reception organized to raise money for orphans to give them a decent education so that they might be of use both to themselves and to society it was the sort of obviously worthy cause that even a woman in mourning such as jenny argyll might still feel free to attend are you sure she will be there hester had asked anxiously certainly she will rose had assured her lady dalrymple specifically invited the argylls and she is at just the level of society one dare not disappoint she is sufficiently nouveau riche to notice and take offense if one declined unless you positively had a contagious disease anyway mrs argyll has spent the entire winter season in mourning so she is desperate to get out before she dies of boredom and everyone who is anyone has forgotten who she is so hester and rose had set out to join the worthy women attending the event and had contrived to spend quite a good amount of time in jenny argylls company they had managed to fall with apparent ease into the subject of bereavement and the whole ghastliness of the upcoming trial of aston sixsmith she knows something rose said to hester when they met the following day on the eve of the trial they were alone in roses withdrawing room sitting beside the fire outside the february rain lashed the windows streaming down the glass until it was impossible to even see the traffic passing in the street beyond i am quite sure she will refuse to see us again unless she has absolutely no alternative rose said miserably and how would we possibly run into her with sixsmith on trial for arranging the murder of her father and she herself in mourning for both her father and her sister she is hardly going to attend any public functions lady dalrymples ghastly affair for the betterment of orphans isnt going to happen again for years isnt there any sort of other function she might go to hester asked even if just to show a certain bravado there must be something suitably somber and of course rose said her face alight with glee the perfect thing they are holding a memorial service for sir edwin roscastle the day after tomorrow hester was at a loss who was he and would she go roses expression was comical with distaste a frightful old humbug but very influential because he made such a parade of being good could flatter all the right people and it got him no end of appreciation she replied everybody likes to be seen praising the virtuous dead makes them feel good by association she sniffed morgan doesnt have anything to do with it because he couldnt stand roscastle and didnt pretend his feelings were otherwise but i know lord montague who will be arranging it and i can persuade him to ask argyll for a donation and to become a patron of the memorial fund hed never refuse thatits far too useful in business are you sure of course i am its at eight oclock tomorrow evening and we can both go hester was alarmed it was a superb idea far too good to miss but it was years since she had been to such a function and she most certainly had nothing suitable to wear rose i it was embarrassing to admit and it might even look as if she had lost her nerve and were making excuses rose looked at her then suddenly understood short notice to get a gown she said tactfully borrow one of mine im taller than you are but my maid can take it up this afternoon we must make a plan of action thus it was that hester accompanied rose applegate to the memorial service for the late sir edwin roscastle it was an extremely formal affair with a large number of people attending including the cream of society they arrived at the church and alighted from their carriages in magnificent blacks purples grays and lavenders according to the degree of mourning they wished to display and the color they believed most became them some were deeply mistaken as to the latter as rose observed to hester in a whisper as she pointed out who they were rose herself was wearing lavender and dark gray with her fair hair and pale skin she cut an extremely elegant figure there she is hester interrupted as she saw jenny argyll walking up the steps clothed in highly fashionable black she moved with grace and a complete disregard for the biting easterly wind although she did take care to keep to the leeward of her husband rose shivered convulsively we can go in now why on earth do they always seem to hold these things at the bitterest time of the year why cant people die with some consideration in the summer it will be warmer at the reception afterwards hester replied i hope to heaven the argylls stay for it of course they will rose assured her that is where one can curry favor make useful acquaintances and generally show off which of course is what everyone is here for isnt anyone here to remember sir edwin rose gave her a startled glance certainly not she retorted he was awful the sooner he can be forgotten the better dying was the best thing he did and he did that far too slowly hester thought the judgment rather harsh but she liked rose too much to say so and by the time they had sat through the eulogies and she heard what kind of people admired the deceased and why she was inclined to take a similar view the reception afterwards was a different matter everyone else seemed to be just as physically cold and emotionally bored as she and rose were they walked rapidly up the hundred yards or so of dark and windy street to the hall where sausages pies and delicate hot pastries awaited them along with various wines hester accepted a mulled claret with gratitude she was surprised when rose took a lemonade instead but she made no comment they began to move among the other guests intent upon approaching jenny argyll as soon as it could be done without appearing too obvious and of course when argyll himself wasnt too close to her im so pleased you came rose said warmly to jenny as an opening gambit there are few things one can do while in mourning without someone making a cutting remark one feels dreadfully isolated at least i did perhaps i am imagining mistakenly jenny could hardly fail to reply without being discourteousadded to which rose was the wife of the member of parliament most important to her husband she gathered her wits with an apparent effort not at all you are most sympathetic she responded hester remained standing back a few steps as if rose was alone jenny argyll looked composed but hester could see that the veneer was thin her movements were stiff and her skin looked bruised around the eyes as if from too many nights awake and too much tightly held emotion she dared not let go of in case she never grasped it again hester would have been sorry for her if she had not been convinced jenny had placed her own safety and continued wellbeing ahead of that of her sister suddenly alan argyll was at hesters elbow a plate of savory pastries in his hand excuse me he brushed past her his attention focused on his wife his face tight and angry it was almost as if he was frightened that she would in some way betray him he spoke to rose but his words were lost to hester in the general babble of conversation he put his hand on jennys arm protectively she moved sideways away from him was it because there was a large woman in black wishing to pass or because his touch displeased her her head was high her face half averted the movement was discreet a shrinking away more than an actual step rose spoke again her eyes wide and tense hester moved closer she wanted to catch the words the inflection of the voices was jenny argyll protecting her husband because she wanted to or because she needed to had she any idea of what he had done was that why instinctively she found his touch repellent rose turned and saw hester and introduced them she hesitated a moment over hesters name knowing that monk would produce powerful and conflicting emotions in both jenny and argyll how do you do hester said as calmly as she could looking first at jenny then at her husband he did not attract her but neither did she find him ugly she did not see the cruelty in him that she had expected even the power in him seemed blunted was he at last afraid not of the police but of his wifes ability to testify against him in court it was her father and her sister whose deaths he had caused what monumental arrogance in him had ever made him imagine she would endure that and do nothing and was she still so terrified that even now she would shield him was evil really masked by so ordinary a face or was hester simply blind to it rose was making some trivial conversation they were waiting for hester to play her part yes of course she said hoping it was a reasonably appropriate response argyll was looking at her his eyes cold and guarded jennys voice sounded strained too sharp and too high the conversation was all trivial a remembrance of the dead man and the causes he had supported a footman passed by with a tray of glasses filled with mulled wine and lemonade they were a little crowded there was no room for the footman to pass between them argyll took the tray from him and offered it to hester considering the potency of the mulled wine she had drunk on entering she decided that lemonade might be wiser this time thank you she said accepting a glass because of the way they were standing jenny next to her husband it was natural to pass the tray to her next jenny hesitated a moment over the lemonade then chose the wine rose took the lemonade as before she lifted her glass to the brave men who pioneer social reform she said and drank deeply the rest of them echoed the sentiment more food was offered this time it was sweet pastries filled with crushed dried fruit or delicate custards with unusual flavors a portly man with heavy side whiskers took argylls attention a threepiece musical ensemble began playing a slow solemn tune rose turned to jenny isnt it awful she said confidentially pulling her mouth down at the corners jenny appeared startled so far they had shared the artificial conversation of acquaintances who did not care for each other but were civil in their mutual interest suddenly rose giggled it was a rich absurdly happy sound not the food the music if you can call it that why on earth cant we be honest nobody feels like playing a dirge because the old fool is dead most of them couldnt wait for him to go death is about the only thing that finally made him hold his tongue jenny pretended she was not taken aback she took a deep breath and answered with a slightly shaky voice that may be true but we would be wiser not to say so mrs applegate hester realized she had been holding her breath almost till it hurt what on earth was the matter with rose this was not part of their plan to be wise all the time is the utmost foolishness rose said rather loudly we are so careful being wise we never commit any indiscretions unless they are colossal and catastrophic she swung her arms wide to show how very huge the indiscretions were nearly knocking jennys glass out of her hand look what youre doing she reproached her bad wine stains you know jenny looked embarrassed several other people turned to look at rose then away again quickly a waiter passed and rose took another glass from his tray but this time she took the wine she drank it down in one long draught then tossed the glass over her shoulder it fell on the floor with a tinkle as it broke she ignored it entirely and strode over towards the musicians she made a magnificent figure head high skirts swaying her handsome face bristling with life she stood in front of the dais for heavens sake stop that awful screeching she commanded fiercely you on the violin you sound like a cat wailing for a fish head unless you think the poor old sod went to dismal torment which i admit is likely try to sound as if you believed in the forgiveness of god and some chance of heaven for him the violinist clasped her hands to her bosom and let the violin slither down her dress and fall onto the floor rose stooped and picked it up she put it under her chin seized the bow and began to play astonishingly well she began with the same music they had been playing but she altered the tempo to that of the music hall and then slid into one of the concert songs swift and bawdy the pianist gave a little squawk of horror and sat stark still with her mouth open the cellist burst into tears oh stop it rose commanded her pull yourself together and hold that thing properly she pointed to the cello like a lover not as if it just made you an indecent proposal the cellist flung the instrument on the ground and fled the bow trailing behind her someone in the audience fainted or pretended to another began to laugh hysterically a man started to sing the words to the song he had a rich baritone voice andmost unfortunatelyknew all the words hester stood frozen aware of jenny beside her and alan argyll a few feet away paralyzed rose did not hesitate a stroke but kept on playing in perfect time swaying and tapping her feet suddenly the pianist abandoned all propriety and joined in her face was fixed in a terrified smile showing all her teeth alan argyll jerked to life moving to stand at hesters elbow for heavens sake he hissed cant you do anything to stop her this is appalling morgan applegate will never live it down hester realized she was probably the only person who could do anything she was roses friend therefore it was an act of the utmost compassion and necessity that she intervene she walked forward to the dais picked up her borrowed and rather long skirts and stepped up rose was still playing very elegantly she was on to a different song now but no better rose hester said quietly but with as much authority as she could manage thats enough now let the violinist have her instrument back its time we went home home sweet home rose said cheerfully and loudly thats a terrible song hester positively maudlin were celebrating sir whatshisnames death at leasti mean were remembering his life with with regrets i shouldnt have said that she started to laugh far too close to the truth should never speak the truth at funerals if a man was a crashing bore like lord kinsdale you say he was fearfully wellbred there was a gasp of horror from the maid if a woman had a face like a burst boot such as lady alcott she went on you say what a kind heart she had she laughed again stepping back out of hesters reach and speaking even more loudly if he was a liar and a cheat like mr worthington you praise his wit if he betrayed his wife with half the neighborhood you talk all about his generosity everyone keeps a straight face and weeps a lot into their handkerchiefs to hide their laughter she hiccupped and ignored it you dont understand she went on looking a little dizzily at hester youve spent too much time in the army oh god someone groaned someone else began to giggle and couldnt stop it was wild hilarious hysterical laughter soaring higher and higher rose was hopelessly drunk she must have had far more than hester had seen or realized was this the terrible weakness that morgan applegate had been trying to guard her against had he the faintest idea what she was like what she was saying so devastatingly loudly was awful the worse for being perfectly true and what everyone was secretly thinking rose was about to start playing the violin again the pianist was waiting half in agony half in ecstasy it was probably a night she would remember for the rest of her life she kept her eyes straight ahead and took a deep breath then plunged in with a resounding bass chord and then a trill on the top notes hester was desperate it was all completely out of control and part of her was on the edge of laughter it was only the knowledge of ruin that stopped her joining in she snatched the violin bow from rose gripping it around the middle in a fashion that probably did it little good she flung it behind her towards the back of the dais where at least no one would tread on it the original violinist was still collapsed in a heap and someone was waving a fan at her quite uselessly the cellist had disappeared completely you are going home because you are no longer welcome here hester told rose as sternly as she could put that violin down and take my arm do as you are told i thought we could play a game rose protested charades dont you think or perhaps notwere playing it all the time really arent we or blindmans buff we could all grope around bumping into each other and grabbing hold of the prettiest or the richest no thats being done too all the time what do you suggest she looked at hester expectantly hester could feel her face burning come home she said between her teeth suddenly overtaken with fury at the senseless destruction of a reputation now rose was startled by the tone rather than the words reluctantly she obeyed hester put an arm around her and grasped her wrist with her other hand awkwardly but efficiently she marched her to the edge of the dais rose however misjudged the step tripped over her skirt and pitched forwards only just saving herself from serious hurt by dragging hester with her and at the last moment by putting out her hands to break her fall hester landed hard knocking the breath out of her lungs this saved her from using a word that had not passed her lips since the days in the army that rose had referred to struggling to disentangle herself from her skirts and stand up without treading on rose and falling flat again she rose with great difficulty to her feet get up she commanded furiously rose rolled over slowly and sat up looking stunned then began to laugh again hester leaned forward caught roses hand and jerked hard rose slid forward but remained on the floor it was alan argyll who came out of the crowd everyone else was milling around trying to pretend nothing had happened and either surreptitiously looking at the spectacle or studiously avoiding looking for gods sake get her out of here he snarled at hester dont just stand there lift he bent and hauled rose to her feet balancing her with some skill so that she would not buckle at the knees then as she began to subside again he picked her up put her over his shoulder and marched her towards the door hester could do nothing but follow behind outside it was not a difficult matter to send for roses coachman ten minutes later argyll assisted her with considerable strength into the coach i assume you will go with her he said looking at hester with disdain you seem to have arrived with her somebody needs to explain this to her husband she cant make a habit of it or shell be locked up i shall manage very well hester assured him tartly i think she has gone to sleep her servants will help as soon as we get that far thank you for your assistance good night she was angry embarrassed and now that it was over a little frightened what on earth was she going to say to morgan applegate as argyll had pointed out his political career would never recover from this it would be spoken of for years even decades the ride was terrible not for anything rose did but for what hester feared she would do they sped through the lamplit streets in the rain the cobbles glistening the gutters spilling over the constant sound of drumming on the roof splashing beneath and the clatter of hooves and hiss of wheels they lurched from side to side because they were going too fast as the coachman was afraid rose was ill and needed help hester was dreading what applegate would say no words had been exchanged but she felt he had trusted her to care for rose from the first time they had met hester had seen a protectiveness in him as if he was aware of a peculiar vulnerability in his wife one he could not share with others now it seemed that hester had quite extraordinarily let them both down except that she had had no idea how it had happened the carriage came to an abrupt halt but rose did not seem to wake up there was shouting outside and more lights then the carriage door opened and a footman appeared he leaned in without even glancing at hester lifted rose with great care and carried her across the mews and in through the back door of the house the coachman handed hester out and accompanied her across the yard and through the scullery her skirts were sodden around her ankles her shoulders and hair were wet nothing had been further from her mind on leaving the memorial reception than sending someone to fetch her cloakor to be more exact rose s cloak inside the warmth of the kitchen she realized how very cold she was her body was shuddering her feet numb her head was beginning to pound as if it were she who had drunk far too much the cook took pity on her and made her a hot cup of tea but gave her nothing to go with it no biscuit or slice of bread as if hester were to blame for roses condition it was half an hour before morgan applegate came to the kitchen door he was in his shirtsleeves his face flushed but white about the lips his hair tangled mrs monk he said with barely suppressed rage will you be so good as to come with me it was a command rather than a question hester rose and followed him she was deeply sorry for his distress but she had no intention of being spoken to like a naughty child he walked into the library where there was a brisk fire burning he held the door for her then slammed it shut explain yourself he said simply she looked at him with as much dignity as she could manage being sodden wet wearing borrowed clothes and having endured one of the most embarrassing evenings of her life she reminded herself that she had survived and been useful in fever hospitals and on battlefields this was a minor tragedy she refused even to be formal i believe rose has had too much to drink mr applegate and although it cannot have been more than one or two glasses she seems to be unusually susceptible to alcohol unless of course it was remarkably strong he was breathing deeply as if he could not immediately find words to retaliate i am extremely sorry it happened hester continued im afraid you know only the simplest part of it yet better to get it over now rather than leave it for him to discover in the most acutely embarrassing way there was a dismal musical trio playing and rose took the violin from the fiddler and played it herself extremely well unfortunately she soon changed to a funny but rather vulgar song from the music halls the whole scene is something you would probably prefer not to know about but it was memorable oh god he went ash white how she hesitated how he repeated she was very forthright over what people say about each other and what they really mean with names im sorry she meant it deeply he stared at her the anger draining out of him i should have told you she she used to he spread his hands helplessly she hasnt done it for years why now his eyes pleaded with her for a reason for the devastation that had descended on him with no warning then suddenly she knew the answer it was as obvious as a slap across the face alan argyll she said aloud he must have put something in her drink he knew we were there to try to persuade jenny to testify it was after he joined us that rose started to behave differently could he have known about her weakness she would not insult either of them by mincing words it was far too late now if he had cared to find out applegate admitted he sat down slowly in the large leather seat just behind him leaving her to do as she wished he looked crumpled like a rag doll someone had torn the stuffing from was it awful he asked without raising his eyes to lie would only leave him more vulnerable yes she said simply it was also very funny and perfectly true and it is the truth of it i fear people will neither forget nor forgive he sat silently the fire was beginning to warm her through the hem of her gown was steaming gently she knelt down in front of him im sorry we believed it was a good cause and that we could win it is a good cause he said quietly he seemed about to add something more then changed his mind will she be all right hester asked tomorrow the next day then she thought with a chill how clumsy that was it would never be all right for applegate himself his position would become untenable he would never be able to take rose to any social event after this possibly he would find it unbearable to go himself he lifted his head suddenly his eyes were blurred with fear and exhaustion but there was a light of decision in them ill give up my seat in parliament well go back to the country we have a house in dorset we can do a lot of good there without ever coming to london again its quiet and beautiful and we can be more than happy well have each other and that will be enough ridiculously hester felt her eyes fill with tears he must love her so deeply and unquestioningly that all his happiness lay in being with her his anger had been on her behalf not against her perhaps it was even against himself because he knew her weakness and had not protected her from it would monk have been as gentle with hester as forgiving as willing to sacrifice she would probably never know im sorry applegate apologized would you like something to eat you must be frozen its i shouldnt have blamed you you couldnt guard against something you knew nothing of or would you rather simply go home she made herself smile at him i think actually i would like to go home and put on some dry clothes its been a rotten night ill have my coachman take you he answered monk flung the front door open almost before the carriage had stopped when hester alighted he strode out into the street disregarding the rain where have you been he demanded youre soaked and you look terrible you were supposed to then he saw the expression on her face and stopped what is it hester thanked the coachman and went inside she was shivering again so she sat down in the chair nearest the fire and huddled into herself now that she was no longer faced with morgan applegates grief or roses urgent need a profound sense of defeat settled over her she wondered how she could ever have been so stupid as to think they could beat such vested interests her hubris had created her own downfall and in her unthinking ignorance she had taken rose with her what happened monk said again she described it as accurately as she could remember although she left out a good deal of what rose had said and summarized the rest argyll must have put alcohol in her lemonade she finished i dont know howi didnt see anything more than his hand over it for a moment after tonights performance shell have to disappear and neither she nor her husband will be able to give evidence of anything and we wont force anything out of jenny argyll either i wont have any way of getting back into society without rose in factthe heat rose in her face in fact i may be remembered rather unkindly for my part in this im sorry im terribly sorry he was startled youre why are you apologizing what else is there that you havent told me hester she stared at him nothing but they knew who i was that im your wife arent policemens wives supposed to behave rather better than that he gazed at her wideeyed then he started to laugh it was a deep fullthroated howl of incredulous hilarity its not that funny she said indignantly but he laughed even more and there was nothing she could do but lose her temper or join him she chose the latter they stood together in front of the fire the tears running down their cheeks i think you had better forget politics he said at last you arent any good at it im not usually as bad as this she defended herself but without conviction there was still defeat in her eyes yes you are he replied suddenly gentle again i think you should go back to nursing at that you are superb no one will have me she told him ruefully yes they will in portpool lane every one of them loves youeven squeaky robinson in his own way there was disbelief in her face hesitation then hope but you said i know i was wrong he did not add anything because she threw her arms around his neck and clung to him kissing him long and hard ten in spite of her personal joy hester woke in the morning with the utmost remorse over rose she packed up roses borrowed clothes and returned them her army experiences had taught her something of the suffering incurred after overindulgence in alcohol and she knew how to minister to those afflicted she spent several hours doing what she could for rose to both her and her husbands intense gratitude then she wished them every possible happiness and took her leave she arrived at the argyll house shortly after noon good morning mrs monk jenny said with some uncertainty when hester was shown into the withdrawing room good morning mrs argyll hester replied with a slight smile i thought that after last nights disaster you would naturally be concerned for mrs applegate i know that you and she were friends a fraction of a second later she realized she had already put it in the past and i owe you something of an apology had i been aware of her susceptibility i might have been able to prevent it there are some people to whom even a drop of alcohol is a kind of poison jenny cleared her throat she was obviously profoundly uncomfortable she was still wearing black of course but relieved at the neck and wrists with lavender she was not handsome as monk had said mary was but the possibilities of life passion and laughter were still there in her face masked by discretion i suppose it must be she sounded acutely uncertain but she could hardly ask hester to leave unless she was prepared to be inexplicably rude it is something of which i have no knowledge i hope you never have to hester said warmly i learned when i was caring for injured soldiers and those facing death on the battlefield she saw jennys face pinch with momentary pity when one is facing decisions that are almost unbearable hester went on as if now there was some kind of bond between them some of us do not easily find the courage to do what is right if it might cost us all we hold dear i am sure you have the sensitivity to understand that mrs argyll i er jenny appeared to know that the conversation was leading somewhere she did not wish to go there was a purpose in hesters bearing she could not have mistaken this was no idle call hester forced open the crack of opportunity i am sure you are looking for the kindest way to enquire how poor rose is this morning she lied i have been to see her she is in great discomfort but it will pass i dont believe any physical damage has been done to her but the injury to her reputation will never heal i imagine not jenny agreed at last she was on more familiar ground society could hardly forget or overlook what she did i i hope you are not considering asking my help jenny swallowed i have no influence in such matters i wouldnt think of it hester said quickly i have no idea what anyone could do that would help or the faintest reason why you should compromise your own standing by attempting it jenny relaxed visibly something of the natural color returning to her cheeks she unbent far enough to invite hester to sit down and did so herself i think her best course would be to retire from society she added i agree entirely hester concurred i knew you would have the compassion and the delicacy to understand jenny looked pleased but confused i am so sorry hester added sorry rose did not drink alcohol intentionally hester explained or even knowingly it was given to her by someone who wished to discredit her to a degree where she would not be able to appear in public in the foreseeable future she had already decided that to blame argyll immediately would be very bad strategy she must adopt the line taken by the prosecution the newspapers and public opinion in general jenny paled why on earth do you think that surely surely if she has such a weakness she left the rest unsaid hester frowned as if concentrating she must have been aware of her trouble she replied it can hardly have happened in public recently or we would all know of it therefore it took her by surprise also someone else caused it she drank only lemonade jenny stared at her she took several long breaths steadying herself there is always the pastries she suggested her voice a little husky some cooks mix the dried fruits with brandy or the creams with liqueur hester had not eaten them but she should have thought of that so should have rose would would it be enough she said to fill the growing silence she was playing a game of wits and she had no time to spin it out the trial was drawing closer to its verdict which would be issued any day rathbones time was short and once the defense started he might not be able to introduce new evidence she hated having to be so brutal jenny shook her head i have no idea it would seem so what we saw was irrefutable im afraid the poor woman was very intoxicated indeed she thought for a moment im so sorry hesters mind raced she must be able to use jennys pity turn it into a feeling of guilt she had no doubt it was alan argyll who had killed havilland morally if not physically and with great skill caused sixsmith to be blamed of course she agreed aloud sometimes the results of our actions are not even remotely as we have imagined they would be she was moving towards the subject of jennys letter to her father approaching it softly jenny paled her hands moved on the black fabric of her skirt not quite clutching it then deliberately relaxing again there was effort in it control i am sure she can have no idea that a few pastries would do such a thing it was after her lemonade before the pastry hester corrected her not certain if that was true how could anyone jenny started her face was very white hester shrugged a little bottle such as one uses for medicines a distraction of attention not so very difficult jenny was forced to fill the silence who on earth would do that someone who wished to discredit her hester repeated rose had been looking into the matters your late father was investigating just to make certain that there was no danger of serious accident and my father was disturbed in his mind jenny said abruptly there was no danger at all the machines my husbands company uses are the best there are it is skill that has improved them which is why they are faster not that they are taking less care the color was high in her face her eyes brilliant this whole terrible charge has arisen only because of my fathers i dont like to use the word but it was hysteria hester could almost believe her but for the man melisande ewart had seen leaving the mews and that is why you wrote to your father asking him to meet your husband in the stables she said allowing doubt into her voice and poor mr sixsmith is facing a charge of murder jennys voice was half strangled in her throat it isnt murder its its just bribery and even that is nonsense my husband will see that he is cleared of that mr dobie is a marvelous lawyer her hands were now clenched hard in her lap knuckles shining will he hester asked do you believe that mrs argyll why on earth would he who else could have hired the man who shot your father a succession of wild emotions crossed jennys face confusion terror hatred hester leaned towards her hating the fact that she had to be the one to do this someone hired that man to kill your father and so in a way your sister too can you live with not telling the court that your husband made you write a letter asking your father to be in his stables that night can you go forward into the future looking at your husband across the dinner table every evening across the bed knowing that both of you allowed aston sixsmith to hang when you of all people could have proved his innocence the tears were running down jennys face you have no idea what youre asking she gasped no idea perhaps not hester admitted but you do and if you are honest you know what it will costnot only yourself and your children but mr sixsmith as wellif you do not do you wish to explain that to your children or live with it yourself you are ruthless jenny choked on the words im honest hester replied sometimes they seem like the same thing but i take no pleasure in it you can still see at least that your father is buried with honor and his name cleared jenny sat motionless her hands locked together the lamplight necessary even at midday bleached her skin of all color the truth can be very sharp hester added but it makes a cleaner wound than lies it will not fester jenny nodded very slowly please do not come back she whispered i will do as you say but i cannot bear to see you again you have forced me to look at a horror i believed i could avoid allow me to do it alone of course hester rose to her feet and walked slowly to the door she knew that the servants would let her out into the street where morgan applegates carriage would be waiting to take her home that same morning monk went across the river as the light was dawning in the drifting rain he went first to wapping station simply to ascertain that no crisis had arisen demanding his attention then he took a hansom westwards to the old bailey to see rathbone drunk rathbone said incredulously rose applegate and unforgivably frank monk added rathbone swore which was an extremely rare occurrence we are losing this case monk he said miserably if im not extremely careful i shall end up convicting sixsmith whether i wish to or not and argyll will walk away free the thought makes me seethe but even if i destroy half the decent men around argyllthe navvies the foremen and the bankers as well as sixsmith himselfi still cant be sure of getting him if rose applegate could have persuaded argylls wife to testify to anything that would have made her fathers story more believable we might shake him he sighed and looked at monk the dread of failure burning visibly inside him it was in the nature of his profession to gamble on his own skill and he could not always win but when it was another man who was going to pay it clearly cut to the bone of his selfbelief it was a pain he was evidently not used to and his confusion was naked for a moment in his eyes monk wished he could help rathbone and knew it could not be done there are places each man walks alone where even friendship cannot reach all he could do was wait and be there before and after ill go back to looking for the assassin he said turning to go if you dont find him in the next couple of days it wont matter rathbone told him id rather let sixsmith go and drop the case altogether than convict an innocent man he smiled thinly my foray into prosecution is not conspicuously successful it seems monk could think of nothing to say that was not a lie he gave a very slight smile and went out closing the door softly he was within half a mile of the wapping station when scuff appeared out of the gloom the boy was soaking wet and looking inordinately pleased with himself he ran a couple of steps to keep up with monk i done it he said without the usual preamble of greeting monk looked at him his small face was glowing with triumph under its outsize cap monk had still not managed to tell him it needed a lining what did you do he asked scuffs expression filled with disgust i found where the killer lives o course int that wot we gotter do monk stopped facing scuff on the footpath you found out where the man who shot mr havilland lives the thought was overwhelming then he was furious i told you not even to think about it his voice cut across the air harsh with fear a man who would shoot havilland in his own stables would not think twice about strangling an urchin like scuff dont you ever listen he demanded or think scuff looked confused and deeply hurt this was seemingly the last thing he had expected monk suddenly realized that the boy must have clutched his achievement to himself all the way there expecting monks praise and happiness only to find the prize dashed out of his hand scuff took a deep breath and looked at monk blinking to keep back the tears don yer wanna know then monk felt a guilt so deep that for a moment he could not find the words to express it even to himself far less to try to mend anything in the child staring at him waiting yes i do want it he said at last he must not intrude on scuffs precious dignity for the boy had little else he must never allow him to know he had seen the tears but i dont risk my mens lives even for that thats something you have to learn oh scuff swallowed he thought about it for a moment or two while they both stood in the rain getting steadily wetter not nobdys nobodys at all monk assured him even those i dont like much such as clacton never mind those i do oh scuff said again so dont do it monk added or youll be in trouble ill let you off this one time scuff grunted so yer wanna know were e lives then yes i do please e lives down the blind mans cuttin wot leads inter the old sewer an tunnel theres lots o folk live down there but i can find im ill take yer es a bad un mind an e knows them sewers like a tosher exspecial the old ones down near the fleet thank you i think we had better take some men with us well go to the station and find them monk started to walk scuff remained where he was monk stopped and turned waiting i int goin there scuff said stubbornly its all rozzers youre with me monk said quietly nobody will hurt you scuff looked at him gravely his eyes shadowed with doubt would you rather wait outside monk asked its wet and its cold but itll be warm in there and well get a drink of hot tea there might even be a piece of cake cake temptation ached in scuffs eyes and hot tea for sure an rozzers yes do you want me to send them all out into the rain scuff smiled so widely it showed his lost teeth yeah imagine it monk replied thats as good as youll get come on hesitantly scuff obeyed walking beside monk until they reached the steps then hanging back monk held the door for him and waited while he took smaller and smaller steps then stopped altogether just inside staring around with enormous eyes orme looked up from the table where he was writing a report clacton drew in his breath caught monks eye and changed his mind mr scuff has information for us which may be of great value monk told orme he will give it to us of course but it would be pleasanter over a cup of tea and cake if there is any left orme looked at scuff and saw a wet and shivering child clacton he said sharply fishing in his pocket and pulling out a few pence go and get us all a nice piece of cake ill make the tea scuff took another step inside then inched over towards the stove two hours later monk scuff orme kelly and jones the men armed with pistols descended down the open workings and along the sodden bottom between the high walls of blind mans cutting as it closed overhead they lit their lanterns monk glanced at the sides of the tunnel the old bricks were set in a close carefully laid curve now stained and seeping with steady drips and slowcrawling slime the smell unmistakably human waste was thick in the nose and throat the skitter of rats feet interrupted the slurp of water down the channel in the center otherwise there was no sound except their own feet slipping on the wet stone no one spoke apart from the frail beam from their lanterns the darkness was absolute monk felt panic rising inside him almost uncontrollably they were buried alive as if the rest of the world had ceased to exist he could see nothing but dark wavering shadows and yellow light on wet walls the smell was suffocating perhaps their journey was no more than a mile but it seemed endless until they met a junction of waterways scuff hesitated only a moment before turning to the right he led the way into a narrower tunnel where they were obliged to stoop in order not to strike the ceiling the gangers couldnt have been this way recently because the piledup sludge beneath their feet was deep and dangerous catching at them dragging at their feet holding them back and sucking them down monk had no idea where they were they had turned often enough that he had lost all sense of direction sounds echoed and were lost then there was nothing but the steady drip all around them above behind and ahead it was like endless labyrinths through hell filled with the odor of decay one of the men let out an involuntary cry as a huge rat fell off the wall and splashed into the water only a couple of feet from him another half mile and they emerged into a dry tunnel where the ceiling was considerably higher there they met a pair of toshers roped together for safety they had long poles in their hands for fishing out valuablesor gripping the sides when caught by a sudden current after a rainstorm they were dressed in the usual tosher gear high rubber boots hat and harness it was scuff who spoke to them leaving the river police in shadows with their lanterns half concealed then they moved on again probing the darkness with their feeble lights the thought made monks stomach churn and his throat tighten what would happen if they dropped the lamps they would never get out of here one day in a week or a month some tosher would find their bones picked clean by rats the last tosher they had questioned half a mile back had said there were people using this old way to get from one part of the city to another the man they were looking for whose name no one spoke was one of them in the subterranean world there seemed little of either friendship or enmity it was simply coexistence with rules of survival those who broke them died it seemed an age before scuff finally led them up a ladder their feet clanged on the iron rungs a few yards later they passed a sluice rushing so loudly they could not hear their own voices above in a dry passage leading to a blind end a group of men and women were sitting beside a fire the smoke going up through a hole a little distance away and disappearing into utter darkness a short whispered conversation followed between scuff and an old woman which way ma scuff asked her touching his tooth to remind her whom he was referring to she shivered and jerked her head to the left a younger man argued with her pointing to the right finally orme agreed to follow the youth one way with kelly and jones and return if he found nothing monk took the other two men and went with scuff the way the old woman had indicated half an hour later after more twists and climbs they emerged into an open cutting air fresh and cold on their faces she lied scuff said bitterly scared i spect daft of he stopped short of using the word he had been going to say that way he pointed back where they had come from at the next branch in the tunnel they divided again monk and scuff going alone down more iron steps and deeper into the bowels of the earth monk stopped scuff close beside him their lights showed only ten feet ahead and then there was impenetrable darkness now there was no sound at all except the steady drip from the ceiling monks anger had worn off leaving him cold he could not blame the old woman he was shivering with fear himself had he ever felt this gutchurning terror before he could not remember doing so surely he would never have forgotten it it was primeval woven into ones existence his skin crawled as if there were insects on it and he heard every sound magnified his imagination raced the river could have been twenty feet away or twenty miles was the assassin really somewhere ahead of them perhaps even waiting he heard nothing but water dripping running splashing around their feet this part of the old system was no longer used the stream was shallow fed by nothing but rain down through the gutters but it still smelled of stale human waste the gangers had not been here for a long time the piledup silt of excrement was like stalagmites there was a sound ahead monk froze it was not the scratch of rats feet but the heavier noise of a boot on stone monk covered his lantern its im scuff whispered reaching up and gripping monks hand the noise of footsteps came again then a light reflected yellow on the ancient slimy stone of the tunnel a shadow grew larger moving swelling scuff was holding monks hand so tightly his ragged nails bit into monks flesh and it was all monk could do not to cry out he pulled scuff closer half shielding the boy behind him his heart was pounding in his chest choking him had he been aboveground when he was facing the man however dark the night he would have been calm apart from heightened senses he was glad he had a gun although this was like meeting the devil in his own territory alien and dreadful an inhuman evil the sound of a boot scraping on stone suddenly vanished as the man coming towards them trod in a drift of silt there was nothing but the swelling shadow and the dripping of water scuffs breath hissed in through his teeth and he clung to monk the man came around the corner only twenty feet ahead of them he had gone another five or six feet before he realized that the shadows of monk and scuff by the wall were human and not detritus heaped against the stone he froze his lamp unwavering in his hand the yellow glare of it lighting his face like a lined yellow mask he was thin his hair unkempt and ragged to his shoulders the black slashes of his brows cut across his face he had a long narrowbridged nose flared nostrils a lantern jaw and a wide thinlipped mouth surprisingly there was intelligence in the eyes even humor very slowly he smiled and monk saw the sharp oversized eyeteeth the left bigger than the right monk froze the picture indelible in his mind then the man turned and with astounding swiftness loped away monk galvanized into action he tore the cover off the lantern and still grasping scuff by the hand floundered through the silt and water and up into the drier streambed after the man scuff was now easily keeping up with him so he let go of the boys hand the man ahead was forced to keep his lantern high as he splashed slipping his huge shadow on the walls and ceiling like the image of a wounded bird trying to fly arms wide the yellow light jerked over the black shining ooze on the walls and the slick surface of the stream there was a turn and then utter darkness scuff was so close to monk he pressed against him monk realized how wet he was his legs were frozen but his body was sweating he could feel the perspiration run down his back and his chest there was a noise ahead a splash he jerked around to face it the right tunnel rats scuff whispered hoarsely es jiggered up em rats cmon and without waiting to make sure he plunged through the water monk drew in his breath to cry out stop but bit it back sound echoed down here he had no idea how far ahead the assassin was perhaps only a few yards he ran slipping and struggling after scuff the dim reflection on the water made scuffs small figure oddly elongated as it moved with a jerky swaying gait the light ahead was there again bright and unguarded monk saw the assassin turn to face them his arm lifted there was a sharp crack a spurt of flame scuff cried out and crumpled into the water monk lunged forward pulling his gun out of his pocket he fired it again and again even after the figure had disappeared and there was no light in the suffocating darkness except his own he put his gun away and held the lantern high staring at the stream looking for the small figure scuff would be already floating pulled along by the current scraped by the sludge and filth monk saw him lost him and found him again he bent over awkwardly because there was nowhere to set the lantern and picked up the limp body scuffs face was white and wet reminding him with a lurch of pain of mary havilland but scuff was far smaller pinched and thin the skin almost blue around his eyes and mouth thank god he was breathing in spite of the blood that oozed through his clothes and stained them scarlet around his shoulder and chest the assassin must be somewhere ahead of them but the thought of leaving scuff and going after him never entered monks head clumsily because of the lantern and trying to carry scuff gently with only one arm he turned and began the long way back he walked in the center of the sewer floor where he could move the most easily he had very little idea where he was and his only thought was to find the way up towards help he did not know how badly scuff was hurt but he could not stop here to find out there were rats everywhere and they would smell blood far worse than that the assassin knew he had hit scuff the fact that monk had not followed him would tell him that scuff was not dead and that monk was trying to get back up again hampered by carrying a wounded child as soon as he was certain of that would he double back and try to finish monk off if the positions were reversed monk would he was lost there was a fork again three ways two ahead one behind him which way had he come think scuffs life depended on it the water was flowing around his feet quite rapidly it must have kept raining all day what happened if it got harder heavier flash floods of course deep water enough to pull him off his feet maybe even drown him and scuff was it still raining he could feel the panic rising inside him he commanded himself to stop behaving like a fool and think water flows downwards on the way in had he been going with the flow or against it with it of course down all the time down so he had to go back against it now upwards it didnt matter anymore where he emerged as long as it was into the air and he could get help any opening would do he started forward again scuff was growing heavy held on one arm but he had to hold the lantern high in order to see its weight was pulling on the wound from the fight on jacobs island one good thing if he was simply going up and not necessarily retracing the way he had come then there was no trail for the assassin to follow as monk trudged upwards his mind was working why had the killer never gone back to sixsmith for the second half of his payment nor apparently to argyll either perhaps he had never expected to collect the second half he might have asked for what he meant to have in the first payment maybe he feared that argyll meant to kill him tidy up the ends was he right rathbone would have to drop the prosecution or risk hanging sixsmith and argyll would escape neither mary nor her father would ever be vindicated monk shook his head to clear it all that mattered now was getting scuff up to the top before he died of shock and the cold he wanted to look at the wound but there was nowhere to lay scuff down nowhere to hang the lantern so he could see his legs were freezing and clumsy his heart was pounding and the stench of sewage all but made him gag but he was moving as fast as he could always uphill against the flow of the water once he passed a series of iron rungs in the wall alone he would have climbed but not with scuff he rounded a corner the light seemed clearer now he must be nearing the surface then he saw a figure ahead of him a man thin with his arm raised there was a shout but in the tunnel it echoed against the roar of the water going over the weir he could not make out the words it must be raining harder the shot still took him by surprise ricocheting off the wall and sending brick chips and dust flying he threw himself against the wall sheltering scuff as much as he could with his own body there was another shout and another but they sounded further away he looked around and at first thought there was no one there then he saw the lantern held high ormes familiar figure behind it relief washed over him like a warm tide almost robbing him of the little strength he had left orme he shouted here help me mr monk sir are you all right orme ran over slipping in the water his lantern swaying wildly his face crumpled with concern scuffs shot monk said simply weve got to get him up orme was aghast now just now no no we caught up with the assassin and he shot at us right sir ill lead the way orme said steadily come with me it seemed a long way before they finally emerged into the open cutting by now monk had abandoned his lantern simply following ormes light ahead he wanted to hold scuff gently in both arms the boy was beginning to stir and every now and then he let out a soft groan when they reached the end of the cutting and were on level ground again they stopped for the first time monk saw scuffs face in the daylight he was ashen and there were already hollows of shock around his eyes monk felt a tight pinching in his heart he looked up at orme you better get im to a doctor mr monk orme said anxiously scuffs eyes flickered open i want crow he said weakly it urts summink awful am i gonna die no monk promised no youre not im going to take you to the hospital scuffs eyes grew wide and dark with terror no no ospitil dont take me there please mr monk dont take me he gasped his face turned even whiter he tried to reach out his hand as if to ward off something but only his fingers moved please all right monk said quickly no hospital ill take you home ill look after you youve got to get im treated proper mr monk ormes voice was sharp with fear just carin isnt gonna be enough that bullets gotter come out an the ole stitched up an cleaned i know monk answered more sharply than he meant to get a message to crow and have him come to my house my wifes a battlefield nurse orme saw the futility of arguing when time was so desperately precious he ran out into the street and stopped the first hansom passing ordering the startled passenger out to find another hansom this was police business the man saw the injured child and made no demur orme left to look for crow it was a nightmare journey monk sat cradling scuff in his arms talking to him all the time about anything and nothing wishing he knew how to help the trip seemed to last forever and yet it was perhaps no more than half an hour before he climbed out paid the driver and carried scuff to the front door the house was dark empty and cold god had she gone back to portpool lane already he could have wept with fear and the aching loneliness of knowing he was inadequate to do what was needed where was hester why was she not here what could he do without her he felt panicky and sick there was no time to wait he must keep scuff warm he was slipping away bleeding too fast his face was gray and there was barely a flutter of his eyelids monk must warm up the room riddle the stove put on more fuel he should boil water to make it clean where was hester why was she not here he had no idea how to get a bullet out he could kill scuff just by trying he moved quickly ramming the fire with the poker he must be careful if he added too much coal he would put the fire out then it would take ages to light again he blew on it to make it draw then he filled the biggest pan with water but changed his mind and put on a small one instead it would be quicker finally there was no excuse to wait any longer he lifted scuff from the chair where he had put him and laid him on the table under the light he must take off his coat and remove the bit of scarf orme had put in to pack the wound it was soaked through with blood his hands shook as he pulled it off and saw the scarlet hole in the white skin still welling up scarlet inside scuff was unconscious and barely breathing perhaps it was too late already he did not even hear the front door it was not until hester was standing beside him that he realized his face was wet with tears of relief he did not ask if she could save scuff because he could not bear the answer she said nothing except to give orders pass me the knife clean this for me cut up my petticoat its soft put the vinegar on this yes its clean they used to use it in the navy in ships of the line just do it they worked together she probed for the bullet pulled it out packed the wound and finally drew the flesh closed and stitched it over with a darning needle dipped in boiling water she used the only silk thread she had a dark blue from a dress she had been altering he obeyed his teeth clenched his body now shuddering with cold and exhaustion his heart pounding with fear finally they were finished scuff was bandaged and dressed in one of hesters nightgowns which was the only thing that was anywhere near his size and laid gently on her side of the bed only then did monk finally ask will he live she did not lie to him her face was pinched with grief and tiredness and her blue dress was irrevocably stained with blood i dont know well just have to wait ill sit here with him try to keep his temperature down theres nothing else to do now except wait go and wash and put dry clothes on he had forgotten that he was still sodden himself and the stench of the sewer probably filled the whole house but he started then realized she was right there was nothing further he could do to help scuff and catching pneumonia himself would help no one he was shaking with cold his teeth chattering he would change and then make them both a cup of tea his stomach was empty and sick and his arm was throbbing he was in the kitchen with the teapot when crow arrived how is he he asked searching monks face god you look awful his voice shook his emotions too raw to hide i dont know monk admitted hester took the bullet out and stitched the wound but hes terribly weak hes upstairs in my bed can you crow had a gladstone bag with him he had not even put it down he turned and went up the stairs two at a time monk followed him five minutes later with scalding hot tea crow was standing beside the bed hester was still sitting on the chair scuffs white hand in hers crow turned she did a good job he said simply theres nothing more that i can do its a bad wound but the bullets out and its clean its not bleeding much anymore ive got bandages here and spirit to clean with and a drop of port wine to lift him when he wakes he did not say if but they all knew he meant it just wait monk wanted to do more than that there must be something tea crow said with a bleak smile monk poured it and they sat down to endure the long night scuff tossed and turned by midnight he was feverish monk fetched a bowl of cool water from the kitchen and hester kept sponging him down by half past one scuff was more settled breathing shallowly but not thrashing around and no longer covered with sweat crow took off the bandage and repacked the wound it looked clean but it was still bleeding slowly he tried to give scuff a teaspoonful of wine but the boy would not take it monk dozed a little in the chair then changed places with hester by the bed watching and waiting outside the rain turned to sleet then to snow at five oclock scuff opened his eyes but he was only half awake he did not speak and it seemed as if he had little idea where he was hester lifted him very slightly and gave him a teaspoonful of wine he choked on it but she gave him some more and the second time he smiled very faintly almost immediately he slipped back into unconsciousness but his breathing was a little steadier monk went down to build the stove up again and boil more water for tea a little after seven scuff spoke mr crow that you yes its me crow said quickly yer came of course i did did you think i wouldnt nah i knowed i done it he smiled weakly told yer what did you do crow asked him i found the feller fer mr monk i elped im yes i know crow agreed he told me did e scuff frowned he gave a deep sigh and fell back to sleep again smiling is he going to be all right monk demanded his voice hoarse looks better was all crow would say at eight oclock crow left needing to see his other patients there was no more he could do for scuff now and his manner more than his words said that he trusted hesters ability as much as his own he promised to return in the evening monk was weary his bones were aching and his eyes were smarting each time he blinked as if there were sand in them nevertheless he knew he must go and tell rathbone that he had seen the assassin exactly as melisande ewart had described him and that the killer had shot scuff and escaped at least monk could attest to his existence and his nature hester was exhausted too but she dared not sleep in case scuff suddenly grew worse and she was not there to do all she could even so she was only half awake when he spoke to her oo are yer are yer mr monks wife his voice was surprisingly clear she opened her eyes blinking yes i am my names hester how are you he bit his lip i urt i got shot did mr monk tell yer yes i took the bullet out of your shoulder thats why it hurts so much but it looks as if its getting better would you like something to drink his eyes widened yer looked dint yer faint nor nuffink no i was a nurse in the army i dont faint he stared at her then moved experimentally suddenly he saw the lace on his sleeve wos that wot yer done wi me clothes its one of my nightgowns she replied your own clothes were wet from the sewers and pretty dirty he blushed scarlet still staring at her ive tended to soldiers before she said matteroffactly its all the same in battle not that i gave them my own nightgowns of course but i didnt have anything else for you and no time to go and get anything you needed to be warm and clean oh he looked away confused would you like something to drink she offered again he turned back to her slowly wot yer got tea with sugar and a little port wine she replied i don mind if i do he said a trifle warily he was obviously still turning over in his mind the fact that he was wearing her nightgown and he had no idea where his own trousers were hester went down to the kitchen and made tea then brought it up and added a few spoonfuls of port she helped him drink it without any further conversation his color was definitely better when he lay back yer looked arter soldiers he asked doubtfully yes wy dyer do that dint mr monk mind i didnt know him then int yer got no ma and pa ter look arter yer he frowned as she evidently did not fit his picture of an orphan yes i had then they didnt like it a lot she said frankly but quite a few young ladies even very respectable ones went out to help florence nightingale oh yer one of em yes were yer scared sometimes but when things are at their worst you dont think of yourself so muchmore of the men who are wounded and if you can help them oh he thought for a moment i dont need no elp least not most o the time i elp mr monk e dont know much bout the river not that e int clever an brave like he added quickly e s just ignorant she supplied for him with a smile yeah he agreed if yer knowed that whyd yer let im go because if you love someone you cant stop them doing what they believe they have to he looked at her more seriously with the beginning of something that could even have been respect is that why yer pa let yer go inter the army something like that wots it like she told him fairly factually what the troop ship had been like crossing the mediterranean and her first sight of scutari she was describing the hospital when she realized he was asleep his breathing was even his brow cool his skin dry she lay down on monks side of the bed and in spite of her intention not to fall asleep almost immediately drifted off too when she woke scuff was awake looking uncomfortable he had been lying close to her perhaps afraid to move in case he disturbed her yet he remained there now when he did not have to his eyes wary waiting for her to say something perhaps make some kind of demand she knew better he might have been frightened lonely and hungry for affection but if she offered it too soon he would reject it instantly he needed his independence to survive and he knew it how are you she asked quite casually i fell asleep she added unnecessarily it urts he said then instantly seemed ashamed of himself im better ta i can go ome soon it was not the time to argue with him he needed to feel some part of his fate was in his own hands he was afraid of losing his freedom of becoming dependent of coming to like warmth and soft beds hot food even belonging yes of course she agreed as soon as you are a little better i am going to get something to eat would you like something too he was silent uncertain whether to accept or not in his world food was life one never took it or gave it lightly all his surroundings were unfamiliar and he was conscious enough now to be fully aware of that she stood up tidying back a few strands of hair and making a poor job of it in spite of her determination not to care for the boy she cared intensely if he knew he would resent it and feel trapped she must not allow it to show she went to the door without looking back then forgetting at the last moment she turned he was lying in her place whitefaced the skin pinched around his mouth shadowed around his eyes he looked very small it was monks opinion he cared about not hers ill be back she said feeling foolish and went down the stairs she returned half an hour later having made an egg custard something at which she was not skilled she had had to work hard to get it right she had it now in two bowls on a tray she set them down on the dresser and closed the door then offered him one dish he stared at it no idea what it was and raised his eyes to hers uncertain she put some on a spoon and held it to his lips he ate it tasting it slowly carefully he might never admit it but it was clear in his expression that he liked it very much slowly she fed him the rest then ate her own she had a ridiculous feeling of success as if she had won a great prize she looked forward to making something else for him is that wot yer feed soldiers when theyre urt he asked if we have the supplies yes she replied depends where were fighting it can be hard to get things over great distances wot kind o things yer gotter ave food dyer ave guns an things too yes and ammunition and medical supplies and more boots and clothes all kinds of things then she elaborated on army life and he sat with his eyes never leaving hers they were still talking when monk came back in the late afternoon he came up to the room quietly he looked exhausted but the moment he saw scuff sitting up against the pillow he smiled hester rose anxious for him now it was already darkening outside and he was spattered with rain even after having taken his coat off downstairs are you hungry she asked gently trying to read from his face what he needed most yes he answered as if surprised by it rathbone thinks they may all be convicted including sixsmith im sorry she said sincerely navvies evidence he explained perhaps we shouldnt have started this but its too late to undo it now what about tomorrow more navvies clerks people who probably had no idea of any of it he answered lets eat ive done all i can are you hungry scuff scuff nodded yeah i am eleven by the time monk returned home to paradise street after the following days court it was dark and raining again the gutters were awash slopping over onto the cobbles the reflections from the lamps danced on wet stone and the clatter of hooves was broken by splashing the cold wind coming up from the river carried wreaths of mist that stretched out wrapped around trees and even houses then elongated and disappeared again inside the house was warm the kitchen smelled of new bread clean linen and something savory hester greeted him at the door hes fine she said before he asked he smiled as the sweetness of it soaked into him hes been asleep on and off she went on he looks a lot better he held her close kissing her mouth then her cheek and eyes and hair allowing the rest of the world to be closed out for a few precious minutes then he went upstairs to change into dry clothes and to see scuff how are you he asked scuff stirred and sat up very slowly blinking a little he seemed uncertain how to answer are you worse monk said anxiously scuff grinned lopsidedly it urts like bleedin eck he said frankly but that egg stuff as she makes is real good dyer know some o em places shes bin his eyes were huge with amazement and more admiration than he was probably aware of i int never eard o some o em neither have i monk conceded coming in and sitting on the edge of the bed she told me bout wot she done in the army an such me too now and then she doesnt talk about it a lot sad eh all em men urt bad scuff frowned lot o em died she dint say so but i reckon as they did yes i reckon so too are you hungry yeah are you yes scuff tried to climb over to the edge of the bed as if he would come downstairs to eat no monk said sharply ill bring it up to you yer dont ave ter scuff began id rather carry the supper up than have to carry you again monk told him dryly stay where you are scuff subsided and inched back to the center again he lay against the pillow watching monk please dont fall out monk said more gently youll hurt yourself worse scuff said nothing but he did not move again they were all three of them in the bedroom halfway through eating when the interruption came hester was cutting up vegetables for scuff and letting him pick them up with a fork he did it carefully uncertain at first how to manage monk was eating steak and kidney pie with a vigorous appetite suddenly there was a loud knocking on the door again and again almost as if someone were trying to break in monk put his plate on the tray the last mouthful uneaten and went downstairs to find out what it was orme stood on the step in the rain his hair plastered to his head his face white he did not wait for monk to ask what it was nor did he attempt to come in theres bin a cavein he said hoarsely down at the argyll tunnel the ole lot it all came in and god knows ow many mens buried it was what james havilland had feared and monk would have given everything he owned not to have had him proved right do they know what caused it he asked his voice shaking even his hand on the door felt cold and somehow disembodied not yet orme said ignoring the rain dripping down his face suddenly the ole side just slid in wi water beind it like a river an then bout fifty yards further up the line nother lot went im goin back there sir ter see if i can elp although god knows if anyone can another slide that means there are men trapped between the two is there any sewage down there dunno mr monk depends on wot it were that slid its close ter one o the old sewers as is still used could be i know wot yer thinking gas he did not finish ill come with you there was no question of what he must do come in out of the rain while i tell my wife he left the door open and went up the stairs two at a time hester was standing in the bedroom doorway scuff sitting up on the bed behind her both of them had heard ormes voice and caught the sound of fear in it theres been a cavein i have to go he told her injuries can she stopped he gave her a quick smile no your place is here with scuff he kissed her quickly harder perhaps than he meant to then he turned and went back down the stairs again took his coat from the hook in the hall and followed orme out into the street there was a hansom waiting they climbed in and shouted to the driver to hurry back to the tunnel he needed no urging they clattered through the streets the long whip curled over the horses back and water sprayed from the wheels on either side it took them nearly half an hour to get there even at this time of night when there was no traffic as orme scrambled out monk paid the driver too generously then followed orme into the darkness and the rain ahead of them a maze of lamps was moving jerkily as men stumbled over rubble and broken beams as carefully as they could to avoid falling monk was aware of shouting the sting of wind and rain and somewhere though he could not see wherethe thrum of one of the big engines for lifting the rubble beyond the periphery of the disaster area there were carriages waiting and ambulances bloody awful mess crow emerged into a small pool of light his black hair was soaked if he had ever had a medical bag he had lost it his hands were covered with blood judging by the gash on his left forearm at least some of it was his own how can we help monk said simply can we get anyone out god knows crow answered but weve got to try be careful the grounds giving way all over the place watch where you put your weight and if it goes yell even in this noise someone may hear you throw yourself flatthatll give you at least some chance of finding a beam or a piece of something to hang on to stand straight and youll go down like an arrow as he spoke he was leading the way towards a group of lanterns about a hundred yards further on which were swaying as the men carrying them picked their footing to go deeper into the cavein area what happened monk asked having to raise his voice now above the thud and grind of the machine digging and unloading the rubble must have dug too close to a small river crow shouted back londons riddled with them all this burrowing and digging around and some of them have moved course only takes a couple of feet a change from clay to shale or striking an old culvert a cellar or something and the whole thing can turn sometimes it just goes around it and back to thewatch your feet the last was a shout of warning as monks foot sank into a squelching hole he pitched forward only just catching ormes arm in time to pull himself upright and haul his foot out his leg was now coated in sludge up to his knee shock robbed him of breath and he found himself gasping even after he had regained his balance crow slapped him on the shoulder wed better stay together he said loudly come on monk leapt up with him someone must have known this was going to happen he said sixsmith crow asked keeping moving havilland actually monk replied crow stopped abruptly murdered because of it there was surprise in his voice and but for the wavering lights his expression was invisible i dont know if he had sense enough to listen to some of the older toshers maybe some of them knew things that arent written down anywhere just lore passed from father to son they were at the edge of the crater which seemed a fathomless pit monk felt his stomach clench and his body shook even though he tensed every muscle to try to control it a little man broadshouldered and bowlegged came towards them he had a lantern built into his hat so both his hands were left free there was too much noise of clattering earth and the thrum of the great machine for him to try to be heard he waved his arms for them to follow then turned and led the way down monk lost all count of time and finally of direction also even of how deep he was and the distance he would have to go upwards to find clean air or feel the wind on his face everything was wet he could hear water seeping down the walls dripping sloshing under his feet sometimes even the steady flow of a stream a sort of thin wet rattle all the time someone had given him a shorthandled shovel he ignored his painful shoulder and worked with crow to begin with digging away fallen debris by the dim light of lanterns trying to reach trapped or crushed men then crow went up again with bodies and monk found himself beside a barrelchested navvy and a tosher with a broken front tooth that made his breath whistle as he heaved and dug the light was sporadic one moment the lantern would be steady held high to see an arm or a leg distinguish a human limb from the timbers or a head from the rounded stones of the rubble at others it rested on the ground while they dug pulling hoping and then realizing there was nothing to find and moving on going deeper at one point they broke through into a preexisting tunnel and were able to go twenty yards before finding another slide and starting to dig again it was under this one that they found two bodies one was still just alive but even with all they could do to help the man died as they were trying to move him his injuries were too gross for him to have stood or walked again and yet monk felt a crushing sense of defeat his mind told him the man was better dead than facing months of agony and the despair of knowing he would remain a cripple in shattering pain and utterly helpless but still death was such a final defeat he returned slowly his body aching to the heap of waste he held his lantern high to see if the other man could be brought up for identification and burial or if it would jeopardize more lives even to try he picked his way carefully even though he knew it by now and bent holding the light towards where he thought the head was he pulled away pieces of brick and mortar until he had uncovered the body as far as the middle of the chest it would probably not be too difficult or dangerous to get the rest of him free he was so plastered with clay and dust monk could distinguish very little of his features beyond that he had long hair and a thin angular face there was a rattle of pebbles behind him and the bowlegged tosher appeared at his elbow silently they worked together it took some time but eventually they freed the body and halfcarried halfdragged it along the old sewer floor they had to pass through one of the small streams dribbling out of the side wall it was icecold and erratic but at least smelling of earth rather than sewage when they at last reached the top monk held the light to look at the man the question of who he might be froze on his lips the stream they had passed through had cleaned off the mud and he saw the face clearly it had stared at him in the lantern light of another sewer only two and a half days before the black hair and brows like a slash across his face and the narrowbridged nose were etched in his mind forever with a shaking hand he touched the lip and pushed it back there were the extraordinary eyeteeth one even more prominent than the other what irony his hiding place had been the cause of his death the very stream he had killed to conceal had in turn killed him oo is ethe tosher looked at monk frowning i seen im somewhere afore an i cant member where it were hes a man who killed other people for money monk replied the police are looking for him i need to find sergeant orme can you send someone to fetch him it matters very much the tosher shrugged ill put out the word he promised are you goin ter leave im ere im going to stay with him at least until the police can take him away monk replied suddenly he was aware of the cold of the numbness of his feet would this be in time to make a difference to the trial it would at least prove that melisande ewart had seen a real person might that be enough to swing the jury or to frighten argyll he waited crouching in the dark beside the corpse hearing shouts and seeing lanterns waving in the distance across the rubble it had started to rain again the light shone yellow on the faces of the rocks and black pools of water between the giant machine roared in the mist like some monstrous halfhuman creature still grinding and thumping as more debris was hauled up monk was not sure if it was his imagination but it seemed to be settling deeper into the earth it was about half an hour when at last orme appeared waving a lantern crow on his heels you got im orme asked bending to look at the dead body yes monk had no doubt at all crow stared at him his face was lit on one side and shadowed on the other but his expression was a mask of anger and scalding contempt doesnt look so much dead does he he said quietly then he bent down frowning a little experimentally he touched one of the mans hands then picked it up his frown deepened and he looked up at monk you think he was killed in the fall yes his legs are crushed he was probably trapped he was half ashamed as he said it i should feel sorry for anyone caught like that but all i feel for him is angry we cant make him tell us who paid him id bring him into court broken legs broken back and all scuff ii be all right orme said quietly looking not at monk but at crow wont e yes i should think so crow agreed but look at his legs mr monk what about them theyre both broken see any blood no probably washed off in the water we took him through i dragged him hes heavier than youd think crow looked at the body again more carefully orme and monk watched growing more curious and then unaccountably concerned why does it matter monk said finally crow stood up his legs stiff moving awkwardly because he was dead before the slide hit him he replied dead bodies dont bleed the only blood staining anything is on his coat from the bullet hole in his chest the river didnt wash that out monk found himself shaking even more violently you mean hes been murdered surely hed never have shot himself not in the back anyway crow replied went in under his left shoulder blade came out the front i reckon whoever employed him paid his last account monk swallowed are you absolutely sure crow pulled his mouth tight and rolled his eyes very slightly take a look at the bastard yourself but of course im sure im no police surgeon and dont want to be but i know a bullet hole when i see one heavy caliber id say but ask the experts monk straightened up thank you will you and sergeant orme take him to the morgue and call the police surgeon i must tell the prosecutor in the sixsmith case and superintendent runcorn a mans life may hang on this it was an order at least as far as orme was concerned and a request to crow orme relaxed of course he said resignedly come on monk went back to paradise road to tell hester what had happened no message from anyone else however sympathetically or precisely delivered would satisfy heror monks own need to see her and tell her himself he was confused and exhausted by the emotional horror of seeing so many people in agony of body and terror of mind whom he could not help he knew those who were dead had been crushed buried and suffocated in the darkness often alone as they felt life slip away from them hester could not heal that no one could nor could she erase the memory but she would understand just to see her would ease the knots locked hard inside him it was only now that he realized with amazement that he had not had time or emotion to spare to be afraid for himself it was a sweet hot kind of relief he was not a coward at least not physically and he needed to see for himself that scuff was still recovering it was absurd that he should feel so intensely about it but something compelled him to see scuffs face for himself the moment he opened the door he heard movement upstairs before he was halfway along the passage he saw the light go up on the landing and hesters figure on the top step her hair was unpinned and tangled from sleep but she was still dressed although barefooted william she said urgently her voice sharp with anxiety she did not ask specific questions but they were all there implicitly their understanding of each other was founded on the battles and the victories of the past he wanted to know about scuff she answered him before he asked hes getting stronger all the time she said coming silently down the stairs a little feverish about midnight but it passed its going to take a week before he can get up much and far more than that before he can go back to his own life but he will her eyes searched his face she did not ask if the experiences of the night had been terrible she read the answer in his demeanor and the fact that he did not even try to find words for what he had seen when she reached the bottom of the stairs he took her in his arms and held her close hard wordlessly in his mind he blessed over and over again whatever benevolence had led him to choose a woman whose beauty was of the soul brave and vulnerable funny angry and wisesomeone to whom he need explain nothing monk had no time to sleep only to wash and change clothes and eat some hot breakfast of course he also went up to look for a few moments at scuff who was scrubbed clean and sound asleep the boy was still wearing hesters nightgown with the lace edge next to his thin little neck his left shoulder sitting crookedly over his bandages a few hours later at half past eight monk was at rathbones office explaining the nights events a messenger was dispatched urgently to runcorn telling him to contact melisande ewart with a request that she be at the old bailey along with runcorn that morning if she was unwilling a summons would be issued by ten oclock the court was in session and rathbone had asked permission to call monk to the witness stand monk was startled by how stiff he was and how his legs ached as he climbed up he had to grip the rail to steady himself even after a meal and a change of clothes he was exhausted his shoulder ached and the violence of the night invaded his mind rathbone looked up at him anxiously the barrister was as elegant as alwaysimmaculately dressed his fair hair smoothbut his eyes were shadowed and his lips pale and pulled a little tight because monk knew him so well he could see the tension in him he knew how close he was to being beaten in the front row of the gallery margaret ballinger sat white and unhappy her eyes seldom left rathbone even though most of the time it was only his back and profile that she could see mr monk rathbone began will you please tell the court where you were last night dobie who apparently had not heard the news immediately objected very well may i rephrase the question rathbone said tightly his voice scraping in his throat as some of the court may know my lord there was a catastrophic cavein at the argyll companys sewer construction tunnel last night he stopped while the public gallery gasped and one or two people cried out the jurors looked at one another in horror the clamor subsided only at the judges demand for order were you called to the scene mr monk rathbone concluded yes monk kept his answers as bare and as direct as possible he glanced only once at sixsmith up in the dock the mans powerful face was cast forward his body rigid with tension and totally unmoving who called you rathbone asked monk sergeant orme of the thames river police did he say why no i believe he assumed that i would want to be involved since i had been investigating the risk of just such a disaster because of james havillands fears and his subsequent death also of course we were doing all we could to help as were the metropolitan police the fire services and various doctors navvies and any ablebodied men in the area your point is taken sir oliver the judge assured him he turned to monk i would like to know inspector what you found was it of the nature that you had been led to fear yes my lord monk replied that and greater please be more specific it was the line that rathbone had intended to take so monk was happy to respond james havilland had intimated that he feared a disaster if there was not a great deal more time and care taken in the excavations he did not record precisely what he fearedor if he did i did not find it there are risks of land movementslippage subsidencein any major work he seemed to fear something further what seems to have occurred last night was that the diggings went too close to an underground river and the river burst the walls carrying an enormous weight of earth and rubble with it and flooding the tunnels there was too much noise of horror and distress from the gallery and jurors for monk to continue and even the judge looked stricken obviously the news had not yet reached the daily papers and few had heard it even by word of mouth silence the judge ordered but there was no anger in his voice he was calling his court to order but without criticism i assume mr monk that you are here in spite of your appalling night because there is some evidence sir oliver feels pertinent to the case even at this late stage of events yes my lord very well sir oliver please ask your questions thank you my lord rathbone acknowledged mr monk during the course of the night did you bring to the surface any bodies of the dead or the still living yes were any of them people that you knew yes who were they two navvies that i had spoken with a toshera man who retrieves objects of value from the sewersand one other man whom i had met once before he stopped abruptly memories of the pistol shot and scuff falling momentarily choking his breath he was so tired that the past and present collided with each other and the courtroom seemed to sway where did you meet him before mr monk monk realized that rathbone had asked him twice he stiffened his back and shoulders in the sewers he replied when i was looking for the man mrs ewart saw coming out of the mews after james havilland was shot you did not arrest him rathbone sounded surprised he shot the boy who was guiding me monk replied i had to get the lad to the surface the judge leaned forward is the boy in satisfactory condition mr monk yes my lord we got him medical treatment took the bullet out he seems to be recovering thank you good good dobie rose to his feet my lord all this is very moving but it actually proves nothing at all this unfortunate man who appears to be without a name is deadconveniently for the prosecutionso he cannot testify to anything at all he may be no more than some unfortunate indigent who thought to sleep quietly in the havillands stable apparently he met his own tragic death when the excavations collapsed and buried him alive we have no right and no evidence to make a villain of him now that he cannot answer for himself he smiled pleased with his point and looked around the courtroom before he resumed his seat sir oliver the judge raised his eyebrows rathbone smiled it was a thin calm gesture that monk had seen on his lips before both when he was winning and moving in for the final thrust and when he was losing and playing a last desperate card mr monk he said smoothly in the utter silence are you certain that this is the same man who shot the boy guiding you in the sewers surely the sewers are extremely dark isnt one face when you are startled and possibly afraid pretty much like another monk gave him a small bleak smile he held a lantern high up i imagine in order to see us better and maybe take aim the moment was etched on his brain as if by a blade he gripped the rail in front of him he had straight black hair and brows a narrow nose and highly unusual teeth his eyeteeth were prominent and longer than the others especially the left one when a man is drawing a gun at you it is a sight you do not forget he decided not to say any more the tension was too stark for decoration with words to be appropriate no one in the room moved except one woman who gave a violent shudder i see rathbone acknowledged and did this unfortunate creature malevolent or not meet his own death as a result of last nights disastrous cavein no hed been shot in the back he was already dead when the cavein occurred dobie shot to his feet objection my lord how can mr monk possibly know that was he there did he see him get shot rathbone merely turned very slowly from dobie to look at monk his eyebrows raised in the dock sixsmith leaned forward the mans legs were broken by the timber and rubble that fell on him monk replied there was no bleeding in the gallery a woman gasped the jurors stared at monk frowning dobie shook his head as if rathbone had taken leave of his wits rathbone waited the living bleed the dead do not monk explained when the heart stops there is no more flow of blood his coat around the gunshot wound was caked with dry blood but his legs were clean rigor mortis had already set in the police surgeon will give you time of death i imagine dobie flushed and said nothing thank you rathbone nodded at monk graciously i have no further questions for you dobie declined to add anything and monk was excused he left the witness box but remained in the court while rathbone called the surgeon who corroborated all that monk had said then runcorn slipped into a seat in the row opposite monks in the gallery just as melisande ewart took the stand she walked up the steps of the witness box and faced the room she was very composed but even those who had not seen her before might have detected the effort it cost her her body was stiff her shoulders rigid monk glanced at runcorn and saw him leaning forward his gaze intent upon melisande as if by strength of will he would support her monk wondered if she had the faintest idea how profound was his feeling and how extraordinary that was for a man such as he if she did would it please her or frighten her or would she treat tenderly that enormous compliment and read its vulnerability as well rathbone moved into the center of the floor the jury sat silent like men carved of ivory mrs ewart rathbone began i believe superintendent runcorn of the metropolitan police has just taken you to identify the body of the man mr monk brought up from the cavein at the construction is that correct yes her voice was clear but very quiet there was a murmur of sympathy around the gallery some of the jurors nodded and their faces softened monk looked up at sixsmith his heavy face was motionless crowded with an emotion impossible to read have you ever seen him before rathbone asked melisande yes she answered with a catch in her voice i saw him coming out of the mews that serves the home where i live at the moment and also served that of mr james havilland when did you see this man on the night of mr havillands death at any other times no never you have seen him just once before today and yet you are certain it is the same man yes now she did not waver at all rathbone could not afford to let it go so easily how is it that you are so sure he persisted because of his face in general but his teeth in particular she replied she was now even paler and she held tightly to the rail as if she needed its support superintendent runcorn moved the mans lips so i could see his teeth i am confident enough to swear under oath that it is the same man runcorn relaxed and eased his body back into the seat letting out his breath in a long sigh thank you mrs ewart rathbone said graciously i have nothing further to ask you i appreciate your time and your courage in facing what must have been extremely unpleasant for you dobie stood up and looked at melisande then at the jury straightening his gown on his shoulders he sat down again rathbone then played a desperate card but he had no choice for he had to show purpose and connection he called jenny argyll she was dressed in full mourning and looked as if she were ready to be pronounced dead herself her movements were awkward she looked neither to the right nor to the left and it seemed as if she might falter and crumple to the ground before she made it all the way to the top of the steps the usher watched her anxiously even sixsmith jerked forward his face suddenly alive with fear the guards beside him pulled him back but not before jenny had looked up at him now her eyes were burning and it seemed as if she might actually collapse alan argyll had yet to testify so he was not in the court had he any idea of the net closing around him rathbone spoke to jenny coaxing from her the agonizing testimony he had wanted so badly only a few days earlier you wrote the letter asking your father to go to his stable at midnight in order to meet someone yes her voice was barely audible whom was he to meet she was ashen my husband there was a gasp around the entire room why in the stable rathbone was asking it was a november night why not in the house where it was warm and dry and refreshment could be offered jenny argyll was ashen she had to force her voice to make it audible to to avoid an interruption by my sister it was to be a secret meeting who asked you to write the letter mrs argyll she closed her eyes as if the terror and betrayal were washing over her like the black water that had burst through the sides of the tunnel and engulfed the navvies deep underground my husband in the dock something indefinable within sixsmith appeared to ease as if he smelled victory at last rathbone allowed a moments terrible silence then he asked the last question did you know that your father was to be killed in that stable mrs argyll no now her voice was strong and shrill my husband told me it was to be a meeting to try to persuade my father that he was wrong about the tunnels and to stop the navvies and toshers from making any more trouble as mr sixsmith has told us rathbone concluded unable to resist making the point thank you mrs argyll dobie looked confused suddenly at the moment when he expected to be swept off his feet the tide had turned and retreated before him with no apparent explanation he asked only one question it was your husband who asked this letter of you mrs argyll not mr sixsmith that is correct she whispered he thanked her and excused her monk looked at the judge whose face was furrowed with puzzlement it seemed that the prosecution and the defense had changed places arguing each others case possibly he had understood what was happening and as long as the law was not flouted nor brought into disrespect he would leave the drama to play itself out he adjourned the court for luncheon in the afternoon monk and runcorn were both there dobie called alan argyll to the stand as rathbone had fervently hoped he would he had done all he could to make it virtually impossible for him not to argyll walked across the floor whitefaced and composed he glanced upwards once towards the dock but it was impossible to tell if his eyes met those of sixsmith or not sixsmith was leaning forward again surely he must see freedom almost in his grasp but argyll had not been in the court for his wifes testimony he did not know his grip over her was broken he waited for rathbone as if he thought he was still certain of victory perhaps he did not even see the open hostility on the jurors faces he looked at dobie without a tremor and his voice was clear when he answered no i did not ask my wife to write such a letter he even managed to affect surprise dobie looked disbelieving there is no question that the letter existed mr argyll or that your wife wrote it she has admitted as much to this court if not at your request at whose would she do such a thing argyll paled monk could see from the angle of his head and the way his hands gripped the rail in front of him that he was suddenly frightened he started to look up at sixsmith then forced himself not to was he beginning at last to understand i have no idea he said with difficulty dobie grew sarcastic one of your children perhaps your sisterinlaw or your brother argylls face flamed and his hands clenched on the rail he swayed as if he might fall over my brother is dead sir because mary havilland dragged him down with her and you stand there and accuse him of of what how much courage does it take to accuse a murdered man you disgrace the office you hold and are a blemish to your profession dobie blanched clearly embarrassed and momentarily at a loss to defend himself the judge looked from one to the other of them then up at aston sixsmith whose face was now expressionless lastly he looked at jenny argyll who was ashen her gaze was fixed in the distance as if she were held against her will by some inner vision unable to tear herself from it rathbone said nothing the judge looked at dobie again mr dobie do you wish to rephrase your question it seems inadequate as it is i will move on with your lordships permission dobie said clearing his throat and looking again at argyll james havilland was in the stables alone at midnight for whom else would he keep such an extraordinary appointment i dont know argyll protested have you ever seen this man they describe whose teeth are apparently so uniquely recognizable the man who it is suggested actually murdered your fatherinlaw argyll hesitated there was a faint cough in the gallery a creak of whalebone stays then silence jenny argyll looked up at sixsmith their eyes met and lingered for a moment then she turned away what was it monk saw in sixsmith s face pity for what she was about to lose forgiveness that she had not had the courage to do it before or anger that she had let him suffer right to the brink and spoken up only when she had been forced to his look was steady and unreadable argyll swallowed yes as sixsmith said i wanted to hire someone to prevent the unrest among navvies regarding safety and stop the toshers whose territories were disappearing from becoming violent and disrupting the excavations he drew in his breath we have to finish the new sewers as soon as possible the threat of disease is appalling there was a rustle of movement in the room monk stared at the jury there was unease among them but no sympathy did they believe him we are aware of this mr argyll dobie answered beginning to regain his composure it is not what you are doing that we question only the methods you are willing to employ in order to accomplish them you admit that you met this man and that you gave mr sixsmith the money to pay him for his work the answer seemed torn from argyll yes but to quell violence not to kill havilland but havilland was a nuisance wasnt he dobie raised his voice challenging him now he took a couple of steps toward the stand he believed you were moving too quickly didnt he mr argyll he feared you might disturb the land cause a subsidence and possibly even break through into an old uncharted underground river didnt he argyll was now so white he looked as if he might collapse i dont know what he thought he shouted back his voice ragged dont you dobie said sarcastically he turned away then spun around and faced the witness stand again but he was a nuisance wasnt he and even after he was dead shot in his own stable at midnight and buried in a suicides grave his daughter mary pressed his cause and took it up herself didnt she he was pointing his finger now and where is she also in a suicides grave along with your ally and younger brother his smile was triumphant thank you mr argyll the court needs no more from you at least not yet he waved his arm to invite rathbone to question argyll if he should wish to rathbone declined victory was almost within his grasp the judge blinked and looked at rathbone curiously but he made no remark dobie called aston sixsmith rathbones ploy was hardly a gamble anymore sixsmith mounted the stand the man exuded intelligence and animal power exhausted as he was there was a rustle of sympathy from the crowd now even the jurors smiled at him he ignored them all hoarding his emotion to himself not yet able to betray his awareness of how close he had been to prison or even the rope he looked once again at jenny argyll for an instant there was a softening in his face gone again almost before it was seen a sense of decency his gaze barely touched alan argyll his erstwhile employer was finished worthless from the gallery monk watched sixsmith with an increasing sense of incredulity rathbone had won monk looked across at margaret bellinger and saw her eagerness for the moment her pride in rathbones extraordinary achievement for justice dobie was questioning sixsmith ramming home the victory did you ever meet this extraordinary assassin before the night you paid him the money mr argyll gave you he asked no sir i did not sixsmith replied quietly or after that no sir have you any idea who shot him or why i know no more than you do sir why did you give him the money for what purpose was it to kill james havilland because he was causing you trouble and possibly expensive delays no sir mr argyll told me it was to hire men to keep the toshers and navvies from disrupting the work and what about mr havilland i understood that mr argyll was going to deal with that himself how sixsmiths gaze was intense show him that he was mistaken mr havilland was his fatherinlaw and i believed that relations were cordial between them could this man this assassin have misunderstood you sixsmith stared at him no sir i was quite specific dobie could not resist making the very most of it he looked at the jury then at the gallery describe the scene for us he said at last to sixsmith let the court see exactly how it was sixsmith obeyed him speaking slowly and carefully like a man emerging from a nightmare into the daylight of sanity he described the room in the public house the noise the smell of ale the straw on the floor the press of men he came in at about ten oclock as near as i can tell he went on in response to dobies prompting i knew him straightaway he was fairly tall and thin especially his face his hair was black and straight rather long over his collar his nose was thin at the bridge but most of all he had these extraordinary teeth which i saw when he smiled he bought a tankard of ale and came straight over to me as if he already knew who i was someone must have described me very well the man introduced himself using argylls name so i would know who he was we discussed the problem of the toshers in particular and i told him a little more about it i gave him the money he accepted it folded it away and then stood up i remember he emptied the tankard in one long draught and then he left without once looking backwards dobie thanked him and invited rathbone to contest it if he wished rathbone conceded defeat with both dignity and grace not by so much as a glance did he admit that it was actually the most elegant and perhaps the most difficult victory of his career the jury returned a verdict of guilty of attempted bribery and the judge imposed a fine that was no more than a weeks pay the court erupted in cheers the gallery rising to its feet the jury looked intensely satisfied turning to shake one anothers hands and pass words of congratulation margaret abandoned decorum and met rathbone halfway across the floor as he walked towards her her face was shining but whatever she said to him was lost in the uproar monk also was on his feet he would speak a word or two to runcorn thank him for his courage in being willing to reexamine a case then he would go home to tell hesterand scuff twelve the trial had finished promptly so monk was home comparatively early the weather was bright and clear and the february evening stretched out with no cloudsonly trails of chimney smoke across the waning sky it was going to freeze and as he alighted from the omnibus the stones beneath his feet were already filmed with ice but the air tasted fresh and the sweetness of victory was in it the sun was low and its reflection on the pale stretches of the river hurt his eyes the masts of the ships were a black fretwork like wrought iron against the rich colors of the horizon beyond the rooftops he turned and walked smartly up union road to paradise place and then up the short path to his front door as soon as he was inside he called out hesters name she must have heard the triumph in his voice her face eager she appeared at the top of the stairs from the bedroom where she had been sitting with scuff we won he said starting up the steps two at a time he caught hold of her and swung her around kissing her lips neck cheek and lips again we won it all sixsmith was convicted of no more than attempted bribery and fined everyone knew that argyll was guilty and hes probably been arrested already i didnt wait to see rathbone was brilliant superb margaret was so proud of him she absolutely glowed the bedroom door was open and scuff was sitting up staring at them he looked unnaturally pink his hair was actually much fairer than monk had supposed he seemed to have forgotten about the lace on his nightgown or even that it was hesters his shoulder must hurt him but he was making little of that too now his eyes were bright with expectation longing to be told all there was to hear hester led monk into the room and sat on the bed herself so that he could recount it to them both yer won scuff said excitedly they gonna get argyll fer killin poor avilland an miss mary as well yer gonna bury em proper yes monk said simply scuffs eyes were shining he was sitting close to hester quite naturally both of them seemed to be unaware of it ow dyer do it he said hungry for any piece of information he had sorely missed being there to see it himself would you like a cup of tea before we begin hester asked scuff looked at her with total incomprehension monk rolled his eyes she smiled right then you get nothing until its all told every last word he began with the days proceedings recounting it as a story of adventure with all the details looking at their faces and enjoying himself he described the courtroom the judge the jurors the men and women in the gallery and every witness scuff barely breathed he could hardly bring himself even to blink monk told them how he had climbed the steps to the witness box and stared at the court below him how sixsmith had craned forward in the dock and how rathbone had asked the questions on which it all turned i described him exactly he said remembering it with aching clarity there wasnt a sound in the whole room did they know e was the man wot killed mr avilland scuff whispered dyer tell em wot the sewer were like oh yes i told them how we met him the first time and how he turned around and shot you that horrified them monk answered honestly i described the dark and the water and the rats scuff gave an involuntary little shiver at the memory of the terror without realizing it he moved a fraction closer to hester so that he was actually touching her she appeared to take no notice except that there was a slight softening of her lips as if she wanted to smile but knew she should not let him see it did jenny argyll give evidence she asked yes monk met her eyes for a moment of appreciation and an acknowledgment of what it had cost rose applegate she told it all argyll denied it of course but no one believed him if hed looked at the jurors faces he could have seen his own condemnation then he realized suddenly what a final thing he had said they had accomplished it the seemingly impossible sixsmith was free and the law knew that alan argyll was guilty it would be only a matter of time before he was on trial himself funny hester said aloud well never know his name the man who actually shot james havilland no he agreed but he was only a means to an end and hes dead anyway the thing that matters is that the man behind it will be punished justly and perhaps there will even be more care taken in the routing of new tunnels or at least in the speed with which theyre done but argyll will be charged hester insisted so mary havilland can be buried properly and and her father too ill make certain he meant it as a promise seeing the warmth in her eyes he knew that she understood did sixsmith give evidence she asked explain it all he seemed like a decent mana bit rough perhaps but its a rough profession he he felt things deeply i thought he smiled oh yes its always a risk putting an accused man into the dock but he was excellent he described exactly what happened how argyll gave him the money and what he told him it was for which was to bribe the toshers who were making trouble it made sense and you could see that the jury believed it he remembered sixsmiths face in the witness box as he told it he said he had not known what the man looked like and he sat waiting for him the man recognized him immediately and came over he was fairly tall lean with long black hair onto his collar and he stopped the room swayed around him and his limbs suddenly felt far away and cold as if they belonged to someone else sixsmith had described the assassin as he had been when he was killed not when melisande ewart had seen him on the night of havillands death or two days before what is it william whats wrong it was hesters voice calling from a great distance fuzzy at the edges she sounded frightened scuff was pressed up next to her his eyes wide picking up her emotion when monk spoke his mouth was dry sixsmith said his hair was long he swore he saw him only once two days before havillands death but in fact his hair was shorter then much shorter mrs ewart said only a little longer than most mens but it was over his collar when i found him dead hester stared at him horror slowly filling his eyes you mean sixsmith saw him just before he was killed then she stopped unable to finish the thought he killed him monk said it for her argyll was telling the truth he probably gave sixsmith the money to bribe the toshers exactly as he told us it was sixsmith who gave the order to kill havilland and possibly mary as well but argyll couldnt be innocent hester argued it was he who had jenny write she tailed off or perhaps it wasnt perhaps she lied and it was sixsmith who told her to but why scuff was looking at her anxiously his mouth twisted down at the corners he might be only nine or ten but he had lived on the streets he had seen violence beatings revenge she ate im that much he asked wonderingly thats daft less e knocked er alf senseless so she would lie to incriminate her husband and get sixsmith free hester said with awe and disgust argyll might be cold and bore her to death but could she really be in love with sixsmith to that degree knowing what he did oh william he murdered her father and her sister has she lost her wits completely or her voice dropped or is she now too afraid of him to do anything else i dont know he admitted i i dont know his mind raced to the memory of jenny argylls eyes in court the power in sixsmith and the way she had looked at him it had not felt like fear then more like hunger scuff looked from one to the other of them wot yer gonna do he asked yer gonna let im get away wi it there was incredulity in his face it was impossible to believe such a thing you cant be tried twice for the same crime monk explained bitterly the jury found him not guilty but they int right scuff protested e done it e paid the man wot shot mr avilland it wasnt mr argyll arter all yer cant let im get topped fer it it int right even if e is a greedy sod but he wasnt tried for shooting the assassin hester pointed out eagerly nobody was it was true no one had specifically made any charge about the murder of the assassin it had simply been implicit that it was argyll because he had the motive but sixsmith could be charged with that legally it was perfectly possible in fact it was absolutely imperative that he must be for only then would the charges against argyll be dropped monk stood up slowly oddly stiff i must go and tell rathbone hester stood also tonight yes i cant leave it im sorry she nodded slowly she did not explain that she wanted to come but could not scuff understood however im all right he chipped in i know hester agreed quickly but im not leaving you anyway so dont bother arguing with me but she froze him with a look and he subsided wideeyed his lips quivering between tears and a smile refusing to let her see how much her caring mattered to him monk looked at them for a moment longer then turned and left the hansom dropped him outside rathbones house he told the driver to wait although the lights were on it might only mean that the manservant was in but at least he would probably know where rathbone could be found as it was rathbone was at dinner as monk had expected with margaret ballinger mr and mrs ballinger were present also as chaperones at this delicate stage in the younger couples betrothal too they were delighted to be included in what was also the celebration of a victory they did not in the least understand its nature but they were aware of its importance im sorry monk apologized to the butler in the hall but it is imperative that i speak to sir oliver immediately and in private im afraid sir that sir oliver is dining the manservant apologized the soup has just been served i cannot interrupt them at present may i offer you something in the morning room perhaps that is if you would care to wait no thank you monk declined please tell sir oliver that i have discovered a fact of devastating importance regarding the sixsmith case the verdict cannot be allowed to stand as it is his attention cannot wait the manservant hesitated looked more earnestly at monk then decided to obey five minutes later rathbone appeared elegantly dressed in evening clothes what is it he asked as he closed the door on the glittering dining room behind him shutting out the voices the laughter and the clink of glasses i am in the middle of dinner and have guests you are welcome to join us if you wish heaven knows you did more than anyone else to bring about our victory monk took a deep breath it was not a victory rathbone do you remember sixsmith describing the assassin when he passed him the money rathbone frowned of course what of it do you remember melisande ewarts description of him when he came out of the mews after he had just shot havilland two days after that yes it was obviously the same man there cant be two looking like that rathbone s face was puzzled and on the edge of losing patience hair monk said simply i saw him when he was dead and his hair was long over his collar so did sixsmith that was what he was describing on the stand rathbone blushed are you saying that he didnt pay him the money what his eyes widened suddenly he understood and the color died from his face sixsmith shot him god in heavenhe was guilty all the time we got him off i got him off but not for killing the assassin monk said quietly rathbone stared at him with dawning comprehension there was a knock on the door rathbone turned around slowly come he answered margaret entered she glanced at rathbone then at monk a question in her eyes she was dressed in extravagant oyster satin with pearls at her ears and throat and there was a warmth in her face that no artifice could lend rathbone went to her immediately touching her with intense gentleness we were wrong he said simply monk has just pointed out that sixsmith must have shot the assassin and more essentially that we have accused the wrong man to save him we must at the very least prove sixsmiths guilt of the assassins death and if possible convict him of it margaret turned to monk to verify from his face if that could possibly be true she needed only an instant to see that it was then we must do it she said quietly but how the trial is finished would taking his testimony to anyone be sufficient no monk said with certainty we must prove the whole line of connection the fact that he knew the man all the way through he saw in her face that she did not understand if we charged sixsmith now he explained on the strength of his description of the assassin he could say he heard it from argyll or anyone else he might slip away again he smiled bleakly we must be right this time i see her answer was simple she was not a beautiful woman her looks being rather more individual but at this moment there was a true beauty in her face as she turned back to rathbone well celebrate when we have it right she said calmly i shall explain to mama and papa and we can finish dinner quite pleasantly and then go home please do what is necessary it cannot wait whatever time it takes however difficult it is it must be accomplished before argyll is charged and tried they would hang him for james havillands death perhaps for marys as well although i suppose it could have been toby who was to blame for that do you suppose toby did that for sixsmith rathbone was thoughtful but he did not take his eyes from her face possibly but he might not have realized all the implications sixsmith could have asked him to speak to her try to persuade her that her fathers death was suicide after all and that she was only making it worse by continuing to probe it almost certainly he would try to persuade her that there was no danger in the tunnels was that what james havilland was afraid of uncharted underground rivers she turned to monk yes i think so toby seems to have spoken to toshers a lot too but that could have been to try to stop them from interfering with the work thats what i thought to begin with i dont think well ever know if he meant to kill mary probably not not unless there was far more between him and sixsmith than we know he tried to visualize again what he had seen on the bridge i think it was an accident she was frightened of him perhaps she thought alan argyll was behind her fathers death and that toby was going to kill her too she tried to get away from him and whether she meant to or not she took him with her as he said it he was not sure if that was what he really believed could sixsmith deliberately have corrupted toby argyll he remembered alan argylls grief when he had heard of his brothers death grief or guilt we wont know will we margaret said sadly probably not he admitted and mrs argyll she persisted she swore it was her husband who told her to write the letter i know rathbone answered her there are a lot of things we still have to learn and to prove but we cant afford to wait im sorry i understand she gave him a smile that was intimate and a little sad but only for the moment missed no more she excused herself and left rathbone looked at monk for the first time since rathbone had realized he was in love with hester there was no envy in his eyes only a deep happiness he smiled at monk monk smiled back at him surprised how pleased he was im sorry he said again where are we going to start rathbone asked him monk looked rathbones elegant figure up and down with rather older clothes i think we need to find and prove the connection between sixsmith and the assassin rathbones eyes widened for gods sake monk how sixsmith worked in the sewer excavations he could have been anywhere when he was out on bail it was only a bribery charge and no one has the faintest idea where the assassin was we dont even have a name for him youve summed it up perfectly monk said with a smile that was more like a baring of teeth i plan on enlisting all the help i can ill start with runcorn orme and as many of my own men as i can spare then the doctor crow hell be happy to help because the assassin shot scuff then ill get as many navvies asll help toshers gangers and watermen too and ill try to get sutton the ratcatcher he knows the hidden rivers and wells that very few other people do all the hiding places people who wont speak to us will speak to him there was horror disgust and selfmockery in rathbones face and what is it you imagine i can do in this this pursuit of the unspeakable monk grinned now oh you are in command he assured him you will tell us what is proof and what is not rathbone gave him a dark twisted look and excused himself to change his clothes they went first to runcorn as a matter of geographical simplicity he was horrified as they had known he would be even more than that he was angry with himself for not having seen the difference in the two descriptions of the assassin no one did monk assured him honestly it was only when i was telling hester about it and repeating it myself that i realized that one detail too much was his only slip runcorns face was hard and bleak ill trace each step of that bastards way he promised if i have to climb or crawl through every sewer in london and question the bloody rats at the thought marks face pulled tight his mouth in a downward turn but he did not argue next they got orme out of his bed with an apology for the hour as he could just barely have gone to sleep after a hard day he made no complaints not even by change of expression on his face monk hoped profoundly that it was not because he did not dare to orme had earned the right to respect and consideration for his feelings his wellbeing and the fact that he might have other cares and occupations in life than serving the demands of the river police in general or monk in particular i cant do it without you monk said frankly thats all right sir ows the boy orme replied dashing cold water on his face to wake himself up they were standing in the kitchen of his small home where monk had never before been he was uncomfortably aware that not only had he intruded uninvited on the one place where orme had privacy mastery but also he had brought others who were strangers in all but name recovering well he replied can i make you a cup of tea while you dress orme stared at him ill make it sir if you just like ill do it monk insisted im not asking for instructions just permission yes sir the teas in the caddy up there he pointed to an indianstyle tin at the back of the tidy kitchen shelf the kettles beside the stove and theres milk in the pantry cupboard waters already pumped for the morning but thank you monk interrupted him again just dress theres no need to shave were going down into the sewers orme obeyed monk moved around the small immaculately tidy kitchen while runcorn riddled the last ash from the stove and piled it delicately with new coal to make it burn up again warm the kitchen and boil the water in the kettle rathbone merely sat and watched as his skills would be required later seven minutes later orme was back down dressed for going onto the river then over hot strong tea they discussed the exact tactics of how they would hunt down the evidence they needed to hang aston sixsmith what do we need sir orme looked at rathbone rathbone had obviously been considering it we have on sixsmiths own admission that he knew this assassin he frowned i wish we could find a name for the man we need unarguable evidence that sixsmith knew him with the credible assumption that he also knew his occupation it seems obvious enough that sixsmith told argyll of the trouble toshers and other men were causing and that they needed to be bought off you might see if thats actually true how much trouble were the toshers because the money went to the assassin and yet the work is still apparently going on he looked at them in turn what about the cavein runcorn asked do we knew exactly what caused that and if it was foreseeable was it what james havilland was afraid of has it anything to do with sixsmith and what about mary monk added and what connection was there between sixsmith and toby argyll rathbone asked in short alan argyll may be technically innocent of having hired the assassin but is he innocent of everything is this one man or a conspiracy orme looked at monk questions sir we gotta find people oove seen sixsmith an the man wi the teeth afore avilland were shot an prove as they know each other we gotta find navvies an toshers an the like oo know if sixsmith knew about the dangers o movin that machine too fast an cuttin wiout askin enough about streams an wells an the like rathbones eyes widened exactly he agreed very well summed up mr orme he gave a very slight smile perhaps you dont really need my presence monk gave him a wry look and then smiled back we couldnt possibly manage without you rathbone he replied they spent some further time apportioning duties and planning where and how often to meet in order to compare notes and keep each other informed they had an hours sleep sitting in the chairs in the kitchen then another hot cup of tea and several slices of thick toast by half past four they were on their way towards the main road where they caught a hansom and started the journey to the tunnel they stopped to pick up crow he was a sleepy and startled recruit but willing enough when he heard the truth of the events he sent a messenger to find sutton and tell him where they were going and that it was extremely urgent that he join them they did not wait for the ratcatcher but arranged a rendezvous the wind was gusting hard and carried the smell of rain as they made their way down the muddy slope to the bottom of the tunnel the walls oozed water in the lantern light and on the bottom it was running slowly in between the broken bricks and pebbles the wooden planks were slimy underfoot when monk held his lantern up the beam shone on the mist of fine rain lighting the wet walls and the planks that held them back but barely reaching the higher beams that forced them apart crisscrossing upwards to an invisible sky the air smelled of earth water and old wood monk wrinkled his nose not knowing if he really smelled the sour odor of sewers or if it was just conjured by memory and imagination he had to make a greater effort than he had expected in order to force himself to walk calmly under the brick facing of the tunnel and the vast weight of earth on top of him their feet echoed on the boards and the water sloshed around the wood and up over the soles of his boots it was bitterly cold he heard rathbone gasp behind him and wondered if the darkness suffocated him as much if it brought out the sweat on his skin and made him strain his eyes and ears for anything that would give him a sense of proportion direction any of the things one takes for granted aboveground a thousand yards on they separated in order to cover as much ground as possible for safetys sake they went in pairs runcorn and orme rathbone and crow with monk to wait at the appointed place for sutton dont go by yerself sir orme warned his voice sharp with anxiety one slip an yer finished it yer ead an the ratsll get yer it int a nice way ter go monk saw rathbones sensitive mouth twist in revulsion and he smiled i wont sergeant i promise you orme nodded and disappeared into the darkness behind runcorn their lights swallowed up in moments rathbone took a deep breath and body rigid followed after crow without once looking backwards perhaps he was afraid that if he did he would lose his nerve to proceed sutton arrived twentyfive minutes later accompanied as always by the little dog its a bad business mr monk he said grimly were d yer wanna start the decision had already been made the other four are looking to find out if sixsmith was ever seen with the assassin and if so when and by whom i want to find out more about the dangers of cavein that havilland was so worried about and how much sixsmith actually knew of it yer mean could e ave stopped it sutton asked he frowned dont make no sense mr monk why couldnt e ave gone careful if ed really understood cavein dont do im no good when i thought sixsmith was innocent monk explained beginning to walk deeper into the tunnel i assumed argyll was giving the orders and he had little choice i took it for granted that whatever he feared he would have told argyll and been ignored but maybe thats not true is he callous a villain or just incompetent whyd e ave avilland killed sutton asked curiously following on monks heels it ad ter be ter keep im quiet about the dangers adnt it yes but that doesnt mean he believed him he might have thought havilland was just scaremongering sutton grunted mebbe the first thing they did was to find navvies at the excavation face and question them they moved with speed after the ordeal of the trial they did not expect sixsmith back at the site that day but it was not impossible that he would be there he was a man accused wrongly according to the law and found innocent by his peers if they seemed to others to be harassing him now their position would be unpleasant to say the least he might even claim they were exceeding their office monks career could be jeopardized and possibly ormes and runcorns as well rathbones reputation would not profit from his expedition into the sewers to pursue a man he had prosecuted and failed to convict he would appear to be losing with neither dignity nor honor the navvies told them nothing and after an hour or so monk realized he was wasting his time instead he took suttons advice and sought out a couple of toshers they were father and son amazingly alike both bluntfaced with a cheerful and sarcastic disposition sixsmith the father said with a twist of his mouth strong feller not scared o nobody yeh i knowed im why monk allowed sutton to ask the question they had already planned what to say e dint kill avilland arter all sutton replied casually e really thought as the money were ter pay off toshers wot was makin trouble an im the queen o the fairies the father said witheringly yer sayin as yer never took no money sutton asked his voice almost expressionless werent nothin ter take sixsmiths a bleedin liar the son added angrily we werent makin no trouble an wots more mr sutton just cos yer catches rats fer the gentry it dont give yer no right ter say as we were yer know that yer scurvy bastard i know yer dint used ter sutton agreed ow about others wot about big jem or lanky or any o them we int stupid the father retorted gettin meself in jail wont elp no one did mr sixsmith know that monk asked speaking for the first time course e did the father looked at him his face screwed up in disgust like a gargoyle in the lantern light es a fly sod an all not fly enough to avoid a cavein monk observed course e were the father said intently e knew as much about streams and wells and clay stretches as any of us e just dont give a toss they asked other toshers but nothing they could elicit contradicted the belief that there was no more trouble than usual just the odd quarrel or fight there had been no deliberate sabotage and the accidents were rather fewer than average for the heavy and dangerous work in progress the thing that struck monk most forcibly and which he told the others when they went up in the middle of the day was that in everyones opinion sixsmith was an extremely clever and able man who was very well aware of all the risks and advantages of everything he did so he knew about the streams and wells rathbone said grimly he looked strained his nostrils flared with the stench he had been unable to avoid his clothes were spattered with mud and clay and his boots were sodden even the bottoms of his trousers were wet yes monk agreed knowing what the inevitable conclusion must be it seems he did not care about the cavein or he may even have wanted it rathbone added but why what is it that we dont know monk whats missing to make sense of this he turned to runcorn and orme e knew the assassin orme said his face tight avent got a witness as yer could bring inter court yet but theyre there e knew is way around did sixsmith dont put him in the past runcorn looked at them each in turn hes still very much here weve got to hurry before he covers his tracksor us monk found himself shivering rathbones face was bleak and angry no one argued briefly they conferred on the next step then set out again cold tired and determined hester slept poorly after monk had gone the shock of defeat just as they were savoring what she imagined to be one of their sweetest victories had left her momentarily numb she cleared away the supper dishes and tidied the house automatically then went upstairs to see if there was anything more she could do for scuff she might have stayed up were it not for him but she knew he could not rest if she did not do so as well she was lying awake at about five oclock wondering how they could have been so bitterly wrong when scuff spoke to her in a whisper yer int asleep are yer it was not a question he must have known from her breathing no she replied but why arent you cos i cant he inched a fraction closer to her is mr monk gonna put it right should she lie to comfort him if he found out it would break the frail trust he was building she might never mend the damage wasnt truth better than the loneliness of that no matter how harsh thats what she would do if he were a man but was a child different how much should she protect him and from what is e scuff repeated he was not touching her and yet she knew his body was stiff hell try she answered nobody wins all the time this could be a mistake we cant mend i dont know he let out his breath in a sigh and relaxed inching another tiny fraction closer to her mr avilland were right about their machines werent e im afraid he was she agreed at least partly he was also right about going ahead too quickly without making sure where all the streams were mr sixsmith were the boss down there yerd think as ed a told mr argyll wouldnt yer he whispered he must have she agreed as she said it she realized with a chill in spite of the blankets over her that it was not necessarily true but it made no sense wots the matter scuff demanded at least i suppose hed have told mr argyll she answered he put his hand on her shoulder so lightly she barely felt it only its warmth theres summink as dont make no sense int there is mr monk gonna be all right i should a bin there to look arter im i think mebbe that sixsmith s real bad but what does sixsmith want she said as much to herself as to him money power love escape from something she turned a little towards him do you suppose it was because of mrs argyll shes in love with him i think and her husband is a cold man she must feel terribly alone werent mr avilland er pa too he asked yes i dont believe she knew the assassin was going to kill her father and afterwards she thought it was her husband who had done it maybe she still doesnt know it was sixsmith and we cant prove it but e knows scuff pointed out so e dint do it for er if yer love someone yer dint kill er pa no she stared up at the ceiling the faintest of lights coming through the curtains from the streetlamps outside maybe he doesnt love her so much as just want her it isnt the same mebbe e just ates mr argyll scuff said thoughtfully yer gotta member e made it look like it were mr argyll wot paid the assassin an it were mr argylls company wot caused the cavein and mr argyll wots goin ter prisin or mebbe the rope eh thats an awful lot of hate she said quietly shivering again in spite of herself why would anyone hate that much i dunno he answered must a bin summink bad it must have been she agreed but her mind was beginning to wonder what jenny had felt did she believe that when her husband was imprisoned or even hanged she would be rescued from her boredom and emotional desert by sixsmith was she so in love with him that she had thought no further than that what would happen when argyll was shown to be innocent and sixsmith guilty jenny had lied about who told her to write the letter that was what had turned the tide against argyll sixsmith knew that what sort of future awaited her then had she used sixsmith to get rid of argyll so that her children would inherit the company since toby was also dead and they would get whatever james havilland had possessed also since mary was gone as well did she imagine that this would hold sixsmith to her and was that what she wanted surely if she had any sense she would fear for her own life or did she believe he truly loved her yerve thought of summink avent yer scuff whispered beside her yes she answered honestly i need to go and see mrs argyll she lied in court and she needs to know what that could cost her ill send a letter first thing to ask margaret ballinger to come to sit with you until i get back i don need no one he said instantly im almost better no you arent she retorted and whether you need anyone or not i need there to be someone here so i can stop worrying about you and keep my mind on what im doing dont argue with me ive made up my mind and youll like margaret i expect mr monk said yer as stubborn as an army mule did he indeed well mr monk wouldnt know an army mule if it kicked him scuff giggled obviously the idea entertained him but i would she added before he got any ideas of insubordination yerd kick it back he said with immense satisfaction and moved the last couple of inches until he was next to her she put an arm around him very lightly in five minutes he was asleep in the morning she sent one of the local boys to take a message to margaret wait for her answer and return with it she gave him fare for a hansom both ways and something for himself it was extravagant but she judged it necessary not only for her own peace of mind but for monks also she had not misread the affection in his face for scuff no matter how carefully he tried to mask it she arrived at the argyll house a little after ten oclock it was strange to realize that the rest of the world still believed argyll guilty and sixsmith innocent for a moment terror overtook her as she walked across the pavement to the steps up to the front door what if sixsmith was there already if he and jenny were lovers they might have celebrated their victory together no that would be foolish even if argyll had already been arrested it might arouse suspicions in order to preserve any dignity or belief in her jenny argyll would have to play the shocked and grieving wife rescued in time by the innocent man they would be two victims together of argylls wickedness hester straightened her shoulders and mounted the steps to the front door head high the bell was answered by a redeyed parlor maid and hester told her that she was here to see mrs argyll on a matter of great importance and urgency hester guessed from the girls appearance that argyll had already been arrested im sorry madam but mrs argyll is unwell the maid began she isnt receiving today i was in court yesterday hester replied what i have to say will prove mr argylls innocence she did not add that it would also prove mrs argylls guilt the parlor maids eyes opened wide then she stepped back and invited hester in she was flustered happy and still frightened she left hester in the withdrawing room the only place even remotely warm from the embers of the previous nights fire such domestic duties had been utterly neglected that day ten minutes later jenny argyll came in her black gown was very well cut and flattered her slenderness her hair was styled less severely than earlier but her face was almost bloodlessly pale and there were bruised shadows around her eyes she looked feminine and vulnerable hesters last doubts that jenny was in love with sixsmith were swept away jenny could have helped her actions but her emotions were beyond her mastery good morning mrs monk jenny said with faint surprise her voice trembled a little was it tension exhaustion or fear my maid tells me you know something of urgent importance about my husbands arrest is that true hester had to force herself to remember rose applegates humiliation in order to say what she must she was certain now that it had been jenny who had poisoned roses food or drink with alcohol not argyll it was she who had the motive and surely it could only have been she who had known of roses weakness had roses resolve slipped before or had she confided in someone in a moment of weakness perhaps as her reason for not joining them in wine or a champagne toast to some event one might require such an excuse to avoid giving offense for example at a wedding jenny was waiting yes it is true hester replied i went into court believing as did my husband that mr sixsmith was innocent of everything except the very understandable offense of trying to bribe certain troublemakers to stop sabotaging the construction the only reason he was charged at all was in order to bring the whole subject of james havillands death to court and during the proceedings to prove that it was actually your husband who was guilty then you succeeded jenny said with almost no expression why have you bothered to come and tell me this do you imagine i care what possible difference do your reasons or your beliefs make to me hester looked at her was any of that hurt or outrage real or was she showing that emotion to mask the sense of victory she must feel now the prize was almost in her hands none at all hester admitted calmly it is the fact that we were mistaken that is of importance your husband was not guilty and i am almost certain that we can prove that jenny stood motionless her eyes wide unfocused for a moment hester was afraid she might faint not guilty she said hoarsely how can that be he has been arrested that was a denial almost a defiance hester hoped fervently that sixsmith was not in the house was she taking a stupid risk it was too late to retreat now but you dont believe him guilty surely how how can i not because you know without any doubt who it was that asked you to write the letter to your father and since it was sixsmith who paid to have him killed it is impossible to believe that it was not also sixsmith who arranged to have him be in the stables hester replied jenny drew in her breath raising her hands as if to push hester away physically oh no i you are in love with him hester continued yes i know so much is apparent but however infatuated you are it does not excuse the deaths of your father and your sister and the shame of a suicides grave for both the anger and all her own old pain poured into her voice until it shook she had to gulp for breath and try to steady herself you may not have known at first but dont tell me you dont know now i dont jenny denied furiously youre lying my husband is guilty the court knows that you have no right to come here saying such terrible things terrible hester challenged her it is terrible that sixsmith could be guilty of killing your father but not that your husband is i think that judgment betrays your loyalties rather clearly mrs argyll you accuse me jenny shot back of course i do it was you who swore on oath that it was your husband who made you write the letter that lured your father to his death you could not mistake such a thing it had to be a deliberate betrayal of both your husband and your father what does sixsmith offer you that is worth that jenny gasped get out of my house you she could not find words to protect herself is he such a lover hester went on allowing her own past helplessness to drive her anger how dare you jenny shouted you ignorant complacent stupid woman with your good works and your petty little ideas what on earth do you know of passion i know love and hate and the price you pay for each hester replied i know death and ive seen better men than youve ever known give their lives for what they believed in ive seen grief and war and murder ive made more terrible mistakes and ive loved till i thought id die of it ive let people down because ive been weak or shortsighted but ive never deliberately betrayed anyone you betrayed your father your sister your husband and rose applegate as well was that really worth it just to lie with aston sixsmith jenny swung her arm around and slapped hester across the face as hard as she could sending her staggering backwards until she fell onto the armchair several steps behind her hester climbed to her feet slowly hand to her burning cheek i see that it wasnt she observed jenny took a step towards her face scarlet eyes bright with rage hester was prepared this time her own hand ready fist closed sixsmith murdered the assassin she said shot him and left him to be crushed and buried under the cavein and dont bother to argue that it was what gave him away he described the man as he was when he was killed not when sixsmith said he paid him it was his only mistake but it was enough itll save your husband from the rope or is that not what you want to hear that was an accusation with the bitterest contempt i dont want any of it jenny said desperately and youre lying it cant be true hester did not bother to argue he murdered your father and your sister and hes going to murder your husband is that the sort of man you trust to look after you not to mention your children if youve got any wits left at all youll save yourself while you can your husbands going to be freed whatever you do and sixsmith will hang jenny looked at her with loathing and what does it profit you mrs monk why do you care if i survive or not i think youre lying and you need me to betray aston or hell still beat you and alan hester forced herself to smile but she knew it was a cold uncertain gesture are you prepared to wager your life on no one finding evidence now that they know where to look more than that are you sure your own future is safe with a man who will kill when it suits him who betrayed the man who employed him and trusted him by taking his wife and who set him up to hang for a murder he didnt commit look who is dead are you sure you are not the next when your usefulness to him is over or he finds a younger prettier woman who isnt weighed down with another mans children or could it be that your children are heirs to the whole argyll inheritance could that be your value to him and if you marry him whose will it be then tobys dead too and mary jennys face collapsed hester imagined the memories that might be racing through her mind moments of intimacy of passion hester would have pitied her had not so many others paid the price go to the police and confess perjury she said more gently while you still have time make up some story that you were deceived and now you realize the truth you might at least survive you have a choice today anyway live with argyll who may be a bore and a bullyor hang with sixsmith who is far worse she gave a very slight shrug theres no profit in it for me mrs argyll but there is for your children i suppose i care about them and she turned on her heel and walked out she would go back home and have lunch with scuff and perhaps tell him what she had done she would write a letter to rose applegate and tell her too when it was all over as monk and all the others shared a brief lunch with a group of navvies this time having the benefit of far more knowledge they questioned them not about argyll but about sixsmith they were deep underground sitting on stones in the rubble away from the pounding of the engine it was an old tunnel where debris had been dumped rather than carry it all the way to the surface the constant dripping of water filled the air with damp and the smell of sewage the scrabble of rats feet was closer than the clang and thump of the machine the voices around them echoed until it was hard to tell from which direction they came darkness hemmed them in on all sides crowding the frail heart of the lantern light they could have been twenty feet below the surface of the earth or hundreds monk tried to drive the thought from his mind and keep his stomach from knotting rathbone drank some water but was reluctant to eat the coarse bread he did manage to keep the look of distaste out of his expression so miss havilland asked for mr sixsmiths help he said again yeah the navvy agreed he was a big bullchested man with fair hair receding at the front and an agreeable heavily weathered face course e did went out o is way ter give er wot she asked fer did fer er pa too same information rathbone asked i spose the navvy creased his face in thought e elped a lot o them never id nuffink e must a told miss avilland wot she asked im fer cos it were arter she spoke wi im that she came ter know as er pa were murdered or leastways ter think as e were rathbone glanced at monk then looked back at the navvy i think i might begin to understand this mr finger the navvy supplied cos i lost me finger see he held up his left hand the middle finger missing from the knuckle thank you rathbone acknowledged mr finger did mr toby argyll work with mr sixsmith also the navvy grinned showing several gaps among his teeth jus finger yeah course e did mr toby were keen ter learn all e could about the machine an no one knowed as much as mr sixsmith mr toby were down ere alf the time before miss havilland was killed on the river rathbone pressed yeah even the day before as i member monk suddenly understood what rathbone was thinking and perhaps a step beyond it as well finger he said quickly why did mr toby ask sixsmith about the machine rather than asking his brother alan argyll perhaps his brother wouldnt tell him rathbone suggested and looked questioningly at finger nobdy knows em machines like mr sixsmith does finger replied with certainty but mr alan was the one who invented the modifications that made argyll brothers machine better than anyone elses monk pointed out cutting across rathbone e owned it finger said it were mr sixsmith wot thought it up e knew it bettern mr argyll that id swear on me mas grave god rest er ah monk sat back looking across at rathbone so mr sixsmith had the brains but mr argyll took the credit and the money i imagine mr sixsmith was more than a little unhappy about that they thanked finger who told them where to find a navvy who could help them further they had gone only another mile when there was a tremor in the ground so faint as to be almost indiscernible a moment later the rhythm of the machine altered slightly a wave of horror passed over monk bringing the sweat out on his skin then desperate fear rathbone froze can you smell something sutton whispered smell something rathbone said hoarsely the stench of the sewers for heavens sake how could anyone not smell it sutton stood still in the wavering lamplight it was impossible to tell whether his face was paler or not but there was a tension in him that was unmistakable then it came again a louder rumble this time we gotta get out of ere suttons voice was sharp theres more comin down somewhere cmon he started forward snoot was at his feet hackles bristling they crowded behind him lanterns high monk saw the yellow light on the walls was it his imagination that they were bulging as if any moment they would rupture and the water burst through drowning them all he was gasping for breath now his body trembling was he a physical coward after all it was a new and shattering thought was it pain he was afraid of or death the end of opportunity to try again to do better some kind of judgment when it was too late to understand or be sorry or oblivion simply ceasing to exist and then with a sweet hard certainty he knew the answer he was afraid of the ultimate failure of being a coward and that was something he could control it might cost him everything he had but it was still within his power to do it it was within him not beyond he felt his heart steady he was treading on suttons heels and rathbone on his then crow orme and runcorn they moved as quickly as they could heads bent to avoid the low roof feet slipping on rubble the smell seemed stronger monk felt it thick and pungent in his nose it was not just sewage it was gas he strained his ears but heard no more rumbling only the slosh of their feet in deeper water and the increased skittering and squealing of rats as if they too were panicking it made the small hairs stand up on his skin but he knew it was infinitely better than silence if the rats were alive then the air was breathable there was another fear that he would not express but it kept beating in his brain sixsmith was free no one else knew he was guilty except hester and scuff all those who could prove it were here in this wormhole in the earth about to be trapped buriedby sixsmith sutton was still leading the way but the water was flowing against them he bent and picked up snoot it was too deep for the little dog to stand in and he kept having to lift his head up no one remarked on the obvious monk turned to look behind him once and saw their smudged faces eyes reflecting fear rathbone pulled his mouth down at the corners but said nothing keep close monk warned better put your hand on the man in front of you lose touch and well all stop thats an order they pressed on the smell was definitely stronger there was another violent tremor sutton stopped and they looked at each other no one spoke they began walking again and came to a fork sutton took the right turning and no one questioned him ten minutes later the water was shallower and a few moments after that they came to a blank wall where the rock had fallen in it was totally blocked not a break of air came from the other side sorry sutton said gently they each dismissed it and told him not to worry they had barely finished speaking when there was a hollow roar beyond the fall as if a train had gone by and then utter suffocating silence suttons lantern slipped out of his hand and crashed into the water wavering under the thick filthy stream for a moment or two then going out what was that runcorn said hoarsely water no sutton held snoot more tightly what rathbone demanded fire sutton croaked god almighty rathbone leaned against the wall in the yellow glare his face was gray reckon as mr sixsmith knows were on to im orme observed pity we dint get im es a real bad one that hardly begins to describe him crow said bitterly well go back no one answered him none of them wanted to argue the realities they turned and started to retrace their steps until they were at the fork again other way runcorn asked sutton sutton shook his head thats the way o the fire we need ter go back the way we come waters deeper crow pointed out i know sutton started forward without adding anything they went after him each apparently lost in his own thoughts monk tried hard not to let his mind go to hester and scuff it would take from him his anger and the strength it gave him to go on through the icy stinking water up to his knees and the filth that was in it he knocked against the bodies of dead rats ahead of him sutton was still carrying the little dog had he any idea at all where they were or what was ahead of or behind them except rockfalls and fire they turned more corners and passed a weir the water thundered over the drop so violently they could not hear each other even if they shouted sutton waved to the left pointing to another passage thats runcorn cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled but his words were lost orme looked at monk crow shrugged and followed after sutton monk and rathbone had no better knowledge of the tunnels all six of them and snoot crossed over gripping each other through the fast flowing stream only just keeping their balance the tunnel curved around and started to go upwards then just as monk was thinking he could smell fresh air it came to an abrupt end there was water flowing from the left a thin steady spout out of the raw earth already carrying soil with it and growing stronger even as they watched its going to burst through rathbone said his voice high beyond his control well be drowned he swiveled around to look for escape the tunnel behind him sloped downward the way the water would flow monk saw it and understood there was no escape oddly now with disaster so close his fear was under control snoot began to bark writhing to get from suttons grasp e can smell rabbits sutton said quietly we aint got no other way if we break this the streamll come but it isnt big i reckon as we it wot they used to call the lark afore it went under it int very deep well get proper wet and cold but keep goin an well come out and without waiting for approval he attacked the soil with his hands monk looked at rathbone then at the others snoot was already digging just as fiercely as his master monk stepped forward and joined them then so did the others the stream broke through in a rush almost knocking them off their feet sutton fell against runcorn and crow bent to help them back to their feet the lanterns were all shattered and they were plunged into obliterating darkness there was no sense of direction except that of the icy water cmon sutton shouted there was nothing to do for survival except to follow him into the stream they crawled against the water trying to breathe to keep hold of anything to move forward upward clinging gasping cold to the bone monk had no idea how long it went on how many times he thought his lungs would burst then suddenly there was light real daylight and air he fell out after sutton into the shingle bed and stumbled up the sides of the stone culvert he turned immediately to see who was behind him one by one the others dragged themselves out filthy drenched and shuddering with cold he swung around to thank sutton and saw with a wave of boundless relief that he had snoot in his arms is he all right he demanded sutton nodded thought e werent he said shakily but es breathin thank you sir rathbone held out his hand to sutton you have saved our lives now we must go and deal with mr sixsmith i suggest you get your dog warm he fished in his pocket and brought out a gold sovereign be so good as to give him a teaspoon of brandy with my compliments monk felt the emotion well up inside him too intensely for him to speak he met suttons eyes looked again to make sure that snoot was indeed breathing and clasped rathbones arm very briefly then they followed crow who seemed to know which way to go the five of them were perishing with cold and smeared with clay and remnants of sewage when they reached the head of the tunnel again they found finger and almost twenty other navvies near the great machine finger saw monk we got another cavein bad one he said grimly blimey yer look like bloody ell very well observed monk replied too accurate to be accounted abusive language where is sixsmith down there finger pointed at the entrance monk looked at it and a wave of nausea enveloped him he could not go in that again he simply physically could not his legs were shaking his stomach sick it was runcorn who walked forward his face set like stone ill get that bastard up here he said grimly or ill bring the whole bloody lot in on both of us what runcorn monk shouted after him he swore violently he could not let runcorn go in there he had no choice he charged back into the semidarkness a pace behind runcorn still shouting at him fifty yards in the tunnel was still dimly lit from lanterns on the wall a hundred yards and the glow came from ahead of them and runcorn stopped abruptly monk caught up with him fire he said his voice catching i can feel the heat of it wheres sixsmith monk pressed forward again more slowly now he had covered another twenty yards around a curve when he saw the broadchested figure ahead of him it was unmistakably sixsmith from the way he walked he was coming towards them he must have recognized monk at that same moment he stopped and stood with his arms loosely by his sides if he was surprised to see monk was not alone there was nothing in his voice to betray it youd better let me past theres fire behind me and im the only one who can put it out if i dont it could come up into the streets and burn the whole of london did you mean to kill toby argyll monk asked without moving eventually sixsmith replied but mary taking him over with her was a piece of luck i had intended to have him blamed for her death but the way it worked out was better dont waste time monk the firell break through soon that whole tunnel behind me is ablaze theres enough air in here to feed it why did you do it for the argyll company dont be so damn stupid for revenge alan argyll took my invention the money and far more than that he took the praise for it i dont give a damn if this whole thing blows up monk but you do you wont let the city burn so get out of my way i can put it out those fools up there dont know what to do behind monk runcorn was moving monk swung around to see what it was and at that instant runcorn threw the rock it caught sixsmith just as he raised his hand with the gun in it he fell backwards as the shot exploded and the bullet hit the rocks run runcorn yelled grabbing monk by the waist and almost pulling him off his feet side by side they hurtled towards the entrance again feet flying shoulders banging into the walls monk fell once runcorn stopped and hauled him to his feet almost yanking his arm out of its socket nearly tearing his wound open but they reached the entrance just as finger fired the great lifting machine into life under ormes orders the earth began to shudder and stones were dislodged boulders quaked and the whole machine slid forward the giant stakes that held it were gone and it slithered and pounded belching steam finger jumped down and ran away from it as it lurched forward the boulders crashed over and down then gradually the entire wall and all its retaining boards and planks buckled and slid crossbeams exploded like matchsticks with a great eruption the earth collapsed with a roar and crashed over the entrance burying it as if it had never existed pebbles rattled and dropped steam exploded from somewhere in a white column then there was silence monk wiped his hand across his face and found he was shaking better sixsmith be buried rathbone said his voice with only a shred of its old humor im not sure i could have convicted him anyway he smiled ruefully dont bring me another case for a while monk youve ruined my clothes they stood in a row five of themfilthy freezing and strangely victorious thank you gentlemen monk said each and every one of you he had never meant anything more in his life about the author anne perry is the author of two acclaimed series set in victorian england her william monk novels include death of a stranger and the shifting tide among her novels featuring charlotte and thomas pitt are the new york times bestselling southampton row and long spoon lane with no graves as yet also a new york times bestseller perry began a new miniseries set during world war i her short story heroes won an edgar award anne perry lives in the scottish highlands visit her website at wwwanneperrynet in her bio not a book you understand but part of the package sent to wandering journalists thatd be me in advance of an interview anne perry writes i was born in london england in a few months before the war and spent the first years of my life there although i was evacuated a couple of times for short periods my schooling was very interrupted both by frequent moves and by illhealth but i do not feel as if i have been deprived because of it because much of my education was acquired haphazardly there are some rather large gaps in it and some odd additions i missed most of my schooling from thirteen to eighteen then took university entrance examinations and passed in english latin history and geography in anne perrys case acquiring an education haphazardly is a rather delicate euphemism for incarceration perry was well on her way to becoming an internationally known mystery writer when her secret came out as a teenager in new zealand perry and her best friend were tried and convicted for killing the other girls mother no doubt it was much to perrys embarrassment that details of the story came to light nor could she have been particularly enthusiastic about the film heavenly creatures that was made about the story in that regard i only know what ive read understandably its not something that perry likes to discuss in person anne perry is much as expected its not even difficult to imagine the girl kate winslet portrayed in the film growing to be this cultured and mature woman she is tall slender perfectly coifed and turned out when i meet her she is elegant and her bearing is regal we meet in a busy bistro and there is noise all around the clink of glasses the midrange hum of a successful eatery somewhere at a distant table a child cries intermittently perry pays attention to none of it she meets my gaze with her own clear blue one sits serenely and answers quietly readers of perrys monk mysteries might even feel they recognize one of the writers own characters in the level intelligent gaze in many ways perry reminds me of her creation hester latterly both women possess the same maturity of style and stance the same natural elegance and perhaps even a bit of the same background perry has not been an overnight sensation still relatively unknown in her native united kingdom perrys north american audience has been growing in modulated spurts since the publication of her first book the cater street hangman in the last few years however that has been changing as well while a steadily increasing number of readers are tuning into her two series of wellhoned victorian mysteries and while perry will be the first to admit she didnt invent the genre shes certainly done much to increase its popularity perry is committed to publishing two books per year a pitt novel in the spring and a monk novel in the fall and while a pace like that might leave other writers breathless perry feels she works consistently but not at breakneck speed with time enough in fact to occasionally focus on other projects two of these projects have been of special interest to perry of late a film version of the cater street hangman has been completed and will be aired in the united states on a e in middecember and for something completely different a fantasy novel called tathea will be published in february linda richards how do you manage to write so many books anne perry i work reasonably hard though probably not harder than many people i work probably eight or nine hours a day six days a week two books a year is what youre doing yes plus a few short stories im not planning to slow up i normally do two a year ive done two a year since your first book was published in yes right at the beginning of that was the cater street hangman that was the first one in the pitt series first mystery i ever wrote first victorian one and the first one to get published and youre living in scotland now yes between and miles north of inverness in the highlands with one dog and five cats of your books whats your favorite whatever im doing at the moment because it might just work out exactly right my heart is always in whatever im doing at the time you used to live in the us i lived near san francisco for about six months and in the los angeles area for four and a half years in the late s i understand you moved around a lot as a child i think that spawns writers in a way yes i guess you make your own world and also illness has that effect as well and i had a lot of childhood illness not since then thank goodness but it does because you have to live within your mind because theres not much you can do outside it your latest william monk novel doesnt offer the clues to monks past that readers have come to look forward to is there a pattern or plan in your mind about revealing more of the mysteries from that investigators history yes there is but my editor said to me dont do it every time it gets a bit you know and i thought she was right its agreeable or i wouldnt have done it but just to leave it for a while but ive got something planned where were going to discover a great deal more about his mentor and hes going to be forced to discover things hed much rather not know about both his mentor and himself and its really going to put it on the line are you working on something right now yes of course i am i put the pen down to come here i am a third of the way through the pitt for the spring of and they have the pitt for next spring which will be called bedford square and they have the monk for next autumn which will be called the twisted root you like writing dont you yes i do how did you guess theres passion in your eyes when you talk about it i think its a terrible thing to write and not enjoy it its a sad thing but of course a lot of people do work because they need to eat and we all need to eat but thats not the only reason to work you couldnt have paid me not to write if you said youd give me x thousand or a hundred thousand dollars or a million dollars a year not to write i would tell you to keep your money because what am i going to do youve got to do it i think its the same for people who act or sing or play music or dance whatever how old were you when your first novel was published i was approximately well i guess i was when it was accepted i was when it was published or in a breach of promise you spend a lot of time with oliver rathbone and not as much with monk or hester latterly i like rathbone and i thought the structure of the story called for rathbone to be investigating at that point rather than monk youd have had to distort the story to have monk investigating at that point somebody whos going to be served with breach of promise goes to a lawyer not a private investigator it wouldnt have made sense to have him go to monk so you use them as you need them exactly yes that was the story do you have a large american readership yes thats where it is the readership is american i didnt realize that well if i tell you that the cater street hangman came out in america in and has never been out of print and they brought it out this year in britain in september that should give you some idea and they can do that with your books because theyre quite timeless oh i hope so if its taken that long in my own country i mean ive got a few out but im not a big name at all not at all but what made me think of that were your comments about rathbone i mean thats british stuff in relation to money and breeding in relation to money not necessarily breeding because you cant buy class americans sometimes say to me that they have no class system themselves all human beings have class systems it can be based on a different thing in a different country but the thing about breeding is you cant buy it if you have to say it you havent got it its a kind of an inner confidence and you dont have to say it and its curious but those people who really have breeding can be very quiet and very selfeffacing but they have that total confidence they dont believe in themselves they know so americans dont have a problem then with making the leap to understanding that but then youre writing about history and you write about it well you write about it with authenticity well thank you i try besides on the east coast they also have exactly the same class system its the same thing it seems to me that youre at an interesting point in your career popularitywise your following has really grown in the last few years do you get a sense of that yes according to the figures it goes up a little bit each year its been absolutely steady theres no just gently all the time but its also gone up quite remarkably in france and in spain does nicely in italy in portuguese and japanese and theyre on audio tape and the cater street hangman has just been filmed for television and it will be shown by a e in early december its a pilot and i dont know whether theyre going to do any more or not were swinging in the breeze waiting to find out filmed in north america or in the uk in the uk done by yorkshire television now watch when i name drop i do it well its actually prince edwards company thats done it and he does actually work at it he was there on set he actually is a very nice chap and he has a nice sense of humor too he was on the des oconnor show which is a sort of chat show just before the program aired in the uk and he really was funny he had them rolling around and its all spontaneous none of it was thought up before whats the title of the show its called the inspector pitt mysteries did you see it what do you think laughing did you like it yes i liked it very much i was very lucky i waited quite a while and worked with people i believed would not have much of a chance of getting it done but if they did would make a really good job of it and they did get the chance to get it done and i think they made a superb job of it its very very true to my characters the stories altered a little bit condensed of course because its a different medium but the characters are exactly as i wrote them and quite a lot of the dialog is straight from the book but the casting director picked them right out of my mind im very very fortunate tell me what your genre is well if youve got to stick it in a genre mystery is so wide you can put it in a mystery novel historical mystery novel but i dont think i invented them i think sir arthur conan doyle got there a day or two before me i dont like putting things into descriptions but i suppose you have to theres also always something mysterious going on in your novels theres always a crime and it always gets solved i think of the end and then i think well how did this happen and then you write it that way you start at the end and then go back and write and go that way not everyone does but i do some people just sit down at the page and start off i start from what happened including the why and i dont like he was mad as an answer unless hes been driven mad by something we can understand and ive had one or two of those its something that we can understand that put him in that position youre a very strong writer i think anything you wrote would be interesting thank you ill take your tape and play it back to myself when im feeling low do you think theres a chance you might write outside of this genre yes ive got a fantasy coming out in britain on the th of february it doesnt exactly fit in that genre theres just no better way to describe it an allegory a spiritual journey in story form whats it called tathea its the character if it will come out in north america i dont know i havent got an answer from the publisher yet its not my usual publisher its a church publisher im mormon and its with the publishers there ive got a verbal yes we like it but you dont know until youre there when ive got someones name on the contract then ill know where i am so is it fantasy like anne mccaffrey kind of fantasy no not at all like that it doesnt really fit into anybodys sort of category no dragons no magic no wizards no sorcery its a spiritual journey back to the original question who am i its the basic question that some of us ask at some time or another was it fun to write if i tell you i had a wonderful christmas everybody i employ was away for a whole fortnight and i worked over odd pages and did a complete rewrite and i wrote every day except sunday even christmas day i wrote for a while it was one of the best christmases ive had fun it was not it was totally satisfying and absorbing and i was very happy joyous yes thats a better word i was totally absorbed in it and i was happy to work every day from the time i woke until the time i went to sleep i got right through the whole thing in two weeks i did a complete rewrite of pages in two weeks is writing fun for you oh yes it is i love it you couldnt pay me not to write so you enjoy the process as much as anything yes almost everything about it is enjoyable for me about the only thing i dont like is when the editor calls you from two books back and youve forgotten what its about and she says on page about half way down did you mean this or did you mean that and you cant remember the story and youve got to scratch through the manuscript and try and apply yourself and think well what did i mean i dont think anybody likes line corrections you write th century london so well would you like to have lived there and then no do you know anything about the medicine then the plumbing the dentistry the clothes the central heating and lack thereof the dreadful restrictions on women but just the medicine itself would be enough to put me off permanently you do write it so compellingly i was reading a bit in breach of promise dealing with gabriels description of his war experience in india and its so real you have to have done a lot of research to have captured the feeling so accurately i read quite a few diaries of the period it was pretty appalling the detail was so fine readers could get the feeling that you dreamed yourself there oh absolutely i am there and you get to come back exactly i get to do it in the comfort of my own home with a flush bathroom and a hot bath when i want one and if i need to go to the dentist i can have a nice shot to deaden the pain and if i get a problem i can go to the doctor and get sorted relatively painlessly relative to that anyway november linda l richards is the editor of january magazine her fourth novel death was the other woman will be published early in by st martins minotaur
