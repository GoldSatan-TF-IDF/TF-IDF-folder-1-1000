seneca prologue visa rantis saevae defectu laboribus undae quam theridi longinqua dies glaucoque repostum solibus et canis urebat luna pruinis she beheld a ship outworn with the toils of the savage sea long since offered up to thetis and glaucus which passing time had scorched with its suns and the moon with her hoarfrosts had worn argonautica book ii valerius flaccus there was a thunder pon the sea crash and bellow a deep continual tympanydrumming which went on and on til the waters on this slightly foggy coolish day shivered as if in terror and the winds already nothing to boast of from out of southofwest were shot nigh to stillness winds failing and the long atlantic rollers beguilingly rippled and fractured like an ocean of shattered glass fragments but it wasnt the wind that did itit was that thunder they could feel it a gunthunder which had quailed the winds and waters rumbling upwards from the sea itself as if some drowned volcano had cleared its throat numberless fathoms below and their ship shook to that thunder vibrated and trembled humming in enforced harmony a game lass was their little ship a plunger and a goer most of the time but she was now worn just about out from too much daring and panache too many hasty but vital errands and patrols and nothing like a proper refit despite rare portcalls at gibraltar lisbon or at oporto coming apart at the seams she was those seams weeping weary salt tears which had her hands at the bilge pumps every morning before breakfast her oaken flesh and bones baked sere and dry as old toastand not enough paint tar or oils left for even a lick and a promise either her bottom was foul and she trailed a verdant jungle of vinelike weed and green slime from her quickworkslowing her so that she now lumbered like a dowager with the gout instead of dancing upon the winds like the lightfooted darling she once had been yet her standing and running rigging her towering masts still stood in a lean bristol fashion her spars and yards were yet sound and her sailsthough much patchedstill curved sweetly windfull though her captain had considered frapping her roundabout with lighter kedge or streamanchor cables like a truss or corset to remind her how to hold together for just a bit longer but slowed as she was as frailing her crew could load and fire three broadsides in less than two minutes could still cajole her to dance at the peak of their expertise gained in three years continuous service together so she stood near the end of the battleline as it sailed on sutherly with the lead ships just starting to tack about norwest to double back on the two converging packs of foes they faceda repeating frigate to pass messages or aid a ship which might be disabled hms jestersloop of war still served though again to her captains mind and a rather chary mind it was at that moment thankee being on the leeside didnt particularly mean the safe side of the battleline off jesters lee bow down to the soueast there were about eight or nine spanish ships of the line with accompanying frigates and coming up slowly to merge with another pack and that pack good god seventeen at the least tallsided ugly brutes they were twodecker s s and gunners some of them threedeckers and one monstrous fourdecker flying more admirals flags than sailcanvas it seemed and so stuffed with guns that every time she lit off a broadside it looked like a mountain blowing up and here they were curling about into a rough vee sandwiched like a forlorn nut between two arms of a nutcracker fifteen warships of admiral sir john jerviss fleetformerly the mediterranean fleet before theyd been run out of that sea the previous summerall just about as bad off as jester in material condition when you got right down to it yet blithely standing into danger as though they were about as fresh as newpicked daisies or as belligerent as a rutting bulldog with their artillery crashing and bellowing making that thunder sending shock waves through the sea i can make out sir lieutenant ralph knolles attempted to say as he took off his hat and swiped both forearms of his coat at his hair and brows a bad sign that usually one nervous hand over his blond locks was sufficient sign of worry aye mister knolles commander alan lewrie replied sounding almost calm in comparison beyond sir knolles pointed towards the spanish fleet it may not be a convoy about eight or nine more rather large ships over yonder to the westnorwest do they all assemble sir well twodeckers dye think sir lewrie frowned stepping to the starboard side of his quarterdeck leaning on the bulwarks and raising his telescope for a looksee the smoke from all the gunfire was thick a sulphurous reeking mist which hazed the day even worse more than a few british lineofbattle ships stood between him and the ones knolles had sighted too their gunsmoke and towering masts and sails obscuring what little he could see but he could barely make out threemasters yonder well up to weather and almost hulldown from the spanish line least an hour or more off he thought sailin large to come down to join he couldnt tell as if we need more he sneered to himself already got a bloody armada here anyway on its way north to join the french fleet waitin at brest the dutch fleet too transports mostlike carrying troops for an invasion of ireland or england and if admiral jervis threw away his ships in this action then what hope did lord bridport and the channel fleet at portsmouth have to stop them or even get word of their coming in time to takin this lot ons like a horsefly deliberately landin on a gametable sure tget swatted lewrie speculated has tbe done no error growl ye may but go ye must and all that cahrrisstt was lewries sudden uncaptainly comment and a rather loud comment it was too in his telescopes ocular hed just discovered the foreend of a ship of the line which wasnt crossing righttoleft sailing obediently in the battleline he was looking at the beakhead and figurehead the cutwater and frothing bowwave below an outthrust bowsprit and jibboom of a warshippointing right at him hands wear ship lewrie yelped eyes wide in disbelief as he lowered his glass in shock helm hard aweather seen with normal vision unenlarged wasnt much better as she bored direct for his jester hms captain third but last from the tail end of the line was swinging out of line alee and loomed close enough to trample them if jester didnt get out of her way the captain mr midshipman hyde gawped commodore nelson mr midshipman spendlove supplied that bugger lewrie opined as his crew sprang to loosen braces and headsl sheets he heard lieutenant knolles and bosun cony barking urgent orders felt the deck shift under his feet as his ship heeled to wear about falling off the wind spared a second to observe that things were well in hand then spared a longer glower at nelson and his twodecker no one left the sacred order of the line of battle no one not ever the fighting instructions were nigh to gospel and god pity the fool who disobeyed them to turn away leeward away from presenting a broadside to those spanish warships that could be called cowardice in the face of the enemya hanging offence bugger commander lewrie snarled again not only was nelson swinging clear of danger he was forcing him to swing clear too jester had been a cable to leeward of the line when hms captain began her turn a fairly wide one to retain her speed being a smaller ship with smaller sails than a liner she could cut a smaller radius of turn so they ended up close together once both ships had worn about to larboard tack with the scant winds crossing their lefthand sides for captain was standing on almost easterly to build back up to speed they were within shouting distance lewrie stood by the larboard bulwarks hands fisted and akimbo on his hips wondering just how much of what he had to say to a man who had just quit the line he could get away with damn im hes still a commodore lewrie fumed to himself hoy jester came a highpitched slightly nasal shout from a runtish little dandy by captains starboard rails the dandys hands were cupped round his mouth follow me into clear air for signals hoy sir lewrie replied deliberately delaying his sir and what what the bloody hell you think yer playin at was lewries real question he amended it though regretting the necessity where are you going sir he bellowed instead no time to explain nelson hallooed back sounding infinitely pleased with himself damn near laughing with joy in point o fact before they join both bodies astern of us in the noreast follow me jester were off to glorrryyy cackhanded brainless bloody cavalry charge pipsqueak lewrie grumbled in a harsh mutter his face stretched into a toadying rictus of a smile death or glory mine arse mine arse on a bloody bandbox then the captain with her longer waterline and taller wider sails aloft was surging past beginning to turn even more westward as wind filled her rigging and her greater speed returned do we follow him sir lieutenant knolles wondered still aghast christ i dont christ hes captain was now aiming to pass between the last two ships of the line diadem and excellent to shorten the distance shed have to sail to engage the entire spanish fleet hes gone lunatick lewrie breathed in awe but hes right damn im lewrie had to admit to himself do we hope collingwoods on a run o luck today and doesnt collide have a prayer sailing master mr buchanon moaned crossing his thick fingers for luck as captain collingwoods excellent seemed to shy dithering whether to shorten sail back the topsls to brake or haul her wind and leave the line too aye well follow mister knolles lewrie sighed well alee of excellent mind somebody has to do signals old jarvy to nelson or vice versa clap him in irons this gaps too narrow and closing theyll merge if we dont get past us without a real fight haul taut to windward mister knolles course nornorwest aye sir and mister buchanon do you keep those fingers crossed oh aye capum buchanon rather soberly assured him now til epiphany if ats what it takes god help us were in for th most confounded scrape lewrie shared a quick quirky and sardonic smile with his stolid sailing master then turned away to look outward once more the small batch of spanish ships to leeward were almost level with them now and level with the tail end of the british line which was still labouriously wheeling about one after the other at a point which seemed to lewries fevered imagination to be too damn far south to be of any comfort to the west captain troubridges culloden at the head of that wheeling line was almost level with the rear of the spanish main body again too far to windward to be of much immediate use to them apart from the fleet and its palls of gunfire they were in clearer air in undisturbed unroiled winds which cupped the sails taut and full the two lone ships whod disobeyed now going like cambridge coaches aft was excellent dithering again he wondered coming off the wind to wear he hoped most fervently was diadem too forrudover jesters larboard bows there lay the spaniards at which they charged like naive houseterriers at an enraged bull on their first day of a country weekend a very menacing and formidable pack of dons they looked too though not in any particular order he also noted though it must be said that at that moment lewrie would have grasped at any straw of encouragement no matter how frail they were bunched more like three ragged lines overlapping each other and not a wellordered inlineahead earlier jerviss line had shifted from two cruising lines into one battleline crossing the dons bows while theyd come to do battle in three or four columns as if to bore through in several places at once but theyd been shot out of that planif plan it had been they could only fire the guns of those which were nearest lewrie grimly decidedonly the first six or so that unfortunately seemed to be more than enough to swat captain away for it included that fourdecker which that moment erupted again in a ragged broadside he could almost count he quit when his tally rose over odd guns along her starboard beamtimes two equaled a sum too terrible to contemplate he felt like a headache was coming on yet like a citybred terrier too stupid of the consequences of tackling a huge farm animal captain opened fire as she neared the middle of that nearest lineofbattle delivering a welltimed broadside from her pounders and pounders that pummeled her target like an alpine avalanche of boulders fresh gunfire came this from culloden as she cruised up close to the tail of that nearest rank of spanish ships sails were flying loose puckering to roundshot tgallant and royal masts and yards at odd angles as they fell and tangled along the topsls and the fightingtop platforms and timbers and bulwarks screamed mansized slivers of oak blown high as their maincourse yards from that hopeless pummeling sir deck there the mainmast lookout shouted down they be turnin dye hear there head o th lines turnin north a fresh broadside from hms captain as she stood on as if shed pierce through between enemy ships to get at the second line if thats what it took hazing and becoming slightly indistinct as she sailed into the sour battlefog of spent powder one poor lone rd rate sure to be blown to flinders the very next instant but she had daunted her foes and made them turn away that gap would not close anytime soon there was still time for old jarvy to complete his tack about to the north bringing more ships into actionin perfect order lewrie was pretty certain the dons had hauled off to sort themselves out into one long battleline but from where he stood that instant it looked like the spanish had no stomach for a real fightand were flinching from the fleabites of a single ship daft little bugger lewrie whispered in appreciation theres method to his madness aye still mad as a hatter though its knolles gulped as if witnessing the second coming a cheer for captain lads lewrie bade in a quarterdeck roar a cheer for commodore nelson hes showing us the way his crew obeyed gladly sure they were witness to one of those rare miracles whooping and tossing their hats into the air and overside no matter the cost of replacements that their purser mr giles would dun them for once soberer heads prevailed lewrie looked astern again for aid several other vessels had taken nelsons cue for here came blenheim of guns prince george of with ocean and irresistible in their wakes to reenforce the insanity still out of gunrange far astern of culloden but spreading more sail letting fall their powerful courses which were usually brailed up during battle to prevent accidental fires from the discharges from their own guns and hms victoryold jarvys flagshipwas in the process of wheeling about tacking ponderously slow but sure exposing her tall bluff sides would those powerful ships arrive soon enough though lewrie fretted turning back to look at captain lewrie could see her snuggling up close to a large spanish twodecker guns ablaze and ripping pieces off her with every shot taking fire too taking damage but shrugging it off the spanish ships werent firing quickly none of themnothing like three broadsides in less than two minutes poor practice their gunnery lewrie commented slow sir damn slow aye knolles agreed two or three minutes tween broadsides not mister crewe lewrie bellowed for his master gunner sir that worthy barked back from the waist a broadside mister crewe know its too far for a hope of hitting anything but the dons yonder need a little more discouraging sir uhm knolles blanched it was the accepted gentlemanly practice for repeating frigates or auxiliaries near the battleline to keep mum their gunports closed and they wouldnt be fired upon by the more powerful liners in return to open their ports though run out and fire upon larger ships allowed them to be reconsidered as fair game and an gun sloop of war with pounder popguns had no business even placing herself near stray shot much less inviting quick destruction bloody insane aint it mister knolles lewrie said with his mouth screwed up and an eyebrow raised but there seem to be bags of insanity about today long as we dont take ourselves too serious sir lieutenant knolles shrugged feeling fatalistic his captain was wearing his bemused look that wolfish oh what the merry hell smirk and his eyes eyes that knolles had come to be able to read they were blue or they were grey by mood or temper had they steeled themselves flinty coldgrey he would have been trembling in his boots for when commander lewrie was out for blood and there was hell to pay thankfully this time he saw that they remained placidly rakehellishly blue well not go plungin into range of those monsters like were a st rate no mister knolles lewrie assured him with a chuckle and a wink but we will make them look astern and see blood and thunder comin down on em ready sir crewe reported blaze away then mister crewe blaze away it was impossible really nearly a mileandahalf separated jester from the nearest spaniard and had her guns been able to shoot that far with the elevating quoin blocks all the way out and the gun breeches resting on the truckcarriages pounder roundshot could do no more than doink against thick oak sides and bounce off but out ripped their puny broadside a bowtostern rippling of sound and fury higher pitched and lapdog sharp compared to the greatguns of captain or culloden but those puny iron balls would sing through the air whistle and moan and they would raise splashes where they struckmight even skip a time or two like a wellflung river pebble theyd get someones attention or divert it short mr knolles noted seeing the troutsplashes well of course lewrie snickered bloody hell several gunners crowed from the waist standing to peer over the bulwarks and gangway through the open ports to spot the fallofshot cowards cowards someone began to singsong nothin tdo with us lewrie thought goggling as he saw the line of spanish ships begin to peel apart we couldntve the head of that line their van group was arranging itself in proper lineahead at last but hardening up to the wind to spare those astern from collisionsand inclining more to the ffwrnorwest the further column which had their guns masked by the nearest were stretching out into line as well the ones nearest jester back and filling whilst those further north were making more sail making room for those astern and bending away leaving the smaller pack near captain including that massive fourdeck flagship by themselves a bit to leeward mister hyde hoist a signal lewrie snapped any onell do as if nelson sent one dons cant read it but mister crewe serve em another helmsmen do you ease a spoker two aweather let her fall off the wind a bit and open the range he told himself so we dont sail right into that mess get too closeand get squashed like a cockroach ready sir on the uproll lads steady fire their slight turn away swung their broadside to point in the general direction of that monstrous fourdecker mileandahalf it was for their poundersrangetorandomshot and this time that uselessasdriedpeas broadside struck the sea within half a cable of her waterlineflying tortoiseslow by then lewrie suspectedthe iron roundshot crippleskipping even closer a time or two she fired back such a stupendous sudden explosion from all her decks of guns that sailors whooped with delight for an ignorant second or two that theyd somehow struck a weak spot and blown her skyhigh uhm errr mr knolles said again stoic but corpsepale oh shit was lewries prime thought moans and roars sounds of tearing silk irate witches screams and heavy surf crashes that went on and on rustling overhead beyond the bow and stern great pillars and feathers of spray leaped skyward and the oceans boiled and frothed with more surf noises as if jester had conjured up a tropical reef at the entrance to a lagoon hundreds of yards to windward though nowhere near her and once the shock had worn off as chagrined gunners and gangway bracetenders got back to their feet after flinging themselves down instinctively jester s crew began to jeer their hapless foes uhm helmsman two more points off the windd suit lewrie shakily ordered marvelling that he hadnt pissed his breeches aye aye sir the senior quartermaster agreed enthusiastic well lewrie crowed clapping his hands and trying to justify his arrant stupidity that should draw their teeth for four or five minutes at any rate a good broadside wasted and them slow as treacle at reloadin spare captain her attention too mister crewe do you secure the larboard battery for now reload and stand easy aye aye sir five minutes more well have some other ships up to us lewrie went on pacing aft to peer at the reinforcements which were positively bounding over the sea by then mister hyde what signal flags are we flying he asked craning his neck to look aloft up the mizzenmast you said anythingd do sir so i grabbed the first four near to hand sir hyde smirked accident really but its it uhm means start excess water sir lewrie looked aloft once more hands on his hips shaking his head in wonder and began to bray with laughter take it down mister hyde take it down fore the others think were passing the word from nelson to pump out and lighten ship run up more as if we were speakin the flagship meaningless strings of rubbish mind no real legible orders to anyone serve em gibberish to keep our dons on the hop good god start excess water hah aye sir hyde chuckled well we wont be trying that on again anytime soon lewrie told knolles once hed paced back to the nettings overlooking the waist at the forrud end of the quarterdeck discretion above valour is our watchword how is captain faring her fore topmasts shot away sir but it appears shes gunneltogunnel with one of theirs and boarding her knolles relished to relate a real neckornothing day sir and by five in the afternoon it was over the spanish never managed to unite and the smaller body of ships which had lain to leeward had turned about and sailed off to the south out of sight the bulk of the main body had limped away towards cadiz with the british squadron too cut up to pursue but it was a day of victory for the spanish had left behind four ships san ysidro a rd rate of guns san nicolas a rd rate which nelson had first engaged and boarded the san jose and salvador del mundo both nd rates of guns all defeated by slipshod sail handling and collisions by horrendous casualties and extremely poor and slow gunnery for a time the flagship of viceadmiral don jose de corduba that fourdeck monster the santissima trinidad had struck her colours too after being totally dismasted forcing the spanish admiral to transfer to a frigate a lastchance rally round pm though had driven the british off so the spaniards could tow their flagship away the largest warship in the world of guns the only fourdecker anyone would ever build and shed almost been taken as prizeby the ferocity of nelson and his gunned hms captain there there bad noises done no more gun stinks lewrie told his cat toulon as he carried him in his arms cosseting and stroking him the blackandwhite ramcat had spent the day far below decks on the orlop with aspinall and the ships carpenter mr reese bottled up and moaning as gunthunder echoed and thrummed round him now he was famished for attention and pets mewing plaintively pawing kneading biscuits for comfort mmmahwhahhj he entreated muzzle under his masters chin big timorous baby yes i know signal sir midshipman spendlove announced our number from the flag followed by what sort of lunatic are you i shouldnt wonder lewrie told himself with a rueful shrug its captain repair on board sir spendlove concluded very well lewrie replied turning to call out to his first officer mister knolles take us down to victory and lay us under her lee mister cony ready my gig and boat crew best turnout coxn andrews aye sah best rig his jamaican coxswain answered well be ready sah as honsome as sunday divisions handsome they were half an hour later when they rowed him over to the flagship tricked out in clean check shirts sloptrousers and brassbuttoned short blue shell jackets ably competent too hooking onto the starboard mainchains at the first try oars tossed upright as one as lewrie made the long ascent up boarding battens and manropes to the upper deck a freshscrubbed sideparty greeted him with twittering bosuns pipes the slap of stout shoes on oak planking horny hands on brown bess muskets and a glittery whirl of swords presented in salute winking in the wan winter sunset this way commander lewrie if you please an officer bade up to the broad quarterdeck where a group of senior officers stood hats off and chortling like theyd just left a good comedy back home in drury lane and were waiting for their coaches to take them to some even more diverting entertainment captain robert calder and captain grey fleet captain and the flag captain of hms victory rearadmiral parker off prince george viceadmiral the honourable william waldegrave off barfleuradmiral hoods old flagship during the revolutionviceadmiral charles thompson off britannia and lewries recent squadron commander during commodore horatio nelson cheekbyjowl with the gruffly gracious admiral sir john jervis kb a dour old tar who theres a wonder alan goggled seemed almost congenial for a change twas a wonder what a victory would do sir john gentlemen the lieutenant announced commander lewrie of the jester sloop lewrie ah old jarvy grumped doffing his large cocked hat as lewrie did his his head tilted back a bit to peer rather dubiously did alan imagine down his finesculpted nose heard some about you sir deed i have he pronounced most disconcertingly that dont sound promisin lewrie quailed not knowing how he might respond just how much has he heard and which bits your servant sir john he cooed instead making a leg well old jarvy barked still holding his hat high over his head though lewrie had lowered his to his side did you start your water and was that before or after the santissima trinidad fired oh lewrie brightened instantly much relieved to hear the chuckle which rose from sir john see the puckish grin on his phyz to receive much the same sort of cheery approbation from the rest all those senior and august commanders im certain moren a few of our people did sir john immediately after for myself twas a close run thing i didnt anticipate such a response certainly not her full attention a fellow who yanks the lions tail sir admiral jervis said with a touch of highnosed frost simply must expect a clawing he twinkled snortedactually making a jape almost but not quite as full of jollity as an affable compatriot and nothing like the flinty humourless disciplinarian he was reputed to be who could give anyone a case of the runs by simply glaring at him admiral jervis clapped his hat back on stepping closer to take lewries hand and pump away at it quite vigourously for a brief time as the rest tittered polite appreciation for their commanders jest ill caution you commander lewrie about making a career of tomfoolery sir john added pursing his features nigh to an actual admonishment but twas a splendid gesture nonetheless you captain troubridge in culloden commodore nelson was it disobedience of my signalled orders he posed detaching his hand from lewries christ am i for it after all lewrie shivered again distressingly now his hand was free again admiral jervis doffed his hat high aloft once more making alan twitch in indecision then it was a most forgivable disobedience hmmm thankee sir john lewrie muttered dumbstruck that hat your casualties sir your damage admiral jervis asked more softly coming closer and glooming up in grim expectation why none sir lewrie declared no damage either they couldnt shoot worth a they were very poor at longrange firing closein though one of the senior officers sighed but still slow as churchwork little nelson chortled with glee else wed never have been able to stand within pistolshot for as long as we did sirs yank the lions tail indeed sir john got santissima trinidad to waste a months worth of shot and powder on his ship stead of mine my thanks commander lewrie when he was of my squadron at genoa sirs i found none more expeditious and slyboots than commander lewrie when it came to befuddling our foes no casualties and no damage sir john mused heavily i do declare good though good tis been a bloodyenough day well for the dons much worse sir nelson prattled on i must think they suffered ten times worse than us youve been aboard the prizeships seen aye sir john grunted clapping one hand behind his back to pace himself back to his usual taciturn grumpiness so you may sail off towards cadiz and smoak the dispositions of their remaining warships sir he directed this to lewrie aye sir john lewrie said automatically though we are a tad worn down sir i was hoping to careen her recopper her bottom a short spell in port before should i doff my hat to him too youve been in commission since captain calder three years this month sir john calder supplied off the top of his head we shall make other arrangements then sir john said almost mournfully but instantly there was a twinkle in his eyes lewrie today is valentines day i shall make you a present remain under my lee til i send you written orders aye aye sir and well done lewrie damn foolhardy but well done there was a lot of that going round today sir i think it must be catching alan allowed himself to jape called the san nicolas my patent bridge for boarding first rates ha ha nelson could be heard to titter in his high voice up and over without a pause board the san jose dye see lewrie cocked a chary brow at that statement nelson was never a shy man when it came to taking acclaimhed seen that preening side to him before and he mostcynically suspected no one had called it that yet nelson had made it up himself for his vaulting vanity damn fool lewrie sighed never knew when to stop troweling it on servants were sporting trays of drinks round and lewrie snagged himself one and took a welcome sip of a very good claret old jarvys best he imagined saved for a rare occasion such as this by the by commander lewrie captain calder purred stepping over to him just before this little setto we received some mails for the fleet i do believe should you speak to our first officer he has yours ready to hand mail sir lewrie enthused it had been weeks since hed had news from home i cant think of a single thing more to make this day any more perfect uhmm is that some cat hair on your coat sir nearly nine oclock of the evening watch and almost time that all glims and lanthorns were doused for fear of fire in the night hours even a captain had to heed the master at arms there was still time though to race through just one more letter from his wife caroline back home in anglesgreen then give them all a slower more loving perusal the next morning he swiveled and craned under the swaying overhead lanthorn for the most light at his desk idly stroking a sleeping toulon atop the attractively crinkly discard pile of other mail from chandlers tailors bankers and such tucked up all sphinxlike has purchased three hundred acres of land talked of running up a manse just by the old ruined tower where long ago we pledged our mutual love lewrie flipped back a page or two looking for a clue was this some new botheration from harry embleton or his father the baronet that was chiswick land just by his own rented acres land he stood a chance to inherit his brotherinlaw governour for certain once old uncle phineas chiswick went toes up and pray god soon phineas would never sell a threehundredacre tract off whilst living and would likely find a way to tuck it in his coffin and hoist it off to perdition with him just for spite in fact hed rather die than give away a single blade of grass to a passing drovers goat ah to england and has been making the most perfect hooraw in the village since and he now lodges on us until he discovers suitable quarters which as i am certain you understand dearest has caused no end of upset must be further back lewrie puzzled if her brother burgess had returned from service with the east india company army caroline would be over the moon with joy would never express reservations even if he came back sick lame or bankrupt more like he could lodge with phineas and his mother in that drab pile with governour and millicent at their new house now where the deuce lewrie grumbled halfaloud sorting out the fronts and backs of the hefty letter there came the crisp clang of two bells up forrud the stamp of boots and a musket butt from the marine sentry at his main deck door almost at the same instant master at arms sah reports darkened ship sah christ on a crutch lewrie yelped sah very well carry on then jesus lewrie barked back the proper respect and deference due your sire and most of all dearest that tender consideration i feel bound to show brigadier sir hugo as my fatherinlaw though until his unlookedfor arrival we had never met my bloody father lewrie muttered aye dark alright dark and gettin darker i pray you though alan should you have any suggestions as to how to finesse this matter i beg you write at once and tell me what shall i do with your father load those pistols i left in my study was lewries first thought send to the blacksmiths for a gross of chastity belts was his second thenbest yetrun book one non equidem invideo mirror magis undique totis usque adeo tubatur agris well i grudge you notrather i marvel such unrest is there on all sides in the land the eclogues i virgil chapter one it should have been a glad day yet to lewrie it seemed to be one of infinite sadness though the harbour waters were sparkling and glittering the skies were freshwashed blue stippled with benign and pristine brushstroked clouds the sun was bright and the day was just warm enough to be mild yet not hot enough to be oppressive and gulls and other seabirds swooped and dove and hovered with springtime delight it was his last day the morning he surrendered command of hms jester admiral sir john jerviss valentines day present following the battle of cape saint vincent was a quick dash into lisbon for two days outofdiscipline an aboardship revel with the portugee whores and something approaching a monumental drunk for all hands and once the last doxy had been chivvied ashore the last smuggled wine bottle tipped overside and the last thick head had returned to normal use they had stripped jester of topmasts stores and artillery for her first careenage since leghorn the middle of tons of weed slime and barnacles had been sluiced swabbed chipped or fired off her hull and what little they could do to replace missing copper sheets or tar over and paint over had been performed before refloating her giving her that longdelayed lick and a promise above the waterline before restocking her rearming her and setting her masts up anew it was only then that lewrie could announce to his men that they were off for portsmouth to decommission off for home and england and jesters decks had rung with whooping cheers and tears of joy hed wished hed known sooner four hands had trickled off from the working parties entered on ships books as run had they known earlier that jester was bound for england they might have stayed on to see their families again and collect the pay owed them which was nearly eighteen months overdue which given the times and the navys slack accounting system was actually a little betterthannormal delay then again two of them had been italian volunteers or some of those maltese seamen whod been hiredout by the grand masters of malta in after hood had taken then lost the french naval base at toulon lewrie was certain that their fly purserthe young bespectacled mr gileswas cackling in glee somewhere aft in a stores room over their departure not only had they decamped without their meagre pay but their shares in the prizemoney which jester had accumulated since finding a way to make absent men chew tobaccopurchase slopclothing hats tinware and such on a twoyear spending spree as profligate as as drunken sailorsto help make his books balance lewrie was mortalcertain or sign their pay over to him in total forge documents that he was their executor selected to hold any share of prizemoney for them their only bloody heir lewrie had scoffed there was little he could do to their benefit and after all theyd run taken legbail from the fleet from shipmates and from his command now they were mostlikely deadbroke and desperate for a berth in any merchant ship thatd have them throwing away sums that for a poor sailorman were damnnear princely the devil with em damn fools so hed demurred and hadnt cocked a wary brow at giles letting him have his unofficial due he needed him too badly to anger the smug little captain sharp not at the last moments of a commission when his own accountings and financial records were to be scrutinised by a platoon of pettifogging admiralty clerks not if he didnt want to have some beartrap snap shut on his arse all unsuspecting years later his cabins were stripped bare but for guns carriages and the blackandwhite chequer painted on the sailcloth deck covering ragged and scuffed the paint scrubbed half off beneath the guntrucks the many light canvas and deal partitions were stacked to one corner like a set of abandoned doors or usedup stagesets his chests were now in a hired boat alongside toulon strenuously objecting to it was caged in a wicker basket which aspinall heldrather carefully he noted for toulon was hissing spitting hunkering and licking chops like he wished to nip the fool whod ordered him in there or whichever fleshy idiot got within slashing distance lewrie huffed a huge sigh of finality even after theyd come in thered been nigh on ten days worth of nattering with viceadmiral sir peter parkers staff in charge at portsmouth with the criminals at hm dockyards with the bewildered twits at gun wharf whod given him permission to keep his french pounders which equalled british longnines instead of waiting to exchange for the proper pounders his vessel rated and now vowed they had never known a thing about it and who the deuce did he think he was playing fast and loose with their records didnt he know there was a war on thered been a blizzard of paperwork all the forms ledgers and logs the fillintheblanks documents for sick hurt board victualling board ordnance board powder and shot expended in action or for gundrill with many tsktsks and mournful shakings of heads over wasting precious munitions without good reason backstays shifted spars lost or cracked lumber nails and screws used for repairshow necessary were the repairs to ships boats or bulwarks and had the carpenter or bosun allotted too many board feet too many bloody screws to restore a shotthrough cutter marines accused of using too little bootblack or pipe clay whilst using too many flints expending too much powder and ball and losing one whole musket and two bayonets having to explain in triplicate every lack or loss with the replacement cost held over each unfortunate respondents head until a plausible compromise could be reached every lack was lewries final responsibility as captain after all every loss or condemnation of rotten stores department heads were liable for lack of accountability certainly but in the end there were some things he could be dunned for after a final prissy and unsatisfied harumph that no outright fraud had occurred no sin of omission or commission which might lead to pay stoppage or courtmartial the senior clerk had written lewrie a form which deducted from the pay due him a copy of said form to be forwarded to admiralty for the clerks there who could tally up his pay for three years service another to go into his personnel file one for the portsmouth records and one to be handed over to lewrie for his own keeping with another huge sigh lewrie turned his back on those greatcabins and went out the forrud passageway twixt the sadly empty dining coach and the stillusable chart space to the gundeck to face his crew he had never decommissioned a ship in wartime shrike back in after the american revolution was over as a junior officer into telesto in or sweet little alacrity a converted bombketch hed had his first official lieutenants command when shed come home from the bahamas in those were all done in time of peace and were relatively joyous occasions for the hands had mostly been freed from the navy going off to civilian pursuits and the pleasures of their homes their families with the fleet much reduced now though the royal navy was gigantic with nearly one hundred lineofbattle ships and another hundred frigates even more lesser ships in commission out fighting their foes worldwide nearly half the hands were impressed or culled from debtors prisons to man those fleets and there would be no freedom even a brief tantalising spree for most of his jesters at that moment she lay far offshore to prevent desertions daunted by the many guardboats which rowed portsmouths inner harbour with armed marines aboard with orders to shoot or apprehend with truncheonbearing press gangs patrolling the docks to deter anyone whod swum ashore in spite of the guardboats or the vigilance of a ships own marines who stood harbourwatch with loaded muskets with the navy so hungry for trained experienced men who could hand reef and steer this wellshakendown crew of his could end up scattered in a heartbeat sent off in dribs and drabs as need dictated to the foul receiving ships to idle for weeks til a sufficient number was mustered to draught aboard another ship newly commissioning or one come in with casualities desertions and deaths from battle accidents or sickness in need of quick remanning with any luck at allthough lewrie rather doubted his jesters would find any hed seen lips smacking greedy hands clapped together from other ships bulwarks or the impress servicethey might allow the crew to turn over entire into a new ship with a great deal of luck they might be allowed to remain aboard intact under the newest captain yet jester would be going alongside at gun wharf to remove her artillery along a stone quay to empty her of every last movable item to lighten her including her very last ballaststone her masts and spars taken away perhaps the lower masts drawn out like bad teeth and shed be weeks perhaps as much as three months in the hands of the dockyards being partially rebuilt except for those choice few holding admiralty warrant who were prettymuch assigned to her for life the fleet could not let valuable seamen sit idle what to say to them lewrie puzzled sadly hed most hopefully made himself a list assuming that some word might come down from london before this moment arrived offering him future employment as a confirmed commander he might go into another sloop of war like jester and the admiralty would then allow him some few of his most trusted hands to ease his transition should they actually promote him pray jesus and make him post into a th or th rate frigate then theyd allow him even more of his favorites along to form the nucleus of a new and unfamiliar crew less than a dozen all told even as a postcaptain but aboard that wishedfor frigate confronted with a sea of nigh two hundred strange faces hed need every salt he knew by sight or smell but there had been no word from the lords commissioners from the new first secretary mr evan nepean no word of future employment or promotion hed been required and directed to dot the last i and cross the last t unlooked for and unloved or so it seemed he smiled a sad grimlipped smile for the seamen and inferior petty officers gathered on the gundeck nodding and acknowledging the shy lost and inarticulate expressions from the ships people whilst on his way to the quarterdeck god help em he thought theyre just as hung on tenterhooks as i and with a perfect right too lewrie thought clapping a few on the arm on his way many ratings aboard a warship were the whims of her captain those informal positions aloft as yardcaptains topmast captains forecastle captains the quarter gunners and such places of trust and seniority marks of personal merit and authority which got them but a few more pence per month yeoman of the powder yeomen of the sheets bosuns mate carpenters mate members of a captains boatcrew in a new ship their qualities unknown to a new captain and his officerswho already had their coterie of favorites or protegestheyd lose their preferential rates their pride and esteem and the slim pay which went with them a valued man elevated to petty officer in one ship would be just another able seaman in another even if they stayed aboard jester her new captain would be bringing along his own tight little clique and would demote and replace according to his own lights lewrie went up the starboard gangway ladder to say his goodbyes to his waiting officers to share a last quick remembrance or two with them they at least were officially looked after and would be going off to finer things though considering the capricious whims of admiralty itd be just as stressful and worrisome to see where each might alight lieutenant ralph knolles such an elegant able and cheerful young officer sure to rise even higher and do great things mr edward buchanon the sailing master that youngold seer and west country mystic midshipmen martin hyde and clarence spendlove whod turned into saltstained tarryhanded young men in their late teens spendlove whose voice had broken and gone deep this commissionalmost ready to face examining boards and earn their own lieutenants commissions had they any fortune patronage beyond his own or interest with senior men almost pleasurable it was the first time this commission lewrie thought to say his goodbyes to the gloomy sarcastically bitter mr howse their surgeon that laconic critic whod set his teeth on edge with his eternal disgust with the world in general and lewries place in it in specific and his builtin chorus of one his mate legoff peter giles the pursertwas relief lewrie felt when taking leave of him that he hadnt yet been caught and lewrie implicated as well in guilt by association in some vaulting scheme which exceeded even the jaded tolerance of a corrupt victualling board was ever a dog bom tbe hung sooner or later i lewrie thought glad to see the back of him giles though and his jackinthebreadroom were as safe as houses for he held warrant and would continue on in her should he wish it mr crewe her master gunner mr reese her carpenter mr paschal the sailmaker mr meggs jester s armourer her cooper and a few such others would remain aboard in the yards right into her next commission as would will cony unfortunately making this day even worse making him wish hed never tried to promote will to bosun cony had been his man since back in the days of the siege of yorktown with him throughout all his adventures well then lewrie said at last from his familiar pulpit by the middle of the quarterdeck rail overlooking the waist damned if we havent had a rare run of luck aboard right lads seen wonders done wonders met some right bastards too but we fought em and beat em all hollow too and now come home the most of us safe and sound you oldest hands off cockerel you who came from windsor castle agamemnon since toulon those who come aboard in early right here in portsmouth all thrown together in the pot and stewed til you becameshipmates bitter and the sweet spicy and blandand youd know best which you are hey that got him a semblance of a laugh which made it easier a ships company and a damn goodun god bless you all for therell never be another like you not for me whereer i go in the fleet ill always have my jesters as the ringmeasure for any other crew to fit through to try and equal im damme i am not goin ta tear up and blub he told himself give me one more minute o manhood besides theres surely an article of war against it he looked to the side where stood a party of clerks from viceadmiral sir peter parkers staff eager to get down to their business of paying off the hands beyond there lurked a suspicious hovering tender which he imagined must contain the impress service ready with a list of ships needing hands so part of his farewell speech seemed to be right out that bit about taking joy of being home well then he reiterated you know what they say bout changing ships the best men you serve with once honour them as examples the rest of yer life and never see again the dross show up like creditors one commission after the other id be proud to be with you every last manjack o you im as proud o you as a captain can be so you take pride wherever you light in what you did together proud of her our ship proud that for a wondrous three years you were jesters goodbye you rogues g goodbye jesters now give us three cheers for the best ship in the fleet and the best crew in the fleet a ship and crew any captaind be glad to command he added for the benefit of that impatient spectre waiting overside hip hip a quick bustle a final shake of hands a last formal leg to the senior officers who had had enough human decency to not peer at their watchfaces to spur him to hurry and who were mostlike familiar with the pain he was experiencing in losing a ship and he was at the gangway entryport while cheers still resounded from the crew he doffed his hat in salute shared a nod with marine sergeant bootheby and his elegantly turned out sideparty then turned to go down those freshsanded and tarred boarding battens gripping virginwhite new manropes strung through the battens outer ends so brightly served with ornate turkshead knots and bound with colourful red spunyarn trim then into the waiting barge and step aft to take a seat on a thwart near the tillerman among all his chests kegs crated cabin furnishings and canvasbound goodies a matching barge stood nearby idling offandon under oars in slack water also piled high with possessions a barge in which stood a young man in a commanders uniform his boatcloak thrown back to show his epaulet glowering at lewrie for taking so long making him wait to claim his new ship a grim thanks for nothing you bastard grimace on his phyz for making his leavetaking too personal poisoning his arrival in the afterglow of that intensely emotional farewell a pursemouthed meanlookin git lewrie thought resenting the hell out of him for replacing him for stealing jester from him were you smart you d have waited til this evening after i was long gone lewrie glowered back just as stonily as his coxswain andrews and his servant aspinall clambered into the barge shove off then lewrie pronounced and the new captain was stroking forward to take his barges place below the entryport in an eyeblink as he drew close though as they passed lewrie thought he saw the new man begin to beam in appreciation his face turned upwards bearing that ineffable look of a man gone arse over tit in love that wideeyed crinkle of joy that all sailors bestow upon only those loveliest of vessels the new man most likely lesssenior had the presence of mind to doff lewrie a cautious salute with his hat before clawing eagerly at the manropes eager to claim the hands lewrie smirked to himself lay hold of em before the vultures from the dockyard did with the new captain in his barge were a halfdozen seamen just as eager to board her and continue their favouritism and seniority under their patron portsmouth point sir the tillerman enquired aye portsmouth point lewrie glumly agreed facing the town unable to bear the tweetle of bosuns calls welcoming her new captain aint gonna like dot new capum sah andrews commented e didnt give em time tgive ya yer presents properlike what presents lewrie gloomed as the barge turned the older waterman by her mast beginning to hoist her single lugsail deres a letter sah andrews told him untying a canvas packet and handing it over model o de ship and dis sah lewrie read the letter quickly coughing to cover his chagrin every manjack had signed it or xd his mark except for mr howse and legoff of course thanking him for being a tolerant firmbutfair captain vowing should they have the chance theyd be glad to ship with him again wishing that he didnt have to leave jester lewrie squinted over that feeling his eyes mist up as the barge sailed out oi jester s shadow into bright sunlight ah hummm was all he could manage to say clearing a prodigious lump in his throat ain often po sailormen git a good capum sah andrews told him showing him the ship model it was about two feet long as fine a rendering as any admiralty model run up to present to the king himself with jesters every detail precisely and meticulously reproduced every line brace clew slab or buntline strung spiderthin aloft months itd taken he thought started before lisbon and his glad news deys is too sah andrews offered a coinsilver tankard pintsized engraved with a scroll of seashells and chain round its base and upper lip with a profile sailplan of a sloop of war in all her bounding glory and a scrollboard claiming her to be hms jester engraved below her there was a suggestion of the waves a boisterously erose dash at her waterline inverted vees about one side and a pair of leaping dolphins the enigmatic heads of two smiling seals and a forearm stretched forth from the deeps ahead of her bows wielding a sword as if pointing her way onward seals and a seagoda cryptic meaning known only to one whod been there board that ship in that crew and only during that commission my god its beautiful its lewrie mumbled in appreciation tother side sir aspinall winked read tother side he turned the tankard so the handle was to the drinkers right discovering a dedication which would ever face the drinker presented to commander alan lewrie rn lucky captain of a lucky ship from a grateful appreciative ships crew of hms jester model got done aboard sir aspinall revealed eagerly cup wellmember bosun conys runs ashore once we anchored took up a donation from evry hand he did and i spoiled the moment for em lewrie groaned too hot tflee fore i hed vowed hed not look back but he did even while the other new man was reading himself in shouting his orders so everyone would hear and understand from taffrail to jibboom tip directly charging and commanding the officers and company belonging to the said sloop of war subordinate to you to behave themselves jointly and severally in their respective employments with all due respect and obedience unto you their said captain the crews attention was bound inboard yet he stood his head bare raised the letter high in one hand the silver tankard high in the other a few men upon the starboard gangway spotted him nudged each other and attracted the surreptitious attention of more they waved hats and hands below the bulwark smiling fit to bust so the new captain would not spot them and when the new man finished reading himself in there came a thunderousundeservedcheer ruined it for him lewrie thought a silly asss smile plastered on his phyz but with tears coursing down his cheeks at last well what of it just bugger him and he d better treat em right chapter two there came a second hard leavetaking for a sailor standing atop portsdown hill as the overloaded diligence coach toiled up to the crest and the passengers as usual got down to walk the muddy track to ease the horse teams to gaze back and down at the wide sweep of spithead and the solent past the isle of wight outwards to the flood of the channel as the tide turned the harbours so full of warships a forest of masts and savouring his last noseful of kelp fish and salt breezes as if saying farewell forever to a dying lover andrews and his clerk padgett went one direction for anglesgreen aboard a stout dray laden with his possessions lewrie and his manservant aspinall went another for london in the thricedaily dilly for admiralty and word of future employment the wind now a land breeze heavy with springtime growth with nurturing rains and turnedearth smells stole the seascent and whistled cool over the crest of the hill almost foreboding he could conjure lewrie marvelled though how much england had changed during his absence roads where before there had been foot paths branching from the main london route and teeming with waggon traffic the main road now become a congested highway with cottages rowhouses shops and inns lining the sides where cows or sheep had grazed before mysterious fuming bustling manufacturies crammed with workers amidst the clank and hiss of newfangled steam machines that drove belts pumped water and spun looms and lathes reeking of burning coal and the musty wetlaundry odour of the steam itself tiny crossroads hamlets had blossomed into villages villages into towns and london had sprawled even further afield absorbing a host of settlements and farmland into its industrial residential conurbations as though it had leapt southward almost to guildford in the span of a single dog watch like an oil stain progress had spread they passed through new suburbs of london looking just as seedy as the old ones lewrie took wry note bricks and windowpanes were already sootblackened the gutters filled with castoff trash horse droppings and the scurrying carters and street vendors artificers or mechanics children or housewives looked pinched and off their feed careworn driven urgent to their business or a tad vexed lewrie wondered as good and warm as the people were dressed there was little colour to them as if the gods of wardriven industry were just a tad too demanding and despite the evident signs of wealth london proper struck him as dowdy fretful and gloomy even the ornate gardens and parks were tinged the swans noticeably offwhite for all the fume of coal smoke which he had not thought quite so thick the last time he had come up to the city of his birth in and once alit from the rumbletumble coach it began to rain of course a sooty pelting drizzle that brought the garbagemiddens to life as redolent as the old fleet ditch before it had been paved over and filled ages before the rain only whipped the crowds to greater speed not indoors and he and aspinall had almost been run over half a dozen times by carts or coaches by trotting vendors shouting cursory ave care sir or by yer leave damn ye as lewrie tried to regain his land legs his former canny knack for city navigation and to stay somewhat clean whilst they searched for lodgings for himself his servant and the wickercaged toulon no rooms sir the innkeeper at williss rooms his favourite lodgings told him sadly not even for an old customer nothing lavish sir lewrie wheedled after spending the last two hours of a late wet afternoon plodding from one inn to another this was the most expensive place he could recall but it set a good table and it was growing dark my man could even sleep rough on a settee if we have to no matter what aspinall had to say about it well there is a secondfloor chamber sir but the owner frowned raising his eyebrows at the thought of a gentleman and a common bodyservant sharing that chamber he gave aspinall a onceover frowning even deeper dear lord sir is that a cat you have with you bless me sir never take animals no sir its not sir whosis back in sir lewrie countered brought his favourite hounds kept em in his rooms fed em attable too as i recall no fuss then what would that single room be worth sir lewrie set his purse on the counter of the bar in the public rooms aching for an excuse to get off his feet to sidle over to the cheery fire and dry off a bit over a mulled rum or a brandy that purse gave off a promising chinking sound of solid coin coin sir the innkeeper gasped of a sudden his brows going skyward but of course sir just paid off your ship did ye tell me well thatd be silver or guineas sir not merchantissue shoddy fortunate in prizemoney sir lewrie boasted loosening the drawstrings and spilling out an assortment austrian maria theresas silver dollars some italian tin looks insubstantial but its silver shillings and aye gold guineas bless me sir you should see what im offered these days the innkeeper smiled like thisun sir spanish piece of eight but with the kings profile overstamped four shillings nine pence or five shillings tuppence no one knows exactly they say sirthe innkeeper dropped into a very confidential whisper that the bank of england to make its dollars pass stamped the head of a fool pon the neck of an ass ha ha good silver and gold well its a rare commodity these days i assure you be the ruin of commerce sure enough the piece of eight hed produced had overstruck a portly george iii over the latest slackjawed bourbon king of the dons to speak that way bout the king though now sir shall we say uhm guinea the day for you and your man and uhmm your cat yonder sir the innkeeper proposed lodgings and food all found commander lewrie yikes lewrie thought its baldfaced rape decent room is it lewrie sighed laying out two guineas for two days ive hopes to complete my business with admiralty by saturday and depart for home so we can be there for easter sunday services at the least firstfloor front with a good fireplace and a window sir the innkeeper assured him now jovial as anything as he swept those precious gold guineas off the counter and into a pocket bedchamber and small parlour in one but theres a screen i could put up and a cot i could fetch down from the garret for your man thatd right fine thankee sir lewrie told him ill see your things up to the room commander lewrie and once youve settled in do avail yourself of the public rooms a drink or two before mealtime and would puss there like a dish o cream sponged clean of most of the street smuts feet up in one chair and slouched in another lewrie did avail himself of the public rooms near enough to the roaring fire to take the chill off as the lodgers came back from their rounds of the city for the night a large glass of warmed brandy lay between his paws from which he sipped pleased as all getout that hed found shelter right down to heeltaps at last and waving for the serving girl to fetch him another here ye go sir four pence she said dropping him a wee curtsy and scraping up a shilling from the tabletop she returned a few coppers four pence for a lone glass o brandy wait a bit what in hades are these lewrie puzzled they were no copper coins hed ever seen better made actually than most pennies truerround and with sharpmilled edges but claiming to be from an assortment of private firms merchant shoddy sir the girl explained tokens really is wot they calls em but any sort o coins is so dear these days most folk accept em ive half me wages in em an theres nought turn up their noses honest sir williss does th best e can but times is hard she speaks true sir no fraud an older gentleman informed him from closer to the fire this bloody wars the fault the chinee trade and all our silver going to india and china he sneered very well lewrie nodded to the girl accepting the imitations for real currency and slipping her a true hapenny for service rendered been away too long sir lewrie commented cocking a brow at his interlocutor fightin this bloody war no business of ours sir what happens on the continent or what happens to frogs dons and dagoes mean tsay sir whats our good english channel for hmm long as those frogs donsperhaps even some of those dagoes have navies sirlewrie bristledit is our business what do you think we did at saint vincent broke up one part of a combination with an eye for our invasion sir if not of england then of ireland ah to defend ourselves aye sir the older fellow chirped most happily aint that right douglas he asked his partner at their table a cherubic old country squireish sort id not be averse to a million pounds being spent on our defence sir but not a groat more should go to austria prussia its their problem isnt it so they should spend their treasure if they think they need a war against the french blockade the french keep their navy reined back keep their armies from overseas adventure aye sir but thats as far as we ought go before the countrys bankrupt emulate the words of washington first president of the united states sir when he warned beware of foreign entanglements all very fine sirlewrie sniffed archlyfor a powerless and isolated nation cross the seas too impoverished to aspire to an empire but lookee here sir no matter which government france has theyve always hated us weve always hated them give em licence to conquer the rest of europe dragoon all europe into their fold and theyll be across that channel of ours and at our throats and whats the eventual cost of that hey damme never heard the like and from an englishman too lewrie fumed was the man a bloody quaker too meek to raise a hand to guard his own throat or one of those rights of man levellers youre newcome sir ill warrant the cherubiclooking old fellow who went by douglas poohpoohed back from our most expensive wooden walls hmm youve not seen the suffering sir nor felt it yourself thousands more enclosure acts farmers thrown out of work or off the land industry he sneered dragooning thousands into the mines and mills sir high wages aye but high taxes too so that no one may make the living one made three years past price of grains gone through the roof yet farmers such as myself barely breaking even een in a bumper year taxed to death we are hear hear several other gentlemen growled in agreement youd trust to a french occupation to lower your taxes lewrie sneered aloud and was gratified to hear an even larger more vociferous chorus of hear hears from those of the opposing camp you malign me sir the angelically whitemaned douglas said rearing back and suddenly looking as fierce as an old but game viking berserker never the french rather a reforming of our the first older gentleman laid a restraining cautioning hand on his friends coat sleeve you mistake our motive sir nay sir lewrie snickered i meant to malign you actually which won him a rowdy round of cheers the thumping of tankards or fists on the tables from the more patriotic topers lewrie had himself a deep draught from his fresh brandy in celebration knowing that the old fellow could glare fierce but would never press to cross steel with him or blaze with pistols he could be as nasty as he wished to be it looked to be hellishgood sport to berate the pair of them as unpatriotic im off dutyan halfpay civilian for the nonce he reminded himself no more firm but fair damme i aint been free to be me malicious old self in a month of sundays you have your opinion sir the first man said much subdued we have ours do you spend time ashore you may change yours i very much doubt it lewrie began but they were leaving the first gentleman almost shaking douglas to force him to keep mum they gathered their capes and hats from the abigail by the door and departed for cheerier taverns his shot at amusement over lewrie took another sip heaved up a shrug and reached over to their table to snag the newspaper theyd abandoned in their haste to depart now thisll be a rare treat he thought reading a newspaper which hadntbeen smudged nighillegible by an hundred previous hands one which wasnt waterstained ratgnawed folded and crinkled to the fragility of a yellow onion peel and containing information newer than a month past ahem gentlemen one of the innkeepers assistants announced from the doubledoors to the dining room we are now serving those doors were thrown open and a heady steam wafted out so tempting that lewries mouth began to water a first shot at homecooking a proper english mealcourse after course of his old favourites he hoped as he rose quickly a gluttons delight to welcome him back to all which hed fought fora glad repast worthy of the prodigal sons return he crammed the newspaper into a side pocket of his coat sprang into action and beat several slower feeders into the dining room at the first sight of that groaning sideboard laden with roasts steaks chops savoury fowland a pudding the size of a capstan headalan consigned the pleasures of political nattering quite out of his mind chapter three wartime hadnt thinned the waiting room lewrie noticed once he had left his cloak with an attendant no matter those hundred ships of the line those hundred frigates sloops brigs and such which required every officer still sound in wind and limb there were indeed a horde of others waiting rearadmirals and commodores rather old fellows no higher in seniority than the blue squadron he imagined though some might have slowly clambered up the seniority list to the red because theyd outlived their contemporaries some positively doddered there were postcaptains blessed with both epaulets denoting more than three years had passed since their promotion and at least one active commission at sea they the most of em looked healthy enough to sail on the kings business including junior captains with only one epaulet worn on the right shoulder a mixed bag that lot some spry healthy and young pacing impatiently others who looked old enough to be their fathers plucked by dire need from a sea of lieutenants at long last those men whod had no hope of command of promotion for they were the unfortunates who were ever at the wrong place at the wrong time had no patronage or interest and had never been chosen to serve aboard ships where they could shine in the eyes of an influential man of flag rank the same could pretty much be said for men of his own grade with the epaulet on the left shoulderthe commanders in the room they either were too young to be so fortunate or looked too old and wornout for the rank the ones whod go down on their knees and thank god for a bloody war or a sickly season as the old messtoast went he had no eye for the many hopeful lieutenants and midshipmen in the waiting room the devil with em he thought competition a lap or two about the room looking for a seat revealed no officer of his personal acquaintance either the good he thought sourly or the twitlike the twits hed served or served with he suspected were wellconnected twits and would be at sea that instant the good men hed known should be he took that as a hopeful omen that either way he was regarded by admiraltytwit or goodunhed soon receive one more activeduty commission and not end up cooling his heels in here with the hopeless ah commander lewrie do come in sir the strange new secretary offered not too cheerful considering lewrie thought but hed not sounded threatening either evan nepean sir first secretary your servant mister nepean lewrie cooed as the door was shut behind him nepean waved him to a wingback chair before a desk then took a seat behind it spreading his coattails carefully before he sat down he was a much younger man than either old phillip stephens or his deputy jackson had been cultured slim and rapierlike and togged out most nattily in the latest civilian style something about him though that arch look perhaps that wryly observant glare made lewrie think he wasnt a man hed exactly put his trust in well well sir nepean drawled in a lofty nasal accent of the titled and powerful so you are the infamous lewrie he smiled looking at lewrie intently over steepled fingers depending on which infamous you had in mind mister nepean lewrie most carefully replied shifting from one buttock to the other crossing his legs to guard his nutmegs damme whatd he heard why the ramcat sir nepean simpered the successful and lucky lewrie toulon genoa of the recently promoted rearadmiral nelsons squadron the one wellknown ofand dare i say it sir as highly commended bya certain ah audacious and unconventional gentleman from the foreign office the far east tween the wars a certain frenchman by name of choundas there and of late ashore near genoa i speak of that commander lewrie sir ah lewrie gawped well that he pretended to preen with at least a shred of becoming modesty thankful they didnt keep files on the other part of infamous nothing really just some rather uhm sub rosa activities this past year in the adriatic nepean interrupted ive letters on file hmmrn nepean thumbed through a short stack of correspondence sir malcom shockley the mp the millionaire lord what a horrid word do you not believe thankfully a firm supporter of our faction and of the prime minister one from lord peter rushton in lords though not known for anything much still full of praise for your nautical quality at least his first address to the house of lords could be construed as actually making sensewhich is more than one may expect from one of that august body so politics again lewrie groaned to himself damme it had even crept into admiralty with this new man evan nepean thinking him brave because he was tory and was spoken for by ones who were tory allied with william pitt the younger am if ivouldn t know him from adam if he crawled up and bit me on the ankle nor the old whig fox either well call this old dog any good name ye wish long as it puts me in command of a new ship he decided nodding sagaciously yet committing himself to nothing more to the point though commander lewrie nepean sobered from his bout of heroworship becoming all businesslike are your good characters from captain thomas charlton and from lord saint vincent a new investiture you wouldnt have heard of it yet from admiral sir john jervis now made earl good for him sir lewrie crowed suddenly his ennoblement rather yet wondering when the blades did he ever take time to think good o me rather a furor in the fleet after the glorious first of june commander lewrie nepean scowled admiral howe allowing his flag captain sir roger curtis to ah anoint by mentioning only those few captains of lineofbattle ships present for honours whom he himself thought worthy those whod closed yardarmtoyardarm to take their foe as prizes for the rest who fought well nothing a medal struck but given only to those fortunate few excuse me sir but lewrie puzzled whilst in lisbon in the careenage i read a london paper and admiral jerviss report made no mention of anyone at all so youre saying a taciturn man is the new earl saint vincent commander as im mortal certain youve already discovered nepean chuckled shuffling one pile of papers aside and drawing out a single slim folder to open yet he would not ever make the same mistake would never create even more jealousies among his officers he sent captain robert calder home with his dispatches which glad arrival soon after resulted in captain calder being knighted and promoted no old jarvy as i believe the men of the fleet are wont to call him waited to write a more complete list and report of the action to the first lord earl spencer after hed had time to assess things to sort them out this time every captain of every shipoftheline present is to be honoured given a medal commemorating the battle too i see sir lewrie nodded again still striving for sagacity but more than a little puzzled by this long prosing prologue then again good for old jarvy the earl saint vincent that is you sir more to the point at hand were cited in that letter to the first lord nepean said with a smirk very much like i know something you dont know ah sir lewrie gulped expectations rising for rushing let me see how did he phrase it ah for his intrepidity and alacrity at rushing to support hms captain his fearnought daring in engaging the enemy battleline in complete disregard for the custom and usage of repeating frigates at such hopeless odds in those minutes before he could hope for reinforcement or succour i most respectfully request of your lordship that commander alan lewrie of the jester sloop be included in the list of those to be honoured ah lewrie gargled mean tsay ah sir well the only officer below post rank to be so named commander lewrie breaking away from the line as you did in trusty and loyal and dare i say heroic fashion in support of your old squadron commander horatio nelson spite of all the rules to the contrary the risk of court martial and infamy well sir well well nepean cried sounding for a moment almost fawning in his appreciation well sir it was lewrie began fighting the urge to bark like a pack of seals at such an absurd characterisation pushed me out o line he did ordered kickin an screamin in spite of the volume of work still waiting you will do me the honour of coming with me commander lewrie nepean bade motioning towards the door in the far wall the one that led to the board room a discreet knock a muffled bidding to enter and they were in the presence of the first lord of the admiralty george john the earl spencer a fairly tall and distinguishedlooking fellow of middling uncertain age there followed some cooing remarks which lewrie could never quite recall for the heady rush of blood in his ears he would recall however the moment the medal was slipped over his head long and broad white satin riband edged in blue which passed through the oval of a largeish gold medalfinely milled and ropechained about its diameter a scene of victory standing on the prow of a galley and placing a laurel wreath on the brow of a triumphant britannia under the coat collar over the waistcoat so the medal will hang just above the pit of your stomach sir alan thought he heard the earl spencer instruct first sir robert calder now you commander lewrie the only ones i will have the honour to personally bestow the rest are to be sent on to the fleet now blockading cadiz so that the earl saint vincent may award them then im doubly honoured milord lewrie murmured still not quite featuring this was happening this was fame this was glory beyond his wildest fantasies within a quimhair of being knighted god he thought can dine out on this free for years suitable period of leave then will there be something open mister nepean earl spencer enquired as lewrie swam his way back to the hereandnow several vessels will i am certain be coming open milord nepean purred back though none for several weeks as i recall there you are then good sir your few weeks of shore leave commander lewrie earl spencer beamed you reside where sir a anglesgreen milord just down the road past guildford in surrey he replied his mind gibbering bloody hell they goin tpromote me into the bargain family estates sir oh erm milord near my wifes relations he admitted good huntin country surrey spencer prosed on wide open and rolling lovely riding which hunt do you follow sir only the local sir sir romney embleton baronet lewrie related glad he could elide his way round how often hed been invited to ride with them since he and caroline had wed in sum total of zero it was since hed shamed sir romneys otterjawed lackwit son harry damn near broke his nose in point of fact he could at the least sound like he still yoicks tallyhoed after foxes well my regards to your wife and family commander lewrie the first lord chuckled and do you take joy of a few weeks ashore mind now dont fall off anything and lame yourself we expect a great deal of you once youre back in navy harness ha i shant and thankee most kindly milord most kindly he babbled on his way out with evan nepean taking hold of his elbow to steer him away before he said something lunatick my lord that was lewrie marvelled back in the privacy of nepean s adjoining offices quite nepean said with a firm nod though sounding much less appreciative than he had before well then sir i will turn all the official correspondence from your commission over to the junior clerks though i dont imagine after a thorough scouring by viceadmiral sir peter parkers staff at portsmouth that theres anything serious amiss to quibble over my congratulations again commander lewrie he said extending his hand for a quick shake i note that you are owing eleven pounds two shillings six pence and there is the matter of your official certificate for your medal that will be another two shillings six pence do you prefer we may deduct the total from the pay certificate owing you sir or you may deposit the sum with my underclerk then see the pay office superintendent get your chit and be on your way home nepean was looking at his mantel clock whilst he said all that no matter his hearty bonhomie hed done his duty and it was time for him to take up others and lewries presence was a timewaster which made lewrie all but snort with cynical amusement ill just pay your clerk mister nepean he drawled with one brow up and a quirky smile on his face and damme if it aint one o the cheapest ways ever i heard of to get a medal stap me i should have thought o this sooner erm yayss nepean purred back just as chary of lewrie of a sudden as lewrie was of him well goodbye commander lewrie we will be in touch by post hmmm and he chivvied lewrie out of his offices into the care of an underling before lewrie could utter another sound the underling led him without a word to the aforementioned clerk far down the hallway lewrie felt like stopping dead in his tracks or going back into nepean s office concerned about the sheaf of penny tracts which had been hidden in his borrowed newspaper the previous evening all sorts of rabblerousing republican cant no more king annually elected parliaments votes for the common man what rot but given his unfortunate penchant for shooting off his mouth as he just had of indulging his smarmy wit he didnt think hed get another welcome or a bit more of nepean s time of day he dug into his purse and paid on the nail then waited for his slowly penned receipt for the sum owing the clerk then opened a tin cashbox and proceeded to begin counting out a stack of ornately made papers muttering to himself and referring to a thick ledger damme what are those then lewrie was forced to ask this is the balance of your pay owing you sir the prim old fellow intoned most officiously less advances previously paid out looks like bumfodder lewrie carped bank notes sirthe clerk tensedissued by the bank of england are hardly uhm that which you just described sir they are perfectly good legal tender throughout the realm sir there is the shortage of specie to consider after all they come in various denominations you should note sir differing colours and such for a one or twopound note the five ten and twenty you will come across the odd fraud issued by forgers or private or provincial banks those which have not gone under the past two years sir only these notes are legitimate so you should give any received in exchange the closest inspection and of course there are none smaller than a one pound and im to be paid in these am i my crew too when it comes their due twill be a wonder do they not riot over em i fear so commander but times are so terribly hard christ whats the country comin to he griped stuffing the neat pile of bills into his coat pocketsthey surely wouldnt go in a proper coinpurseand wondering how hed get to couttss bank to deposit them without losing half to a brisk breeze one may only wonder commander wonder indeed that clerk lowed like a mournful bovine chapter four what a reassuring sameness and familiarity lewrie thought all but squirming with anticipation as his hired coach swept past the stone ruins of the norman or saxon castle at the edge of sir romney embletons lands mossy old st georges church hard by the eastern bridge then anglesgreen itself damme more change he grumbled to himself as he beheld a whole new row of houses on the south side of the stream the clutch of new buildings round the red swan inn how the ancient old ploughman tavern had taken down a rowhouse to make a side garden for casual drinkers or bowlers there was a third bridge he clattered past quickly round the curve of the red swan onto the newly graveled road which forked off north alongside chiswick landstaking the turning he shouted to the coachmanonto a primeval rutted goat track trust uncle phineas chiswick not to waste a single farthing for pea gravel on his private lane just like the miserly old fart lewrie sat up straighter shifting from the larboard window to the starboard for a first tantalizing glimpse of his own home god he breathed in expectation there was a last turning between two new greybrick pillars onto his own lane which was propergravelled and drained wide enough for two coaches to pass and lined with far set back sapling oaks in twentyfive years hed have the makings of a drive found only on regal estates he marvelled beaming at carolines handiwork and forethought there was the house the lane became a circular drive about an immense informal garden tall and lush with flowers what sort lewrie wasnt quite sure but they were blue pink white pale yellow rather pretty uhm somethings he thought a real english country garden that would bloom colourful from march til november carolines work that and her green thumb there had been time for ivy he was fairly sure he knew ivy when he saw it to lay tentative creepers on the house front about the imitation palladian stucco central portal and the homey grey brick new white urns sat on either side of the portal as jardinieres he puzzled big as washtubs some yews and hollies to frame them between the windowsaye definitely recognisable yews and hollies his hollies his house his house his door it was a glossy darkblue with his silvery venetianbrass lion doorknocker prominent at its centre and that door was opening he was out of the coach before the postillion could get down to lower the metal step for him knocking his hat off in the process and galloping to enfold the brood which erupted from the house good god hugh he cried my boy my boy he whooped as he lifted him off his feet im home gad yer gettin heavy as any man sewallis he said lowering the wildly exuberant and squirming hugh to fling his arms about his eldest who for once came into his arms with something akin to enthusiasm to embrace him ten he was by then and sprouted like a weed already as tall as lewries chin god youre a sight for sore eyes sewallis grown so welcome home father sewallis said teared up and with his lower lip trembling but clinging to some shred of his sober stoicism weve missed you so yay youre back youre back hugh crowed so excited that he was capering sidewise like a crossgaited pony did you kill lots of frenchmen did you sink a lot of ships whatd you bring us ooh whats this a medal hurrah did you get it from the king boys my god he shuddered hugging them close to either side of him and little charlotte he knelt down tears in his eyes as he beheld a perfectly adorable wee girlchild no longer a squawling chub but a miniature young lady so like her mother with her mothers radiant amberhazel eyes and spiderweb fine lightbrown hair long and bound into a loose tail beneath a missish little mobcap when i left you were still in swaddles lord is it you charlotte she hung back a tad leery of him a coy finger tugging at one corner of her pert little mouth staring at him wideeyed like at a bad bargain she came within grasping range only at his coaxing are you really my daddy she asked of a sudden sounding just a bit cross and hiding her pudgy little hands in the folds of her fully flounced little sack gown well o course i am charlotte he assured her a tad put off just been away too long thats all of course i am as if to say well thats alright then she relented rushed to reward him with such a radiant and flirtatious smile and flung her arms round his neck he picked her up and stood not knowing quite what to do with such a delicate packet as she at last giggled aloud and gave him a peck on the cheek daughters he thought ruefully as he returned the favour upon both her cheeks boys now them i can understand hell i was one did you like the doll i sent you from venice he asked her as he paced about in a circle to admire hernow that she was satisfied that they were kin did you get it all safe and sound ooh daddy yessf she squealed with delight did you bring me another alan from the doorway he spun about to face her caroline he roared her name in joy it had been three long years so long hed almost forgotten what she looked like even with a miniature portrait hanging in his cabins almost forgotten what she sounded like hugh was prancing about wearing his goldlaced hat sewallis was being his everhelpful self dragging a heavy valise towards the entry yet there was his wife and he could have trampled them all in the dust in his haste to hold her she came to him with the same haste and charming little charlotte had to fend for herself as lewrie lowered her to the ground instantly forgotten to free his arms for caroline fierce as a lioness her arms were about his neck as he lifted her from her toes fierce and needy as a starving lion was he were both of them as their lips met she was beaming weeping her tears hot on his cheeks and his neck as he held her pressing her to him and rediscovering her taut slim firmness and the sweetly softer curves of her hips her belly against his the press of her breasts god its so good to be home lewrie crowed at the skies as he lowered her slid his hands down to grasp hers and leaned back to regard her her hair was down like charlotte s long lustrous and so finespun and loosely bound back in an almost girlish welcome instead of a proper goody housewifes starched mobcap clean brightshining and sweetsmelling of her trademark citrony flowery hungary water her eyes her merry eyes with the riant folds below them which waxed when she was happy her mouth and lips so widely spread in joy damme a touch o grey he puzzled at the sight of her temples she aint i aint mean tsay we aint that old yet surely crows feet merrylookin crows feet he corrected himself instantly he felt her hands so spare and slim looked at her from headtotoe smiling all the while mind and took in how spare her forearms were below the lacy froth trim at her elbowsa definite softening of her formerly firm flesh a falling away from the bone beneath ah but she did have the damn fever couple o years ago now didnt she he assured himself thatd put a few years on anybody he let go her hands and stepped forward to hold her close once more to nuzzle at her neck drink deep of her aroma and stroke her back so damn good tbe home with such a lovely wife tgreet me swear tchrist caroline youre even lovelier than before lewrie almost but not quite lied alan ive missed you so she whispered in his ear three long years im sorry i was above stairs hoping youd come today preparing should you she laughed softly and a fine piece o preparin youve done my dear he told her turned out like sunday divisions fair as morning here now dont trowel it on he chid himself wellhang itdo shes a woman aint she you cant pay enough compliments they stood back from each other again gazing fondly been dyin tbe away from portsmouth london achinalan chuckledtbe with you see your sweet angels face she teared up again but she was smiling fit to bust love what youve done with the house the drive and all and this fine round garden what a splendid sight he prated on id wager its a fine thing to clap eyes on first thing of a morning from our chambers hmm or watch the dusk gather he leered mummy see daddys medal hugh prompted for killing ever so many frogs frenchmen hugh dear caroline automatically corrected for killing frenchmen then hugh amended not so polite to say round dear sophie though is it hugh caroline instructed you must think of what might hurt people by the words you say or the topics you mention hmm its alright hugh i got this for fighting spaniards alan winked the one for frogs is to come by post hurray hugh piped and even sewallis sounded glad lets go inside shall we lewrie suggested im fair dry and a tad peckish that coach ride let me but park my fundament in my favorite wingchair see if it awakens oh caroline this is my steward aspinall and his burden thats toulon maam aspinall said doffing his hat and making a shy leg mister aspinall caroline replied with a regal incline of her head and a warm smile of welcome my husband has written of you so often it will be quite the sailors rendezvous here you mister padgett and andrews for a time i hope you take joy of your stay here lordy i hope not mistress aspinall said making a jape in his slow shy way but a sailors rendezvous is where the impress gang gathers fore they goes out tkidnap unwary sailormen lets call it fiddlers green then lewrie laughed out loud freeflowin rum beer and wine music round the clock and never a groat does the publican demand amen to that capum lewrie aspinall smiled ill be yer burden just til monday though maam me and padgett we thought tgo back up tlondon for a piece me mum an dads there and mas doin poorly til capum lewrie gets a new ship maam a new ship yes i see caroline frowned turning to alan for confirmation with a vexed worrisome look complete with that vertical exclamation point wrinkled twixt her brows do they say oh not for weeks im bound dearest lewrie hastened to assure her nigh on a month perhaps the first lord earl spencer to my face told me i was due a spell of shore leave daddys new kitty charlotte exclaimed going to peer close into the wicker cage ooh i want to hold him i wouldnt young miss aspinall cautioned hes a terror when hes upset an the coach ride didnt set him well aye charlotte leave him be for a while theres a good chub but daddy the weeun said stamping an imperious foot lets go in lewrie said again im dying to see what youve done with the place all those improvements you wrote of the formal salon was now furnished in light airy fabrics homey cherry or walnut settees and such the larger dining room was furnished as well in the entry hall those redlacquered venetian bombe commodes that clotworthy chute had obtained how hed prefer never to know flanked the carpeted stairs bearing coinsilver candelabras gawd its magnificent caroline he breathed in awe as she preened proudly a visitor might think the lewries settled and financially secure for ages more to the point possessed of good taste all that age which was more than could be said for even titled households who equated cost with instant elegance no matter how garish toulon was making unsettled rumbling hissing noises as aspinall set his cage down in the entry hall beside the luggage wee charlotte was down on her knees poking and peeking best we feed him quick so he doesnt get it in his head to run outside and get lost lewrie suggested fore he runs afoul of those setters sewallis is so proud of hey sewallis he looked at his eldest son remembering that sewallis had been half terrified of his old cat william pitt before hed passed over well chary of him lewrie amended to himself being charitable sewallis shared a look with him glad that hed remembered his dogsthough he looked more than cool to the idea of a new cat about the place he shrugged as if it were no matter yet aspinall gently moved charlotte out of the way and opened the cage toulon bounded out uttering a wary confused trill then leapt for the parlour where he immediately slunk under a settee to fuss oh come and see the morning room caroline enthused as she took lewrie by the hand to lead him from one wonder to the next that particoloured fabric you sent me darling two bolts were just enough see much too sheer for dress material not in england at any rate heavens do venetian ladies strut about that undressed aye they do lewrie secretly smirked ana damnfine show they were too drape this one large window what do you think he was a bit disappointed hed intended that she run up a gown from the fabricor as hed most lasciviously hinted in his letter which had accompanied it a sheer bedgown and dressing robe in his heartofhearts fantasy hed have loved to see her through both thin layers every sweet inch of her flamedraped by the subtle marbley waves of umber peach ochre and burgundy like one of lady emma hamiltons most pornographic attitudes now that cloth made bright cheerful drapes for the window in their smaller dining room where they usually ate enfamille without houseguests caroline had coordinated plush ochre velvet overdrapes using the sheer material as gauzy inner drapes and had tablecloth and napery of peach with the other colours picked out here and there in the paintings frames some fresh paint on the chair rail but it wasnt the use hed wished here kittykitty he could hear charlotte still coaxing in the salon and a faint carp from toulon as he was chivvied from pillar to post in search of a new hideyhole in a strange threatening house charlotte leave the cat be lewrie called over his shoulder wearing a supposedly pleased smile of appreciation on his phyz for the drapes hes not used to you and he wants to be left in peace he said it in an exasperated outofhisdepth semblance of his best quarterdeck voice the one hed use on slow bracetenders which brought forth a whine from charlotte as she began to blub up to be so loudly chastised alan really caroline gently chid dont want her eat halfalive thats all dearest lewrie tried to quibble aye theyre fetchin as hell arent they these drapes whatever was i thinkin that youd make a gown of it in anglesgreen and all oh do come out kitty owwwwl mummy was the shriek rrrrowww it could have been fright it could have been a glad victory cry lewrie could see once hed turned his head his cat making a dash for the stairs a blackwhite streak nigh flat to the floor and his legs churning like a naples centipede there went another streak in pale blue moire satin and white lace as caroline tore off to comfort her precious little girl left with the boys lewrie looked over to see hugh pursing his mouth to blow a fartlike sound with his lips and rolling his eyes evidently charlotte s curiosity and the teary result wasnt exactly a new thing in their house and sewallis surprised him with a worldweary almost adult sigh of exasperation and a highpitched hmmpph or tittch girls lewrie agreed hands behind his back and tipping them both a conspiratorial wink they do take a power o gettin used to lewrie figured hed done enough damage indoors for the nonce it was time to trot til domestic bliss was reestablished hows your pony farin lads and sewallis wherere those dogs does your mother ever let em in the house uhm no only when they were pups sewallis brightened we leave them part of the old coachhouse do you want to see them now aye i do you give your brother hugh one too lewrie joshed leading them out through the kitchens we share sewallis replied most primly no we dont theyre all his dont want a dog anyway want a fox kit or an otter hugh grumped no you dont hugh not round my dogs why theyd tear an otter or a fox to pieces sewallis harshly countered as they emerged in the sunshine to walk the old brick path between the kitchen garden and the flower garden bustling careless of where they put their feet three men striving to walk sidebyside or lead and dominate youd sic them on em hugh groused theyre beastly pests and nuisances sewallis snapped back would not but theyre ratty ugly theyre not theyre not hugh shouted in full cry by then theyre pretty so red and fluffy or so sleek an otter could be a playmate slide into the creek with me oh wager yer motherd love you slidin down mud into creeks lewrie scoffed ruffling hughs hair he does already and mummy doesnt like it he knows but boys lewrie cautioned away so long he hadnt known they could be at each others throats and within a quarterhour of his return too and whered prim little sewallis within a quimhair of being dour as a parson find bottom enough to boss hugh about or try to anyway though hugh was only eight he was more than ready for a scrap to the knifehilt lookee here lads lets not you quarrel my first day home at any rate christ you two go at each other like this all the time im sorry father sewallis muttered much abashed well he started it ahem lewrie barked glaring i know where theres an earth where theres a mother fox daddy hugh wheedled and ive seen otters in the creek up on grandfathers new land by the old tower we could ride up oh once i show you them youd let me have a there came a clatter of hooves from the farm lane which straggled off between the new brick barn and the old wattleanddaub one they had turned into a coachhouse coming into the stableyard past their whiterailed paddock where the childrens pony trotted in excitement grandfather said i could have one so hugh prattled on lewrie sighed rather heavily it must be noted for here came two riders back from a morning canter over their modest acreage drawing the pony to extend his head over the railings and whicker at them drawing a pack of spotted setters from the older barn jogtrotting and yipping with their tails lashing most gaily in the lead was a female his ward since toulon fell in the vicomtesse sophie de maubeuge last of her noble line no longer a frail tremulous waif he noted she rode with an easy confidence beaming a smile at him at the world in general and over her back to the second rider no longer a delicate little fifteenyearold newcome from a convent sophie had turned into a spritely eighteenyearold beauty with rich redauburn hair glowing in the spring sunshine her green eyes alight with an impatient girlish delight astern though in the full fig of his regimentals from the old th native infantry of the east india company army was his own father sir hugo saint george willoughby brigadier sir hugo haw the house haw the newcome his father cried waving his egretfeathered heavily goldlaced cocked hat in the air alan my boy home at last give ye joy mademeoiselle sophie enchantй lewrie called out as she rode up to him commander lewrie enchantй aussi she laughed as he offered to take her reins and a hand to steady her she swung off of her sidesaddle slipped her stirrupfoot to jumpslide to the ground as graceful as a landing dove almost squealing with glee you are home at last msieur la the house has been on the pins and needles for the first sign of your coming welcome home good sir welcome home he embraced her accepted a chaste peck on his cheek three years has done her wonders he thought when hed left thered been a girl bereft of fortune title family her intended and his own family so sunk in grief that she could barely raise her voice above a mournful whisper and possessed of the most fractured english now though but for a lilt a turn of phrase there was a girl who had the confidence the poise and grace and the easy unaffected joy of any countryraised young english lady of the squirearchy who never had known any other style of living or country the groomsman a new face to lewrie after the old one bodkins was taking the reins from him reaching out for the reins of the other horse then down sprang his father shorter than hed remembered from the far east how odd lewrie thought whitehaired now thinner on top liverspotted by a dissolute youth damme a dissolute bloody life yet still erect as a guns ramrod with the dammeboy twinkle of old in his eyes my boy my dearest boy sir hugo crowded offering his arms for a paternal hug ten damn years its been come ye here and a very merry hello tyou too lewrie thought with a weary sigh you wicked old fart he plastered a glad grin on his countenance and suffered to be embraced embraced his father in return wondering all the while if sir hugos elation to see him was a ruse that he secretly was poor as a churchmouse and this was the last port of refuge for a scoundrel damme never knew him tbe gladsomecept when he was needy o something lewrie thought as he was pounded on the back most heartily good to see you too father damn glad he lied rather well he thought but hed had a lifetime of practice by then chapter five the next few days were heaven lewrie thought for starters he got introduced to the dogs so they would not think of him as an entree whenever he wished to walk outside about his own lands he remet the pony without getting nipped remade acquaintance with his favourite horse anson which whickered in glee to see him once again they ate in the new large dining room that night in the light of those dolphinandtrident silverybrass candelabras hed bought in venice before the hurried evacuation of the adriatic then spent a lively evening in the salon opening the latest gifts for the children for caroline and sophie from lisbon sipping on a fruity nutty sherry hed found incask from oporto too theyd played some tunes caroline to her flute sophie to the harpsichord and he on his tinwhistle flageolet and finally getting a compliment or two on how much hed improvedthough anything better than birdsquawks could be considered an improvement after all those years of practice after a tad too much wine theyd at last retired were lit up to bed to a real soft and welcomingunswayingbedstead crisp and sweetsmelling of scrupulously clean linens still redolent of a faint floral sachet and the soap in which theyd been boiled toulon had found a refuge at last in their bedchamber and had crept out of hiding for a frantic quarterhour of reassuring wubbies much to carolines amusement so much like the early days my love she whispered fondly slid into bed with him and lying close at last after brushing out her hair toulon was fairtaken with her too you me so completely alone and private she chuckled scrubbing toulon under his chin and chops and old william pitt to pat and purr us to our rest or she added in a huskier voice sull up on the fireplace bench whilst sull up toulon theres a good puss lewrie growled and once the last bedside candle had been snuffed dark it was much like their first nervous honeymoon night at the coaching inn on the way to portsmouth as caroline could finally welcome him home in her own inimitable fashion which fashion left him damned near purringdrained and dreamless the next day theyd coached to st georges church for easter sunday services turned out almost regal in their springtime best and most dignified lewrie had thought caroline had worn her new gown and bonnet which had been most fetching sophie de maubeuge too looking ethereally lovely and being ogled by the young men of the parish the children adorable clean and unruffled for a rare hour or three and lewrie and his father tricked out in their best uniformslewrie with that gold st vincent medal clapping on his waistcoat buttons and a spankingnew goldbullion epaulet on his left shoulder his darkblue coat stiff with gold lace which hadnt gone verdigrisgreen from salt air yet the whole family primly arow in the same rented pew box it had been a joy afterwards to greet his brotherinlaw governour chiswick and his lovely darkhaired wife millicent theyd had an heir at last and millicent bade fair to present him with a second by late summer serene settled country squire was brother governour by thenstout and getting stouter halfway towards resembling the satirical artist cruikshanks depictions of john bull and where had the pantherlean ropemuscled side of north carolina colonist beef lewrie had known at yorktown gone he wondered mother charlotte chiswick was there now living with governour and millicent as a doting granny a bit stooped and myopic with hair gone white as lambs wool and uncle phineas chiswick himself got up in his bestthough he looked as if hed shopped for clothing in william pitt the elders last term in office lewrie had been struck dumb to see the miserly old bastard chortle and whinny with bonhomie clap brigadier sir hugo on the back and he almost pleasant for once emily the vicars spinsterdaughtertraipsing hopefully in a new ensemble of her own in her fathers wake still single and becoming just the slightest bit longintooth and the embletons and their coterie were there of course it was damn near their church their vicar their village their parish maybe even their half of the county dignified old sir romney embleton now master of the hunt his slackjawed halfwit son harry sporting his yeoman cavalry uniform spurs ajingling and preening amidst the same pack of rogues and rousters who had always surrounded himlooking a bit put out that no one made notice of his lieutenantcolonelcy of militiathis sunday at least master of hounds now harry sir hugo had muttered to his son think hes given up on civilian suitings for the duration of the war hey an mp oh very patriotic is harry embleton god pity the poor dogs then lewrie had whispered back which had made his father snigger the sort of man born tbe cavalry sir hugo sneered and turned to translate that comment to his valet a thoroughly ugly oneeyed old havildar trilochan singh of uncertain caste from sir hugos regiment in india had lewrie run into him in a calcutta baiaar back in the s hed have run for his life for trilochan singh was raffish bearded and mustachioed and looked the part of a swaggering badmash a hill bandit whod cut a mans heart out just cause it was a slow afternoon and no wonder caroline dbesn t know what to do with father or his man lewrie wondered to himself arent sikhs supposed to carry five knives all the time or is it one no matter god ill wager therere moren one of our maids sportin more than pinch marks sir hugo sir romney said in passing doffing his hat cool but politely punctilious vicomtess sophie enchantй mister and mistress lewrie your servant sir romney and a lovely easter day it is sir sir hugo replied just as formally as they made their way to their waiting coach galling as it was lewrie was forced by courtesy to doff a hat and make a leg to sir romney as well as caroline and sophie dipped the baronet their own polite curtsies hugh and sewallis emulated them doffing hats with sewallis well on his way to a clumsy boys leg as his mother had schooled him brigadier harry embleton said trailing his father ah colonel embleton sir sir hugo fairbeamed leftenant lewrie harry added barely audible and stiff commander actually lewrie gleefully corrected turning on the smarm and a good day to you colonel embleton uhm ah yayss harry drawled his gaze riveted upon that gold medal for a startled or envious second or two before gaining his aplomb once more and greeting caroline and sophie still cool with caroline lewrie noted and for good reason if he knows whats good for himso she dont take her horsewhip to him a second time pleasingly caroline gave as good as she got as coolly pleasant yet formalfor the neighbours sakes hello though hespractically slobberin lewrie thought as poor harry had a word with sophie poor chit she cant know any better surely to simper back at him surely carolines filled her in by now if the servants hadnt the new neighbours daughters her age hadnt polite is one thing but for gods sake she dont have to play coy at him a glance over his shoulder at his impatient sire already at the coach door stirred harry to motion and he doffed and bowed a parting before making all the haste that genteel and aristocratic languid would allow to catch his daddy up well at last he spoke to you alan caroline had breathed in wonder once the embletons had departed the beginning of a thaw do you not think perhaps my dear lewrie allowed but he still fair gives me the shivers or the collywobbles he added with a sarcastic grin alan on church grounds before the children caroline admonished all but poking him in the ribs may you not moderate your saltiness my pardon my dear well then let us be on our way caroline decided shooing the children towards their own coach easter dinner will be at uncle phineass in his role as paterfamiliasshe sighed at the necessitywhere we may break our fast with the bounty of the season and celebrate our lords ascension oh joy lewrie had snickered freshgrown bounty all those ground nuts tree bark and mud nothing but the best for his kin hey that set the children to tittering wildly bark and mud hugh contemplated rather loudly ugghh mud pies with caramel sauce lewrie abetted pig slop soup hugh dreamt up with cracklings mud pie an caramel charlotte all but shrieked yahahaha children caroline snapped do consider where you are making such a row on gods ground and of who you are and comport yourselves according alan really she cautioned swiveling her gaze upon him nostrils pinched and like to breathe fire slip o th tongue mizzuz he replied agrovel tugging at his forelock like a day labourer and crouching from the waist twas drink an bad companions maam wont appen agin maam beggin yer pardon oh dont flog me maam hhmmph was her nosehigh comment for that on public view though there was a forgiving amused sparkle to her eyes and her vertical exclamation point of vexation between her brows wasnt that deep now was it chapter six it was a splendid morning for a ride the faint mists had gone away the sun was well up and the dew was barely dried birds chirped and fluttered over their newly hatched young rabbits bounded ahead of them as they flushed them out not so much a fearful scurrying as it was a playful catlike clearing of the ground in exaggerated and exuberant highheeled hops the aromas of new shoots budding fruittree blossoms of virginal freshwashed tree leaves commingled with the loamy scents of recently turned slightly damp earth from planted fields and the greensap sweetness of hay barley wheat hops and rye sprouting in them turned earth and a faint hint of manure turned in with it came from the fallow fields which had been left for livestock to graze over the past autumn now broken for spring planting skies of pale blue brushstroked and wisped with clouds vivid greens of leaves and even weeds the paler greens of acres where crops had begun to venture forth like a thin watercolour wash over a deep umber shinhigh grasses waved as breezes took them on every cutover hill and the valleys between the woodlots starkstippled white with new lambs and the darker almost smoky bluegreen of forests copses and woodlots with here and there the faint skein of bluewhite haze from brushfires burning off piles of winter deadfall on such a safe cool moist day and as they topped one of the tumbling seawave hills for a wider mileslong vista even the faint sour reek from the fires seemed more the shades of living things than the spirits of the greyed dessicated dead of winter hugh ever the adventurer was further on ahead urging his pony up another swelling hillock sewallis now mounted on a proper horse though a gentle runt of a twelvehander stayed closer to them with his ears as acock as his mounts to an adult conversation listening with sober interest or perhaps rueing that they hadnt taken any of his dogs along this morningfor fear of spooking hughs quest or lewrie thought giving him a glance sulking that its hugh were indulging not him thought bein so priggish sewallis would be more tolerant of hugh his watchdog not his rival when did this rivalry start he wondered regretting being gone as they grew up wont you have the devils own time constructing yer lane lewrie asked up an down up an down all the way from our place to yours not if you come up governours lane first alan me dear his father smiled softly whatever possessed uncle phineas to sell you one square yard i still have yet to fathom lewrie confessed getting used to swaying and adjusting to ansons gait over the hills money my dear boy sir hugo replied smiling again but it looked like a cadaverous leer of a practiced captain sharp oodles of money oh i must admit he was loath in the beginning hoping it would confer to governour entire after he was gone didnt wish to split it up not in his lifetime at least not after he spent most of his life scheming to shove it together lewrie snickered point taken alan sir hugo grumphed tolerate you as one of his tenants perhaps expect governour to treat his brother burgess the same when he returns from india pray god he does damned good soldier is your younger brotherinlaw would have got the regiment had i had anything to say about it but he was not the senior major and money again the new fool who got the colonelcy is a third son to one of the nabobs of john companys governing board ah the same old story lewrie sighed philosophically he had never prospered from family interestor money eitherwith this caddish old rakehell at his side to thank for both at least in the royal navy connexions could only advance the idiots just so far talent and seamanship counted in the long run though there were the admirals on foreign stations whod made postcaptains out of their sixteenyearold sons and yes and thank god fort sir hugo hoorawed else id have not gone a captain in a distinguished regiment like the fourth been some tagragandbobtail ensign in a kutch pultan in the fever isles or at john o groats well no matter does burgess not get a colonelcy from john company ill have him back in england on my stafffore he can turn his head to spit your staff lewrie halfscoffed swaying sidewise in his saddle to peer at his father wondering who in his right mind would give him command of british troops again what bloody staff why im tbe military aide to the lord lieutenant of surrey alan me dear sir hugo hooted no matter the nexttolondon counties are almost completely run by the home office they still allow the token twits the office and a devlish profitable office it is too yeomanry militia forces do i not make majorgeneral by this time next year ive either gone titsup or wasnt really tryin another reason your phineas chiswick would sell me land alan sir hugo confided leaning a bit closer as they passed under some overhanging boughs at a sedate walk for the prestige o havin me for a neighbour and for a word in his ear now and again as to profitable doins which i pick up from the goralogs reason your sir romney is so affable too given the bile betwixt you and his son toadeatin aint limited to the lower classes alan me son oh theyre high and mighty men phineas and sir romney must confess i care a power more for sir romney than ever i could for that well a decent sporting gentleman he is dignified of the old school now im a landowner and not a wealthy tenant hes invited me to join the local hunt this winter committee decided im worthy you lewrie howled feeling abused didnt they know what they were getting he puzzled here he was a longtime neighbour affable as the day was long well to all but harry a bloody war hero due to be a postcaptain equal rank to harry and hed still be suckin hoofdust by the side of the road whilst his father would be garglin claret stirrupcups this fly rogue this ride on sewallis see what your brothers up to lewrie bade but father spur on now hes out of sight and just like goodyers pig sure tbe in mischief oh alright sewallis grumbled youll blow it you know lewrie told sir hugo once sewallis was out of earshot sooner or later that base nature of yours will ours me lad sir hugo twinkled ours therell be someones unmarried daughter a fit of temper or something lewrie stammered grope yer hosts maids guesting nothin of the sort lad sir hugo dismissed him waving a hand like shooing flies shooing horseflies for real in point of fact for one i aint so spry these days that i can rantipole like a young buckothefirsthead im older and pray god wiser too wise tbe caught do ye get my meanin for a second ill be off half the time to guildford london or glandon park where i may indulge those few penchants o mine discreetly with the better sort o whores i am a man o simple tastes sir hugo modestly declaimed like im first lord o the admiralty lewrie groused back import me a sportin sort o doxy tpose as my housekeeper sir hugo speculated done all the time and well you know it just the one woman though brrrr he shivered at the thought of anything close to domestic bliss or a lack of variety well mayhap ill just stick to the buffet assortment o courtesans i can hold my wine theres never been anyone said i couldnt ive drunk some ragin sponges under the table in me time too and thats sayin something for a man whos spent his life at messnight in royal regiments like the fourth where dye think our good english peerage hide their drunks but in the army hey or the clergy gad do i slosh down a pint less than most vicars and bishops im ready for beatification saint bloody hugo the temperate haw the chaste lewrie offered tongue most firmly planted in his cheek laughing at the image at the bloody statue or in going to a saint hugos and kneeling for communion do i dissemble well enough well perhaps even that me boy sir hugo nodded as mischievous as ever perhaps even that there theres the beginnings he said perking up like a gun dog on scent as they topped a bald rise it was the tower the brokenfanged topless tower where he and caroline had first kissed declared their love atop a small flattop hill with a view that went on for miles to the north and west a rill ran south below it almost lost in a thick stand of timber to its left another lay to the south meandering the bottom of the last swale they had left where theyd first dined alfresco a long sweep and another rise and there was the hill with the lone oak where hed and further beyond to the east the sight of his own home farm with embleton estates beyond that just barely visible sandwiched between was the gloomy old redbrick pile which phineas owned off to the noreast the tower was being reconstructed he could see the rectangular ancient stones had been gathered from where theyd fallen an age or more before and reset new stones to match from one of the nearby quarries had been fetched in to raise it and provide the base of a new house which adjoined it a basement had been dug out lined with matching stones or brick its going to be huge lewrie gasped at the expanse of the foundation framed by the first courses of the outer loadbearing walls not a bit of it sir hugo replied itll be onelevel so i dont gasp my way up and down stairs in my dotage like an old romanbritish villa or an officers bungalow out in india his father kneed his horse into motion so they could ride over for a closer look be in by august they assure me out from under carolines feet i expect shell appreciate that he said with a wry smirk that quickly must cost a bundle all that haste lewrie probed to discover just how much pelf his father had absconded with five thousand pounds the land two thousand for the house before furnishins sir hugo offhandedly admitted as if those sums were mere pittances dear lord lewrie felt the need to gawp who had sir hugo robbed be yours when im gone sir hugo informed him my son ah lewrie realised of a sudden rather hopefully threehundredsixty acres all told cheekbyjowl you note with yer hundred sixty rented from phineas but thisll be a paidfor freehold free and clear time im passed over so i expect phineasll be too then governours yer landlord for the smaller parcel and you and he can work out the details this for sewallis eventually hes eldest specify in yer will that hes trent the smaller to hugh for less than market value dont expect hughll be home much to enjoy it though down for the navy i spose that was our intention lewrie admitted where i have a bit of influence find him a good first ship and captain pity hes a naturalborn horseman exuberant child daring and a leader een now thats magic with troops now ive paid off all my creditors made my pile im a lot more welcome at horse guards than ever i was previous an army commission is a possibility in a bukshi regiment too needs a bit o polish though a good boarding school round the better sort we could fund that together son which did you have in mind father lewrie grimaced at the memories of how many of the good ones hed been tossed out of we tried that with me remember i doubt theyre forgotten me so yayyss well there is that sir hugo allowed with a rueful smile of reverie harrow especially hey boom you were ever the rebellious young dog once hughs eighteen though we could buy an army commission captaincy first then a majority as he seasons theres sewallis to think of first two more years and hell be due for a proper school when hes twelve mature enough to stand up to the bullies hell meet sure as fate well see him right sir hugo offered damme whats money for if not tsee yer children wellplaced welleducated and ease the first few hurdles money and influence grandchildren rather i will put up half his tuition and such a modest allowance too for both the boys charlotte too when its her time to be shipped off to be finished why thats thats magnanimous of you father i told you long ago son wouldve bought you a bloody pony and cart was that what you wished sir hugo sighed drawing a plaid kerchief from his sleeve for a blow of his drinkveined nose wasted my youth me best middle years ill probably waste my dotage too do i not look sharp about it wasnt much of a father to you and thats a gods honest truth hey abloodymen lewrie snorted back made up fort after me own fashion in india an orgy with the three girls of his private bibikhana as lewrie recalled it a cut of the best loot from the mindanao pirates hoard after theyd slaughtered em at balabac and aye some of carolines most impressive jewelry from that ah but yer too old an jaded to spoil now alan me dear sir hugo scoffed playfully tipping his sons cocked hat half over his nose no im not lewrie thought have a stab at it sewallis and hugh now second chances sir hugo went on sounding regretful but hopeful too reason i bought land here do you see might have been a horrid father and a shitearsed husband a timer two but i might just make a hellishgood grandfather do you not mind be around when you cant be take a tad of the wind out of master hughs sails that the way you tarry sorts express it but a tad sewallis well impart of a dab o backbone a pinch of confidence now and again with an heroic sailor for a father and dare i say it an heroic soldier for a grandfather that might inspire him when youre at sea i could stand in your stead nought to undermine caroline o course but youll not turn em into corinthians swear lewrie dithered torn between acceptance of the peace offering and the largesse which went with it or in shouting no way in hell for what deviltry sir hugo still had fermenting in his breast no matter his highflown sentiments look how i turned out he pointed out to himself and that with him being there but a tenth of the time now watchandwatch like i did with you dye mean sir hugo scoffed god was yer own doin that i merely set you the example a badun lewrie reminded him smirking even so good god most tykes dont get even that so sing small and be grateful his father japed in mockseriousness half that due to no mother in the house tmoderate your own mother then old alice up and dyin too well aye tis a rakehellish life ive led alan not that it was not the grandest fun mind ive one true son i know i sired turned out decent one stepdaughter a tenguinea whore now and gerald wherever hes got to hes mostlike but one step away from swallowin frogs at fairs for tuppence but here you are with a fine wife and three fine healthy children wholl be raised decent ive no livin relations no wife no one to leave a farthing to and a bit too old tbe startin a new family for myself dye see christ money all ive to show for my life is the bit o tin i gathered soldierin like muckin out abattoirs though the pays better sometimes well a slew o tin to be frank about it cause i was ever fortunate tbe in the right places and lightfingered tboot should have written first bout my intentions should youve said no then i would never have come here but how much tin lewrie wondered you a chicken nabob odd way tget a readymade family though for what nine or ten thousand pounds lewrie asked one brow up gently probing nearer to twelve all told sir hugo shrugged drop in the bucket balabac rebel rajas palaces good fortune in the opium trade to china i could have bought phineass estate entire lock stock and barrel and still have had plenty left he boasted christ lewrie exclaimed with a low whistle all his prizemoney should it ever be adjudged and sent to him mindand hed still be a beggar compared to well then i spose youll not turn hugh towards cavalry hear me hes much too clever for that no ill leave that to the likes of harry embleton son sir hugo laughed much relieved that he had in essence bought himself a readymade family after all and assuaged his conscience lewrie surmised though he was never quite sure if sir hugo truly had one or was merely hymnsinging from memory of how proper folk did things dammef i dont like sir romney toppin fine but theres a good chance the best part o harry ran down the footmans leg sort o dim bastard that turns up in the mess as a cornet o cavalryso stupid that even the others notice sir hugo guffawed well then lewrie summed up reaching for his reins i spose we should be going fore they maim each other hmm see those otters of yours at play boys saddle up he called erm thankee alan sir hugo said offering his hand not much i could do about it now youve already bought land is there lewrie sighed as he swung up atop anson sorry didnt quite come out right did it force of habit tbe on tenterhooks around you wary itll take gettin used to father lewrie replied offering his hand mind now hughs not to have an otter pup not take one home just adopt one up here at his grandfathers youll not encourage him will you son sir hugo shied acting much maligned moi chapter seven lewrie went over the farms books the next morning in his study the entries were in carolines neat copperplate scriptor in their overseers awkward scrawl receipts for seed and such were arranged in one pile and receipts for the sale of sheep cattle hogs wool corn and such were in another caroline sat by the open doubledoors facing the gardens by the side of the house on the west side knitting and playing games with toulon who was mellowing to houselife and farmlife quickly keepin her eyes on me lewrie wondered tsee do i smile or do i glower and glower over what he almost shivered recalling their first posthoneymoon spat in the bahamas when hed come home from three months amidst the down islands and hadnt appreciated whatall shed accomplished to turn a rented coachhouse into a showplace had erred by jibing her over the odd pastel the house had been repainted as if he were an uncaring cad and she too henheaded to run their house present him with a going concern that anyone would be proud of does something particular trouble you dear she asked one brow up and her voice a bit hesitant not so hesitant though that she didnt sound resentful that he might have found something amiss just as governour said lewrie admitted tossing away the newest ledger and leaning back in his chair to puff his lips frustrated taxes labour costs damme do we double our profits as you have done my dear he complimented her and meant it which eased her greatly with the prices we got at prewar tax rates and prewar wages for workers we shouldve cleared over ј not ј this past year head above water yet and all that but damme i wish workin for a naval herod be worth something even maggie cony alan caroline said putting aside all her knitting to cross to the desk and stand behind him one arm caressing his neck and shoulder they offered her work in the kitchens of the red swan and i couldnt match it with the baby and their cottage in the village to keep up closer to home and more money you see i was sorry to see her go she was such a treasure but little i could do to keep her no matter how friendly we were and hadnt replaced her lewrie noted saving nearly eight pounds per annum with the boys old enough their private tutor had been sent away after the last term just ended besides the new village school was just as good though nowhere near as uppercrustand cost a good deal less no more need of a proper governess just an older widowed maidofallwork to tend charlotte no grand as it looked a lewrie household didnt seem like itd be awash in footmen butlers servinggirls and suchnot anytime soon at any rate besides your named not draw workers alan caroline imparted sweeping her skirts aside to first sit on the arm of his chair then lean back and snuggle into his lap mind we think the world of you but he interrupted her to steal a gentle teasing wifely kiss unless theres a grand victory like saint vincent most folk could care less about the war she told him as she nestled in and they forget that a week later why last year the london mob stoned the kings carriage shouting no more king no more war and no more pitt they what lewrie stiffened in outrage why i never heard the like be stormin the tower of london next buildin guillotines and loppin off heads didnt see that in any papers come by me hold on yes i have heard the like lewrie reminded himself back in london that packet openny tracts those men at williss rooms higher taxes price of feeding themselves gone right through the roof feeding their families caroline mused sadly and all the men away in the army or the navy and believe it or not even these high wages theyre getting even with a scarcity of ablebodied hands cant keep up levies on everything needful alan soap beer boots clothing on candles taxes on sugar salt coffee and tea not that you can still find tea for sale less its been smuggled across from france mind caroline complained bricks tobacco rum windowpane glass windows themselves four pence mind you on a copy of a newspaper ive heard some mine or mill workers earn eighteen pounds per annum and ten of that goes out in taxes or necessities the same for our necessities as im sure you saw in my ledgers aye i did lewrie winced at the yearend sum there have been rumours of riots she confided nestling closer to him with a worried look labouring groups organising to stop work for higher pay though theyve been outlawed along with all of that rights of man thomas paine croaking never thought id hear such tripe in england of all places lewrie sighed sliding a protective arm about her damme dont they know do they stop working they starve our defences dont they know the frogs are ready to come conquer us ungrateful curs they wish to parlevous and bow to a liberty tree see all the churches boarded up and turned into temples of reason there came a knock from the entry hall on the doubledoors beggin yah pahdon sah andrewss voice came soft and melodious as he filled in for a proper butler but tis bosun conys wife come callin sah missuz maggie say she got tspeak tya sah it be urgent she say um ahh lewrie grunted disentangling himself helping caroline up from their compromising position so she could push her gown and her hair straight and he could reset his waistcoat shoot cuffs and appear respectable very well andrews ill be out directly i do declare caroline speak of the devil hmmm hardly the devil darling caroline chuckled maggies too dear to us to be calling her that morelike seeing a redbird as sign someonell come unexpected like we believed in the carolinas lewrie opened the doors and stepped out into the entryhall to espy a worriedlooking maggie cony the flaxenhaired helpmeet to his old friend and compatriot while not a classic beauty for a country woman she was usually most fetching in a strong nononsense way and more than a match for her absent husband mistress cony he beamed and young will too bless me nothings gone amiss since we saw you at church has it something urgent i heard will had been detained at portsmouth for a few days longer just until the ship could be properly housed in a stone dry dock lewrie had issued leavetickets for the senior hands and will should be on his way home unless the new captain had decided not to honour them hed sent a thick packet of sealetters on with andrews and padgett too as theyd come on to anglesgreen with his goods everything had been just fine hed thought somethin awful happenin down tportsmouth captain lewrie sir maggie blurted out coach just came with a note from will fetched it me at the red swan hell not be coming home sir well damme he shall lewrie declared if i have to coach down to portsmouth myself and set his new captain straight i give you my word on that mistress worsen that sir will got his leaveticket aye and his new captain said twas alright him comin on but now he writes he cant leave the ship nor the dockyards cant leave portsmouth atall sir none o the sailors can theres been mutiny in portsmouth nigh on the whole channel fleet sir navy wont take any orders tsail wont stir til their demands have been met oh lord captain lewrie sir maggie cony said one hand for her son and wringing the other in her apron mutiny sir theyll fetch soldiers tput it down an my will right in the middle of it therell be hundreds kilt afightin hundreds hanged fore tis done mutiny lewrie gasped what the whole bloody fleet it that just cant be theyve mean tsay he sputtered turning to caroline for assurance this wasnt a nightmare one ship aye with an ogre for a captain lewrie shivered wincing as he recalled how close hms cockerel was to mutiny with that batch of slavedriving fiends in her gunroom and midshipmens berths he saw caroline shudder but seem to shrug too as if this was merely one more threatening event in a whole year of earthshaking and unbelievable events with all the anger and want in the land she had just spoken of all the unrest hed seen in those penny tracts those republican rebellious screeds labourers noting aye civiliansd do suchhe groped for a thread of understandingbut never the tars not my jacks irish maybebut the best part of the navyhis navy and where might it spread have you wills letter maam good let me see that book two tamen aspera regum perpetimur iuga nec melio parere recuso yet we endure the cruel yoke of kings nor though the better man do i refuse obedience argonautica book v valerius flaccus chapter eight they took the shorter road down from portsdown hill this time beneath the furiously whirling signal telegraph station to the slightly inland town of portsea it was a clear day so lewrie maggie cony and young will could espy far beyond gosport haslar hospital several forts including the one opposite portsmouth pointmanned the forts were above the walls of fortifications circling portsmouth itself framed twixt portsmouth and southsea castlepent atop the goldengalleonspire of the church of st thomas a becketlay the fleet proud threedecker st and ndrate flagships twodecker rd and th rates slim frigates and sloops of war brigs schooners and cutters bulky transports converted from menowar to carry troops and stores for a worldwide war sheerhulks and receiving ships reduced to a gantline and lowermost masts where newcaught lubbers and seamen languished til a warship had need of them all of them flying battleflags the stark unadorned bloodred flags without the british canton commission pendants still streamed but none of the flagships wore broad pendants denoting the presence of an admiral or commodoreonly the battle colours nothing national militia paraded in portsea as their coach slowed shunted aside to make room for soldiery and idling onlookers there were hardly any sailors to be seen naval or civilian marines in full kit stood here and there in full squads their bayonets unsheathed and fixed under the muzzles of their muskets usually a parade of troops brought out the spectators raised cheers the fluttering of handkerchiefs by the town women and the tittery delight of youngsters but not this time lewrie noted now the doleful beats of drums the clomp of crudemade boots the clop of his coachs horses and the funereal rumbles from its ironshod wheels seemed the only sounds rightinto the main gate of the dockyard and several minutes in argument with a marine captain no matter lewrie was wearing uniform then at last proceeding past the hard gun wharf the mastpool and the small royal naval academy and the commissioners house the rope walkand a few more aggressively curious roving marine patrolsuntil they could alight hard by one of the stone graving docks where hms jester stood propped and stranded looking like a scrofulous dead whale with her bottom exposed all the sheet copper paper and felt ripped off and a good third of her underwater planking stripped away for replacing she looked more a shipwreck than a ship of war she did not fly any flags since she was officially out of commission in the hands of the yards and lewrie was grateful to see she did not sport that rebellious red banner either id go aboard he told an idling yard worker by her brow eyeing that shakylooking gangplank which led from the lip of the dock to her starboard entryport perched rather highish above the floor of the graving dock and all its accumulated trash muck and filth in about a foot of verminouslooking harbour water a few rare workmen pretended to do something constructive beneath her you her capum sir the dock worker yawned her last captain lewrie explained ey aint too fond o awficers come callin sir but ye cn try the man shrugged hoy jester lewrie shouted about halfway across that brow several heads popped up over the sailtending gangway bulwarks where a harbourwatch party evidently had been loafing a few sailors mounted to the quarterdeck hands in their pockets and their hats far back on their heads damme lewrie fumed no warrant or petty officer standing deckwatch and common seamen walking the quarterdeck without leave permission to come aboard to visit lewrie called over denied sir sorry a strange voice rasped back beggin yer pardon sir but therell be no officers return aboard til all our grievances been settled lewrie went colteyed at that reply his eyebrows up to his hat brim in shock at being spoken to so by a common seaman damme lewrie gawped again taking a closer look that saucy buggers armed he had himself a closer peer at the sailors whod been lazing on deck before and those whod come up to see the commotion wide baldrics were hung over their shoulders supporting scabbarded cutlasses pistols poked from their waistbands most piratical and those who served as watch or sideparty held muskets and sported cartouche boxes none of your officers are aboard then lewrie puzzled aloud and they gave you the keys to the arms chests not even a midshipman left nary a one sir the strange seaman shouted back all sent ashore just after the delegates of the fleet decided bosun an the master gunnerz in charge sir charge o th arms too sir and beggin yer pardon again sir but we vowed no commission officers to come aboard til i am commander lewrie jesters last captain lewrie stated moving forward a few feet along that rickety gangplank ive come to see your bosun mister cony ive brought his wife and child along there they are yonder oh a social call then sir the leading sailor brightened in at case aye sir come aboard passin th word for th bosun several of the mutinous hands relayed that shout to summon the bosun on deck as lewrie waved maggie and little will forward to join him sideparty present they would offer him a proper salute then though the muskets were mostlike loaded if not primed as well lewrie took it doffing his hat to the quarterdeck and sideparty as if jester was still a ship in proper hands and everything was normal maggie darlin will cony shouted as soon as he had gained the deck he rushed up to help her the last few steps inboard through the entryport maggie swept him into a fierce protective hug just as quickly with little will clinging to his fathers leg like a limpet to a rock the armed sailors their duties done lowered their muskets to lean on and cooed and chuckled softly breaking into fond smiles capum sir will exclaimed after hed scooped his child up to eyelevel still with one arm about his wife god o mercy sir

in pay two years ago too well he handed over a document lewrie scanned it feeling like he should be using tongs not fingers this could surely burn up a navy career like a fireplace ember would consume a carpet he did smirk at it though for it was admiralty paper watermarked with grthe monogram for georgius rex to the right honourable the lords commissioners of the admiralty the humble petition of the seamen aboard his majestys ship in behalf of themselves and all others serving in his majestys fleets humbly sheweth that your petitioners must humbly intreat your lordships will take the hardships of which they complain into your consideration not in the least doubting that wisdom and goodness will induce your lordships to grant them a speedy redress it is now upwards of two years since your lordships petitioners observed with pleasure the increase of pay which has been granted the army and militia and the separate provision for their wives and familiesnaturally expecting that they should in turn experience the same munificence but alas no notice has been taken of them nor the smallest provision the petition went on to state most assuredly that the seamen of the royal navy were his majestys most loyal and most courageous men especially in such trying times when their country called them to so pressingly advance once more to face her foes with what additional vigour and happy minds they would fly to their duty should they know that theyd be paid more money in line with the increases the army and the idle militia gotand pointed out that the navy hadnt gotten a rise in pay since the times of charles i well hmmm lewrie commented duckingandcovering behind a quaff of his beer for a moment of thought damme anything i say will be misconstrued as encouraging a mutiny mine own arse nailed to the mainmast but could i cosset em out of it he wondered save a ship for the loyalist side that would be another favour admiralty owes me oh for gods sake mister tuggle you look halfstrangled lewrie said with a faint smile long as wills taking his ease why do you not yourself sir mind now as i said i have no brief to negotiate nothing official but aye thankee sir thankee right kindly tuggle relented with a whoof of expelled breath he pulled up a tarry keg and bobbed his head as he poured himself a piggin of beer after bobbing his head to seem to beg even more permission sailors had been flogged halfdead in the fleet whod even dared begin a conversation with some officers or take any liberties of familiarity with them tuggle was treading on very shaky ground and he knew it i must say this petition was quite respectful and handsomely done a small pay rise and a more timely paying of it well your officers i assure you experience just such frustration i dont see how that this letter led to this lewrie cried holding the damning document aloft to sweep over his head to encompass the whole rebellious harbour and compared to the liners anchored out there youre in shoal waters guns landed ashore trapped in the graving dock why its a wonder the port admiral hasnt sent marines here already to root you out a mutiny for this piddlin scuse me capum

ordered viceadmiral gardner tdrop eight ships down tsaint helens patch and await a wind sir well they didnt not a man moved obeyed orders sir all orders but that un afore then well sir tuggle related more chummily lord bridport he knew what was goin on or had an inklin at last he asked for the ships tsend him more specific complaints and he bloody what lewrie barked halfstrangled on his beer open the floodgates to the lower deck lewrie marvelled to himself oh try and lance it fore it festers but my god the wrong damn way why every manjack had something that rankled him about being in the navy pressed or volunteered said he couldnt deal with anonymous petitions sir cony admitted why we ended up signin our names valentine joyce in royal george th speaker for all sir he signed first o th list sorry maggie but i had tdo hit wot those yankee doodles said durin th war we hang tgither or we all hang seprate you were coerced cony lewrie objected offering him a way out the people looked to you

ave another risin quota men sir tuggle sneered weve a few worst lot o drunks rowdies backstabbers thieves sir tuggle growled and several of the newcome men and most of the old jesters still aboard chimed in with a like growl of disgust no matter theyre no sort o sailormen nor watermen either sir cony stuck in evry county evry borough an townz down t supply so many men each assizes f r th navy their quota so they muck out their gaols and loonie bins and pass em on to the fleet lewrie scowled bloody right sir beggin yer pardon maggie darlin will cony rejoined most heartily ere maggie you

aint safe from e do ya ide em in th powder magazines cony barked which raised another agreeing rumble of discontent from the true seamen and petty officers gathered round them lewrie forced himself to scowl more deeply though he felt like breaking out in laughter for here was the same plaint hed heard for years in midshipmens cockpits officers gunrooms and many a captains greatcabinsabout the sailors they already had and for it to come from men afore the mast too well anyways sir refusin tsail that got their lordship attention right smart tuggle sighed once the hands had calmed down lewrie noticed that a few of the newcomes were blushing or scowlingsome of those quota men here among real sailors i would imagine that would lewrie japed deadpan anyway sir tuggle went on we the fleet delegates that is come up with our list o grievances lord bridport asked us for written up proper and signed this time reasonable demands sir i am mortalcertain youd call em too commander lewrie bein a longtime officer an all youve seen how thingsre done how the hands are treated oh theres some private grievances from some ships bout removin th real deathfloggers an th truly cruel officersn mates men so cruel itd make yer eyes water sir nought like you ive heard nossir an were holdin out for a genral pardon too sir sadler chimed in from one side in writin so we dont end up like the lads board culloden a few years back culloden the same twodecker troubridge had fought so well just recently at st vincent with pretty much the same crew aye lewrie recalled that shed staged a brief mutiny captain troubridge had been saddled with a perfect whore of a warship barely in any condition to put to sea and her people had demanded that they turn over into some other safer ship or have culloden into the yards for a proper refit surprisingly the admiralty had given into their demands though they needed every ship at sea and theyd sworn to her crew that theyd be forgiven yet as soon as theyd returned to duty troubridge and the marines had rushed them and seized the ten ringleaders five of them had ended up being hanged by the neck until dead then their corpses tarred and chained and displayed til their bones fell apart admiral gardner called aboard his flagship queen charlotte sir cony grunted sour from the memory urged em tgive way an return tduty said they could swear loyalty sign a tribute to th admiralty an itd all be forgotten ey wouldnt though sir not thout a pardon not thout their demands so he cursed em called em cowards sir swore evry fifth mand be hangedswore they all deserved hangin justz goodz spittin on em sir an them some o th best sailors in th fleet his own crew sir so what were these uhm grievances lewrie asked well the wages thats still first sir tuggle announced he produced a folded copy of the document which had been copied for every ship and laid it on the table lewrie put one hand in his lap and the other on his beer no way was he going to touch that ahem tuggle began to read that our provisions be raised to the weight of sixteen ounces to the pound and of a better quality and that our measures may be the same as those used in the commercial code of this country well god help the pursers lewrie thought thatd put em out of business in a dog watch no profit for em in that uhm that there be no flour served while we are in harbour in any port whatsoever under the command of the british flag and also that there might be granted a sufficiency of vegetables of such kind as may be most plentiful in the ports to which we go which we grievously complain and lay under the want of so we gets the fresh meat from them dockyard thieves the regulations says we should sir sadler groused pound o bread even freshbaked tommy wont never be the match of a pound o beef sir and the flours so cheap they claim tissue the beeves or hogs then pocket the diff rence sick care sir tuggle added tapping a marlinspike finger on the document man gets sick or injured he might as well turn up his toes an die for all the care most surgeons give cram em deep below where theres no fresh air cram em in the orlop some do and the surgeons and mates responsible for buyin their own medicines sir well you know how cheeseparin they are bout that like we say in the grievances here sir that these necessities be not on any account embezzled then i may presume mister tuggle that surgeon mister howse and his mate left the ship soon after lewrie chuckled sure tgod did sir cony supplied most cheerfully first warrantholders off in fact called us ungrateful curs sir after all theyd done fer us lewrie winced to himself too much use o that term ungrateful curs hmm now sir tuggle went on sternfaced as an instructor at his first morning classand sure to be disappointed by his scholars the fourth thing we want is liberty real shoreliberty for those of the hands deservin like jester sir three years in foreign waters and whatd she get sir anchored out combed for the press at best put out of discipline and all the hands wives children and the hired drabs amingle thats not respectful at all sir no privacy and in me last ship sir there were these midshipmen who loved twander in watch proper married folk at their couplin beggin yer pardon mrs cony leavetickets for trusted men longtime married men sir and holders of warrant so they could go home outside the port town when back in england liberty o th seaport for the younger and unmarried now mayhap therell be some like these new quota men and such who have tstay aboard cause you cant trust em and mayhap ya ferry the doxies out for them but you havent a bloody hope lewrie sadly thought you stay stubborn over that un and youll still be mutineers til next epiphany navy cant take the risk cant send a third of a crew ashore not if theres a french fleet just cross channel and the wind shifts of a sudden and lord how manyd ever come back no impossible last thing sir cony said drawing lewrie back from a pose of halffocused inattention well almost right now any man is wounded in action or sickis pays docked til hes back on is pins an discharged from sickberth we figger e oughta get all is pay straight through does e land at haslar or greenwich hospital ends up discharged then es pensioned off but for gods sake sir dont dock is last bit o money then turn im out tstarve in civilian life where e cant earn alf th livin e coulda made as a sailor broke up crippled missin legs an arms and such our pay goes up sir so does the pay for greenwich pensioners tuggle said as though it was already decided but thats a pittance and for a man grown up at sea what sort o life would it be tend a beggar ashore tuggle drew out ashore as if it were a biblical curse an never tread a deck again sir never see a foreign port nor have pride in a voyage done a storm weathered nor a watch shared with real sailormen a sunrise a sunset lewrie sighed wistfully wondering if thered be a navy another deck for him to tread if this mutiny went on much longer what would ae do as a civilian uh ahem now sides the pardon sirtuggle said clearing his throat with a tutorly whinnyheres the last bit so their lordships know were reasonable men askin no moren our due ahem it is also unanimously agreed by the fleet that from this day no grievance shall be received in order to convince the nation at large that we know when to cease to ask as well as to begin and that we ask nothing but what is moderate and may be granted without detriment to the nation or the injury of the service given on board the queen charlotte by the delegates of the fleet the th day of april now that aint askin so much is it sir one of the older hands enquired not like were askin for th moon isnt it lewrie wondered sadly last we heard sirtuggle told him as lewrie got his feet to pace hands in the small of his backtheyd agreed to the rise in pay nothin official yet but do they give us better wages then surely theyre considerin the rest wouldnt that be enough then lewrie asked to end this well nossir tuggle sighed after a long thought we wrote back thankin em for the pay rise buttil we get the fresh meat back an the flour removed the vegetables the pensions and the signed pardon from the king we dont stir sir well maintain discipline and order keep the ships up proper but we wont stir from portsmouth sir even do the french come out from brest or the dutch from the texel lewrie scoffed quickly youd sit idle if they invade us well sir uhmwill cony wheedled for a moment as he got to his own feet to look his old captain and compatriot eyetoeyemight be best then does whitehall worry bout such that we come to an agreement soonz they can sir stonefaced and cold as christmas will cony of all people in the navy telling him hed not sail to his countrys defence it was inconceivable could an easygoing loyal old tar like will cony put his back up and refuse to yield a single point then what in hell was the world coming to sail over tfrance give e froggies th fleet some faceless voice at the back of the pack crowed be swimmin in gold fer that here none o that now tuggle barked wheeling to confront such sentiments who said that own up man no one did though no one glared back too angrily or reddened with embarrassment to betray himself aye beware of talk like that lewrie roared like he still had the right to roar on these beloved decks thats not mutiny thats treason gainst king and country levelling republican poisoning talk london corresponding society talk same as annual parliaments no king he trailed off a tad limply he wasnt sure what else the london corresponding society wanted couldnt recall their other points in those tracts hed discovered any man talks of stealing the fleet and sailing off for france isnt a true englishman lads hes a viper in your breast planted on you by schemers who plot treason besides jester aint exactly fit for sailin to france at the moment now is she damme if we do not get what we want and they try to take us why i just might steal me a rowboat for spite and sell it to the frogs hah will any of ya be swimmin in gold for that hey he mimicked there was a certain sardonic logic to it that made them laugh at least the slightest bit whoever said that you lads watch him close make sure that you take whatever else he suggests with a handful of salt lewrie told them damme not three weeks ago i told the old hands among you i was as proud of you as a captain could be and now look at what youve gotten yourselves talked into come on men settle for better wages and a few concessions youre in no spot to sail away from a graving dock and youre in no spot to resist without artillery took an oath sir tuggle insisted beggin yer pardon sir but our mindsre made up same as yours by the sound of it said yerself sir you didnt come to negotiate dont have an ear with admiralty to help or hinder sir beggin yer pardon sir but it might be best did ya go ashore like tother officers sir will i came for you lewrie snapped after having himself a long incredulous gawp at tuggle he hadnt been ordered about like that since he was a midshipman im asking as a friend leave it theres still your leaveticket youd let him off wouldnt you mister tuggle lads heres his wife and child begging damn you all heres me begging he demanded will you come away mister cony

marryin bibleoath ah ya cant maggie cony muttered sadly committee said tput all women ashore out o harms way so we could keep good order proper ships discipline so they don think us nothin but drunks an debauchers cant make no exceptions dear as id wish maggie come ere a minute give me leave capum fore ya takes em back ome for me lewrie saw it was no use and gravely nodded will and maggie went aft towards the taffrails for a last few words of parting while lewrie retrieved his hat then paced away towards the entryport and little will tears running down his face aware his dadd not be with him anytime soonsaw himself being cosseted and dandled on old mr paschals knee surrounded by some older petty officers and seamen who had children of their own making a fuss over him cooing making faces to amuse him though will wailed inconsolably lewrie felt a presence near him and turned to meet the sheepish gaze of jesters new master gunner mister tuggle youre a hopeless pack of bloody fools you know lewrie said accusingly and do you get will cony courtmartialed and hung aside you then i swear tchrist ill dance on your grave i spose you may be right sir tuggle confessed looking a bit lost and hopeless at that moment but the fats in the fire for sure sir theres always a chance theyll give us bettern half what we asked be satisfied with that a bit moren half sir is there much to this from that london corresponding society lewrie simply had to know saw some tracts priestley place some of that lot did they stir this up or did it you forgot mister thelwall and mister binns sir a heap of others tuggle said with a brief weary smile id reckon least a quarter o the new handsthose quota men and united irishmen pressed americans have thorn paines rights of man part the second damnnear memorised by now sir no king sir no house of lords just commons annual parliaments fair wages pensions decent working hours and conditions sir right tvote for any man making ј a year not ј any who pay scot and lot lord sir even gone so far as to preach on giving wimmen the vote sir did ya ever hear such tripe commander lewrie has nought tdo with the fleet tis nothing we wish as to yer question sir though i spect weve a few lcs men aboard wasnt them started this seen none o their tracts no one ashore stirred the fleet tmutiny either sir this come from the sailors themselves sir and did some of the wildeyed radical shite beggin yer pardon sir come up twas rejected by the delegates early on were loyal men sir tuggle insisted just want better rations pay a tad better treatment sir thats all we demand tbe treated like men sir we arent all drunken brainless animals sir like most officers and th admiralty think well do our duty for king and country should we be called to were still true blue hearts o oak at bottom sir lewrie opened his mouth to make a reply but decided against a rebuttal it could only come out an exasperated sneer he suspected i trust mister tuggle that you are sincere bout doing your duty should it comeshould the french come lewrie said instead and with will cony so stubborn over this i trust youre all as sincere in your grievances too i cannot wish you good fortune you know it yet for wills sake if nothing else i wish that i could for will conys sake then commander lewrie sir for wills sake mr tuggle grimly nodded with only a tiny crinkle at the corners of his eyes all lewrie could do after that was to go aft to take charge of bosun conys family and escort them off the ship back to their carriageand take them home their quest a failure chapter nine lewrie was feeling particularly helpless and hapless after a few more days no letter had come from admiralty to offer employment as he had smugly expected it was spring planting season about which he knew absolutely nothing no matter his few idle halfpay years as a gentlemantenant farmer before the warthat was carolines bailiwick and none of his he had been known to raise his hat but nothing green his civilian suitings were once more hopelessly out of style as well and to waste money updating his shore wardrobe at a time when the farm needed every pence in these tight times could appear selfish and henheaded spendthrift showing disloyalty to caroline besides he halfdreaded to invest in civilian togs might signal a surrender or a willingness to remain ashore on halfpay for the rest of his life the fates he superstitiously feared took note of such accommodations practically in a dog watch he had been reduced from a powerful warship captain to a mere centurion mouthing repetitions of his tribunewifes dictates to their hired labourers without even half a clue to what they portended or a decent idea of what proper work such orders involved or how such labour was to be carried out on top of that the household was also feverishly engaged with the dreaded spring cleaning and did he not wish to be pressganged into moving furniture or emptying pantry shelves a man still possessed of his higher faculties would make himself scarce perhaps oversee the boiling of water as one did for childbirth at best and leaving the womenfolk to their pagan rites rituals and mysteries simpler societies such as the south sea islanders or the seminole and muskogee indians he had dealt with in had solutions for menfolk and warriors in situations such as these lewrie recalledthe longhouse where women were barred london had its clubs lewrie and anglesgreen had the public houses after a horseback tour of his acres a word or two with the new foreman and his mates lewrie betook himself to the old ploughman tavern the pub was uncrowded in the morning hours of course the real farmers who knew what they were about were out busily doing it even the moregentlemanly red swan inn that he rode past where he was anathema as long as any embleton still drew breath only had a coach or two a saddle horse or two out front lewrie handed his reins to the ploughmans newest boyish daisykicker said hello to old mr beakman and his spinster daughter whom will cony had jilted years before lewrie recalled with a newfound sadness for his missing bosun ordered up a mug of light sprightly new spring ale to steel himself for a look at the even more troubling world beyond and called for the newspapers mr beakmans own publicans advertiser was warmly supportive of the mutiny and the seamens cause but wisely shied away from seeming too politicalunless it wished to be suppressed by the government of course last evenings london courier and the freshcome morning chronicle were whig papers and foxite they hardly even said that the mutiny was even a mutiny yet just the disturbance at spithead or oh christ lewrie groaned the chronicle bore the disturbing tidings that the mutiny had now spread to the dozen lineofbattle ships based at plymouth too a list of ships that had raised the red flags was included hmmm he puzzled very few of the frigates were listed yet but that made sense pay didnt matter aboard frigates it was all prizemoney they were after and frigates were more comfortable ships with more room per hand not so crowded and a lot less dull a life than plodding aboard a liner or swinging at anchor waiting for the foe to come out and challenge them for a brief hopeful time the mutiny had appeared to be ended just after hed come back from portsmouth parliament had been rumoured to be meeting the house of commons to debate a bill for supplementary funds that the prime minister and councillor of the exchequerwilliam pitt the youngerwere drawing up to add to the annual admiralty expenditures his nobs king george had been rumoured to have left off dunking and gambling at bath and had seemed amenable to the general pardon the mutineers requested tory progovernment dailies had hinted that crews were returning to full discipline taking their exiled officers back aboard a few days later though pitt had spoken to the commons rambling through a speech that notably omitted any mention of navy mutiny seamen pay or even water the whigs and foxite factions had been on him like dogs on a butchers castoffs questions had been raised enquiries into the matter threatened elderly admiral lord howe had had to rise to defend himself howe had admitted that he had gotten anonymous copies of their demands weeks before but had been reassured by sir hugh seymour the admiraltys senior man at portsmouth that hed seen no signs of mutinous assemblies seen any grievance letters and had thought that the copies howe had gotten were the work of a malicious individual pitt and his first lord of the admiralty had been forced to admit that they had had inklings of mutinyand had sat on it following pitts dreadful speech the sailors had put officers ashore once more rehoisted the red flags and rerove the yardropes sure they were being set up with false promises for another betrayal soon to be winnowed and hung as cullodens ringleaders had been to make things worse the earl spencer had told commons that he had ordered completely new sets of weights and measures to be used for sailors rationsadmiralty could not redress that grievance until the new weights were available that lewrie scoffed was a baldfaced admission that corruption and graft went from bottom to top from ships pursers to the dockyard warehouses from jobbers to the victualling board itself that even civilian purveyors were being cheated when they put their goods on the admiralty scales panicked by the resurgence of the mutiny commons had elected to scrounge up an extra ј for the navy estimate and the king signed a pardon but by then it was too little too late not over yet sir beakmans daughter enquired as she fetched him a topup of spring ale no and god knows when it ever will be thankee lewrie told her poor mizzuz cony not knowin the daughter said with a tiny cluck of her tongue before returning to the long oak bar counter never married after will took up with maggie lewrie speculated gettin longintooth and haggard god a publicans daughter not taken yet even did she look like the arseend of a sheep he rather doubted that mistress beakman had much real sympathy in her soul for maggie cony spite and glee for a longawaited comeuppance was more like it he turned to the tory papers both the times and the gazette were incensed that the mutineers were demanding relief from tyrannical officers and mates too how dare common seamen hope to dictate to the aristocracy the squirearchy their betters to decide who was capable or suitable to command them never in hell both papers were firm in saying should hm government admiralty or the landed gentry surrender their rights as honourable gentlemen why it violated that sacred principle of the gentlemanofficer the dignity of the navythe dignity of the monarch himself why with times so parlous and revolution run riot on the continent in america lewrie shoved the times away in disgust right here on this very village commons the day before the local yeomanry and militia had drilled as his father had said to prepare them should they be called out to march to portsmouth just in case would the mutineers turn their artillery on the shore fire upon british troops if their demands were not met would british soldiers fire upon british tars lewrie wondered with a frown that was even a more disturbing question for if that happened all bets were off and england might go the way of france with blood in the streets and the aristocracy the king and queenand serving officers lewrie queasily imaginedthrown out thrown in gaol even guillotined just like it had come to the port of toulon and his nowdead french royalist compatriots in would he and caroline and the children end up as refugees in foreign lands as those royalists had or dead like charles auguste baron de crillart and all his kin but sophie de maubeuge caroline had kinrebel kinin the cape fear country back in north carolina and caroline and her parents and brothers had fled them too become refugees in england had the american chiwicks mellowed enough for a welcome he wondered but what joy was there in that the united states had practically scrapped their navy once the revolution was over and what could he do except farm jesus there came a hellish din from abovestairs the scrape and clang of something heavy and metallic the sloosh of water followed not a moment later by a trickle of water off the smoky overhead oak beams of the lowceilinged public houses common rooms what the devil lewrie griped aloud standing quickly to flee a positive flood of sudsy water leaking through the ancient floorboards above oh so sorry squire lewrie but were doin spring cleaning mistress beakman gasped peraps youd be safer on the side garden thought id escaped spring cleaning he groused rescuing his pile of newspapers and his widebrimmed felt hat might as well go home at this rate sorry mizzus a woman wailed from abovestairs the kettle o wash water spilled but its bringin up a power o grime will ya wish us tstart on the public rooms then aye mistress beakman called aloft will you not stay for the mail coach then squire lewrie wont be a halfhour with every road dry so far this week sir she prattled on shouldve done the cleanin and moppin before the muster day but and wasnt that the grand sight sir your good wife and wee daughter turned out so fine and your ward miz sophie lookin so fresh and fetchin in that pale green chiffony gown her new straw bonnet and all aye shes rare wondrous tsee sir poor motherless lass bein french and so far from home still muster day seemed tcheer her squire harry and his cavalry lads especialshe breezed on fanning her face as if overcome with lust or excitement herselfbouncin on her toes and clappin and cheerin so something was being said beyond idle chatter and gush lewrie suspected and he raised a brow over it as cattily delighted as she was over will conys comeuppance and her rival maggies sufferings for it at long last lewrie suspected that he was being slyly baited will had been his man and he was the interloper from rakish london who had shamed harry stolen his intended caroline did she blame him for being jilted and was she now suggesting that he would be getting a welldeserved comeuppance too fetch you a fresh mug in the side garden whilst ya wait for the mail coach tcome then shall i sir she chirped uhm aye i spose lewrie allowed lord as if i dont have enough worries on my plate as it is lewrie grumbled to himself as he betook himself out to the opensided covered garden porch and took a dry seat at a newish oakslab table worlds goin thell in a handbasket and even domesticity has its pitfalls he decided oh thered been signs right from easter church services women he muttered under his breath they just wont do the sensible thing offer sugar or salt and theyll take salt every timecause its sharper tasting bad man oh a baddd manstay away he wished he could simply order her or dont you silly chit be a fool if you wish he supposed sophie was bored to tears by the poor choice of eligible bachelors in the neighbourhood she was eighteen now and her sap was rising and girls that age began to think of which tree a nest could be built in and how best to feather it sophie was penniless without dowry or dot to offer without personal paraphernalia to take with her beyond what caroline had sewed with her and if she thought the lewries would stand her marriage portion shed best have another think coming especially if her choice was as abysmally unfortunate as the honourable harry embleton maybe its simple youthful rebellion he grumbled the tween years headstrong urge to kick over the traces no matter how gentle or kind the traces or maybe its because shes french he smirked oh they were a perverse race the frogs he could not imagine that she found harry attractiveonly another otter could be attracted to such a profile he was an idiot therefore controllable bosh lewrie could not feature sophie as being so guileful so mercenary so scheming yet for no discernible reason she suddenly had not seemed averse to being fawned at by that feckless fool harry she had few opportunities outside carolines sharp notice but that didnt signify caroline was sure that something was going on behind their backs yet he feared speaking to her about it speak too often and disparagingly about a swain and young chits wouldperverselyrun with glee to the very thing or person one warned them against and god knows i did gladly alan told himself not that anyone in charge of me ever took the time to give me fair warnings yet just yesterday amid all the pomp and pageantry that little anglesgreen could produce the stamp and slap of musket drill and marching the clatter of cavalry hooves the tootles of the bowld soldier boy that his father as the senior officer hereabouts had chosen from his indian army days as one of his very favourites there sophie had been making sheeps eyes and hooded glances mostly at harry oh shed bantered prettily with richard oakes too and if alan had his druthers of all the rakehellish local lads richard oakes was his choice should she deign to swoon over anyone nowhere near rich but his family owned their own land he was handsome wellknit rode well sang well the best of a bad lot frankly for being a member of harrys roistering hellforleather coterie educated was known to not move his lips when he read didnt look like a sack of castoff clothes in his finery and most especially did not resemble an otter with dysentery perhaps i should at least try to solve this one small problem lewrie thought with a fresh frown theres damnall i can do about the rest if i m fated to stay beached til the mutiny ends pray god it does soon or there came a clatter from the east the sight of a coach rising over the hill by the old ruins threading the overhanging roadspanning boughs of centuriesold oaks shopkeepers emerged from the doors of their establishments housewives popped from their homes the mail coach brought them out to see something new hear something new see a strange face in their staid village life lewrie rose too ignoring his mug of ale to stand by the kerb in front of the pub where the coach usually stopped the wee daisykicker sprang to seize the reins a mail sack was flung down there were no passengers alighting this morning then the coachee whipped up and clattered the swaying dilly on its way to petersfield why tis a good thing you waited squire lewrie for theres a whole packet for ya miss beakman tittered oh and bytheby the milliner mistress clowes left this note here for you but it clean fled my mind with all the scrubbin we ah thankee mistress lewrie replied adding that letter to the pile bound with a hank of twine bills bills bills ah ha a larger letter of much finer paper watermarked with the gr for georgius rex for king george iii sealed with a darkblue wax stamped with crown and anchors admiralty it appeared that domesticity any worries anent young sophie de maubeuge the spring planting it could all go hang of a sudden and feeling the perversity of being delighted lewrie was delighted but not guilty enough to stifle a broad grin of relief flinging coins on the table he drained his mug and called out boy my horse chapter ten oh msieur you are back so early sophie de maubeuge said in surprise as he practically burst through the front door she might have been the belle of yesterdays militia parade and drills but carolinesprung from more frugal practical colonial stockhad engrained real work into her sophie was dressed in one of her oldest sack gowns and a maids apron and mobcap with a clothwrapped broom she had been sweeping for cobwebs in the entry hall not very energetically lewrie suspected she had been raised as a french aristocrat since birth the tavern was not amusant sophie enquired obviously eager for an excuse to leave off servants work and twinkling with wit informative but not amusing no sophie lewrie answered in a rush still where is caroline in er boudoir up excuse me then he said bounding for the staircase ze post ave arrived you wish zat i uhm classer non sort it for vous msieurr she offered stepping forward and eyeing that loose bundle with what lewrie could only feel was alarm thank you no sophie its only bloody bills lewrie shouted down from the landing on his way up the second pairofstairs ill sort em later caroline helpful little chuck he thought but no wonder if she wishes a way out with harryor anyoneto avoid carolines housewifery work why what is it alan his wife asked with an amused chuckle in her throat as he stepped into their bedroom she had been sorting out bedlinens stowing away homesewn winter quilts and blankets slaying the triumphant smile he had worn since first breaking the seal on his admiralty letter he held it up in mute statement now unfolded to the full with its official seals of office in view caroline wrapped one arm about a bedpost to support herself while her other hand flew to cover her stricken mouth with trembling fingers oh no oh god no she quavered youre barely home two weeks they promised you it could be weeks more before im to have a frigate dearest he told her that means ill be made post with this mutiny still on they simply must get ships to sea untainted ships otherwise she positively glowered at him despite her shock and grief damme wrong tack alan thought got things out of order caroline i truly am sorry i thought wed have more time too peaceful weeks with you and the children but he attempted saying to cosset her tossing the bundle of unopened letters and bills to the foot of the bed so that he could go and embrace her but as long as this war lastsgrowl ye may but go ye must i cant i know alan she gravelled back arms crossed over her bosom tears and betrayalglints in her eyes dear lord how well i know by now i wish youd never even seen a warship all your born days well he stammered surprised and spurned by her vehemence thereve been times id wish the same my love believe me cockerel my first ship ariadne loony treghuess desperate but youre a navy man she jeered back refusing his offered embraces backpedaling towards her cedar chests off like a flash at their first their every beck and call eager to dash away for your glory and honour while those who love you must remain abandoned worrying and fretting aand caroline he whispered taking a tentative step forward but she would have none of it retreating towards the windows with a swish of her skirts dear he lamely begged to her turned back how little time weve really had alan she accused those three years in the bahamas a mere four more here in our own home making a life so sweet and filled with every delight a man could imagine heirs and land friends and community family and and then a war came which threatens them all lewrie reminded her more sternly than he meant to you know i had to respond to our countrys call dear i dont know what else i couldve you could have stayed alan she accused whirling to face him again that vertical furrow in her brows if i if we meant anything at all to you theyd had arguments before but lewrie felt that this one would be memorable so surprised was he so betrayed by his usually supportive and admiring wife he felt that he could only blush with shame for she was right on the nailhead with her accusations four years on the land you could have at least made an effort to learn the farms ways to uphold and aid me she fumed now looking bleak and haggard in her quiet rage she stomped past him to shut the door so the servants or children couldnt hear but you didnt you played at it and as soon as admiralty sounds their bosuns pipes why off you scuttle to wear kings coat again so you can stalk about your quarterdeck relishing it he would have told her that they were rightly termed the bosuns calls but thought better of it immediately its what i am caroline lewrie said with a sigh its who you married mind a sea officer of the king and yes you are she sighed in turn leaning on the door as if exhausted past all contemplation of future improvement and a glad one you know you are glad to sail away to who knows where glad to be free of your familial responsibilities glad to wallow in gore and shot expose yourself to danger til it catches up with you some day so long as you can chase after glory gone so long so far thinking a letter every rare now and then a pack of pretties from a foreign port atones for your absence she hissed dearest no thought for the ones you leave behind she continued hands to her face to daub her tears now your war isnt the short one you thought when last you left us is it alan caroline jeered god knows another year or two perhaps god save us another five ten another threeyear commission before we see you for a bare month or less before the next one and the next one and damn you and damn the royal navy just her anger broke in a flood of weeping wrenching sobs that shook her frame made her shoulders shudder she lifted her aprons hem to swab her inflamed face and lewrie at last could step forward to scoop her into his arms offer mute comfort and sympathy he rocked her as if dancing from one foot to the other laid her head on his shoulder and stroked her long lean backafraid to say a word more for now at last she made a sniffle drew a deep breath and sighed in resignation how soon then she asked in a wee girlish voice into his shirt collar my reply off by afternoon post lewrie speculatedgently depart by first light tomorrow i fear i really am sorry dearun you dont know how sorry our joys together us and the children youre not the only one who misses peace and normalcy tranquility do they say where youre to go she asked clenching back at him her face cooler against his at last i rather doubt portsmouth or plymouth are in any mood for new ships to commission at the moment he dared to scoff first up to london then perhaps the nore or great yarmouth some port close to home id suspect with the french and dutch fleets threatening us i doubt its to be a foreign station not for a year or better mostlike he told her leaning back a bit emboldened by her resignation to meet her eyes once more so not too far or long a separation caroline softened leaning back herself for a tiny crumb of promise perhaps even close enough to get home every month or so he said with a shrug cant count on it but when winter comes down if im still homeported the weatherll bind me in harbour for weeks at a time we could have you and the children down to visit school can go hang for a bit or fetch their tutor along aye thats the way mgirl he thought perk up game as you always do put the best face on it care to lay a wager with me dearest he joshed feeling he was now on safer ground lay odds with me hmtn i win and i get you with no tykes underfoot just the two of us for hotel weekends and what do i win if youre wrong alan she queried still dubious but much closer to an amused grin than she had been why you get me mdear he promised a joyous romp so you may do what you will with me have your beastly way with me oh youre incorrigible she sighed but lewrie noted this time it was a teasing sigh i spose we should begin packing you lets both pack hells bells lets all pack caroline he insisted all come over with inspiration the overseer can deal with the farm for a few days well all go up to london perhaps beyond to my new ship til im settled aboard alan i cant abandon the farm work not now not caroline balked but with a pensive almost eager sound as if considering it course you can he rejoined quickly extend the times we have together by a fortnight at least the boys are out of school youll be free of my pesky father for a while and when was the last time sophie saw london do her good to see more of the world other likely young lads hmm turn her head gawd thatd be four birds or more with one stone hah lets do love im to be made post so we deserve to celebrate well she hesitated head cocked to one side and swishing her long tail of hair under her mobcap a sly smile sprang to life whyever not then yes lets and she sprang to her wardrobe to open it for likely gowns suitable to impress and thank bloody christ that mellowed her lewrie thought he sat on the foot of the bed to sort the rest of the mail as she measured a dress against her bills mostly tiny sums he noted and thank god for that else theyd not be able to afford a diverting jaunt to the city more prizemoney deposited in his couttss account by his solicitor mr mountjoy aha but a tithe of what hed really reaped so far but more than enough to offset their sudden lunatick excursion and tide the farm over for the rest of the years needs bloody hell he barked of a sudden yes its much too plain caroline agreed misunderstanding his meaning and hanging the last gown shed tried back in the wardrobe though you neednt take such a harsh tone as to no caroline look he insisted bounding from the bed the scales are gone from our eyes as it were this bill from a milliner a mistress cowles quite cunning dearest and not really that expensive really caroline continued to apologise sophie charlotte and i only ordered one apiece for spring ah but its not a bill lovetis a billetdoux lewrie cried waving it at her wondered why a local bill needed wax seals its really from harry embleton suggesting an actual assignation let me see that caroline demanded fresh fury in her voice thankfully for lewrie none directed at him for a change why the conniving hmph see if she has our trade in future i know shes been at her shop quite often lately but i hardly expected sophie to exhibit such backalley guile the thoughtless headstrong chit like that frog novel les liaisons dangereuses lewrie scoffed more than glad for caroline to be on other ground lovers passed letters easier than gas and what would you know of such scandalous scribbling alan well i heard tell he waffled turtling his neck into his collar once more men talk dont ye know in the gunroom lewrie gruffly most offhandedly added i shall speak harshly with her about this caroline promised all this time i thought her sweet and naive but now warn that young miss ill have no lies or dangerous folderol in my household surely she must have sense enough to see that hes so bad for her or any true christian young lady i really must put my foot down in this instance bring her up short before she uhoh lewrie thought in sudden panic and when cornered like a rat accused of foolishness she ii turn and bite back and blab about phoebe aretino and me for jinglebrained spite theres an end to domestic bliss by god caroline shes but a child still he cooed instead going to embrace his wife to cosset her out of another pet besides do we accuse her act as if we dont trust her we will lose all the affection shes developed with us and shell practically run to harry or the first humanlookin substitute all the way to gretna green hey the first hedgepriest or falsejustice thatd wed her to a charming rogue no dear thats not the way i must insist beg would be more like it he told himself in a fret use my father sophie finds him amusing calls him granpere some of his rough uhm sagacity about men might be of more avail he urged god knows he must be good for something she needs soft insistent and loving motherly paterfamilial advice guidance she stared at him for a long moment her hands and that damned billetdoux limply hung together on her belly he felt a need to see to his flybuttons his neckstock under such close inspection alan you continually amaze me she said at last forming her fondest grin that furrow disappearing and the riant folds below her eyes acrinkle youre right of course harsh words and accusations once hurled can never be recoveredor forgiven least said soonest mended lewrie dared breathe in relief where do you get your insight being so much in the company of sailors my dear she actually snickered coming to give him a grateful hug and a peck on the lips id feared her head being turned by harry he is rich and she is not we are not unused to household drudgery though she tries to accommodate your wishes from love and gratitude mdear he tacked on with sisterly dare i even say uhm daughterly obedience shes come to love you us after all thats true too love caroline gently chuckled sophie is never going to be a goodie housewife a magnificent hostess wife or housemistress but yes soft words and sage advice drop by gentle drop will i be more suitable and your fathers cautions given her during their rides and card games a stiff warning to that colluding mistress cowles a word to harry or should i merely take down my horsewhip do you think dearest might he get the hint perfect my dear well off to london all of us yes by first light tomorrow you write your letters whilst i pack she kissed him once more deeper with more meaning before going to the door and be sure to reserve us a separate room at williss will you i mean to hold you to your wager dear alan whew he thought in relief can i finesse em or not children boys sophie guess what caroline announced chapter eleven like a presaging omen of his newfound prospects the coach ride up to london had been a cool but sunny delight the weather had turned off splendid the roads dried out but not so dusty they couldnt lower the sash windows of their coach and savour the aromas and sounds of a marvelous springtime though travelling with children aboard wasnt a thing lewrie was quite used to there were times he envied andrewsup on the drivers seat with their coachee to make room inboard and free of the nonsense london charlotte would scream whenever a new village or town loomed up before them are we there yet hugh would demand at about every tenth milepost sewallis thankfully kept his own counsel for the most part and his lip buttoned decrying only the most marvelous sights which flickered by as their coach reeled off a goodly clip almost as fast as one of the new balloon coaches which bore the royal mails no mudwell not much anywayflew up to daub them no herds of geese sheep beeves or turkeys blocked the road so completely theyd have to come to a complete stop no the delays they suffered were for nourishment for sweets or fruits hawked by pedlars at the kerbs of the towns they passed and of course the inevitable mummy i have to uhm now bawled by charlotte sometimes by hugh but darling you just uhm not a mile back i know but mummy hugh at least could be taken behind a hedge by the side of the road whilst the horses got a rest charlotte though well that required a proper inn a proper jakes a proper escort from caroline or sophie with the familys travelling necessary bundle followed by a sweet perhaps commander lewrie the tiler gawked back again are we sir aye sir on th list sir workin ya like a drayhorse aint they sir in an out in an out goonin sir theresahordeoothers waitin and again in a promising omen his heels had barely cooled in the infamous waiting room before his name was called and he was abovestairs to see nepean once more and it was personally gratifying for lewrie to have so many contemporaries in the waiting room that day even some of the renowned fighting captains peer from their corner coteries of admirers and wellwishers to wonder who he was or why he had the gold st vincent medal clattering on his chest as he made his way to the stairs commander lewrie aha evan nepean commented allowing himself a stab at glad welcome do take a seat sir youve quite enjoyed a few weeks ashore i take it oh quite mister nepean lewrie replied hat in his lap and his legs crossed damme this is goin mainwell he allowed himself to imagine though i did take a trip down to portsmouth to visit my old ship try to talk the hands remaining out of their nonsense wasnt to be sorry to say aha nepean barked looking cross portsmouth did you i see and whilst there sir did you happen to come across any tracts amongst your former crew sir of a radical rebellious nature which might be to blame for this mutiny nepean suddenly demanded none sir lewrie replied guardedly and on that head sir i did enquire but i was assured by my old bosun that hed seen none and that the uhm disturbance was spontaneouswithin the fleetwith no prompting from shore though with so many quota men these united irishmen being pressed lately well theres sure to be radicals in each draught from the receiving ships spirit of the timesmorelike sir known him since sir and hes truthful as the day is hmmm odd nepean sighed looking disappointed we were sure the duke of portland responsible for hunting down utterers of treason and mutinous rebellious assemblages hes agents afoot in portsmouth looking into the matter done a magnificent job of hounding our republican schemers break up every meeting place drive them from pillar to post wed hopes that the plucking or the arrest and silencing of a few ranters might defuse this take away their leadership dye see cant expect lackwit drunken sailors to hold out for long once the instigators are cast into prison hmm beg pardon mister nepean lewrie countered but it was my impression that the sailors did their own scheming crosspatch or no ill grant you the petitions my old hands showed me were written rather well which might seem suspiciously like someone wrote em for them but our tars aint that childlike the bulk of em oh the total lubbers the failed prentices and clerks with grudges you do not side with the sailors demands do you sir the secretary posed surely he purred come over all suspicious shit lewrie sighed and it was goin so bloody well ill be hauled out o here in chains next of course not sir he barked back laying a thick scowl pon his phyz and i was most distressed to find my counsel wasted even with men id sailed with for years trusted he almost thought of throwing in a petulant ungrateful curs which seemed to be the common coin lately but forebade i am gratified to hear that commander lewrie nepean said seeming to relent he got that quirky i know something you dont smirk on his face thumbed a folder to his right and drew out a sheet of paper he held it up to the light to read over just once more to prolong the suspense he let out a satisfied wee sniff bastard lewrie thought in heat though posing just waiting it is my honour to tell you commander lewrie that our lords commissioners have seen fit to offer you the proteus frigate and it is my honour to accept sir gladly lewrie breathed in relief where is she sir at chatham dockyard lewrie nepean deigned to grin holding out that precious document twixt thumb and forefinger florid scrollwork in the penmanship yet legible as blockprinting and suitable to the solemnity of the occasion a square stamp in the upper lefthand corner bearing the seal of admiralty embossed into the thick paper and a tax stamp halfway down the left side by the commifsioners for executing the office of lord high admiral of great britain and ireland c and all of his majestys plantations c to captain alan lewrie hereby appointed captain of his majestys ship the proteus dear lord alan grinned in awe what is she sir nepean chuckled with amusement at his surprise a gun of the th rate which requires a postcaptain into her god theyve been building those for years alan thought quickly lying at chatham sure to be a total refit and old as the hills but no matter he was now to make ј s per lunar month have an honesttogod frigate to command and hed made the long leap to post at last there it was in blackandwhite down in the lefthand bottom cornerhis date of seniority newest of the newagain it was no matter juniormost captain in the fleet that morning to be certain yet who in hell gave a tinkers damn for that proteus he muttered savouring her name the divine oracle of greek myth as i recall the socalled shepherd of the sea uhm more like the roman captain lewrie nepean corrected pulling at his nose blieve nereus was the greek fathered all the naiads are we there yet lewrie wondered hiding his smile wonder if old nereus or proteus got asked that well i was close key one could assume so many shapes when he was cornered before revealing the truth of the matter a proper oracle nepean smirked damn useful social skill lewrie thought sounds like me and sounds like we ii get on together well then nepean drawled ill take my leave then sirlewrie cried leaping to his feet and knowing an exit cue when he heard oneand coach down to chatham instanter just left the graving dock i believe she has sir mr nepean informed him already digging at a pile of more pressing letters a partial crew aboard time enough though for a slight celebration and for you to go well stocked in cabin stores hmm aye sir i spose lewrie allowed wishing he could shift his epaulet to his right shoulder that instant so he could descend to the waiting room and put a nose or two out of joint my thanks sir my undying thanks good morning to you mister nepean and a good morning to you captain lewrie nepean had grace enough to say do you remember to see my underclerk on your way sir there is the slight matter of the tax ah yes lewrie soured a bit taking a look at the stamp upon that precious document they were dunning him for another two shillings and six pence right then how did you put it last time captain lewrie nepean drawled tweaking him a trifle sardonically damme had i known it was this cheap id have done it long before uhm aye sir lewrie cringed quite he turned to go then stopped himself reminded of a vital point which had not been mentioned but should have been uhm mister nepean sir uhmm nepean replied looking up from his papers with a brow cocked in the beginnings of petulant impatience though not stretched quite so thin as to bark or bare his teeth yet the matter of my retinue so to speak sir usually a captain is allowed some of his old hands to accompany him into a new ship ah yes nepean sighed abandoning his work faced with what amounted to a real problem and not a timewaster he steepled fingers below the vane of his nose brow creased in thought ive my coxn my clerk and cabinsteward with me sir thats the lot perhaps some hands off jester could be called away to chatham theres my old bosun a damned good gunner named rahl yeoman of the powder now but a keeneyed shot as quartergunner should he take the rerating there are some able seamen been with me since toulon but captain lewrie nepean frowned opening his hands and closing one to a fist so he could shake an admonitory finger at him your last ship now lies at portsmouth and is reputed to be actively supportive of the sailors cause we simply cannot have men such as those spread throughout the rest of the navy which is so far free of the taint of mutiny i know it is the custom and usage that captains have reliable personally spokenfor men from their last ships but given the fragile nature of these current circumstances i do not see how we may oblige you pon my life i cant i see sir lewrie sighed crestfallen and pondering how he would fare recruiting at chatham in a strange town without a single old hand ashore at any rondy to vouch for him did he not gather a proper crew in a set period of time his precious commission document would be so much bumfoddertheyd assign another new postcaptain to take his place and hed revert to being a commander waiting his turn at another sloop of war if he was lucky or stuck at home back in anglesgreen with all its distasteful civilian and domestic doings fretting crops and sophie and harry embleton were he not once aboard at chatham you may forward to me a list of names you might recall from previous commissions captain lewrie nepean suggestedtossed out like a sop he didnt have to spend much on then are they still in the navy and are they presently aboard ship in an untainted port we may be able to accommodate you but mr nepean lifted his hands palms up and gave him one of those hopeless and powerless shrugs more commonly seen on rug merchants whod failed to strike a compromise on price i see sir lewrie sighed much abashed ah but youre such a knacky and resourceful fellow lewrie nepean said with a purr which meant he wouldnt lift a finger more to help him in this regard and youve taken command of vessels before where you were too junior a lieutenant to fetch aboard your favourites im sure once you explain your plight to the regulating captain of the impress service at chatham he will send you such trustworthy hands and petty officers as he has i will write him at once and send a copy on to viceadmiral charles buckner flag officer commanding at the nore twixt the two of them i am certain you will find proper redress thats satisfactory sir thankee lewrie told him though it wasnt in the least satisfactoryin normal times well then captain lewrie nepean said allow me to wish success to his majestys ship proteus and to her new captain then may all good fortune attend you and her sir long as i just go lewrie snickered to himself ill see what i can bout success sir good day chapter twelve theyd stayed in london that whole day and the next for there was so much to see to visit his solicitor mr matthew mountjoy to arrange funds and inform him of his new situation hunt up aspinall and padgett shop for cabinstores as nepean had suggested attend to getting his epaulets shifted new stockings in both cotton and silk a new stock or two a new dress shirt or two cases and small kegs of wine brandy and such and other foodstuffs specially prepared for a sea officers life at fortnum masons shopping at frybourg and treyers in the haymarket and shopping with the children shopping with caroline and sophie it was a hellish sudden outlay but fun mountjoy had been happy to inform him that another ј had come in from the mediterranean prizecourts less taxes and deductions less prizecourt fees and his own a tidy sum to be sure and half of it gone in a twinkling but the rest enough to keep his family with real style for at least another five years theyd taken in a military parade in hyde park listened to the bands and cheered attended the theatres in covent garden and in drury lane eaten out both evenings gotten a spell of decent weather on the first night and strolled covent gardens and danced the second night thered been a subscription ball to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of king georges daughter charlotte the princessroyal to the german prince of wurttemburg caroline had been glowing in a spanking new gown with some of grannie lewries jewelry and some of that loot which alan had brought back from the far east in some of it they loaned to sophie for the two evenings both were as begemmed as any royal and lewrie had nigh worn out his shoes in dancing almost every dance with them though after her second turn round the chalked floors of that huge salon sophie had had all the male company she might have wished all eager to make the acquaintance of the intriguing young woman who had danced with the naval officer with the medal on his breast shed been coyly ecstatic hiding her eyerolling and her little chirps of glee behind her fan when on the sidelines yet archly imperious and seemingly uncaring for even the handsomest partner upon the floor thered not been much sleep that evening to be sure what with dancing til nearly one a cold collation with champagne after then a coachride back to williss and sophie simply had to laugh out loud purr or titter and damn near shriek at times over her success with society with her and caroline chortling over the night til all hours lewrie awoke after a brief four hours of sleep a tad drymouthed from all the champagne and wines hed taken aboard woke to a bustling as loud it seemed as a pounder being hauled cross the deck to runout position as their household went about packing up for the coach trip to chatham everything in a rush a search for misplaced shoes hats and last nights fineries which had been flung willhe nillhe the slamming of chest lids and the patter of childrens feet at a scamper too excited to be shoved into proper clothing andrews was there with the seagoing stores stowed away aboard a hired cart and padgett was there shyly avoiding being trampled aspinall was back and eager to reprove his worth whetting lewries razor on a strop frothing up shaving soap proffering a towel a bowl and pitcher of hot water on the washhand stand babbling away a mileaminute as he got out that fresh shirt and stock blacked lewries best shoregoing boots and stood ready to shove him into order once hed sluiced his admittedly thick head face and neck shaved himself halfraw and slugged down a single cup of chocolate then down to a boisterous breakfast in the common rooms everyone chattering and nattering and the place filled with commercial travelers and chapmen all eager to chew up something and swallow it then be out and doing pay the establishment the final reckoning mummy i have to uhm into the coach and they were off by halfpast nine down to the thames and across to the south bank mummy i have to for another stop by the semaphore telegraph station at new cross and deptford dockyards are we there already from hugh whod prefer to take a walking tour to look at all the ships under construction greenwich naval hospital went flying by then the royal arsenal at woolwich and the testing of an artillery piecea rather heavycaliber and loud pieceset them to howling with delight putting lewries teeth on edge it should be noted he really did need a nap about as bad as any man born by then but the excitement of the day kept him alert to point out gallons reach and barking reach in the thames to their lefthand side halfway reach and purfleet the long reachwhy do they call em reaches daddywhat ship is that daddywhy do they call it fiddlers road when its not a road at allis that your new ship thenuhm mummy i have to greenhithe and swanscombe went by gravesend loomed up little charlotte thinking theyd come back to london by some conjurement and disgusted with the idea of a graves endwhat a horrid name forty miles of it with a stop for a midday meal at a coaching tavern and many many more necessary stops it goes without saying the hired cart had no trouble keeping up with the bowling coach for it very seldom had the chance to bowl along not more than a quarter of an hour at the most before there was another call to halt just as the scent of the medway came to his nostrils signifying nearly an end to their journey lewrie was most heartily sick of the lot of them and wondered why hed ever suggested they all come along this far along could o left em in london he sighed tautlipped couldve had a good nap by now deed done sophie rescuedhead turned and sure tbe entranced by other young men by now caroline justz pleased with things had we parted after breakfast though we didn t get a goodbye tumble for all the skylarkin fatherhood christ what man of a right mindd abide it did he know goin in are we there yet hugh bellowed leaning far out the coach windows for a first sight of the river round a bend in the rpad of the closeby conurbation of rochester and chatham just across the way and the steamy smoky coalgrate fug of civilisation aye by god we are lewrie roared back half in exasperation having about all he could stand of family closeness half in joy that by the sight of spires in town and the soaring erectness of mast tips at the dockyard just downriver they were finally there dear must you be so short with him caroline chid clucking her tongue like she was calling pullets to the foodpail he was but enquiring does he not just my dear lewrie rejoined feeling a bile rise as he was forced to swallow what he really had wished to say scream rather he threw in a sickly smile to show his good intentions uhm i must own caroline whispered allowing a tiny smile to play at the corners of her lips in spite of her statement quite lewrie nodded just as hugh came lumbering back from the coach window to tumble into his lap step on his right foot and reach across to draw sewalliss notice to the sight he had out of his window ow god mummy look charlotte piped ashiver with bliss london chapter thirteen commissioner proby in charge of chatham dockyards and uncrowned king of the medway all the way downriver to sheerness allowed him in for a preparatory meeting he was for a very busy man all affability and hospitality always happy to greet an officer come to take charge of one of our ships captain lewrie he beamed quite cordially proteus was refitted here sir lewrie asked over a very good cup of coffee or built here originally dye mean just completed proby told him pleased to enlighten him my pardons commissioner proby i thought no more th rate gun frigates were to be built especially the pounder s most of the fleet prefer the pounder s now so shes new brandnew oh my word lewrie beamed back most beatifically soon as he saw how fortunate he was one of the very last to be ordered and one of the last of her sort constructed proby chuckled a variation on the thames class with but some minor alterations to her forefoot and entry borrowed from the french the nicholson shipyards built her on speculation for a new class of light frigate later purchased as a oneoff under private contract with the navy board sir just cross the river they are at frindsbury a private yard then lewrie sobered nought to fear sir proby boomed in good humour they are completely competent nothing done at the back o the beach like most newcome builders these days they built billy ruff n one of the finest rd rate s in the fleet the bellerophon indeed lewrie brightened wellconstructed if i do say so myself sir proby went on pouring them a topup of coffee saw to that nothing but good hamburg or baltic oak for scantlings inner plankings or riders and hamburg oak for second and third futtocksenglish oak for her keel first futtocks decks knees and deadwood tis gettin devilishhard to find enough english oak for complete construction what with the demand for warships in such numbers no just launched one month ago and straight into the drydock for coppering and her masts shes afloat now and i expect youre afire to see her hey he winked most thoroughly aflame sir lewrie agreed over the last of their coffee proby filled him in on her specifications that proteus was feet on her keel and feet on the range of her gundeck about feet overall from taffrail to the tip of her jibboom she was three inches shy of feet in beam at her widest midship span and would draw three inches shy of feet when fully armed stored and ladenor so mr nicholson predicted she would weigh around tons when on her proper waterline and carry twentysix pounder carriageguns of the new blomefield pattern on her gundeck thirteen to either beam broadside she was allotted six pounders for her forecastle and quarterdeck as chase guns and six pounder carronades for close action part of her crew is already aboard all her officers proby remarked as they gathered hats and cloaks to go down to his coach for the short ride to the waterfront short of crew naturally but and her masts are already stepped mr proby lewrie asked creasing his brow in thought i thought that was a captains prerogative to set her rigging up to his own tastes masts set up topmasts standing and lower yards crossed sir proby said to him as they settled into the leather seats of his coach her previous captain had seen to it fore he departed poor fellow sorry sir but i was not aware there had been a previous captain lewrie said carefully he left recent then did he why not a week past sir proby replied turning sombre shifting uncomfortably on his seat the fine leather giving out a squeaking as he did so he leant forward a bit to speak more softlyguardedly youre getting command of a fine frigate captain lewrie oh a wondrousfine new ship proby assured him but he muttered there are some things about her a tad queerlike een so such as sir lewrie enquired crossing his legs for luckto protect his nutmegs against the eerie chill which took him damme jester an her doins was queer enough he thought at her launching dayproby squinted as if paineda fine day sir sunshine and the high tide a rare event on the medway as im certain youll agree a retired admiral come down from london him and his good lady to do the actual naming his lady did her naming lewrie puzzled nigh to gaping it was rarely allowedit was bad luck he constricted his thighs for more protection against such an odd event as good as in essence captain lewrie as good as proby sighed the admiral a most distinguished fellow he did the actual honours with the port bottle his lady by his side no real role in things as it should be no but she was one of those er whatyoucallems the romantic literary sorts quite taken with this fellow ossian dye see and whos he when hes up and dressed lewried scowled in wonder where this was all going some deuced scribbler translated a batch of irish sagas and such gaelic myths and legends set to poetry proby quibbled not sounding too impressed himself the romantic rage of the moment so im told elves and brownies dancing fairies and magic circles swordwielding heroes and druid magicians conjuring up all manner of spells and potions singing swords so please you have you ever heard the like irish they probably take it as history gospel and so this ossian lewrie prompted the ladys enthusiasms for all this bilge water got the better of her and she did strike me right from the first time i clapped eye on her that she was the forbidding sort o mort whod run her household her way and heaven help the husband who gainsayed herwell it was obvious shed put a flea in his ear and him a bloody rearadmiral and should have known better comes the moment to name her tell me before i throttle you you lame twit lewrie groaned stands up there on the platform neath her bows thousands of folk from hoo rochester chalk and sheerness watching band from the chatham marines ready to play her into the water officials down from london navy board and all bishop of rochester there too and that was the worst part lean a tad closer just a tad and lewrie thought furious and his fingers twitching for the leap from his lap to the throat adrape with flags from bowtostern cradle all thats holding her and all but the dogshores removed proby whispered acting as if were he a catholic hed be flying over his rosary beads like some chinee merchant at his abacus should have suspected had him a nose on at breakfast fore we rowed over to frindsbury and her nudging at him like a fishwife all that time whispering in his ear right you re for it lewrie thought raising one hand staring at how strong his fingers flexed stood up there fore one and all and called out success to his majestys ship came all over queer he did and waited with a smirk on his face proby all but groaned and wrung his hands at last he says merlin uhtnhmm lewrie thought feeling an urge to shrug whats so bad bout that old king arthurs pet conjurer so well the crowd went deadsilent and the bishop of rochester damn near swooned away sir proby grunted mean tsay captain lewrie a pagan religious figure a celt druid and there right in front of his nose was one of the chicheley brothers best figureheads of the seagod driving his chariot drawn by dolphins and seals seals oh christ lewrie chilled dropping his hands to his lap for more protection all thought oј mayhem quite flown his head well sir she slipped away right after proby told him in awe of it still himself dogshores just gave way with no one at the saws to free em everyone wheyfaced and the admiralty representative steps up and takes the bottle and glass from the admiral he had drunk off the glass of port but hadnt thrown the bottle to break on her bows so it wasnt quite done dye see and could still be salvaged and the admiralty man takes a quick slug from the neck throws the bottle it breaks on her bowtimbers and he calls out success to his majestys ship proteus the name theyd already picked then the band starts up and the people start cheering and and lewrie pressed crossing his fingers for good measure she stuck sir stuck dead on the ways still cradled tons of tallow so slick a rat couldnt crawl up the slipway but there she was stuck firm as anything proby whispered and the cradle it usually starts to fall apart once a launched ship gets way on her on the skids designed to break up once shes afloat held like its bolted together not cocked a bit offcentre not hung up on anything beneath her captain lewrie but she just wont move dear lord lewrie sighed very softly and circumspectly it should here be noted a badluck ship a jonah whos to say sir proby groaned sounding a tad miserable but heres a stranger part good sawyer in nicholsons yards hes out on the slipway with his little boy to cut the dogshores comes round afore her bows trying to think of what to do she misses that high tide and its days more before shes depth enough to launch proper without damaging her quickwork everybody watching and he just walks up to her forefoot lays a hand on her cutwaterit appeared that he said somethingthen one shove of his little boys hand and she gives out the most hideous groan like the cradle is about to give way and break up but instead away she goes smooth as any launch as ever i did see ah well lewrie felt reason to say with a relieved chuckle yet a bit of a shiver and here i thought you were about to say how she crushed him and his boy drew blood on her naming day wheew ah but the sawyer and his son sir theyre irish proby most ominously pointed out hunched up in his cloak as if he was fearful of sitting too erect irish dye see seen many an odd thing in my time concerning the launching of ships most go smooth as silk and no problem cause theyre just a thing at that moment and dont get their soul til after theyve been in saltwater for a spell now and then though there are the blooddrinkers a sloop of war once mashed three men when she veered off the straightandnarrow on her way in and god help every manjack who served aboard her til she ran aground five years later and drowned her entire crew off the hebrides theres a twodecker from this dockyard thats cost the careers of four captains by now and shes ill not call down bad luck by naming her had more strange accidents and deaths among her crew than any other of her type manamonth dying last i heard of her even bellerophon sir blowing a perfect gale the night before her launching came to see if the shores would hold til morning and there she was afloat launched herself dye see christened her myself after the fact i think she was so eager to swim captain lewrie that she wouldnt wait aye the billy ruff n had an odd birthing sir but for the life o me i cannot recall an event stranger than proteus not in years well thats coincidence surely lewrie objected that she came from the same yard and the matter of the sawyer like she approved of merlin though the church wouldnt then balked at being proteus proby rhapsodised as if in awe of the odd and only a gaelic blessing made her accept it groaning over it but going in at last at the touch of a mere lad well since then at least theres been no sign lewrie said he thought sign too close to portent and after a slight cough amended that to theres been no troubles in her or with her proby shrugged as if forced to say it like a reluctant witness giving damning testimony against a friend there is the matter of her previous captain aye lewrie posed wondering if his leg was being pulled captain the honourable william churchwell man in his earliest fourties as best i could judge sir proby went on a bit of the tartar or so i gathered from others a real tauthand but a most experienced officer dined with him several times once hed come down to read himself in commandjust after she went into the graving dock for her coppering a most righteous man too captain lewrie brought up strict in the church and for a sea officer a very proper and sober christian would have the hide off a seaman did he hear even a slight blasphemy or profane oath rare in the navy his sort bloody right they are lewrie thought keeping a noncommittal glaze to his features a seagoin parson damn rare breed those thankfully abstemious too sir rarely touched more than a single glass of wine an entire meal sir and could only be pressed by the convivial folk to a rare second seen it myself proby related and they both shook their heads in wonder at captain churchwells contrary nature it was a rare gentleman whod put away fewer than two bottles of wine a dayit was the expected thing part of a gentlemans ton the coach slowed rocking on its leather straps as it came to a stop just by the kings stairs which led to a boatlanding they alit which activity delayed the rest of probys tale below the stairs lay a gaily painted tenoared barge commissioner probys own flying his personal flag and hard by a more plebeian hired cutter occupied by aspinall andrews and padgett laden with cabinstores and furnishings and toulon in his wicker travelling basket ah there she is captain lewrie proby said filled with pride of his latest creation for the royal navy a beauty is she not all ships are sir but aye this un lewrie swore at his first sight of her shes lovely tall erect trig and proud glistening with newness her tarred and painted sides shining and reflecting back the prismatic light flash of river water hms proteus was indeed a lovely newcut precious gem of the shipbuilders arcane science her bowsprit and jibboom were steeved slightly lower than most frigates hed seen the way he liked em for that meant larger headsls with more draw closer to the deck and more ability to go like a witch to windward her entry was not an applecheeked bulb from the waterline up but angled slimmer and tapering narrower to merge far before her cutwater in an aggressive outthrust extension of her sprit and head timbers her cutwater angled a few degrees more astern than was customary to give her grace even at a quartermiles distance without a glass lewrie could discern frenchness in her pedigree with a touch of stocky english usage aft where she widened and flared for accommodation space and storage as far forrud as possible he knew just from looking at her that her forecastle could be burdened by a pair of pounder chaseguns and a pair of pounder carronades and still have the buoyancy and form to her front third to ride up and over even the tallest stormwave without ploughing under like a ship with a toofine entry might tumblehome inward from the chainwale and gunwale narrowing to save topweight all neatly proportioned like a surfacebasking whale broken by the row of gunports and the upper gunwale which was painted a rather pretty buff tan there was the glitter of gilt paint round her larboard entryport which at that angle as she lay bows upriver streaming from a permanent moor faced them gilt glitters too further aft where the quarter galleries jutted out from her curved sides and nearly upright stern timbers a commissioning pendant swirled and curled high aloft a small ensign in the eyes of her bowsa harbour jackand the red ensign of a ship yet to be assigned to a particular squadron or fleet an independent ship now and then outfurled to a lazy breeze and all as pristinenew as the ship herself i thought you would not mind did we use my barge to take you out to her stead of requesting of her to send over your gig mr proby said after taking a long satisfying gander of his own thankee mister proby thats most accommodating of you and i would be honoured lewrie said unable to tear his gaze from her in a lust to be abroad and too impatient to wait for a boat to row shoreward to fetch him like a parcel my frigate he exulted even if she was accursed my frigate my first frigate the freedom the power those guns of hers god help me but i do love em ships and guns and the reek o both andrews he called over to the hired boat ill go in the barge do you see my dunnage to the larboard port aye aye capum his coxn shouted back they descended the kings stairs got into the barge and were shoved off it was after probys coxn had a way on her and steering clear of shore before proby continued his tale ah captain churchwell proby sighed toying with the lapels of his cloak he and his chaplain came ashore to dine with me that last evening and as sober a lot as ever you could wish for captain lewrie the last evening you dont mean tsay saw him to his gig just there at the kings stairs as we did just now in my coach proby gloomed turning a weathered face downriver to keep an eye on the ships in his charge the refits and all of the new construction still skeletonlike on the slipways and to get a whiff of ocean lewrie suspected and not a halfhour later his chaplain was dead drowned proby sighed well a chaplain thats no loss lewrie thought most sourly a reverend on a ships a bit gloomymakin anyway havent seen one of em worth a tuppenny shit and most vessels sail without em how terrible he felt compelled to gasp though dead calm just at slack water it was sir proby said with another disbelieving shake of his head not a breath of wind stirring and no cause for proteus to roll or toss sideparty up on her gangway ready to render honours it might have been someone on the main deck took a poke with something through the scuppers but no one could recall seeing hands on deck that late at night other than the sideparty up above the gunports on the starboard gangway but but sir lewrie pressed feeling his hands twitch once more with impatience as proby turned the tale into a twovolume novel for no apparent cause sir she heaved a slow roll starbd proby whispered leaning close to lewrie on the thwart they shared near the sternsheets the chaplain reverend talmidge was halfway aloft and captain churchwell was just by the lip of the entryport when she did her roll and then sircaptain churchwell gave out a yelp like he was stung by a wasp he told me laterand lost his grasp on the manropes he slipped and fell backwards slid down into reverend talmidge and knocked him loose as well and they both hit the water and went under right twixt ship and boat without touching either sir not a mark on the gig as there would have been had the reverend talmidge struck his head on her gunnls and knocked himself out captain churchwell came to the surface a moment later and his boatcrew pulled him out but the chaplain never did now both men were strong swimmers i was told since boyhood and captain churchwell thought that the chaplain might be beneath the gig trapped and unconscious and he dove under searching for him but never found him he was never found captain lewrie thats odd lewrie had to admit aloud usually a drowned man comes up sooner or later downriver perhaps we searched sir indeed we did captain churchwell had boats on the river not a halfhour later proby told him he sent news to me requesting everything thatd float to search as far as gillingham reach the first morning and for several days after but nary a sign of him did anyone see and even did a man strike his noggin and put himself out well being round ships ports and rivers the most part of my life captain lewrie ive seen men fall overside seen drownings aplenty god save me and the most of em do come up right after they fall in fore their clothes get soaked theyve enough buoyancy for at least a single surfacing if theyve a scrap of air in their lungs well perhaps he drew in a breath but underwater lewrie surmised so far it was a tragic tale perhaps indicative of his new ships perverse nature he shiveredgaelic druidic and celtic soul certainly there was a frigate near her like hms druid built back in the early s and thered been a spot of bother at first over her name with the established churchs ecclesiastical court upset by an allusion to the old pagan ways and the necromancing druids he had never heard though that shed been trouble made into a trooper last hed heard with guns removed en flute so she could transport a whole battalion at once but the way proby was glooming and ticking the side of his nose as if in sage warning he wondered when the other shoe might drop it could be as you say sir for ive seen that happen also proby confessed mongst the drunkaslords the ones who did strike their heads but sir reverend talmidge was stonecold sober when he entered that gig and no one could recall him striking his head no dented wood no smear of blood or hair proby shrugged and may i remind you noted to be a strong swimmer i sometimes wish our lords commissioners might follow the example of the dutch navy they require every manjack sent to sea to learn how to swim or know how before joining and their surgeons and surgeons mates can revive a drowned man in almost miraculous fashion by laying him out facedown over a large keg laid on its side roll him back and forth and more than half the time he begins to cough and sputter and spew up what he swallowed or breathed in and is returned to the living captain lewrie like lazarus called out from his grave by our dear saviour i have seen that done too sir in my time so he lost his chaplain sir but you said he was her previous captain lewrie urged what made captain churchwell previous oh sir proby groaned looking appalled close as brothers they were to each other catercousins from the same county the same social set captain churchwell was as heartbroken as a man whod just lost all his brothers and sisters at a single stroke he threw over his commission due to grief mister proby lewrie frowned well it did take all kinds he felt like saying ill warrant there was a certain amount of grief the cause proby nodded looking seaward once more towards hms proteus to judge how near she was and guilt for he was the one whod jostled talmidge when he slipped and fell and that was an odd thing too in addition to her strange roll the manropes were spankingnew manila hairy as so many badgers and dry as dust the batten steps had been freshtarred with sand scattered for a good foothold no cause for him to slip at all no linseed oil anywhere in sight for him to slip on with hand or foot prickly strands of manila that might have been what he said stung him sir lewrie suggested turning to eye his new ship also sting a lubber sir proby grunted most querulously or sting a ladys soft hands but never a tarryhanded sailor like him had a bears grip he did and all over ropehandling callouses so lewrie shrugged why that night then i recall most vividly him saying that it felt like hed gotten stung by several wasps at once captain lewrie proby told him at the tail end of winter when theyre still anest no he claimed the ship bit him beg pardon lewrie gawped bit him did ysay claimed she hated him and was out to kill him too proby told him shrugging not five days later he wrote admiralty asking for immediate relief aged ten years he appeared as haggard as a dogs dinner unkempt his hair turned grey almost overnight i tell you and fallingdown drunk sir him so abstemious before but in his cups right round the clock afterwards running on deck at all hours claiming he heard voices warning him to leave or die mister ludlow claims he smelled sober in the beginning even when he told the most horrendous fantasies and saw things no one else on deck saw sir turned out the marines to search his cabins more than a few times and claimed there was someone there but nary a sign of an intruder there was he began drinking soon after that after the first two days i think it was babbling to himself weeping before the hands twas a sorry spectacle captain churchwell was when he took the coach back to london never seen a man so shattered in body and soul perhaps he was one of those secret topers mister proby lewrie wondered who hold it well and hide it well does a man play a role well enough in public and dont most people seen more than my share of those too in my time sirproby chuckledclaiming to be the strictest abstainers but experience gives the lie to their lies didnt look the sort that sort of lust for drink will show in a man his age in sea officers more than most as im certain youve noted no sir i may attest to you that this demonic craving for spirits was sudden and the poor devil was quite capsized well perhaps she bit him after all sir in a way bottlebit lewrie could not help saying with a quirky smirk proteus was near nownot a musketshot offand the barge was steering to pass under her outthrust bowsprit and jibboom about ten yards in front of her bows to gain her starboard side there was a thunder of feet as her partial crew was mustered the shrill of bosuns calls to summon a sideparty boat ahoy came a shout from her larboard cathead from the strange midshipman of the harbour watch proteus probys midshipman in the sternsheets cried back to warn them that their caller was not just any officer but her new captain the bowman thrust four fingers in the air showing the number of sidemen to be mustered perhaps she did captain lewrie proby snipped sounding as if he was put off by lewries cynical comment perhaps she did at that and the very oddest thing was sir the poor captain churchwell and the reverend talmidge both sir were angloirish son of an irish peer churchwell was from near drogheda and talmidge the younger son of another gone into the ministry both families were landowning in the large way proby drawled the most extensive estates equal to whole counties with hundreds if not thousands of poor irish tenants absentee landowners most of the time with them living welloff in dublin or london most of the year anglo irish sir protestant folk now were a ship to find her soul and resent her name it just might be that does she prefer something gaelic or celticlike some of this fellow ossians romancingsshe might have resented a protestant english churchman and a tauthanded tartar of a captain hmmm murder perhaps sir lewrie said after hed gotten his jaw rehinged but by someone in the crew one of those united irish im certain youve heard about a sealawyer quota man whod gotten what he thought was an unfair portion of the cat half o that lot are better off in prison or swingin from a gibbet at tyburn one or more of their poorest tenants come into the fleet to find him over them and couldnt resist takin revenge for bein turfed off their little plots all those possibilities were considered captain lewrie but so far there is no plausible explanation oh but shes a wondrous ship sir as lovely as a swan do you not think but who ever knows how a ship will turn out even more unpredictable than children sir and heartbreaking to see them turn off evil to see them fail to be the sort youd wished them to be ships sir mr proby sighed a bit wistfully philosophical i do believe captain lewrie that ships live after a fashion call it heretical or pagan or simpleminded superstition but being round em so many years ive come to believe it mariners suspect it merchant or navy as im certain you do theyre more than oak and iron mister proby aye lewrie was forced to confess my last ship well there was a spirit to her too a kindly one gad you make my skin crawl sir i did not intend to daunt you sir proby insisted as the barge coasted towards the mainchains those suspect boarding battens and manropes there could be a most prosaic explanation for all of the oddities surrounding her aye and it could be lirs work lewrie silently scoffed elves and leprechauns skitterin about with drawn daggers too eeriness just waitn for the next her next victim has he turned on me either way sir this ship has i must avow discovered her spirit early she may be mettlesome but never dull and does she have a will of her own well its the mostwillful stallions make the best chargers youd not take a mare to sea sir a dim gelding no youd prefer a fighter is he tryin tsell me a haunted house lewrie felt like sneering oh dont mind the old spook by the fire hes no bother ghastly hole in the roof but im sure you re the sort appreciates fresh air and im certain you will have the most splendid fortune with her captain lewrie proby concluded as the barges bow thumped on her timbers and the bowman lanced out with his boathook to grab at the chain platform and here we are she plan tmurder me too lewrie wondered as he swung his sword to the back of his left leg stood up and flung back his cloak to show off his epaulet ain t an angloirish landowner so she can forget that score callin me wellchurchedd be a real amusement so thats out is she upset with bein an english frigate well too damn bad maybe we ii get on together he eyed the battens dry as anything freshtarred sprinkled with grit the manropes rove through the eyes of the battens were as white as snow served with red spunyarn just waiting hell maybe im just as much a pagan as any she could wish he told himself as he stepped on the barges gunnl to step over i mean god knows most people who know me well already think so chapter fourteen such a sea of faces he thought even with her just partly manned seamen lubbers idlers and waisters petty officers and their mates on the gundeck below him a double file of marines lined up to either hand just aft of them a scurrilous lot the most of em though he took time to note illclad pastyfaced and filthy in the longclothing theyd worn in gaols or debtors prisons what the seamen among them had used for disguises so they wouldnt be chased by the impress gangs by virtue of the power and authority to us given we do hereby constitute and appoint you captain of his majestys ship he read off speaking in an authoritative semibellow he paused for one anxious second proteus he declared and took a breath before continuing waiting to see if topmasts might come crashing down on him for insulting her hed made his way up her side without harm been saluted on the gangway from the instant his hats vane loomed over the lip of the entryport so far so good willing and requiring you forthwith to go on board and take upon you the charge and command of captain in her accordingly strictly charging all the officers and company belonging to the said ship subordinate to you to behave themselves jointly and severally in their respective employments with all due respect and obedience unto you their said captain and you likewise an odd lot those officers hed just barely met too not quite the most promising at first appearance but then who ever was lewrie sarcastically wondered then here came the phrase he hated the most army commissions were almost like loveletters replete with greetings and spoke of the recipients as trusty and beloved in whom the sovereign reposed especial trust and confidence in your loyalty courage and good conduct the fleet however superior officers for his majestys service hereof nor you nor any of you may fail as you will answer the contrary at your peril and for so doing this shall be your warrant given under our hands and the seal of the office of admiralty this ninth day of may in the thirtyseventh year of his majestys reign lewrie carefully slipped his precious commission document into a folio of other papers and handed it to his coxn andrews then turned to peer once more into that sea of strange new faces that earcocked shuffling pack not many get this chance he carefully began weighing words meanings a spankingnew ship to serve in not a month from the slipways a ship still in search of her heart her soul as young and callow as a spring hatchling and we ii just hope shes not found a spiteful heart he wished to himself feeling the urge to cross his fingers behind his back for luck he noted the grave nods from the older hands the longserving petty officers who knew the nature of ships from those hornyhanded men already clad in slop clothing whom he wished he could mistake for experienced ordinary or able seamen upon whom he could rely a spankingnew captain too he allowed himself to say with no shame in confessing from command of one of the sweetest sloops of war ever you did see you older men you know better than any what makes a new ship come alive from your old ships where you came of age and rate gladsome ships for the most part i trust do you miss them well you just bring our proteus that spirit and well get on well did you come from ships youre glad to see the back of did you fetch along bad habits and bad feelings well overside with em for i will tell you all that im firm but i do trust that im fair as well did some turnover as bad bargains then proteus is your place to start over with a clean slate do you serve her and me chearly then all thats gone before is so much jetsam is that a fair bargain lads men cleared their throats and coughed shuffled their feet and cut their eyes left or right but they also nodded and gave voice to a grudging assent with a chorus of aye sir you newcomeslewrie continued allowing himself to smile again and shaking his head at themoutright volunteerspressed drug off drunk or bashed senseless he waited and heard moans or suppressed titters of bleak amusement from some at their predicament a few louder guffaws from the true sailors at the plight of their new shipmates for the joining bounty or to serve your king and countrylewrie soberedto clear off of trouble or to get out of gaol i could care less either theres an old saw in the fleet that says you shouldna joined if ya cant take a joke and perhaps now you have had a tiny taste o navy life youre wondering what in gods name you got yourselves into hey but no matter where you came from or where the navy found you you start with a clean slate too every man presentthe others well recruit or bring aboard in the coming weeks before we sailwill become sailors he stressed seamen royal navy seamen oh yes well make sailors of you you mark my words fighting sailors who could look the devil in the eye and tell him to go piss himself sailors who can swagger into any tavern the wide world round and be respected no matter where you set out in life no matter what you did before you newcomes is that a fair bargain for you then pathetic really some of them purselipped and too proud too shattered by their comedown some so hangdog morose who stared down at their feet so that it appeared they hadnt heard a word hed said some cuttyeyed and cynical all but ready to spit on the decks in sullen truculence at such a promise when every promise made to them had been broken time and again most though lewrie was happy to see did respond with a whipped puppy eagerness wary but hopeful and as we make you sailors teach you the hard things which you have to know to serve this ship properlylewrie promised themand ill tell you now itll be hard learning ships and the sea are the hardest taskmistresses of any calling and well not have time to be always gentle or as patient as youd probably like well make you something even finer well make shipmates make you seamen so proud of serving in proteus of being known as proteusesor should we call em proteans he pondered unable to resist the urge to stick his tongue firmly in his cheekthat this strange new horde of names and faces will become as familiar to youperhaps as close to youas your own families thats bein shipmates for each other when no one else is for each other when things are bleakest with each other in dangers hour or with each other in the good times shipmates sailors and warriors a fine calling to aspire to no finer name nor sentiment to admire and well do it together me you newcome lads and our experienced hands startin fresh together in this marvelous new ship of ours starting today thats all for now mister ludlow dismiss the people and carry on aye aye sir lieutenant ludlow piped up in a gravely basso lewrie turned his head to look at him sensing something sardonic in his first officers tone of voice a weary amusement from having heard such inspiriting guff once too often from a new captain was it he was a man of about lewries age or perhaps a year or two older wideshouldered and thickset with a seabrowned seawhipped visage half gone to wellworn leather his features were regular enough to be unremarkable but for a sour downturned mouth and a pervading stolidity of manner as if hed seen it all long before heard it all been there and back lewrie could prettywell sense that lt simon ludlow would never be one of those shipmates he d recall with much fondness in later years competent humourless perhaps a bit resentful to be serving a younger man or wary and guarded in their first days of association long as he did a thorough job though it didnt signify his other two lieutenants were a rosier prospect as he got an introduction to them second officer anthony langlie was in his midtwenties and again a fellow of regularenough features to be unremarkablethe sort found in an hundred gunrooms in the navy about as tall as lewrie was long and lean and rangy with romantically curly hair in the newfangled style which had set half the london chickabiddies in a swoon dark curly hair smallish brown eyes set rather far apart under a beetling brow he was all affable and cheery though and seemed the type whod retained a devilmaycare streak beneath his professionalism the third lieutenant lewis wyman was much younger just about as freshhatched as lewrie had deemed the ship and crew for proteus was his first ship as a commission officer he was a gracious puckish lad of twentyone or twentytwo faircomplected and gingerhaired with blue eyes and a my goodness gracious callowness about him as if seeing the sea for the very first time he was half a minnikin at least three inches shorter than lewries fivefootnine and looked fair to being blown away like swans down by their first good gale his handshake though was viselike propercalloused and ropetoughened delighted to be here sir quite lt wyman assured him as he bobbed and grinned unabashedly cheerful lewrie turned to the next fellow his new sailing master mister winwood sir ludlow supplied in a politish rasp your servant sir winwood intoned carefully doffing his hat to him he was youngish for a master perhaps a bit beyond midthirties primmer and of a soberer mien than most of lewries experience with an accent more like squirearchy kentish lewrie assumed at first hearing do we sail waters with which im unfamiliar id expect it to be me your servant mister winwood lewrie allowed with an easy grin oh winwood took time to ponder as if to remind himself that people did now and then make jests of course captain i see your point in falling down the medway to the nore of a certainy lewrie nodded back only done it the once thankee jesus winwood seemed to wince a bit at the blasphemy lewrie asked himself or was it me blabbin how newcome i am god take hold oyer bloody errant tongue and act like a proper captain ought solemn allwise and dyspeptic weil see her safe captain sir winwood declared devoutly earnest rest assured of it with your able guidance mister winwood i harbour no qualms whatsoever lewrie glibly replied more forthrightly and looking him straight in the eye the same able guidance youd have given captain churchwell he added hoping for an inkling into proteuss mystery a sorrowful pity sir winwood nodded him and his chaplain both youd not uhm pardon me for asking sir but will you be carrying a chaplain on ships books as well hadnt planned on it mister winwood lewrie answered keeping a straight face more room for em aboard a ship of the line ah i see sir winwood gloomed sounding a bit crestfallen twos the blasphemy lewrie decided as he turned away to greet another stranger hell praps me soundin cunnythumbed too has to be another o churchwells sort a proper biblethumper leftenant devereux sir ludlow supplied putting stress to the lef as the army and marines pronounced it in charge of our marine contingent and once more sounding almost taunting with that slight oddity of stress it obviously irked devereux for that young officer suffered a tic in one cheek as he was introduced first leftenant blase devereux captain lewrie sir that immaculate worthy added as he doffed his hat msergeant skipwith down yonder corprals oneilhes the one puddinfaced brawler from limerick sir plympton sir our devonian full complement of marines sir forty privates all told devereux offered with a stiffbacked professional air though still managing to sound miffed he was in his latetwenties as elegant and lintless a paragon of marine spitandpolish as any a gentleman lewrie decided at once with a private income in addition to his pay and a grudge gainst ludlow lieutenant devereux sir lewrie said with a faint smile on his face and offering his hand dont mind your marines gettin yer hands dirty now and again do you sir uhm in what manner sir devereux blinked suspicious of common pulleyhauley duties the enforced separation between sailors and marines put aboard to guard against mutiny and disorders was an ever touchy subject the marine complements disdain for shipwork was not to be violatedor the two communities allowed to mingle too freely ive found aboard my previous ships sir that the marines were some of the best shots with the carriageguns lewrie told him did we fight shorthanded sir id admire did the marines practice at artillery drill the quarterdeck carronades pounders swivels uhm well of course sir devereux cautiously allowed not finding any traps in such usage theyd not have to mix with the crew in the waist on the pounder greatguns be allowed to trod a sacred quarterdeck a most sensible suggestion sir and i thank you for your cooperation sir lewrie beamed purser sir mister coote ludlow rumbled your humble servant sir proteuss nipcheese stated all agreeable and welcoming coote was a man in his forties togged out in a plain blue coat and breeches with a red waistcoat and an unadorned black cocked hat he seemed very anxious to please given lewries long suspicion of pussers he wondered what sins that anxiety covered pleased tmake your acquaintance mister coote lewrie said i wonder though sir rock him back on his heels right off lewrie told himself works wonders do they think youre onto em from the very first the hands mister coote lewrie frowned all but making tsktsk duckings your slopclothing is not aboard yet is it thats why the newcomes are still in filthy civilian rags why nossir coote gawped back looking as if he wished hed be able to wring his paws in distress no orders to release anything yet captain lewrie the first lieutenant said to told him to wait sir ludlow snapped til the new captain had come aboard might notve cared for captain churchwells choices sir hammocks and suchve been issued but we were waiting to see how you wished em dressed sir and you now have aboard mister coote lewrie prompted his purser damme it sounds a reasonable decision after all he thought some captains had odd preferences for their mens appearance there was no regulated uniform for people before the mast yet red chequered calico shirts sir coote informed him with a wary glance towards ludlow white duck trousers blue duck blue round jackets black tarred hats sir issue blue sloptrousers then lewrie decided quickly a single pair o white for sunday divisions two pair o blue for seaduty shows less dirt and tar and they wont be spending half their ropeyarn sundays tryin to scrub the whiteuns clean aye sir coote brightened and sir save on soap issue too trying to do their washing with salt water or a wee bucket of fresh now and then a pint a man per day for cleanlinessthat was what was allowed for shaving bathing did any of them actually believe in such an activity or scrubbing exactly mister coote lewrie chuckled neckerchiefs oh see what you may do bout finding some reduns for a distinguishing splash o colour black hats all of a piece mind so the people are as much alike in dress as we can make em right from the first a blue round jacket per man too brass buttons for rated men ive black horn buttons for the rest sir coote enthused very well then mister coote see to it lewrie ordered him and mister ludlow rig the washdeck pumps and make sure the people are sluiced clean o vermin an such have you not already as the slopclothing is issued aye aye sir ludlow agreed or at least it sounded as if he agreed grudgingly did he though then lewrie met the ships surgeon a mr thomas shirley a gangly fellow in his midtwenties and his surgeons mates one was named hodson even younger and greener than shirley little better he himself admitted than an apothecary in training as it were mr durant though was much older and boasted more experience had he been englishborn he might have held shirleys berth but mr durant was йmigrй french landed like a gaffed fish on a strange shore hed wheedled a position from the sick hurt board after two years of effort the only way he had in a leery england to support his family he sketched out for lewries information after trying the charity hospitals and private practice you escaped sir from toulon capitaine durant admitted quel tragique ah i was there aye it was sir lewrie gloomed along with him we left at the same time i should think night before oui capitaine an i know of you durant said what you did for so many royalists you sail away from zere merci capitaine i promise you grateful service oui i count on it sir lewrie replied youll be going to your cabins now sir ludlow supposed get settled in sir no lewrie frowned might as well make the acquaintance of as many warrants as i can have the bosun his mate the master gunner the department heads gather in the waist mister ludlow aye aye sir ludlow answered sounding aggrieved lewrie had to think again what was the mans problem bit more o that and i will really give him a problem tfret over so while andrews padgett and aspinall turnedto aft to erect his furnishings and possessions in the greatcabins lewrie descended to the gundeck admiring his lovely new artillery pieces a crowd of older hands gathered round him the bosun was a mr arthur pendarves a hawkbilled sere fellow from cornwall who looked as if hed spent most of his life squinting at wind and weather as did his mate mr towpenny a shorter spritelier version from bristol mr handcocks the master gunner a tall lean and balding fellow in his middle forties and his mate mr morley who was again younger mr garraway their carpenter mr reyne the sailmaker offley the armourer the yeomen of the sheets who served on the sailtrimming gangways betts and robbins the yeoman of the powder who served in the magazine a man named kever who looked as pasty as if he hadnt left the magazine since his teens the three quartermasters motte austen and oleary hickey a young apprentice sailmakers mate a whole slew of quarter gunnersproteus was rated a full eight pettyofficer gunners dowe ohare and magee who were the quartermasters mates on the helm the gloomy mr neale who was their master at arms and had probably been born gloomy and a brace of ships corporalsburton and ragster and of course they all made the lame jape that that poor fellow was ragsterriches nugent and shoemake the masters mates nugent being another irishman lewrie was beginning to notice that they had more than their fair share of hands aboard from that unhappy and rebellious isle and finally the midshipmenall bloody six of them there were the youngunsmidshipmen elwes and nicholas both about fourteen or fifteen and seemingly sweetnatured and a tad shy there was a midshipman sevier who looked to be around eighteen the sort who would bob and choke on even polite conversation a slightly older and very quickwitted mr adair but being a scot and welleducated in comparison to his english contemporaries he would seem to be witty a mr catterall who was now twentyone a blondhaired wag lewrie could deduce at oncehe was most notably from lanes for all his local accent and finally mr midshipman peacham a tad older in his midtwenties a very tarry customer but one unfortunate in interest or patronage so far he was curtly polite hornyhanded the type of senior midshipman lewrie thought he could depend on from his first impression peacham looked the perfect image of a real tarpaulin man of the most knowledgeable sort and overdue for a lieutenancy he shared a few words with them all taking over an hour or more to do so though he doubted hed be able to recall all those names by am when they rose to scrub decks and begin the ships day he was of the opinion that making the effort to reach out was the main thing not so chearly with them as to be taken for a popularity jack but it never hurt to try and size people up and make them realise that he was not a tacit tyrannical tartar either well gentlemen he shrugged at last i hope you will not take it to heart if i have to ask your names again over the next week too long aboard a smaller ship where after a time oned wish to see just one unfamiliar face until the morrow oh mister pendarves aye sir the bosun replied perking up yet looking guarded once the hands have eat tomorrow well look her over lewrie warned him keel to trucks and me in my worst slopclothing then you may tell me what you lack before we fall downriver well sir hands for workd be my mainest plaint sir mr pendarves told him bluntly recruit or press more hands sir we are in fair shape for stores and such else a tad light on rations keep her draught light for the trip to the nore sir where well stock at sheerness but given fair recruiting here at chatham a few more able or ordinary seamen and a weeks river discipline we could let slip mister pendarves lewrie pressed him for his opinion aye sir could the bosun shrugged almost wincing but lewrie queried closer getting a bit fed up with all the tiptoey responses hed gotten since hed stepped aboard might you think theres a reason not recruitin sir pendarves muttered in a gruff voice taking off his hat to stand like a supplicant labourer at the rear door of his master warrants an petty officers some of their mates an friends a first draught off th receivin ship an capum churchwells men thats all we have sir doubt we find many more willin not here in chatham captain cause o pendarves winced again at being on the spot of being the one to bring bad news oh i see lewrie nodded cocking his head to one side there is her reputation to deal with aye sir thatd be it mainly pendarves flushed many aboard wish they could turn over into a new ship bosun well sir theres more than a few irish aboard hands outa the west country too sir an i know it sounds daft but west country yourself id guess mister pendarves lewrie interjected and received a bob of the bosuns head welsh devonian cornish men who think her cursed men who wish off her some like i say sir pendarves confessed hmmm how well did captain churchwell do at recruiting then lewrie wondered well right awful captain pendarves grimaced for bearing even more bad news onliest volunteers dye see were shipmates come aboard tsail with old friends sir pressed men a few hands turned over from the hulks quota menn such capum churchwell only tried but a few days fore he was uhm when the chaplain drowned give it up i spose right after sir and the first officer mister ludlow lewrie frowned went ashore and tried too did he afterwards after captain churchwell departed a day or two sir but jacks see him comin theyd scamper off fore he could trot out an ale bosun pendarves marvelled that british tars would refuse even free drinks no matter could they sign up or refuse to at a rondy come back two days since an pendarves bit off any trace of criticism of an officer i see lewrie sighed pacing about the deck over to larboard to lay a hand on one of his new blomefield pattern pounders to lean a hip against the guns cascabel and the swell of the breech short of real sailors and too many landsmen lubbers cant crew her with a pack of knownothings right out of gaol unless unless proteus is really a very lucky ship after all mister pendarves lucky sir the bosun came near to openly scoffing youre quite right bosun lewrie grinned shoving off from his resting spot it sounds daft doesnt it superstition or not sailors believe in good and bad luck dont they well aye sir you and me bosun lewrie intimated were seamen weve seen things heard things odd strange unexplainable things and aint it smug o me lewrie chid himself tput us both on the same footing hes more experience in his least finger than ill ever whats her name mister pendarves p proteus sir the bosun answered with a slight pause as if afraid to say it aloud her figurehead sir lewrie all but winked proteus the roman shepherd of the sea greeks called him nereus but either name meant the same seagod a divine oracle he was and there he is in his chariot he drove cross the wide worlds oceans drawn by dolphins and seals mister pendarves seals like l uhm ah bosun pendarves flummoxed afraid to say that fearsome name from his boyhood tales either funny thing about proteus or nereus or whatever he went by a man wished his prophecies he had to find him first then he had to wrestle him hold him so he couldnt get away proteus changed his shape he could become any living thing in the sea dye see sir lewrie intimated further almost crooning as he spun his tale turned into little things so he could swim out of your grasp turned into whales and sharks or ferocious seadragons to frighten you into letting go you had to let him run through his gamut of creatures last of all he was a seal and then a man sir lewrie elaborated not sure from his ancient readings not sure if he wasnt spinning a huge lie hed be caught in by pendarves and the others later for lack of lore like a uhm pendarves goggled eyes blared in wonder by then to hear the ancient tales retold in a slightly different version to hear an officer relate them as if he too believed like he was a selkie sir very like a selkie mister pendarves lewrie beamed as his bosun caught on feeling a dread eldritch chill ascend his spine no matter if he was lying and manipulating or not so how close do you think they really came when they chose her name merlin that wouldve suited her hey but then admiralty changed things at the last second and took that back but that celtic or gaelic sawyer and his wee lad whatd he say to her bosun lewrie leaned close hissing his words in a harsh whisper for security against being too manipulative after all hed seen enough aboard jester of a pagan seagods ways to tread more than a touch wary and he never wished his beliefs or his seeming beliefs to be bandied about and then the touch of that lads merest hand and down the ways she went groaning over it but going lewrie purred seductively did they bless her the right way the old lost way did she accept the name proteus as a huge jape on everyone in spite of them take water and swim the worlds oceans and bedamned to em mister pendarves knowing that proteus nereus or lir it makes no diffrence for theyre all the same longlost forgotten seagod there hed invoked it feeling another shiver of awefear but his tarryhanded stoutthewed bosun had wavered away to the thick base of the mainmast hard by the break of the quarterdeck pendarves laid a hand on the masts antiboarding pike beckets never the mast itself for that was bad luck almost reverently he gazed up its height the convoluted maze of rigging and spars then down at the whiteplaned and sanded deck planksand began a crafty smile it could be as you say sir pendarves said at last swallowing as if he had a massive lump in his throat thatd mean she aint a cursed ship nothing we could print on the recruiting handbills lewrie agreed but could say on the sly at the rondys you and some of the other respected senior hands west country men hmm aye sir pendarves grinned wider brightened by the prospect of a run ashore in the pubs ill see you in the earlyearly then mister pendarves lewrie said in dismissal well give this new ship of ours a thorough inspection warn the others so theyll not show too badly but not so much warning they think they can pull the wool over my eyes hmm a good beginning lewrie rather smugly deemed it after doffing his hat and ascending the larboard ladder to his quarterdeck for a moment of reflection before taking a look at his new greatcabins as long as ive not gone and doomed my arse he thought being too damned boastful or sacrilegious chapter fifteen proteus rounded up coaxed or flatout lied to another fourteen seamen or lubbers from chatham volunteers who were of a mind to take to the sea it was a pitiful result for all of lewries ludlowss and pendarvess efforts at recruiting ashore they were still shy of the ninetyone seamen allotted about a dozen shy of the twentytwo servants who could quickly learn the seamens trade recommended for a vessel of their size and gunpower then the pool of possibles had dried up turning further recruiting i work into frustrating futility it didnt help their cause lewrie mostsourly thought that the mutinies at portsmouth and plymouth were still going on news had come that retired admiral lord howeblack dick the seamans friendwould be coaching down to portsmouth and spithead to negotiate an end to it giving hopes of a final settlement but desperate as england was for closure most men of a mind to volunteer were holding out til the settlement had been reached and what demands the illegal workingmens guilds and underground organisations and the pennytract writers were making to tack onto the settlement with the fleet were inciting even more truculence and resistance to taking the joining bounty when it might be worth more in a fortnight when shipboard conditions and rations might be better there was nothing for it but to work what few they had into the basic stages of river discipline and hope for the best the impress service could not help them and lewries old captain lilycrop wasnt the reg ulating captain of the deptford recruiting district any longer so lewrie was reduced to shaking the staleness off his few experienced hands and drilling a semblance of nautical lore into his woolyheaded newcomers so they could get downriver to sheerness in one piece sheerness and the nore was where theyd find sailors at least more warm bodies who could be driven or bullied into something nigh to sailors the receiving hulks and outdated lineofbattle ships there were crammed full of them admiral buckner the officer commanding at the nore had written back claiming that his static flagship sandwich had a crew of nine hundred with an additional five hundred volunteers aboard as soon as proteus arrived hed be more than happy to ease his overcrowding getting there to lay hold of them though proteus would have to work her way down the crowded teeming bendy medway a river simply heaving with brisk tidal flows crossswept by perverse winds from over marshes and lowlands flanked by reeking mudflats and shoals and the navigable channel reduced to a cartpath by the rapid ebbs which narrow navigable channel was then even more crowded by a myriad of sailing barges scows fishing boats and coasters tenders merchant vessels and other warships all seeking the same precious safe and scant ribbon of deep water proteus could run ashore take the ground and be stuck for days on the shoals or mudflats or halfwreck herself in collision with some other vessel most especially one of those bastardly civilian captains of a towing scow with a long string of barges astern of him who seemed to derive their sole pleasure in life from making things difficult for everybody else or collecting high damages from the smashups lewrie dreaded the necessity but finally had to admit that he had no other choice it was sailand risk his ship and career upon the vagaries of the river and its trafficor admit defeat he had his sailing master in and swotted up every text he possessed which might offer a clue as to how he might pull this off without that careerending disaster he feared so much nought to fear sir mr winwood assured him though looking a trifle askance at just how tarryhanded his new captain really was know the nore like the back o me hand and the river pilotsil see us safe sir a last supper aboard with his officers invited to dine in the greatcabins with his wife children and ward hed borrowed furniture from the officers gunroom to seat everyone and for a man nigh to sweating pistolballs or at least fine buckshot by then it had turned off quite convivial and a most musical evening hed learned by then in his life how to disguise his trepidations and suretogod knew how to be witty and amusing with caroline and her flute he and his moremodest flageolet they had had a round of tunes with their aftersupper brandy and lieutenant wyman had produced his violin at which he was better than passingfair lieutenant langlie of the romantic locks also proved himself to be a vocalist of some ability and while sophie was deprived of her harpsichord she had sung along in an angelically high voice with her eyes ashine in admiration of someone other than the beastly harry embleton for once for several in point of fact young lieutenant wymans musical ability and his infectiously amusing air lieutenant langlies voice and his bronzed featureseven a brace of the older midshipmen for their last time together it had really been quite gay and lewrie and caroline had shared pleased glances that things had gone so well regarding sophie and her brief exposure to a wider world and the variety of young men her age in it sewallis hugh and charlotte had even mostly behaved well though lewrie felt like gritting his teeth and at times allowing himself a snarl or two it was mostly pleasant even with all his professional concerns weighing on him the new ship and crew so demanding of his time and interest lewrie had reached that moment he always reached the one which always made him feel so inhuman so disconnected from what real people should feel and so guilty for his lack the children no matter how delightful or loving had grown to be irksome and he wished for a respite from them and their ados his lovely accomplished wife so graceful and gracious so loving sensible and affectionatea woman most men would kill for as a matewas becoming an intrusion into his thoughts his fretting over manoeuvring proteus seaward of stocking her manning her readying her twas her needs her desires took precedence and her faults and lacksand her forebodingreputationwhich rilled his waking thoughts and made him squirm with desperation to be off and free it didnt help that caroline sensed this as she did so many of his moods by then and could feel the standoffish apartness of a driven man beneath his cheerful exterior sham he was becoming that feckless uncaring and ungrateful boor shed wept about back in anglesgreen the one whod throw off every tie to land and family to dash off at the slightest whiff of tar and salt and it really didnt help his feelings of inhuman boorishness that she was so very bloody good about it not so much accepting their separation or his eagerness for it really as she was bearing uplike a christian martyr whose immolation depended on the timely arrival of a waggonload of kindling saintly she was long suffering sweetnatured temperate and patient to the very end and not letting her true feelings show even for an instantfor the childrens sake for his sake and his careers though she could put more import into a faint sigh than most people could cram down the muzzle of a pounder fortress gun her silent patience irked him by then about as much as the antics of the children go on she as much as said to him be a heartless monster ill grin and bear it no matter how sore you hurt me us but dont you feel the slightest pangs of guilt aye he did which only made him wish that he could fly awayeven sooner or quicker marriages lewrie thought most melancholic as he waved shoreward at them as they stood forlorn but brave atop the kings stairs to watch his departure christ who thought them up had tove been some hermit in a hair shirt his little joke on the rest o mankind or gods more a cynic than we think him the night before theyd said their goodbyes in a final hour of privacy in his quarters hed hugged them all cajoled them all and dried more than one set of tears now once proteus was well on her way downriver caroline would take them all back to london for a last round of sights shows and shopping before returning to anglesgreen their adventures over his however were just beginning and in a most perilous way too the high tide had just begun to ebb and turn from slackwater even though it was an ungodly hour to be up and stirring he had to make the most of that tide it was nippy and cool and the faint hint of sunrise promised a bleak overcast day with a whiff of rain on the light breezes breezes which unfortunately stood from out of the noreast the hands stood at sailhandling posts or about the capstan head their few ships boys and boy servants ready with the nippers to serve the messenger cable to the thighthick mooring hawser a medway river pilot stood by the quartermasters on the wheel clapping his hands for warmth and chatting quite gaily with mr winwood with impatience lewrie could imagine as he listened to those mittened paws slapping together now and again proteus tried to stream downriver with the turning tidal flow her stern pointing something near to noreast the direction the medway ran from chatham until it got to gillingham reach and the sharp bend to the soueast the wind however had just enough force to it to shove her down even under bare poles so that her bows pointed about due west directly against the tide that wind it promised to be an eventful morning dear lord in heaven lewrie thought deciding that prayers might not go too far amiss let me get her down to sheerness safe lady do you have a soul remember i ain t yer enemy you re a ship born and bred and yer proper place is the sea so lets get down there be perverse as ya wish once there but its me or ya get a real bastard for a captain next time christ im daft very well sirs he announced in a voice he thought much too chipper and loud as he turned away from the bulwarks and the sight of his family and wished royal navy captains could cross their fingers for luck in public let us be going even if it is a windward tide they stiffened ceased their whispered morning chatters and the tin mugs of coffee were stashed away so they could be about the demanding business everyone looked so bloody keen and earnest masking the fears they felt lewrie could almost but not quite sympathise would you recommend we tack or wear off the mooring sir he asked of the river pilot bows to windward or alee eitherd suit just as well captain lewrie the pilot replied with a long lazy yawn as if it were no matter to him bows aleed save a spot o labour when we get to the bend but theres bags of sea room alee sir bows aweather youd have to tack at the bend and do you end up instays well there was that lewrie thought trying to tack in the narrow confines ofthe river bend mostlike with a dozen contrary vessels coming upriver and vying for sea room should they not get her bow round shed drift on the tidal current right onto the far shores mudflats hed been reading accounts of how to weather the medway had tried to recall his oneandonly downriver passage from so long before that had been with a helpful beam wind from the westnorwest hed lain awake and schemed played a tiny paper boat model down the river chart when toulon wasnt swatting it halfway to france or peterborough in all imaginable weather conditions this one though was the one hed feared worst almost as bad as a leeward tide with wind and current flowing the same direction which would have had them dragging anchors astern at the trip to keep from being hared along quite out of all control and at a prodigious rate of knots no this crews not welldrilled enough for a proper tack alan sighed feeling his innards shriveling we d muck it sure fate it was bows alee for them and all the sailhandling and helm commands he would give arse backwards back and fill then bows alee lewrie decided aloud nought tfear sir the pilot yawned again easy for him tsay lewrie glowered think im fearful do larboard bowers acockbill by the ringpainter sir ludlow supplied sounding much more agreeable and cooperative this day now he had something nautical and challenging to do or delighting in goading his new captain into folly lewrie could also conjure taking joy from his dithering and delay shankpainters free and weve a streamanchor prepared astern as you ordered sir just in case very well mister ludlow lewrie snapped steeling himself and for a dread blank moment trying to recall what commands to issue and in what order he cast a glance aloft at the commissioning pendant to see how strong the wind was and whether it was steady or not it was firmly out of the noreast dead foul of the tide and river weil sheer her round first gentlemen he pronounced with a nip to his voice helm hardover to larboard hard alee quartermasters streaming back from her mooring buoy by a single cable proteus already had steerageway with that tide sluicing past her rudder and down her sides with the helm hardover to leeward the tide forced her to turn still tethered bringing her stern up into the wind and her bows down towards the lee shores to the south she was held to the permanent mooring buoy by a single hawser up forrud doubled from the starboard hawse hole to the metal ring atop the buoy and back to a belay at fairly middlingstays hed placed mr midshipman adair his best and brightest so far all the way forrud in charge of letting slip mister peacham lewrie barked wheeling to face his eldest of the middies who stood with the afterguard in charge of the mizzenmast stand by to hoist spanker to get her stern round mister ludlow stand ready with the topsls and inner jib up her stern came proteus angling more across the tideway with her stern almost directly into the wind any further and shed snub on that mooring cable lewrie knew fail to wheel far enough sutherly to set sail yet for good or ill they had to let go to trust in the wind and tide to take her and let her get a touch of way on so they could sail her off and not trip over the buoyor drift helplessly to strand her on the south bank soon wait shell snub now lewrie thought drawing in a preparatory breath mister adair let slip he almost screamed the wind had it come almost due aft yet a touch of veering on his left cheek man the captsan haul in smartly now she was free untethered horny bare feet pounded the deck as the hands on the capstan thundered about in a circle breasting to the bars the pawls ratcheting as fast as a trotting horses hooves winding the messenger cable inboard about its drum with the heavier hawser nippered to it that heavy cable groaned and grated through the eye of the hawse hole with no sails aloft proteus was taken by the outflowing tide adrift slowly astern still so slowly turning with her helm hardover and her tons of deadweight too much for the wind on her tall sides her masts and the maze of her rigging there the wind a tiny touch on her larboard quarters hoist away aft mister peacham sheet the spanker hard astarboard mister ludlow lets begin with the foretopsl aye aye sir ludlow piped back all enthusiasm yet sounding dubious in spite of it hoy there let fall the foretopsl brace starboard clews halliards jears an haul away up the yard went from its rest upon the foretop with topmen out on the footropes freeing the brails the clews singing in the blocks to haul the lower corners down to bare them to the wind the canvas rustling and shivering as it began to belly in fits and starts loosefooted proteus was now swinging not quite under control yet drifting and driven by the tideway the spanker forcing her stern down and her bows up so she lay soueasterly almost abeam the river and angling more and more windward mister adair bare the inner jib larboard tack just enough pressure on her bows to keep her from swinging up too far into the wind and getting her foretopsl laid aback on the mast and that muddy dangerous lee shore about as far away as lewrie could spit it seemed main topsl mister ludlow hoist away lewrie pressed for more sail and more control mizzen topsl too but brace her all aback christ he gloomed just about ready to drop the larboard bower and surrender admit he was a fraud give up this nonsense and slink off she was now athwart the tideway beamonto the wind hauled off by that shred of the inner jibs tack for the moment but still making way mostly east which would drift her onto the shore any second did the topsls not fill and come on lady you can do it he groaned to himself god knows im not sure if i can but you hmm though the topsls were now fully alive almost thundering as they were set windfull slackly windfull but bellied out and drawing braced round to be brushed by the wind to shape it and cup it for an instant before it soughed past at an acute angle and proteus began to steady broadside to the wind sailing into the wind and making an awkward course to the noreast still a bit too near that lee shore than lewrie cared for but she was going downriver with the tide her fore and main topsls giving her lift and the mizzen topsl all aback to act as a brake as if she was cocked up to windward fetched to turning a bit too much to windward so mister peacham brail up the spanker to the gaff for a bit lewrie called after a long moment of thought mister adair douse the inner jib for a bit he shouted forrud and without the winds pressure on the spanker to act directly opposite of the usual effect which would normally have swung her bow off she steadied once more a bit more broadside to the wind and the river got i it now i think he told himself bows get too high irehoist the inner jib up forrud and thatll push her bows back down does she trend too far off the wind irehoist the spanker aft makin her sternheavy rudder well hmm what rudder were sailin as fast as the tide so weve no rudder control at all til we reach the river bend and try to haul our wind and sail large to the sou east and if it all goes to shit he assured himself though still a bit more than a tad shuddery we just douse sail and drop anchors do we meet a string o barges or get goin too fast we brace the tops is aback to slow down balance wind gainst tide just sit in one spot for a bit as long as the wind complied and continued out of the noreast it wasquite illogically and most disconcertinglywhat was known as smooth sailing neatly done sir the river pilot drawled with a beamish eye incredible aint it what you can do with a ship do you set your mind to it short handed you may be captain lewrie but youve a talented batch of officers and mates includin yerself sir goes without sayin ah hmm well lewrie cautiously allowed wondering if he was being twitted there was still plenty of river left in which he could come a spectacular cropper dont know what the blaies im about he chid himself never done this in me life dont know damn fraud thisll be the worst stretch sir the pilot went on rocking on the balls of his feet looking as if hed be inclined to sing or hum in another minute no traffic this early it seems once to the bend soueast into gillingham reach well be off the wind on larboard tack inner outer jibs an foretopmast staysl to get her bows down then well fly for a spell tricky bit there sir oh mercy the pilot enthused tricky as anything indeed lewrie snapped feeling more reason for misery traffic for certain in gillingham reach sir the man went on most blithe upriver boats huggin the weather shore and us to cross the reach and hug it too beamreachin the wind for the main channel nasty shoals tloord i can tell ye so ye wont wish to be forced down on em where the channel narrows fore it opens up once more sutherly pass below the shoals is possible but tis fearsome narrow and this tidell be ebbin too quick to trust to it by the time we get there short sharp beat tweather into the northern channel where theres more room id suggest captain lewrie barring the odd lighters and ignorant barge captains hey or some brute of a iiner comin upriver for a refit ha ha no worry though sir well be right as rain right as rain ha ha if i didnt need him so damn much lewrie grimly told himself i think i could most cheerfully kill him uhm mister ludlow sheet home the spanker he instructed instead bleakly taking in their progress taking notice of what lay outboard again were sternhigh aye aye sir he looked aft amazingly chathman and rochester s spires were already far astern the kings stairs unable to be seen hed sailed his family under the horizon and hadnt had the time to give them a final backward glance even a last wave of his hat proteus according to the smallscale chart tacked to the traverse board by the binnacle cabinet was already nearly two miles downriver within a mile of the bend into gillingham reach and making a goodly way on the strengthening tide hed been too busy to notice would still be busy about as busy as a onearmed tavejn wench til they got into the estuary by queenborough within sight of sheerness and the wider mouth of the rivers in the nore anchorage where they could drop anchor at last between the isle of sheppey and the isle of grain he felt a surge of remorse which rose to dominate his worries of handling this strange new ship for ignoring his family so completely yet beneath his qualms from imagining the disaster which still could happen he felt a sense of relief loved and cherished as they were he was free of them freed from their concerns their domestic god yer such a callous bastard he sighed to himself across the lowlands marshes and mudflats the noreast winds brought a faint hint of deeper waters of ocean beyond he was free almost asea once more in a spankingnew frigate with a bit more luck to this short passage hed be at the edge of the sea almost ready for anything whack quickly followed by an outraged yelp lewrie turned to see one of the newcomes in the afterguard on his knees by the weather braces for that backed mizzen topsl mr peacham stood over him with a petty officer close by whacking at his palm with a rope starter gittup ya stewpid git the petty officer snarled youll learn tkeep yer hands off that brace til i tells ya ttail on wornt gonna free it the lubber carped getting back to his feet twoz just seein ow ya tie hit proper ow midshipman peacham cuffed the volunteer on the side of his head sending him sprawling again none of your civilian sauce damn you no back talking to your betters he held out a hand to demand of the petty officer his starter as if he planned to lash the unfortunate to the deck until he learned the other newcomes stood aghast and even the few experienced men of the afterguard looked cuttyeyed over it mister peacham sir lewrie barked a word with you sir peacham put on a bland expression and came to his side dutiful and obedient mister peacham lewrie muttered leaning close so others could not hear were shorthanded and barely a herd much less a crew yet i will allow the bosun and his mates to touch up crewmen when necessary but damme if my midshipmen will lay hands on our people you will not indulge in such again sir do i make my meaning clear to you uh aye sir perfectly clear sir peacham managed to choke out still striving for blandness though seeming appalled by the idea that physical force would be denied him officers are not allowed such lewrie expanded with a growl of displeasure you sir are an officer in training you must learn to enforce discipline and obedience without resorting to violence on your own part thats what the senior hands are for aye aye captain peacham nodded and you will caution your petty officer to save his starter and his fists for worse reasons than a newcomes curiosity lewrie concluded storm battle imminent shipwreck a real cause for haste sir not to preface a warning about accidentally slacking the mizzen weather brace can he not instruct and lead without his starter then ill find myself a likely lad who can you will put him on notice on that head mister peacham firmly and forcefully lead not drive aye aye captain peacham nodded again sounding grave but looking a touch wary of his new commanding officers ways he doffed his hat and departed lewrie whirled about to see if proteus had gone out of control during his intimate tirade but found her drifting along rather nicely still broadsideon to the river and the wind and nearing the bend into gillingham reach there was a small twomaster anchored on the weather shore unable to stem the tide with her sails on that light wind she was far out of the main channel and would present no threat over the waving marsh grasses and stunted trees he could see what he took for a large sailing barge round the bend it was going to get exciting in a minute when we bear up to windward then haul off sir he enquired of the river pilot how much depth is there do we intend to shave the eastern lee shore and avoid yon barge sir bags o water sir til youre within half a cable of shore the pilot breezed off with a wave of his hand in the general direction bargell bear up id expect captain he already sees us and hell not wish to get any further down to loord than he is at present he said then took a halfstep closer to caution were i you sir tis about time to bare the spanker and swing her bows windward ready to haul off and fly once were midchannel of the bend sir mizzen topsl lewrie fretted in a whisper spanish reef til were round and clear of the barge i would sir aye very well mister ludlow hoist the spanker and stand by to brail up the mizzen topsl spanish reefed and ease the weather brace stand by to hoist the inner jib once were off the wind aye aye sir ludlow parroted barking orders through a brass speaking trumpet so thered be no confusion well as little as possible anyway and no chore left undone for lack of hearing that done he turned inboard to look at lewrie waiting for a nod of acknowledgment that his orders were complete and did he barely smirk with one eye cast aft towards the afterguard and that recent incident it could have been innocent lewrie fumed wryness over a newly gettin whomped or was it wryness over me bein soft peacham and ludlow so hed learned in the few days hed had to familiarise himself with ship and crew had served together before and peacham had come aboard on ludlow s recommendation the younger gentlemen volunteers were of the previous captains choosing allowed berths to foster support and interest with patrons damme lewrie fretted is proteus tbe cockerel all over again a pack o brutes ill have to watch like a hawk fore they ruin this ship with starters an the lash beat an cuff this crew right from the start an poison her damme theres mutiny enough in the fleet already for that shitten sort wont they ever brail up mizzen topsl bare the inner jib tack lewrie shouted proteus swung up bows to windward a bit too far for his liking topsls rustling and unable to draw enough wind the tide would carry her about but better wait for it he counseled as his frigate wafted on angled for the centre of the river bend pointed right at that unfortunate barge which was now seen to be towing two empty lighters each with a scrap of lugsail aloft on short masts to help out an eye for the lee shore judging drift to leeward once they turned and helm over quartermasters he cried lee topsl braces lee jib sheets hoist the inner jib hoist spanker proteus began to swing to the right taking the faint breeze on her larboard side the topsls wheeling about and filling once more as the winds found them the mizzen topsl creaking as it pivoted and the spanker filling and whooshing from left to right above the quarterdeck there was a chuckle of water neath her stern round her transom post and her rudder as she began to gather way faster than the tide could draw her missed you by a bloody mile lewrie crowed to himself seeing the barge captain waving a fist and making some very english gestures in his direction as proteus bore off and began to rumble downriver at least two musketshots clear of collision with barge or lighters quartermasters a full point to weather midchannel lewrie instructed once abeam the wind allow nothing to loord aye aye sir nothin tloord mr motte the senior said theres one tricky bit over lewrie congratulated himself now only four or five more tgo til were safe as houses he gave his first officer ludlow another searching glance but he was huddled in his coat roundshouldered and enigmatic once more lewrie turned to spy aft at peacham and the afterguard but could find nothing amiss in that direction either some hurt feelings a touch of sulkiness well do i have potential trouble aboard he assured himself i have time to get it sorted out at the nore cure some newlies ignorance fore sailing further sort out the truly stupid and threemaster in the main channel sir mr winwood hailed with some urgency breastin the tide under all plain sail making leeway of course lewrie winced leaning over the larboard bulwarks to peer out afraid so sir well well try to pass alee of her lewrie said hands firm in the small of his back as he strode back towards the wheel with more confidence in his voice than his innards shes the pilots socalled bags of room to weather quartermaster maintain course but give us a point alee when i call for it no more than a single point mind brace up you bastard he thought else make leeway like a wood chip and well surely collide you shit just shit book three fit fragor aetheris ceu iuppiter arduus arces impulerit imas manus aut neptunia terras there is a crash as though jupiter had risen in might and overthrown the citadels of heaven or neptune s arm had rocked the foundations of the world argonautica book v valerius flaccus chapter sixteen gloomy damn place lewrie sighed to himself as he emerged on the quarterdeck by his private aftercompanionway ladder abaft of the greatcabins coachtop it had rained during the night after theyd dropped anchor and though it was now midmay the wind had a bite to it hed allowed himself a full bottle of burgundy with his solitary supper a stout brandy before and two glasses of a good aged port out of that tengallon barricoe hed bought at fortnum masons to celebrate a safe arrival off sheerness to settle his nerves in point of fact his nerves had gotten so steadysomewhere following cheese and sweet biscuitsthat hed been temporarily immobilised aspinall and andrews had had to pour him into his hanging bedcot but he felt hed more than earned his overimbibing proteus lay safely anchored just off garrison point her heaviest bestbower down with a streamanchor astern to keep her from fouling another ship should the wind or tide take her before going aft to his lone celebration hed summoned the crew to gather round the break of the quarterdeck had congratulated them for a safe passage downriver had joshed them gently on things that had gone wrong and had pointed out how to improve then he had ordered a bullock slaughtered for their supper and had ordered splice the mainbrace to make an extra issue of rum wont always be thus hed cautioned them once at sea we wont make such jolly distinctions proper performance of duty will be expected as commonplace then well only celebrate surviving a storm the taking of a rich prize or beating the bejesus out of the french depressing he griped to himself wringing the already thick sheaf of official paperwork between his handsmeaning both his head from taking aboard his load of spirits the previous evening and the sight of sheerness and the tossing nore besides they were about equal for depressing low muddy shoaling and windswept and even a bright day of sunshine probably couldnt make sheerness any fairer a prospect it was a garrison town a warehousing and dockyard town ringed with forts which usually fell early to any foe who tried to enter the thames or medway stopping them was the job of the moresubstantial forts at the many tight bends in the thames or medway further upriver the ships assembled here were not organised in a proper fleet flotilla or squadron they were just here because the nore and sheerness were at the mouth of the thames and medway near enough to london and the many shipbuilding and armaments industries in the capitals environs to supply them at little cost in shipping dozens of ships he noted taking a deep breath of clean air as he waited for his gig to be reported ready dozens of warships he corrected himself there were night on an hundred or more merchantmen close at hand waiting for a suitable wind and tide to proceed up the thames to the pool of london and the thousands of cargohandling docks or waiting for a windshift to carry them seaward to join a convoy forming in the downs fullrigged ships oceangoing vessels deepladen with treasures the lofty indiamen or packets from the caribbean coasters and colliers filled with fish coal timber pig iron tin wool bales of manufactured clothing or shoes from other small ports in the british isles and trading smacks loaded with oysters or poultry eager to be first to market for a hungry citythey were all here or off on the horizon streaming dense as poured treacle from night anchorages off the leigh sands the warp and the maplin sands up the queens channel along the yantlet flats even the short way round from the whitstable oyster beds up the shallow narrow oaze to the swale from faversham behind the medway boom to queenborough hed prefer had he his indolent druthers to sleep in nurse his indulgent head and curl up with a good book and a warm cat but there were duty calls he must make this dreary nippy morning upon viceadmiral charles buckner for one the officer in command of hm ships and vessels in the river medway and at the buoy of the nore to give his full titlewho had promised to solve his manpower shortage and upon the commissioner of hm dockyards at sheerness captain francis john hartwell to arrange the lading of the tons upon tons of supplies due proteus to put her in full fig bags of biscuit kegs of saltmeats waxed cheeses dried peas ground flour by the boatload the powder and shot and cartridge cloth to fill her magazines and whatever his purser mr coote might wish to stow below for later she was even short of rum wine and small beer at the moment and afloat above her load waterline de boat be ready sah andrews reported at last very well lets be going lewrie sighed stuffing his paperwork into a sewn sailcloth haversack slung over his shoulder beneath his boatcloak and wishing hed had time for another restoring pot of coffee things went well ashore buckner was an old fellow welcoming as could be asked for though seeming troubled lewrie put that down to his being in charge of everything and nothing for he had no command over the warships gathered in the nore only with an eye to fitting them manning them making repairs and passing them on to other units hed had some good news even so the semaphore telegraph had wagged the news that admiral howes negotations with the mutineers at spithead were going well and a final solution now looked very likely one which i trust admiral buckner had sighed will settle the grievances once and for all not only for channel fleet but with the mutineers at plymouth too captain lewrie and uhm a closerun thing there was some fighting at spithead aboard a few ships nothing too drastic but the sort of thing which might have caused a violent rebellion had it spread spread much wider dye see something akin to the culloden business sir lewrie had asked feeling a tad more perceptive by then viceadmiral buckner had had a large coffee pot at hand and had been most liberal in sharing captains acting a bit too forcefully engaging in perfidious twofaced dealings aye buckner had nodded captains were forced to uhm back down in the face of resistance sensibly i must allow the retention of a single ship the return of a vessel or two to proper order could never balance against the rancour incitedamong vessels beyond portsmouth buckner had most mystifyingly hinted dye mean here at the nore sir or at great yarmouth too there have been uhm letters of grievances sent me lewrieso far from individual shipsrequesting shoreleave back pay food issues much like the demands of the spithead mutineers the removal of certain officers and mates they deem tyrannical or overly harsh aye buckner had gloomed and lewrie had realised that his troubled mien was due to more than his usual travails nothing organised so far and pray jesus when word of settlement arrives as i am mortalcertain we will receive in a few more days the terms and conditions will be mollifying throughout the navy a sloop of war named jester was not cited as one of the ships where violence erupted was she sir ah no captain lewrie i do not recall any mention of that ship your last command i suspect sir rest easy on that head at the least now sir how many men did you say you desired my my the last task of his days work away from proteus with a precious letter from viceadmiral buckner and his regulating captain of the impress service safely in hand he went aboard hms sandwich to pick up more seamen hopefully and some more warm bodies to fill in the gaps in his watchandquarter bills he stopped to pick up lieutenant ludlow to go along with him to aid him in the choosing sandwich was crammed far beyond his most horrid imaginings it reeked like an abattoir despite being scrubbed daily the sickly foetid reek of a hospital ward where hopelessly sick or wounded men were left to perish in their own good time as buckners flagship she was fully manned ostensibly fit for sea at a days notice stocked and stored and armed for battle not one hour out to sea against any dutch ships which might try the thames and medway again as they had in wars of the previous century but shed been saddled with hundreds more newcomes and recently impressed sailors with all the other receiving ships already full with others buckner had been specific that they must choose from among the potential hands aboard sandwich not the other hulks to reduce the odours lewrie suspected most cynically when he made his rare appearances aboard her god they were a villainous lot hed thought that the people whod greeted him aboard proteus had approached villainous but this crowd gave villainous a whole new aspect not only were they clad in rags and greasy civilian clothes the most of them but they shivered in bare feet bare shins devoid of stockings and even the ones who gave the appearance of nautical experience could barely boast of a single thin shirt and a pair of torn stained sloptrousers a neckkerchief or a hat of any description they smelled like a corpses armpit emitting a sour cloud of steam from being pent so close and thick below decks and freshly exposed to the cool open airs some were speckled with a host of rashmarks fleas licebites saltwater boils and ulcers that had grown large as the wens and buboes seen with the black death doddering oldsters pitifully shivering children barely in their teens longhaired greyhaired gaptoothed as miserable an assortment of wretchedness as ever hed imagined this is captain lewrie of the proteus frigate sandwichs officer shouted to the hundred or so gathered amidships he is come for willing hands a frigate lads now wholl step forward to volunteer for her anyone nought of you willing to serve your king and country in a fine tall frigate damme lewrie looked at the faces glaring back at him most wearing an utter blankness a weariness beyond all reckoning of the opportunity he offered here and there were younger fitter faces men with straight backs and clean limbs a few whod retained their clothing and tried to keep themselves in better order he hoped some of them might step forward god what a potmess ludlow sniped ready to spit on deck and be done with the lot of them not one of em better than what a cropsick houndd spew up their issue slops sir where are they lewrie asked lord sir sandwichs lieutenant sneered then in a loud voice to their facesgutter scum such as them improvident drunkards such as them sir sold or gambled em away with no thought for the morrow like all their lot do thout youd beat some sense into em weakeruns well mayhap the tougher stole em blind captain lewrie be the first to admit such happens the officer shrugged as if it was of no matter to him what these recruits did amongst themselves real sailors are so rare now sir we have to settle for the hopeless shit such as these whod rob shipmates hey you lot no more dawdling lets have some of you step forward and volunteer fore we choose you by throwin rocks a moment sir lewrie snapped his neck burning with anger at the lieutenants choice of words of being such a cruel bastard i would like to address them your surgeon has cleared them i trust aye sir i spose the lieutenant allowed hed not thought to fetch his own surgeon mr shirley along he had not expected however to be presented with a spectacle such as these poor wretches you men he began those sailors among you far back in the rear there suspicious id imagine he chuckled proteus is a frigate and you know what that means shes fast wellarmed and has more deck space and mess space than other ships so you wont be living with two other bastards elbows in your eyes offwatch and a frigate means prizemoney to the devil with shipsoftheline like sandwich shell never catch anything but a frigate will ive been lucky with prizemoney in my last ship and so my peopleve been too theres frigatemen come home so rich they bought new pocket watches then fried em in lard in public just for the hell of it proteus is a spankingnew frigate too just come down from the chatham yard not a month in commission you lubbers you know what that means do you she doesnt stink fresh clean paint and tar sweetsmelling timbers nothing rotting in the bilges and as pretty as a brandnew house a fast ship a proud ship i will sir someone in the back called out though several sneered at him for sounding so eager he came forward a slim young man with a nervous smile that showed he had most of his teeth mash sir topman sir ill volunteer for her very well mash lewrie beamed any mates of yours able to hand reef and steer serve a gun back yonder any others wish to ship with mash then he called out he saw a pair of likely men shrug and pick up their seabags to shuffle through the press of men and also volunteer martyn sir one husky brute said ordnry seaman sir lucas sir said a blondhaired teen topman sir bannister sir claimed a whipthin dark ferrety lad i done a voyager two but aint rated ordnary yet good though we can use you and thankee bannister lewrie said clapping him on the shoulder as he passed to stand to one side any other sailors or watermen of a mind to get out of this hellship get clean again eat decent rations again me sir a wee lad about sewalliss age and size piped up in a falsetto come on da he said to the man who stood behind him with his hands on his shoulders be tgether whats your name lad lewrie grinned the boy didnt look like much of a sailor but at least he was enthusiastic and he hoped that enthusiasm might spread grace splease ye sir the boy tentatively smiled back youre kin lewrie asked the elder man behind him hoping that the lad wasnt the grownups plaything grace sir the man said he was withered ropy and wiry and looked as if hed spent his life on the water somewhere had us our own fishin smack outa whitstable but she went down back durin the winter an all theyd owned mostlike lewrie surmised and once lost they had laboured for others for a tenth of the income theyd made on their own bottom for friends neighbors or no tis me grandson capum sir the elder admitted with pride he was greyhaired missing some teeth but appeared sound in wind and limb never sailed board a big ship all me born days sir me an me son too here he said indicating a third possibility but young grace middle grace and elder grace aye lewrie nodded three pay certificates for the one household then men aye reckon itd help sir well volunteer f r yer frigate the middle one allowed as he gathered up his few pitiful possessions more began to come forward though some lewrie and ludlow had to turn away they were too spindly too weak and hacking with coughs or covered with sores some just too shifty and cuttyeyedtoo old too young even for ships servants and how the impress service had hoped to justify dredging them up lewrie couldnt begin to fathom bennett sir then peacock and thornton humphries and inman and slocombe and sugden grainger and brough only half were sailors or could even charitably admit they were on a firstname basis with a basin of water but every sound man was more than welcome spooner signed aboard then richard then brahms german are you brahms lewrie asked crikey me a dutchie sir the east end londoner guffawed two older fellows came up both with hard hands of common labourers now fallen on hard times drink or a faint brush with the law smyth sir one said cloaked in a blanket and little else with a wye sir essemmwyeteehaich rumbold sir the other announced this one almost bald with but a monkish fringe of whiteish hair above his prominent jug ears i was a waggoner sir know some bout ropes an such better than those who dont know ropes or knots rumbold lewrie assured him steering him towards the growing clutch of men by the lower entryport some smaller younger lads just into their teens volunteered fit for servants now later they could train them aloft as budding topmen soon as they fed them back to where their ribs didnt show that is and hosed them down under a washdeck pump so they would no longer resemble a pack of chimneysweeps apprentices a frigate dye say sor a man dared to ask from the middle of the remaining horde them as go swift as th very birds sor a frigate aye lewrie responded put a bit on his guard by the mans deep irish brogue as if he didnt already have enough of those on his books already hed hoped in the far east of england to scrape up mostly english sailors lord ludlow sneered in harsh voice paddies all brawn and no wits can we not be a little choosier captain sir furfy i am sir and that proud id be tget off this prisonbarge yer honour me an me mates too furfy boasted elbowing at some others near him we aint sailors nossir but were strong as yer officer says and fit sir eager tlearn of a mind to join your mate furfy are you men lewne asked kavanaugh

ragged and shapeless farm hat a black irishman with ebon hair and blue eyes mind your manners you boggish cur ludlow snapped not him sir beggin yer pardon too much the skylarkin sealawyer to me any skills desmond lewrie enquired despite the caution i read some write some taught others some sir fiddler play nillean pipes songs an stories figure cyphers an numbers and a strong back when all else fails me sir bit o th auld harp a sealawyer as i said sir ludlow sneered one step shy of the gallows ill warrant a hopeless drunkard too mostlike faith sir desmond began to protest with a smile on his face but what man alived say no to a drop o th ill go into her sir someone from the far side announced as he clambered up from below dragging his possessions in a hammockroll and a seabag he stepped forward to doff a tarred round flatbrim sailors hat this one at least had kept the bulk of his issue kit and was dressed in worn faded mended but clean seamans clothes and looked to be a real tarpaulin hand in his middle thirties he wore a full beard and mustache despite the fashion for being smoothshavenperhaps to conceal the hint of a dark red scar which sketched his left cheek and the tinge of blueblackness which stained his facea flareup from a powder charge or a burst from a guns barrel as the fellow had sponged out in a previous battle bales sir the bearded fellow reported crisply standing at an easy attention with his head up quite unlike the remaining volunteers hunched hopeless shiverings able seaman sir and a middling good gunner sir bales hey lewrie grinned in pleasure had an old captain named bales howd the other recruiters miss you bales just come aboard last evening sir is why the man replied turned over from hussar sirpaid off at deptford good well take you bales lewrie decided join with the others yonder now desmond lewrie said turning back to the irishman any useful skills strength for th hard labour sir desmond admitted still chipper even under ludlow s glare but wit enough tlearn a sailors trade a stout an willin heart sir an ever a cheery disposition for any task ye put me fell in with furfy an th lads an id hate tpart from em sir be left behind amournin like th auld song goes capum one sword at leaest thy right shall guard oone faithful harup shall praise thee desmond actually sang out in a high clear tenor which old song is that you cite desmond lewrie chuckled why tis th auld minstrel boy sir desmond replied well minstrel boy you dont wish to part from your mates then im not the one to turn my nose up at a real live volunteer go join em and be ready to transfer over to proteus i thankee from th bottom o me heart sir that i do volunteer desmond boomed doffing his hat once more and bowing from his waist he plucked up his small bundle of belongings tied up in a threadbare shirt and dashed to rejoin his friends before lewrie could change his mind despite lt ludlows grunts of disapproval they winnowed a few more and came within five hands of the full number of ninetyone seamen or young teens who could be trained as seamen and made up most of their lack in lubbers waisters and servantsthose stout but stupid too old to send aloft they could use anyone who could serve on the gangways to haul in teams on halliards braces liftlines clews buntlines or jears or serve the guns on the runout tackles to drive them up a sloping deck to the gunports there were no others aboard sandwich even remotely healthy or suitable and more than a few that even made lewrie feel a twinge now and then of suspicion of a criminal background hed done what he could to man his ship and get her ready for sea now according to captain hartwell he might have as long as two weeks before receiving orders to sail and join some squadron of ships where proteus like all fast frigates was all too rare and desperately needed it would be up to his officers and petty officers from here on out to drive lead drag or harangue them into a crew all three of his ships boats were working as were a brace from sandwich to ferry the new hands over to her lewrie stood by the rail with a faint smile on his face thinking how discomfited his purser mr coote would be hed have to issue the most of the newcomes a fresh set of slopclothing plates spoons shoes blankets when theyd already lost gambled away or sold a first issue and his books would be as badly out of joint as his nose lewrie was mortalcertain as he made his way to the entryport to take a salute from hms sandwichs sideparty he felt he had good reason for another celebratory indulgence with his supper that evening for one hed missed his midday meal for all his errands for a second hed succeeded at one more vital step in making proteus a serviceable warship safeguarding his precious commission into her and third hed found a way to put a pusser in a bad mood not bad for a days work he decided chapter seventeen bloody gloomy damnplace lewrie thought even more grimly the next morning it was overcast a touch windy and both seas and skies were fretfully grey sheerness hadnt blossomed overnight eitherit was still the same lowlying pile of crowded warehouses manufacturies and houses crammed together anyoldhow only the sea walls and the bulkheads which elevated it above the high tide made it look substantial and fortified and he already had a discipline problem he had barely shaved and scrubbed his face and neck in a liberal basin of shore water sat down to his breakfast of fried eggs a hash of bacon and shredded potatoes and freshbaked shore bread when he heard a commotion without the gundeck entry to his quarters he slurped up a scalding portion of coffee took a morsel of jammed and buttered toast and chewed quickly before the marine sentrys musket butt thundered on the deck planking first off cer sah enter lewrie managed to mumble past his tasty quid allowing himself as much bile into his voice as he wished for such an illtimed interruption of his few moments of morning calm morning sir ludlow grunted ducking his head to clear the overhead deck beams with his hat under his arm beg treport captain three men on charges one for theft sir tother two for the fight that resulted who are they then lewrie sighed scowling over the rim of his cup thief was landsman haslip sir caught dipping into landsman furfys seabag landsman desmond caught him at it and they both lit into him sir god help the poor bastard then lewrie shrugged remembering that this fellow haslip was a puny shifty runt with the air of a practiced gaolbird whilst the newcomes furfy and desmond were burlier younger and furfy had fists the size of middling pot roasts haslip still breathin is he theres a wonder mister ludlow looks like a freshskinned rabbit sir ludlow told him but without a trace of humour which that remark might have drawn from him ships corporals attempted to intervene captain but those paddies wouldnt have it and took a swing or two at burton and ragster sir shit lewrie frowned laying down his fork told you we should have been choosy sirbout taking those damned irish aboard ludlow grumbled nothing but trouble the lot of f em their whole bloody shiftless race gloomy he said it but with a trace of glee for being proved to be correct hiding it damned well he must have thought to himself but lewrie glared back at him irish yankee doodles cuffies or bloody tattooed savages mister ludlow lewrie barked now theyre ours it doesnt signify discipline and punishment are the same well treat them all the same too no matter where a hand springs from aye aye sir ludlow nodded with a trace of weariness and sir lewrie griped you may suggest all you wish long as its for the common good but sir youll not take that doubtful tone with me or play i told you so hear me sir aye aye sir ludlow cheeped all obedient though with his eyes slitting either in surprise or distaste well discuss this later sir lewrie told him as for our offenders ill hold mast at two bells of the forenoon warn your midshipmen or mates to be ready to testify about their behaviour good or ill along with the ships corporals very good sir ill do it directly sir ludlow said as he bowed his way out lewrie picked up his knife and fork and began dining once more toulon jumped up on the table with a prefatory ummph to sniff lift one paw as he sat and fan the air as if begging with his mournfully abused face on mew he barely managed as if too famished to ask aspinall hasnt this cat had his breakfast yet aye e has sir his servant said leaning out from the pantry wiping his hands on a stained dishclout three strips o bacon all by hisself an thought well o th tattyhash too sir well damme fetch his plate aspinall lewrie sighed i think another dabd do him mister padgett aye sir his clerk replied from aft in his daycabin look up landsman haslip in ships books see if hes a quota man or how he was recruited lewrie directed as aspinall returned with the small bowl which toulon usually ate from with another heap of hash from the sideboard in it hmmm another dollop for me as well aspinall its maintasty this morning lewrie said taking a pleasureable moment to watch his ramcat tuck in most daintily not a full day aboard and youre already in trouble lads lewrie pretended to sneer at furfy and desmond who stood hatless and hangdog before his desk did they read the articles of war to you aboard sandwich or once you were in the impress tender yessir they muttered unable to look him in the eyes read us a power o whereases aye sir furfy expanded article the twentythird lads lewrie intoned says that no one shall quarrel or fight in the ship nor use reproachful or provoking speeches tending to make any quarrel or disturbance upon pain of imprisonment or whatever punishment i think fit now proteus is still in port this could dye wish it be sent ashore for court martial but i dont think youd kke that much would you uh nossir no yer honour sir they cringed the court martial jack was already flying across the harbour as a board of postcaptains off some of the lineofbattle ships convened to deal with a whole raft of malefactors aboard hms inflexible an old storesship this morning formal chargesd put you in irons cooped up in another ships brig mongst strangers lewrie informed them might take days before they got round to your case he forced himself to glower hot furfys use of yer honour sir told him the bulky fellow had been in the dock before and your triald go bout as fast as havin yerself a hedgewhore in out repeat if necessary now do you insist on your rights then nossir no so please yer honour sir now then lewrie sighed leaning back in his chair goin for haslip that i can understand a thief caught redhanded by his shipmates deserves a thrashing theres none worse to have aboard a ship than a thief whod steal from his own kind but once the ships corporals came to break it up you should have stopped right there dye hear me you caught him well and good theyd have taken over brought him to me on charges and youd have been blameless see it would be up to ships justice my justice from then on like youd turned him over to the charlies or the bow street runners in london you will not continue to thump him tget your own back you will not take a poke or two at burton and ragster the captain of your working party a petty officer or midshipman know why you idiots allow me to point out article the twentyfirst none shall presume to quarrel with his superior officer upon pain of j severe punishment nor strike any suchupon pain of death or otherwise as a court martial shall find the matter to deserve never will you lay hands on those above you or even back talk em now do you get it my pretties oh arra furfy groaned turning pale lord save us sir we desmond wavered looking likeabout to faint in dread they read it to you you should have known lewrie cut him off there is no excuse for it most especially ignorance landsman furfy landsman desmond i find you guilty of refusing to cease fighting of disobeying lawful orders to desist and of quarrelling with a superior since however you are only a week in the navy and less than a day aboard proteus i will this once mind be lenient do you ever come before me again in violation of article the twentyfirst i will have you triced up and flogged bloody raw as for now they blanched shared a worried look then turned their gaze on him all but quivering in their shoes ten days bread and water ten days deprived of rum wine or even small beer bread to be ships biscuit not tommy no tobacco either and you will both serve as hammockmen to the ships corporals for those ten days atop your other duties fetchin scrubbin and scourin their laundry and such no rum no wine no beer no tobacco to ease their idle hours it was a death blow and to survive on water and biscuit when every other man was eating shorebread fresh meat from shore dismissed lewrie snapped now for landsman haslip mister ludlow aye aye sir ludlow nodded there it was againanother querulous note in his voice that hinted of disapproval of leniency for furfy and desmond what hed wished for was the maximum of twodozen lashes pass the word for landsman haslip to present himself he barked at the marine inside the greatcabin passin tword fer landsman haslip the outer sentry echoed then there came the sounds of cheering a chorus of hip hip hooray which made lewrie turn up the corners of his mouth with wry amusement the crew must have been on the irishmens side in the matter and were expressing satisfaction for his lenient sentence despite the risk they ran to dare approve or disapprove a first sign of spirit in this new crew of his he wondered no he thought a moment later as a scrubbedup haslip was led in from the gundeck past his diningcoach chartspace and pantry it wasnt coming from proteuss forecastle it was too far off for that and sounded as if it was getting louder as if it was coming from a great many ships at the same time he furrowed his brows and rose from his desk to discover what holiday might elicit such cheers from every warship at the nore dissonant and unorganised mister ludlow we miss something restoration day perhaps dont know sir ludlow puzzled not restoration day for certain thats not for offcer th watch mister wyman sah the outer gundeck sentry cried slamming his musket butt with the crash of an explosion and the tone of his shout more urgent than paradeground captain lieutenant wyman gasped as he burst in almost wringing his hat in his hands his complexion flushed its mutiny sir the nore too every ship sir hands cheering in the rigging plain battle flags flying and yard ropes rove sir bloody lewrie yelped as if stung he dashed forrud to see for himself careening off haslip and his marine guards out upon the gundeck up a ladder to the quarterdeck to peer out hatless and suddenly breathless from more than haste he lunged for the binnacle rack for a telescope then froze for it really wasnt necessary sandwich latona inflexible champion a gunner the old storesship grampus every lineofbattle ship every vessel in the nore and they all flew the red mutiny flags sported damnable yard ropes from their course and topsl spars in fact hms proteus was about the only royal navy vessel that didnt christ not here too lewrie felt like wailing lord sir whatll we do lieutenant wyman almost begged now there was a good question if lewried ever heard one chapter eighteen his first instinct was to beat to quarters to load and run out his artillery raise the antiboarding nets open the arms chests and prepare his crew to defend the ship until they could get sail on her and escape the anchorage but so far proteus had spent most of her time in river discipline at the rawest basicsknots tracing the rigging the making or tending of sail anchor and cable work striking and raising topmasts or hoisting boats off the crossdeck beams lowering them overside and then recovering them along with some practical oarwork about the harbour or mooring until he had formed a full crew he hadnt planned on tellingoff gun crews so only the seamen with previous experience were adept at gunnery practice that would have been part of this new weeks curriculum hed hoped now though short of rations water firewood powder and shot proteus had only one chance of being swept up in mutiny flee at once escape the nore and try to make good her lacks at another royal dockyard mister pendarves he shouted mister devereux here sir the marine officer called back from the quarterdeck already immaculately turned out in full kit turn out your marines sir at once lewrie snarled armed mind to the teeth captain the bosun queried from below in the waist bosun pipe all hands muster hands to man the capstan then prepare to make sail lewrie called down to him were leaving harbour quick as we can if you have to cut the bower and kedge away so be it pendarvess silver call began to peep and shrill joined by the sounds from his junior towpennys feet shod or bare began to drum on the oaken decks as the crew responded to their summons racing from below to mill and bleat in confusion some knew the call and went to their proper stations at once others the freshcaught landsmen had the civilian penchant for chattering about it before being collared by the yeomen or detail captains berated shoved fisted or started to their proper positions spry young topmen clambered aloft up the ratlines and out over the futtock shrouds to the fighting tops beyond to the topsl yards to scoot out precariously on the footropes to loose harbour gaskets and brails to free sails lewrie took time to have another gander round the anchorage a cutter was stroking for proteuss larboard entryport filled with seamen from hms sandwich whose rigging was filled with cheering sailors glass mister nicholas lewrie demanded of the sweetnatured fourteenyear old midshipman who was near the binnacle cabinet darting eyes about in wideeyed wonder as devereuxs drummer began a long roll and a fife joined the urgent shrieks of the bosuns calls the lad fetched him a telescope damme not a night glass mister nicholas lewrie howled with impatience after one look through the telescope which unlike the day glasses turned everything upsidedown and backwards here sir midshipman elwes fetched a substitute having seen nicholass mistake and corrected it better lewrie thought taking a peek at the oncoming boat well not really damme no midshipman steerin eight oarsmen nigh on a dozen more aboard armed hed seen the spikey danger of erect musket barrels the gleam of wan sunlight on fixed bayonets and bared cutlass blades mister devereux a file of your men to guard the entryport lewrie shouted no one from yonder cutter is tbe allowed aboard aye aye sir corprl plympton shoot if you have to lewrie fretted in a loud voice there was a sentiment in the navy that officers captains especially should ever strive to maintain the disposition of a stoic no matter how dire the circumstances that they should present the world a calm unruffled demeanour reassuring those under them to behave properly should a tidal wave arise to swamp their ship and take them all down to perdition a proper captain should pull out his pocket watch stare at it glumly and announce ah right on time not alan lewrie unfortunately andrews fetch me my hat he bade to his coxn who stood by the top of the aftercompanionway ladder to his private quarters my sword and the doublebarrel pistols too aye aye sah andrews said hustling below at once the cutter was about a single musket shot away from them coming fast lewrie turned to look inboard at his crew on the gangways and the capstan ready sir pendarves reported hands at stations for leavin harbour very well mister pendarves mister ludlow set a buoy on the kedge anchor and haul us in to short stays on the bower stand ready to make sail aye sir ludlow barked mister peacham free the kedge buoy the bitter end o the cable forrud there fleet the messenger to the capstan nippermen ready breast to the bars the younger lads brought the lighter dry messenger cable out took threeandahalf turns about the capstan drum and fastened the nippers to the much thicker anchor cable which could never be reeled in directly bars were dropped into the pigeonholes and three men to each bar facedto placed their hands in front and below the bars with thumbs out and up to avoid pinching shoved their chests against the bars and stood poised to begin shoving to wind the messenger in but that was all they did that was as far as they went sir midshipman peacham yawped from back aft i four men of the afterguard stood about the jear bitts to which the light kedge cable was warped protecting it from being undone goddammit lewrie growled mister langlie go aft assist mister peacham let go the kedge cable buoy bedamned nossir some loud naysayer shouted what he screeched in total goggling disbelief nossir the master gunner mr handcocks had dared to mount to the quarterdeck with his mate mr morley behind him and the yeoman of the powder that pale spook kever in tow we wont be sailin sir damn you mister handcocks get your arse back on the gundeck at once therell be no mutiny in this ship but there is captain handcocks disagreed in almost a reasonable voice of amiable idle disagreement were decided the nore will support the grievances o the spithead lads mister devereux you will clear the quarterdeck lewrie said to his marine officer place any hand who resists making sail under arrest you can start with mister handcocks aye sir devereux snapped drawing his slim sword corpral oneil seize those men uh wellsir uh corporal oneil waffled still standing at attention with his musket by his side don reckon i kin do that sir cant obey that order sir you bloody what it was lieutenant devereuxs turn to yelp wont raise hands gainst no man sir not til termsre all agreed at portsmouth maintain proper order sir but the marine blushed his tongue tangling over unfamiliar concepts shrugging helplessly looking to his squad of privates for eloquence hoy the boat corporal plympton was shouting to the cutter as it came alongside levelling his musket down at an extreme angle to aim at the men he thought were leaders sheer off youre not tcome aboard dye hear me sir itd be best were ya thand over the keys tth arms chests fore someone gets hurt for no call captain sir handcocks suggested with his hand out as if lewrie had the precious keys on him ill be damned if i do mister handcocks lewrie shot back at him try and take em and ill make sure they hang you higher than haman get below where you belong you buggers lt ludlow roared stepping forward to cuff mr morley and the wispy kever shoving them towards the larboard quarterdeck ladder lay hands on me and youll swing at execution dock dont he cautioned handcocks who had raised his fists and a belaying pin to defend his minions do ye disobey youre gallowsmeat he lunged and shoved handcocks back to join his followers then drew his sword but there were other sailors dashing for the quarterdeck with belaying pins in their hands boarding pikes stripped from the chained beckets about the base of the masts some were surrounding the marines by the entryport shouting in their ears overbearing and daunting them pressing so close they had no room in which to lower their muskets or draw their hangers andrews lewrie bellowed daring to glance aft to see if his coxn had fetched his weapons yet damn he sagged andrews was back on deck so was aspinall and his clerk mr padgett all with their hands bound and clasped firmly in the grip of mutineers from the afterguard midshipman peacham and lt langlie were off to one side closely surrounded by others who still would not dare actually lay hands on them but hemmed them in so snugly they had no room to defend themselves or take a single step either pipes were shrilling urgently panicky and the gundeck seethed with arguments pro and con with the whines of the dazed and confused and cheering as the passengers from the cutter below the entryport got aboard despite lewries orders despite the musketarmed marines who were either disarmed by now or firmly aligned with the mutiny to begin with mustering to a new leader man the yards lads one of the newcomers was crying waving a cutlass in the air reeve yard ropes aloft dy hear there break out the battle flags from the taffrail lockers you lot declare for the cause be quick about it huzzah for sailors rights huzzah please sirs handcocks interrupted do ya sheathe them swords mister ludlow leptent devereux sir yer outnumbered no call for violence ships ours now sirs samez tothers wont make no point weve the artillery handcocks gestured to the guns one of those brutal pounden carriage guns had been rolled back from its port freed of its tackles and secured to other deck ringbolts aimed aft at the door to lewries cabins lighter pounder swivel guns sprouted from their stanchions along the gangwayspointed aft and inboard seamen stood by them fondling cartridge bags of grapeshot and canister which they had yet to ram down the muzzles grapeshot and canister which could scour the quarterdeck or gundeck cleaner than a billiards table was there any resistance or disruption they didnt look particularly glad about itbut they were standing ready with flintlocks fitted and the trigger cords in their hands damn you all lewrie snarled whirling about to face the men nearest him the uneasy marines who still held weapons the sailors who sported belaying pins crowlevers or rammers from the quarterdeck guns boarding pikes marlingspikes tarpaying loggerheads or clasp knives admiral lord howe is in portsmouth to settle things they may be settled as we speak come on lads dont do this any man proved a mutineer in arms laying hands on superiors threatening superiors will hang when this is over drop your weapons go back to your stations and submit to orders sorry sir cant do that just yet handcocks disputed in a sad tone not til word comes from portsmouth not til all grievancesre satisfied what they demand we want too captain sir and we wont obey orders tsail do we not take hands with the other lads well theres a chance we wont be included in the settlement dye see like it only applies tthem not us oh dont be a complete fool mister handcocks lewrie sneered portsmouth plymouth thats half the fleet in home waters dont you think admiralty needs this over quick as dammit all of it over of course itll be navywide if theyve any bloody sense he thought hoping he wasnt lying wouldnt be so sure o that lads the wellarmed stranger from the cutter shouted barging his way through the press to confront lewrie with his drawn cutlass in his hand and a brace of pistols in his waistband cheeseparin bastardsd starve us tdeath fore we see a shillin moren necessary congratulations mates you stood up an took her like real men soonz ya saw th red banners an proved faithful tth cause he orated flinging his arms about to brandish his sword bellowing to be heard huzzah brother seamen cheer now lads hiphiphooray they did rather more lustily than lewrie expected though there were an encouraging number who only went through the motions unwilling sadly though he also noted more than a minority eagerly at the halliards lowering the red ensign to replace it with the plain battle flag or out on the courseyards tips reeving ropes to which hanging nooses could quickly be bent now then brothers the squat stranger cajoled now then lewrie countered quickly you can get your arse off my bloody quarterdeck and put that damn cutlass away fore you hurt yourself oh ill sheathe sir the stranger rasped looking sly do these tyrant officers sheathe alike ill let em keep em for now how bloody gracious of you lewrie sneered so adrip with acid that most within earshot were forced to laugh aye longz they stow em below in their cabins an appear on deck unarmed sir youre the captain i take it sir here see me do it sir im sheatin my cutlass now an im requestin yer officers do the same lewrie looked at ludlow and devereux they were glaring panting with anger and outrage ludlow looked glazedover ready to lash out devereuxs slyer eyes were calm halfslitted darting about for an opening or an advantage hed be the more scientific fighter did that come the more dangerous ludlow though was about to go off at halfcock draw blood out of rage and thatd mister ludlow lewrie said in a captains proper stoic tone in the face of overwhelming opposition i request that you put your sword away as the master gunner said there is no call for you to perish without a chance to alter the situation or aggravate it he hinted lieutenant devereux my pardons sir but i have to ask the same of you i would not have you fall needlessly sir very well captain devereux sighed sounding disappointed as he released the watchspring tension of his body with an exhalation that sounded like a deflating pigbladder rose an inch or so from the taut crouch hed held and flourished his sword in a circle before he sheathed it gaining a bit of his own back by making the nearer mutineers flinch from its wickedly sharp tip mister ludlow lewrie was forced to insist gahh ludlow spat making a chopping motion with his sword out of sheer frustration damn you all yer scum fuckin scum damn fools ill see you all in chains ill break the lot of you signed your death warrants ya have every last mothers son but ludlow raised his scabbard and clumsily stabbed at it to jab his swordtip into it and ram it home he glared at lewrie with ultimate scorn and bloody murder on his phyz never thought id see the day a royal navy captaind just give up his ship at the first whim o cutthroats an trash ludlow snarled as he turned away to stomp his way below shoving the close press apart with his shoulders glaring defiance and muttering dire imprecations see how th proudre brought low lads an tyrants banished the stranger hooted least yer captains sensible fuck you too lewrie hissed back with an evil grin thomas mccann sir able seaman an youre captain lewrie i am mccann lewrie grudgingly allowed tautlipped heard o ye we have mccann leered called the ramcat i heardtell fightin captain not so cruel an highnose proudz some though ye all are firm but fair hah dont mean disrespect sir do you not mccann alan scoffed does this not delegatesve decided sir mccann ploughed on oblivious to lewries scorn officers behave they wont be discomfited ships discipline tbe maintained officers warrants mates

comes from portsmouth that them bloodsuckers at admiraltys declared all our demandsre met sir mccann ranted with an odd look to his eyes that all brother seamen been victorious do ye see as a caution like so none o usre ordered tfight brother sailors at spithead or plymouth an we know for certain were included in th terms an them bastards wont betray us our cause is just i tell ye their grievancesre ours too mccann all but raved christ im dealing with a bloody lunatick lewrie realised sos we dont get betrayed like them cullodens someone back in the crowd crowed pay more pay howled another fairer share o prizemoney suggested another proper rations an honest weights shore leave wheneer we wish bigger rum ration they gabbled turn out th villains put over us like ludlow lash em bloody then turn em out it dissolved into a bedlam of things they wanted their shouts blending into a brutish cacophony even less musical then the baying of wolves til their inchoate roars became a general lusty cheering it had to peter out after a while and it did though mccann and several others pumped their arms like orchestra leaders to sustain it now sir mccann leered ill be havin th keys to th arms chests lewrie looked at him askance cocking his head to one side he looked aloft at those new flags flying from every mast as if bemused he took time to study the gloss of his boots clasped his hands behind his back no he said at last i dont think so now lookee here sir dont ye mccann blustered didnt you just say that no violence would be offered mccann lewrie said deadlevel serious that means the crew has no need for weapons doesnt it did you not say that proper order and discipline and respect for officers will be maintained in normal usage the arms chests would be locked anyway therefore unless you break your word and lay hands on me rifle my possessions or put a knife to my throat the keys will stay in my possession you claim to hold proteus already therefore you dont need weapons no sir i refuse to hand the keys over to you totally but mccann blubbered his eyes almost crossed in concentration sputtering and bending to mutter with his fellow mutineers to try and find some loophole in the logic of lewries statement or make sense of such highflown breakteeth speech instead he turned on handcocks morley and kever urging them to do something damme was i in proteus id have th arms chest keys mtcann screeched then stomped off towards the entryport dragging his coterie of fellow mutineers with him glowering cursing and muttering much as lt ludlow had just moments before were allowed to carry on with a normal ships work day mister handcocks lewrie demanded of his chief mutineer well aye sir handcocks blushed looking cuttyeyed i take it you think you are now in command of proteus lewrie scoffed you will allow me to resume my hearing on landsman haslip we may man the boats and ferry supplies from shore sir uhm let me ask captain sir handcocks mumbled slinking off to join the group of sandwiches by the entryport who were still deep in a frustrated conversation over the keys mister coote you here sir lewrie asked turning about aye sir a shaken coote replied i spose stand ready to go ashore mister langlie with lieutenant ludlow off the quarterdeck do you take charge of the forenoon watch telloff men to assist the purser ashore mister pendarves lewrie bellowed down to the gundeck assemble working parties to ferry stores offshore aye aye sir pendarves shouted back looking about as forlorn as a landed trout and eager for a command from a proper authority now look here sir mccann snapped returning reinforced by his own followers from sandwich and the proteus mutineer leaders proteus must be stocked with four months supplies for sea lewrie informed him soberly were short of saltmeat flour biscuit small beer rum wine cheeses dried peas portable soup presently she has but half the powder and shot required now sir do you say youre loyal britons mutinying for your grievances and not traitorous rebels in the pay of foreign foes then readying this ship for sea does the mutiny end and were ordered out to fight the dutch or the french is vital a normal ships routine which you just said you would not interfere with surely even you can see that gawd i wish mccann gargled raising a fist ye an yer sort yer all alike thinkin yer so damn clever an smug i short of rations powder and shot mate bales hinted from the rear of the pack elbowing and sidling forward to stand alongside mccann do they cut us off from the warehouses in sheerness whatll we do then think ont whatll we eat til its settled th peoplere for us th common folkd not let em mccann countered eyes bulging with fervour th high an mightyll tremble in their beds do they even try tcut us off the whole nation arise aye though we should stock her gunndeep the gunner sighed just in case like right then mccann sneered sensing another defeat within a fiveminute span go head an stock her but no midshipmen none o their brutal sortre twork th boats senior hands loyal men on th tillers an oars brothers tth cause no escape for th weak them as wont swear tuphold th cause neither very good then lewrie nodded striving to not look as glad as he felt that he was dealing with a witless escapee from bedlam i assume normal duties also encompasses my hearing for landsman haslip mister pendarves muster boatcrews we will go below nossir ye wont mccann barked well do it mans a thief stole from brother sailors so hell get sailors justice an no boatcrews tgo ashore til yeve elected yer delegates handcocks picked yer committee board ship for runnin her an delegates tth committee board sandwich he nudged handcocks under the ribs an weed out them asd cozen ye have evry manjack in an make em swear on a bible tbe loyal or else no lewrie insisted once more quite flatly and pinching at the bridge of his nose as if wearied beyond endurance now lookee mccann threatened going wildeyed again justice is mine mccann lewrie pointed out determining the crime and punishment for it board this ship is the captains prerogative alone and well you know it you assure me and the others that this mutiny will end when the grievances are satisfactorily settled and ships at the nore are included in the terms thats what you told my crew to get them to join you thats what you profess it is mccann shouted back then once you return to subordination and discipline you will once more be under a captains supervision which includes hearing any violations of the articles of war or admiralty regulations lewrie hammered home to unsurp my right to hear and judge haslip will make any sentence you and the delegates decide illegal unless you or some one of you he growled searching the nearest faces for defiance wish to declare himself a commission officer and presume to issue orders then the custom and usage of the sea service says that i alone can judge you can go below and do all the electing you wish to choose your delegates but you will not usurp my power of command or my right to conduct captains mast arrr mccann howled with frustration a pox on ye an th devil take all officers i wish tgod we could just hang ye all an be done choose newuns an start fresh by god frightfully there were more than one or two growls of agreement from the men mustered before him thankfully though they seemed to be sandwiches not proteuses bales the newcome mutineer even went so far as to take mccann by the elbow and whisper in his ear to warn him to temper his remarks or hide his true sentiments mutiny was one thing lewrie thought turning to match eyes with his remaining officers mutiny with the threat of physical violence or the murder of superiors was different lewrie thought to compare the almostdignified soberheaded truculence of what hed experienced at portsmoutha much more respectful and respectable plea for better conditionswith the very beginnings of this version which was led he suspected by a whole baying pack of hotheads like this mccann if so it was a damn narrow razors edge hed have to tread before this was over oddly lt langlie was looking back at him with the tiniest of grins on his face the one corner of his mouth turned up all but tipping him a conspiratorial wink of encouragement he shrugged back his perplexity and his gratitude for langlies silent support right then mccann announced quite grudgingly much taken down from his rant of the short minute before yer a commission sea officer mast on this haslip bastard is yours but well choose who we will for delegates get yer whole crew firm bhind us and what of those who dont wish to swear allegiance with you mccann lewrie asked feeling suddenly pleased that hed regained a tiny bit of authority in the midst of raving chaos already scheming as to how he might undermine this particular mutiny aboard his ship bligh over yonder alan said gesturing towards hms director a gunner cross the harbour had his loyal hands who went in the longboat with him even him he snorted in derision you cant just force everyone to be loyal to you if they dont wish to or are too fearful of the consequences as you should be he stuck on slyly oh god yes he thought hull the buggers make em sweat ah but isnt that what yoz and the navy do sir able seaman bales justasslyly japed make em loyal without a chance to choose for themselves the nearby mutineers had themselves a real kneeslapping hoot at that one and passed it on along the gangways down into the waist and aft to the taffrails to their mates where it elicited the same mirth lewries face suffused with sudden anger that hed been bested by an unexpected opponent by an unlookedfor fount of wits whatever shred of authority hed wished to salvage whatever doubts hed wished to plant in them were ripped away in a twinkling torn to atoms this is over ill see you swing in tar an chains you smarmy bastard lewrie swore to himself you and mccann most of all we ii let you know when were done sir bales smirked with an air as if he had already been elected leader and was taking charge when were ready to send boats to the storehouse wharves justz soon as weve chosen delegates captain and i for my part seaman bales lewrie gritted back will expect the crew to muster aft to witness punishment when order them to no matter where you are in your elections hear me oh aye sir were looking forward to that bales grinned twelve men for th ship mind mccann advised as he followed them remaining on the gangway so he could depart through the entryport and go off to cause even more mischief aboard other ships two for th fleet committee tmeet aboard sandwich an one captain no matter his highanmightiness right brothers mccann was departing shouting a last set of encouraging words to the crew in general and pumping baless hand quite vigourously theres a viper in our breast no error lewrie gravelled in a bleak mood and me that chose him special damme what a fool i was he must be one of the chief plotters planted on us as a sham volunteer just so he could stir em up to mischief uh sah andrews suggested in a low voice after a bashful cough into his fist jus one feller come aboard las night sah e couldna stirred em up much not dot quick scheme musta been afestrin fo some time mong some o de lads we got at chatham even fore we got em capum aye youre probably right andrews lewrie had to admit to his coxn damme whats the world coming to what next a total civilian rebellion too there was no answer to that one or nothing anyone would ever dare put into words he looked outboard seeking salvation like a marooned sailor on a desert isle might scan the horizon for a scrap of topsls which might mean rescue but there was no cause for hope in sight every ship at the nore new the plain red flags of rebellion every ship now sported yard ropes boats full of senior officers were streaming from inflexible steered by their personal coxswains rowed by their personal boatcrews rushing too late to reclaim the commands theyd lost signal flags flapped busily from the roof of the dockyard commissioners house and from viceadmiral buckners shore residence the semaphore tower on garrison point was talking in a flurry of whirling arms to the next station at queenborough thence across the f low country to gadshill or beacon hill near chatham from there the news would now be flashed in a matter of minutes to swanscombe station near greenhithe alerting the tilbury river forts then on to shooters hill about equidistant between the royal arsenal at woolwich and greenwich naval hospitalto new cross west square on the south bank of the thames and at last across the river to admiralty informing their lords commissioners that another entire bloody ad hoc fleet had been lostto mutiny chapter nineteen permission to enter the gunroom sir lewrie announced with a cough into his fist as he stood by the berthdeck portal which led to his officers quarters normally the gunroom was a holyofholies offlimits to all but those who lodged there their personal hammockmen or bodyservants their cook or tableservants captains were included in the banned category since they had their own greatcabins one deck above equal in size to the hull space shared by eight or more men below them the enforced separation allowed them a haven of peace and quiet from the tumult of a working vessel from the wrath of a demanding captain the sight of the common seamen usually he waited one brow up in demand as lt ludlow took his sweet time mulling over the heathenish idea of allowing him into their sanctuary filling the doorway set into the insubstantial dealandcanvas bulkhead partition which was more a token of privacy than real aye sir come in sir ludlow nodded at last stepping to one side he did not say that lewrie was welcome though thankee mister ludlow lewrie said forcing himself to act pleasant as he stepped inside his hat under his arm ah all here i see gentlemen our middies too langlie wyman mr winwood the sailing master surgeon shirley purser coote and marine lieutenant devereux filled the seats down both sides of their mess table the chair at the head of the table was ludlow s now empty there was an eighth chair available but lewrie would not go f any further towards upsetting the gunrooms wellrun order by taking it besides it was at the viceend of the table below the saltand a place for those inferior to ludlow lewrie walked slowly aft giving the midshipmen who were perched on the sideboard or were forced to stand alean against the interior partitions an encouraging smile or two might you do us the honour of partaking in a glass of brandy sir lt langlie offered lewrie could see that at least one bottle had already been rendered a dead soldier on its side atop the table with a fresh one already halfdrained beside it thankee mister langlie and i do appreciate the offer and the gunrooms hospitality but no lewrie told him pleasantly bit early in the day for me dye see on a sensible day mind proceed though yourselves dont let my presence discourage your cheer i thought it best did we put our heads together informally he began to explain summoning you to my cabins might have raised the suspicions of our socalled committee might have made them refuse to allow it and damn em all root and branch midshipman peacham growled at that with his glass halfway to his lips ungrateful pigs the committee had elected a dozen hands to run the ship chosen the master gunner mr handcocks and his mate morley to represent her aboard the flagship of the mutiny and had requested that watchstanding officers and midshipmen go below offduty and remain out of sight unless there was an evolution to perform and had chosen that blackguard able seaman bales to be their temporary captain in charge of proteus until the seamens grievances had been answered and the mutiny was declared over and bales chose a day of rope yarn sunday and celebration in place of those chores of lading ship hed been so insistent upon two hours before leaving the officers with nothing to do and no reason to stay on deck in the presence of their mutinous inferiors listen to em ludlow spat reaching for the halffull bottle caterwaulin an caperin proteus thrummed to the stamp of feet as their mutineers danced their joy clapped and sang rowdy songs to the music of the fiddle and the fife and the songs echoed faintly as far as the gunroom through those insubstantial screens quite clever of em lewrie snapped take a day of rest to cajole the unconvinced like we do at a recruiting rondy to beguile em to join in the first place have em all in their pockets fore dark ludlow gloomed i dont think so mister ludlow lewrie disagreed that is the reason im here so we may decide what to do tomorrow when they begin to face reality hopefully they are enough in league with spithead to remain in a form of discipline and discipline bah ludlow griped most sourly ive seen it sir you have not lewrie snapped at his first officer badly as he needed the support of all of his officers lewrie would most gladly have pitched ludlow overboard being attable with a drink in his hand in his own sanctum sanctorum was making his first lieutenant even less guarded with his opinions he suspected i beg your pardon sir ludlow stiffened eyeing him owlish and halfseasover with brandy do proceed sir weve a new crew lewrie ploughed on trying to ignore that latest jape they havent formed cliques yet you saw how it was on deck a middlin pack of determined men reinforced by the hands who came aboard from sandwich christ almighty we only got our last thirty or so yesterday and i doubt that bales is the only one linked to the plot any of the others strike you as sealawyers dressed well kept their kit tmake themselves look more desirable as volunteers some of the irish sir midshipman elwes suggested in a wary piping surrounded by other nodding sage heads too shy to speak up united irishmen aye mister elwes lewrie was quick to agree with the lad and reward him with a smile sworn to drive us out of their island waitin for the bloody frogs to land and arm them we have to be wary of that lot not all of our irishmen id suspect a halfdozen at best and the rest following along so far uhm lt wyman said raising his hand like a schoolboy would there not be more than a few hands still loyal sir but outnumbered and cowed exactly mister wyman lewrie congratulated him now weve not been thrown together with our crew that long either but i do trust you have already discovered the characters of most in that short time we have to make up lists scribble down those in your watches or divisions you suspect a second list of those you think might be caught in the middlethose who havent thrown their lot in with the leaders and could still be swayed those we might be able to work on do they ever give us the chance though captain lieutenant ludlow all but sneered at their pleasure dammit all this bales fellow lewrie said pacing down the length of the table towards ludlow s end thinking again about sinewy fingers tightening about some rancourous bastards throatmost specifically this cavilling bastards windpipe and squeeiing glaring ludlow to a drinksodden blessedly cowed silence for a moment he was the one suggested we have to be laden with rations and powder and shot lewrie smirked for whatever ends he had in mind and this ship cant proceed to sea thout we have the opportunity to train the hands further innocent evolutions and drills which give us the chance to make out lists three lists gentlemen one of the true ringleaders we most suspect and those people in league with em he ticked off on his fingers second a list of those still loyal the third the sheep in the middle a day or two of watchin close takin note of them like you were thinkin of rating them for a promotion will suffice take strolls on deck for the air if nothing else then put your heads together and well convene meetings like this to go over the lists an invitation to some of you to dine in with me might seem a plausible excuse some music he grinned slyly and saw his officers and midshipmen gather a bit of hope in the midst of what seemed a hopeless situation and when we do organise working parties to lade stores sir lt langlie snickered well have even more opportunity to sift them out separate the sheep from the goats as it were once again exactly mister langlie lewrie chuckled chat them up put on a pleased expression no matter your personal thoughts firm but fair agreeable and affable as if you hold no grudges over their betrayal seem to agree with em sir peacham gasped absolutely not sir lewrie snarled you are to do nothing to encourage or abet the mutiny no winking at it no the best pose to strike i should think would be tolerance and patience as a father might towards wayward children tolerate no disrespect any threats god report em to this bales character stand on your dignity and your rights because once this is over theyll be under your discipline again and they dont wish to do anything which may be remembered hmm were somewhat assured that theyre going to show respect to officers and petty officers or discipline those who break that rule themselves report them to bales sir midshipman nicholas gawped eyes wide with astonishment and looking more than a little lost or as lewrie suspected more than a little befuddled by the gunrooms booze hes declared himself temporary captain mister nicholas lewrie sighed whyever not hes taken the responsibility for any infractions by the crew upon himself for the nonce like spithead i expect our mutineers will declare that theyre loyal and true blue hearts of oak just waitin for their demands to be met those at spithead said theyd maintain sobriety and good order among themselves the yard ropes werent a threat to officers there sirs they hoisted em to keep their own kind in line my old crew told me id suspect though sir langlie said most shrewdly we will be tested sore fore this is done deliberate taunts and japes twill demand a power of patience from us all do you not believe amen mister langlie lewrie nodded from all of us sirs he said trying to lock eyes with all of them in turn lt ludlow most especially but ludlow was busy picking at lint on his cuffs anger im afraid is forbidden us public threats taunts and gibes are denied us as well we cant curse them back to obedience but he cautioned a sly word whispered in the right ear once youve discovered the right ears may sow seeds of doubt and fear in em reminders that once this ends were back in charge and well remember the names of those who were complete traitors and rogues encouragement for those who didnt join hands with em and encouragement to those wavering so we can take the ship back sir sailing master winwood at last commented he looked quite worried if it comes to it sir lewrie nodded grim but admiral howes gone to portsmouth it may be no more than a few days turmoil here before we hear that spithead and plymouth have been settled and the nore will then have no grievances to complain of and this mutiny will collapse of its own the settlement will mostlike apply fleetwide mister winwood something else to remind em of sirs when we are back on deck givin orders even temporarily remind em to wait til they hear the settlement before they do something theyd regret if thats all they have in mind sir mr coote sighed i truly do hope thats all they have in mind united irishmen though revolutionaries even amongst good englishmen who wish to emulate the french republic i know mister coote lewrie shrugged but for now were assured it concerns rations shore leave pay and such have to take that at face value til they prove us wrong that is do we pray that is not the case sir the surgeon mr shirley groaned that they prove that supposition wrong that is indeed lewrie said hands in the small of his back rocking on the balls of his feet something else to smoak out gentleman when youre allowed on deck keep your ears cocked for any talk among the hands that sounds rebellious dangerously rebellious republican cant theres a chance theres more to this than the stated causes we must hope that those who hold such traitorous views are distinctly in the minority and the bulk of the hands are to be warned to guard themselves against being led to greater folly sir lt devereux supposed aloud anything that so much as smacks of paris or thomas paine most shrewdly noted sir lewrie said with a half bow to the wits of his marine officer they declare themselves loyal englishmen asking for but a tuppence of their due anything else though hid it wellenough from us ludlow countered slurring his words by thenthe backstabbin bastards whos tsay what theyre hidin from us now hey thats hey sir mister ludlow lewrie hissed and i will thank you to remember it damn him he thought ive just about had all i can take from this fool might as well be in league with the mutineers for all the good he is to me ruinin the good mood i created look at em now cringin likewhipped puppies when just a second ago they were eager to start cajolin the people well begin making preliminary lists sir lt langlie said quickly right lads who to approach first and well keep our ears and eyes open sir as you ordered all of us sir very good mister langlie lewrie relented forcing himself to grin in gratitude i know i am a very fortunate captain to have a set of officers on whom i may completely rely he told them with another so there glare at ludlow as he sprawled at the table insensible to almost everything by then keep our own counsel marine lt devereux added glowering significantly first at ludlow then at some others and most especially our tempers in the doing captain sir thankee mister devereux thank you all lewrie said now i will plague you no longer and i am grateful for you allowing me to interrupt your offduty time i will have my coxn send down written invitations to dine with me tonight once youve made first stabs at winnowing our chaff hmm good day gentlemen good day sir they chorused rising as he departed ludlow even managed to stagger to his feet with a bit of help lewrie emerged on the gundeck took a deep breath of air and scowled at his crew gathered in the waist beneath the boattier beams they were still dancing hornpipes slapping time with their hands on their thighs beating time with stacks of spoons as the fiddler and the marine fifers supplied the tune he saw the black irishman desmond strangling what looked to be a longnecked cat making a reedy wailing over a flutelike tube that must be what he called uillean pipes softer and mellower than their blaring scots cousins everyone seemed to be having a grand time except for landsman haslip of course he had been left where hed fallen and was still being studiously ignored by his shipmates lewrie climbed to the quarterdeck feeling a bit smug about how hed handled that problem hed found him guilty oј theft doomed him to a dozen lashes and also broken up the elections of delegates by having all hands aft to witness punishment piped a neat little homily hed preached about crime and sailors who were unworthy of being called shipmates the sort never to be trusted hed seen at least a dozen sets of teeth grinding in the mouths of the most dedicated mutineersand had begun a short list of his own then after haslip had taken his dozen lashes from the catwielded most enthusiastically by bosun pendarves and his mates in the place of authorityhed turned haslip over to the crew ive given him my dozen lewrie had declared but a rogue of his stripe will only resent me and authority for it now hes yours prove that you wont tolerate a thief form a gauntlet theyd leapt to it forming two lines facing each other fists and ropeends ready and haslip had been dragged from the hatch grating back bloody and wailing in pain bosun pendarves stood ahead of him with a cutlass leveled at haslips breast so hed be forced to a slow pace and not run down the gauntlet quickly if he didnt want to be skewered haslip had been pummeled and bludgeoned beaten senseless shrieking and cowering from their blows a dash of salt water to wash the catoninetails cuts as he lay prostrate a surgeons mate with warm tar to daub his wounds normally once punishment was done the malefactors mates would help him below sneak him a tot of rum tell him how well hed borne up but not for haslip pray god lewrie thought studying his cavorting crew theyve no use for this mutiny once news comes from portsmouth either he cocked his head as desmond on his odd pipes and the fiddler began a new tune lewrie smiled to realise it was the same one that his father sir hugo had marched his militia to the bowld soldier boy some of his men looked up at him as if cocking a snook at him with that irish air waiting for his reaction they were disappointed if they thought he would mottle or glower with anger though for his right hand began to beat the measure on the caprail of the quarterdeck nettings toulon intrigued leapt from out of nowhere to preen arch and pace the rolled hammocks stowed in the nettings as lewrie petted him with his other hand and smiled in spite of himself desmond furfy a few others nodded back at him even tentatively smiled twas a faint sign but a hopeful one lewrie dared think chapter twenty no thisun wasnt the same sort of mutiny as the one hed seen at portsmouth lewrie decided early on there was nothing orderly or even sane about it the frigate san fiorenio had come in all tricked out in holiday best to bear the newlywed princess charlotte and her princely german groom over to the continent for their honeymoon when san fiorenio had balked and attempted to sail free shed been fired upon her rigging cut up by solid shot moments later shed reluctantly decided to enlist in the cause of their socalled brother seamen the fleet delegates had also moved eight small gunboats from the little nore anchorage into the great nore to secure their weaponry for their own use on their way out all of them had fired their artillery at the shore forts again with solid roundshot perhaps it was to show the mutineers resolve to the admiralty and its local officials or a first round lewrie feared to spur the beginning of a nationwide rebellion certainly they werent celebration shots not with solid ball newsa mere rumor so farhad come from london that admiral lord howe had succeeded in negotiating a settlement of the original spithead mutiny working parties ferrying supplies from shore had come back whooping and hollering with delight over the tidings portsmouth and plymouth the entire channel fleet were said to be returned to discipline and duty word was black dick and his ladywife had gotten a fete their carriage unhorsed and drawn through portsmouth s streets to the towns largest inn by teams of grateful sailors where howe had dinedin the chief mutineers and drunk toasts with themas matey as anyone could ask for yet so far in sheerness and the nore those rumored tidings hadnt done much to ease the fervour of the newest mutineers if anything news of a peaceful agreeable settlement had only sparked a new wave of frolic riotous street parading and shore drinkingbut no hint of acceptance of a settlement here so for another morning lewrie studied the shore with a glass so close off garrison point he could all but taste the meat and drink sailors done with meetings at checquers public house their chosen shore rendezvous paraded the streets tricked out in red cockades and waving their infernal plain red flags of rebellion each large group had its hired band and the sounds of competing melodies blended into an atonal jollity as one pack collided with another with a rival band and simply had to outtootle outblare or outdrum the others even atop the ramparts of the shore forts drunken sailors could be seentroublingly arminarm with equally drunken soldiers or hanging with arms round each others necks swaying and singing airs respectable citizens of sheerness lewrie didnt doubt were all inside behind locked doors huddled over their silver plate and valuables yet the streets were full of garish trulls and sharpers poorer civilians out for a good time as long as it lasted or secret traitors and rebels of republican bent out to stir up even worse troubles children and women also capered and danced with the sailors there was a chance they were legitimate wives come down to sheerness to support their sailor menfolk or as lewrie also sourly surmised whores out to make a killing off the myriad of sailors given liberal amounts of shore leave for a rare once not that they had to go ashore for that lewrie sighed as he lowered his telescope and collapsed its tubes publicans and pedlars bumboats plied the harbour waters ferrying cargoes of gewgaws out to the ships proffering the temporary wives to seamen who had coin enough to support and claim them without a strict watch set by the bosun and harbour watches he was mortalcertain every doxy bore small flasks of spirits under her gowns inside her stockings or hat to sell in spite of the fleet delegates edict against private spirits oh proteus was a merry ship music wafted up from the seamens mess deck from the forecastle too for several bumboats lolled under her entryports and real wives and children and false wives strolled the gundeck or danced in drunken halfclad abandon groping at their men beinggroped and pawed before being led below for a quick fumble tween the mess tables with two blankets hung for privacy caught staring down from the quarterdeck too long one blowsy blonde bawd jerked down the top of her ragged sack gown and shimmied flaunting a brace of pendulous but rather impressively sized teats at him shrieking and calling him a dirty ole awfcer drawing the attention of several of his hands to her antics to his staring god what a dirty puftle he snorted in derision yet doffed his hat and beaming bowed her a courtly leg she shrieked again then blew him a kiss before turning to have her dugs groped by her partner the men had laughednot at him he suspected it had sounded goodnatured and able seaman bales seated atop a pounders breech with his arms crossed over his chest cast him a browraised glare with a shrewd cast to his phyz after that brief antic point for me alan told himself as he paced away ignoring that glare now hes sure to think up something else new to undermine me and my authority has to it was devlishqueer lewrie thought this confrontation twixt me and this bales creature he seems t take it so damn personal not just a scheming sealawyer born for mutiny an damn all officers but like he hates officers in general but me in the most particular he fetched up at the traffrails and leaned on them gazing out to sea and wondered if there was an advantage to save proteus in this fellow baless seething dislike some way to use that against him as a fatal weakness but for the life of him lewrie could not recall a seaman bales in his past whom he had offended from any former ship kin to his old first captain aboard hms ariadne way back in surely notkin would come into the fleet a midshipman in spite of captain bales being cashiered after his court martial at english harbour antigua that was the way of the world and interest in the royal navy sons of fools werent quite the fools that their fathers were til they proved it of course lewrie snickered to himself thenoh struck him what if this bales was old baless kin too penniless and without influence at admiralty to get the usual leg up then he would have had to ship as a volunteer go before the mast at first but with a good education surely hed have advanced past his mostly illiterate fellow sailors have made masters mate by now damme lewrie whispered to himself wasnt me cost old bales his career i spoke up for him lauded him even if i did lie like a rug he ruefully chid himself toadyin for a good name of my own and no way to get to the bottom of it without asking this bales no goddamn your eyes no and take your fools face to hell you impudent gutter trash lewrie turned about wincing at the tone and recognising that voice it was midshipman peacham railing at one of the hands from the afterguarddoing exactly what hed warned them not to do days before hands in the small of his back reminding himself once more about being dignified deliberate and slow he paced towards the altercation but the seamen knuckled his forehead and sloped off before he could arrive face suffused with what looked like murderous resentment mister peacham sir something amiss he intoned captain sir peacham fumed these disputatious hounds i have never heard the like for jacksauce obstreperous such as lewrie purred keeping a solemn face ahem sir he says to me captain sirpeacham stammered in a facesuffusing heat of his own beggin yer pardon sir he poses would you be so good as to advance me the socketfee for a doxy of my own sir the bastard asked purser to dispense funds for his rut as you say mister peacham lewrie sniffed striving to keep a straight face a bit of jacksauce unless of course you thought he was serious i will not abide it sir never peacham declared stiffly oh yes you will sir for the nonce as i said below a few days ago you do recall that sir me in the gunroom lewrie posed tolerant paternal unruffled and patient til this is ended now do you have wits remaining sir recall his name and rating make a sharp note of it and wait for that later to see if he was merely taking the chance to make a jest at an officers expense whether he was put up to it or whether there was something malicious about it malicious of a certainty captain sir peacham averred well see once theyre back in discipline mister peacham lewrie told him now go below and duck your head stay there til youve mastered yourself so you wont explode the next time one of them twits you hmm do they discover youre likely to rage at em the more theyll try you on for the fun of it lewrie cautioned and do they discover youre vulnerable it might be one of the real ringleaders wholl try to get you to rise to their baitand cause real trouble ahh peacham sighed sounding damn close to an insubordinate cry of disagreement he swallowed heavily cringing as if rebuked there see how easy that is mister peacham lewrie snickered instead of bellowing at the fool practice sir practice aye aye sir peacham said doffing his hat and departing another thing to puzzle over lewrie frowned as he paced back to the hammock nettings overlooking that boisterous waist of the ship and the countrydance revelry going on there ominously article the fifth issued by the mutineers had specified that all ships were to keep their navigators aboard as if should their mutiny fail they could sail off the ships theyd seized to foreign enemy ports but most ships committees had put officers ashore captains had been sent packing most willingly and revolted by the betrayal of their crews committees had deemed some officers midshipmen and mates as soul drivers and cruel abusive tyrants and had jeered them over the side rightchearly vowing theyd never allow them to return not in this lifetime they wouldnt and had howe agreed to that but aboard proteus no one had been denounced or turned out yet well grumbled about denounced in a fashion but that was a bit oddsomething else for lewrie to ponder why ever not and can i goad em to put peacham and ludlow off lewrie speculated christ both of em two loads for the proverbial camels back sooner or later not being masters of themselves theyd pop off issue too great an insult to someone and the crew would have another reason to resent authority even after this was finished proteus might also be finished and his command of her with it the admiralty might turn out the entire crew captain and officers and start fresh three sailors mounted the larboard ladder to the quarterdeck as if daring each other to do so lewrie steeled himself for a bit of jacksauce and saw able seaman bales from the corner of his eye still seated atop the breech of the pounder gun but watching most carefully with his tongue in his cheek uhm beggin yer pardon sir one of them chortled elbowed into speech by the ones flanking him and a bit behind for protection permission tspeak capum sir he said removing his hat go ahead lewrie sighed already wearied would ya be so good sir as tissue each man a bottle o gin fer breakfast capum sir the unfortunate managed to say shivering with mirth the others were blubbering their lips in strangled glee oh for gods sake lewrie sighed again pinching the bridge of his nose is that all wellsir uhm aye sir thet is me id love to oblige you frankly lewrie told them ah sir really sir but you know the rules lads lewrie blathered on naval regulations and your own leaders say theres to be no private liquor allowed ever so im afraid i cant but dye see your socalled temporary captain seaman bales there lewrie smiled uhm now do you ask him well he might relent and allow you i heard it said he has a private income beyond his navy pay lewrie extemporised how elsed he come aboard with such a complete kit hmmm do you ask him nicely he might take you ashore with him and sport you to yer gin just ask him sir ah they goggled at him and at each other well go on lewrie urged most mately ask him nothin ventured nothin gained as they always say and good luck er aye aye capum sir we will the spokesman enthused with a hopeful sound they trooped down the ladder to the waist scampering to approach bales and put their outrageous demand to him lord alan shrugged theres three simpler than yer average tars before bales could begin to bark at them and disabuse them he glared upwards at lewrie with a look of pure rage and take that you sly bastard lewrie thought chapter twentyone alan was writing caroline a letter though when he could get it to her he wasnt sure much like the fate of most letters written when at sea to be held until they put into a foreign port met a ship sailing for home or rendezvoused with a squadron flagship the delegates had decreed that no letters would be allowed to go ashore writing was a difficult chore for toulon when not striving to catch and kill the waving quill pens end had developed a fondness for stretching his sleek furry length atop anything lewrie attempted to write or even read desktop dining table or the charttable it made no difference did he make paper rattle toulon would be there in a heartbeatand in a most playful insistent mood rolling over onto his side or back to bare his white belly and push or pat with his paws until he got some petting or brought labour of which alan assumed most cats highly disapproved to a grinding halt toulon now damn yer eyes lewrie fretted shifting pen and paper closer to him but over the cat rolled right onto his back and put all four paws in the air his thick hairy tail lazily lashing and purring in idle impish delight squarely in the middle of the letter arent you supposed tsleep or something lewrie groaned on the verge of surrender its daytime fer gods sake its what cats do eat shit sleep eat pee sleep dont you know the drill weow toulon demanded wriggling nearer the desks edge with his pitiful face on there was a rap on the outer door captain sir enter alan snapped sir theres a boat coming alongside mr midshipman catterall informed him as he stepped inside gunnl down with gin is she lewrie frowned that why the hands are cheerin so lusty uhm i gather one of the key ringleaders has come to call on us sir catterall blinked back but nary a bottle in sight sir come emptyhanded captain a very poor housewarming guest bugger him then lewrie said forced to smile in spite of the interruption by catteralls jest he rose and made his way forrud to go on deck i spose we must see this apparition for ourselves and if he wishes to wet his throat hed best have brought his own spirits lead on mister catterall aye aye sir catterall said with a sly grin id expect rabblerousing is a dry endeavour sir lewrie smiled again as he clapped on his hat and lets just hope its not that lunatick mccann again well at least thought lewrie it wasnt mccann the hands were cheering though that idiot was in the party of visiting leaders of the mutiny hanging back in the rear for once like a spearcarrier in an italian opera lewrie thought to take his rightful place amidships by the nettings at the forward edge of the quarterdeck so he could study this new arrival remember faces if not names for later and remind his mutinous crew just who should be in charge but the visitors usurped that post marching directly from the starboard entryport to the quarterdeck and forced lewrie catterall and the few other midshipmen and officers who had come to answer their own curiosity to hang back far out of range of being tainted by appearing too curiousor tacitly supportive they ended in a clump near the taffrail flag lockers almost out of earshot and mostly ignored by the enthusiastic sailors who were hoorawing what seemed an important visitor the stranger alan noted was of middling height and build and dressed much like a commission officer or warrant officer gentlemanly white breeches stockings and shirt with a plain dark blue brassbuttoned coat over a yellowy striped waistcoat for shoes he sported a pair of halfboots another gentlemanly affection on his head the man wore a hairy beaverfur hat the sort with long and wide flaps that could be turned down over his ears and neck in bad weather the stranger waved his arms crying out to proteuss crew shaking hands here and there with the most forward gladhanding his way to the nettings like a member of parliament on the hustings might work his boroughs pubs for reelection though he was of such regular features as could be deemed handsome he was of a swarthy or sunbaked complexion and there was a halffocused almost dreamy glint to his eyesthe eyes of a romantic lewrie scowled with distaste or was he just as daft as his compatriot mccann he took an instant dislike to him ah sir marine lieutenant devereux said doffing his hat in salute as he came up to see their rareeshow odd do you not think sir he carries himself with the airs of a born gentleman surely he cannot be an officer captain in league with republican rebels a rogue officer lewrie puzzled pray not weve troubles enough from the common seamen and mates who organised this mutiny wearing a sword sir devereux pointed out in a low mutter what looks to be a good pistol in his belt too an officers accoutrements damn his eyes hiphip hooray lads their seaman bales and gunner mr handcocks were exulting three cheers for richard parker president o the floatin republic an admiral o our fleet what gall lt wyman gasped at the effrontery now now lads this richard parker was saying come over all modest and selfdeprecating pushing his hands at the crew as if to hush them so he could speak or morelikely to hush such damning talk to declare a rival government to the established oneand the crownto promote oneself from sailor or mate to the highest peak of the commission officer list a jealously guarded admiralty right could get anybody hanged in an eyeblink even if the mutiny here at the nore ended this instant hmmmtis a good sword at that lewrie had to admit once this parker person had turned about a full circle to silence the crowd it was an officers long slim smallsword not the cutlass from some arms chest more suitable to a seaman pinched mostlike sir midshipman catterall sneered from the offhand side from the gunroom of his own ship right lads give me an ear now hush parker demanded and they finally left off all that raucous cheering there thats better lewrie told himself fore toulon got so scared he had his own litter o kittens weve heard from spithead parker dangled like a lure making everyone lean forward and hold their breaths its official theyve reached an agreement lewrie winced at the noise even if it was joyful tidings lads the terms parker screeched to no avail brother seamen mccann howled stepping forward and waving his cutlass aloft hist now hist tth president th maneatin bastards give in tus th common folkve triumphed over em give heed now theyve won better rationsparker went on once they had calmed at mccanns behestproper weights and measures sickberth pay and proper medical care he ticked off on his fingers theyve gotten the rise in pay for seamen marines and pensioners purged their ships o tyrannical officersn mates too that popeyed mccann felt thrilled to add and full pardons fingers in yer ears lewrie sighed to his assembled officers before taking his own advice yyyyeeeaaahhhhf well thank god lewrie thought as the cheering went on for a full minute or two more turning to share relieved looks with his senior people and a few bold seamen whod held themselves aloof from mutinous doings so far mutinys over and we can get back to work no lastin harm done mongst the people ive still my command listen though listen parker shouted as their cheers began to wane wearing a somber face one thing they didnt get was the more liberal shore leave still limited to seaports or aboard ships same as we have now still have to have our loved ones come out to us stead of us going to them and going ashore decided by individual captains whims still damn em all the souldrivers someone cried well thats all fine for channel fleet lads parked yelled hands on his hips and looking about taking a moment to peer aft at the ships senior officers but theres a problem with it all listen what admiral howe negotiated with the spithead lads our brother seamen our fellow suff rers mccann raved and made parker wince for a moment tell em brother parker terms they agreed to was not an act of parliament it was only an order in council and theyre only good for a year and a day not permanent like a proper act parker cautioned and so far it only applies to spithead and plymouth not to the nore that set off a chorus of boos catcalls and growls of rage well have to hold out til theyve guaranteed us the pardon too presented us with the same terms and sat down and negotiated with us ox whatever we wish beyond the spithead agreement ill be goddamned lewrie groaned horse turds he bellowed before he could think about it which made them turn and glare at him every last motherson ah oops he blushed too forceful chapter twentytwo in for the penny alan sighed dejectedly in for the pound if the settlement satisfies channel fleet he roared though and was done in good faith then why is it not good enough for the nore all any ship has to do is send ashore to viceadmiral buckner and ask for written confirmation of the terms then sign them and return to duty and receive the very same terms and pardon no no wont work mccann shot back aint had our chance tpurge our own ships o tyrants an brutes pardon dont apply here anyways they gotta deal with us face tface and give it to us and we see they live up twhat they promised spithead til we see theyll not stab brother seamen in the back like they done the cullodens or if theyre schemin tgo back on it soon as it suits em year and a day wouldnt trust em further than a man can spit another sailor cried from the back of the pack below the nettings in the waist backstab a whole fleet lewrie countered forcing himself to laugh mccanns suspicions to scorn thatd be national suicide and well you know it admiralty parliament crown they agreed to all they could except for shore leave because they needyou and theyll need you more than a year and a day the way this war is going so how are they going to renege on you no hold out til we get liberal shore leave what our brothers at spithead gave up on seaman bales shouted striding out into plain view a fairer division of prizemoney too a whole lot more things that spithead was afraid to demand he slyly added like bloody what bales lewrie snapped hands on his hips and pacing forward to confront them so more hands could hear the dispute you men did admiral buckner come aboard this instant and offer you the same terms as spithead how many of you would take em and your pardon return to duty and have this done he was gratified beyond all measure to see tentative hands stuck aloft like schoolboys who thought they might just know the answer to a puzzler more than half lewrie exulted more than half ready to cave in take the liberal terms the government had made duck out of sight and notice before they got dragged into deeds which could get them hanged in wholesale lots mates and warrants of a certainty wavered lewrie nodded as he took a quick count a fair portion of the ordinary or able seamen the marines and most of the newcomes the landsmen idlers and waisters new ship few cliques no real complaints against proteus of her officers yet scared men looking for safety youre not part of the ships committee captain bales cried you have no say in this nor any right to demand a division of our house sir turn im out yeoman of the powder kever shouted theres a vote ttake hoy brother seamen turn all th officers out hes only doing what admiralty demands of him bales quickly disagreed not your practiced tyrant but dont heed him brothers theres no proposal from admiralty to vote on not yet lewrie cocked a wary eye at bales puzzled most captains had been sent ashore by their mutineers hed be in good company so why not what motive could this bales have for scotching that idea follow president parker lads mccann shouted sticking his oar in dont sell yer birthright f r a mess o pottage weve but to hold on fr a piece more well win all that spithead got and more vow to hold out til its a proper written act of parliament president parker boomed not only for yourselves but for

burn it tth ground whitehall admiralty all of it raise th whole nation an but it wont come to that lads parker cried out to cut off mccann before such rebellious talk went any further for a fleeting instant lewrie could almost sympathise with the poor bugger saddled with such a batch of firebrands god knew who sat on the fleet delegate committee united irishmen wildeyed republican rebels and levellers foreignpaid traitors and schemers it probably wasnt much fun trying to ride whipperin to a baying herd like that a little more patience is all parker cautioned so they see were serious and theyll give in to us come talk to us theyll have to well get our own terms winnow our officers and mates and get our own pardons a week or more and itll be settled peaceful parker shouted rewarding mccann with a warning glare and a permanent act for all the world to see you mark my words on that unity unity lads strike up all hail brother seamen there then he quickly led them into the beginning of a song which took their minds off fantasies of torches stakes or crucified aristocracy go below bales yelled mustering his staunchest supporters and pointing at lewrie and the officers aft no votes for officers go below no votes for officers go below they began to chant all hail brother seamen that ploughs on the main likewise to wellwishers of seamen of fame may providence watch over brave british tars and guide them with care from the dangers of wars might be best after all sir lt langlie posed we dont wish to create a regrettable incident the mood theyre in at present spose youre right mister langlie lewrie gravelled loath as he was to be seen to flee and admittedly loath as he was to duck below without flinging them a last stinging parthian shot hed never let an insult pass without giving as good or better as he got why change his ways aboard ship then but he had no choice this time at spithead jack from long silence was roused which wakes other brothers who did not refuse to assist in the plan good providence taught in the hearts of brave seamen that had long been forgot goddamn them lt wyman most uncharacteristically blasphemed its all over can they not see that listen to cool reason evidently not lewrie snarled old neptune made haste to the nore he did come to waken his sons who had slept for too long his thundring loud voice made us start with surprise to hear his sweet words and he bid us arise gentlemen lewrie prompted pointing to his companionway ladder and they sorted themselves out in order of seniority to descend to his cabins lewrie tried hard not to glare them all to scorn for a last stinging defiance once more he had been bested scoffed at and it stung like the very blazes chapter twentythree another bleak morning another bleak walk after breakfast upon his usurped quarterdeck with hands shrinking away from him when he got near them and lewrie sighed in frustration another damned longboat coming alongside which had left hms sandwich minutes before and he feared another harangue by the fleet delegates another excuse for the crew to sing caper and tweak their noses at him a ragged sideparty turned out to welcome the visitor and bales handcocks morley and kever turned up to greet him hands engaged in the task of scrubbing and sluicing the decks tensioning the shrouds and stays paused from their labours to see what the occasion was rather blearily lewrie thought there seemed to be even more women aboard than the evening before more strange new faces yawning over mugs of small beer drunk to cut the alcoholic fog from all theyd taken aboard in the previous nights revelries below decks thankfully it was only a minor functionary this time lewrie saw a common seaman bearing a note hed barely gained the gangway and handed the note over to bales shared a quiet word with him then he was off once more back over the side and into the boat bosun pipe all hands bales shouted dont stand there with yer mouth agape mister pendarves dont look to captain lewrie when i give you an order damn yer eyes hes not in charge here im in temporary command pipe all hands then hands to stations for getting underway sounds like an officer alan thought whered he learn that pendarves was looking up from the waist to the quarterdeck in a quandary as to what to do sitting and waiting for the mutiny to be settled was one thing getting up the anchors and making sail sounded like a dangerous escalation of this crisis vast there mister pendarves lewrie barked bales you will not endanger my ship by getting sail on her thats beyond your brief by god sir explain yourself and be quick about it aye ill explain myself sir bales shot back stung to the quick for a rare once his smirky superior demeanour pierced the ship is ordered to shift her anchorage into the great nore not by any authority i recognize bales lewrie hooted she stays where she is damn you pendarves pipe all hands on deck bales roared as he and his minions stalked from the gangway to the quarterdeck thats mister pendarves seaman bales lewrie corrected with a great deal of glee for an opportunity to gall the man i do believe your fleet delegates ordered you to show respect to superiors surely youre capable of following a simple directive mister pendarves pipe all hands bales was forced to amend reddening with anger and my pardons to you sir pendarves said looking to lewrie still proceed mister pendarves lewrie allowed lightly the more witnesses the merrier he silently smirked t see this shitten louse get taken down a pegr two ive got to him at last in public stung him so deep he might make another error the bosun dutifully sounded the call and the hands below with their hungover wives came shambling up into the fresh air looking as if sunlight and a fresh breeze didnt much agree with them lads the fleet delegatesve sent us a message bales cried and lewrie was pleased to note how much they lacked enthusiasm for that news this early in the morning too many special messages he hoped too many excuses for ranting speeches stirring orations or declarations already ahem to temporary captain bales in command of hms proteus you are required and directed to shift your anchorage from garrison point to a position among the nore fleet exercising all due care and caution in the selection of your anchorage bales read aloud dangerous ground bales lewrie loudly sneered your fleet delegates parroting real orders theyve no power to require or direct nor do you pretending to be admiralty or government will cost em dear cost you dear and any man who pretends to obey such well take that risk bales snarled back at him just as loudly fleet delegates wish us to shift to the great nore then that is where we go sir beyond the reach of the fortress guns and such out where men who disagree with you and your floating parliament cant desert you mean lewrie shot back go below captain bales flushed once more striving to keep his temper youve no say in this no vote youd shift this ship without putting it to a vote lewrie retorted with a tongueincheek twinkle what say you lads do you want to be that far from shore on his mere sayso fire on civilians ashore later sail to bloody france later just cause he enough damn you bales screeched prodded into fury at last and instantly regretting it for the low murmur of shock that arose on deck from the waiting hands mister handcocks bales said calming men to the quarterdeck to see the captain below and see he remains there til i give him leave here now bales pendarves called up from the waist ya lay hands on a commission officer and everyones doomed thang alongside ya ya swore thisd be peaceful respectful and it is mister pendarves bales countered but for this but for the captains objections its my responsibility i take it on myself were peaceable so far i ask you though who among us is the one trying to stir us up turn us gainst each other except for the captain any dispute amongst us tis his doing now brother seamen well go to stations get the anchors up make sail handcocks had summoned halfadozen hands the hardest meanest and most dedicated to the cause lewrie contemplated further resistance of taking a cuff or two perhaps a full beating from them to spur his crew to mutiny against the mutineers if thats what it took youll need the officers lewrie suggested slyly yielding not a single inch if youre determined to move this ship nossir we do not bales snapped weve senior mates aboard experienced sailors ive served as quartermaster and masters mate before i think were perfectly capable of sailing two miles and taking a new anchorage without the help of you or your officers now pipe hands to stations mister pendarves jump to it lads sir captain lewrie sir ill thank you to leave the quarterdeck else whatever befalls you will be your own fault he added much softer and none o yours of course seaman bales lewrie sneered secretly gloating that hed finessed this nigh to the crucial confrontation that would break the back of the crews apathy put steel into the spines of those wavering well if you and the rest of your mutineers are so damn capable why dont you put us ashore before you guarantee the noose around your bloody neck he hissed with pleasure bales did the very worst thing then to lewries lights that subtle bastard regained his composure stepped so close that lewrie could smell the reek of his unwashed shirt and smiled quite malevolently so thats what you wish is it captain he whispered well youll not get it oh no not you most of all ive plans for you i have no matter how the mutiny falls out now would you be so good as to get your arse off my quarterdeck out of the way of sailors who know what theyre about mister handcocks see im below be gentle with im but not too gentle hey of all the low lifes they could have clasped hands with there was haslip with handcockss party of enforcers with his hand upon the hilt of his sofar sheathed clasp knife with an expression of pure hatred and revenge on his phyz for his ravaged back taking a cuff or two getting his eyes blacked or spouting claret from a smashed nose well that was one thing getting his gizzards spilled by a mutineers knife was quite another for one thered be no opportunity to savour his testimony or the joy of watching these people go for the high jump from the gallows for the first time he felt a frisson of pure fear this mutiny could end a lot bloodier than anyone intended or expected his blood in point of fact will ya go below capum sir mr handcocks asked seeming about as shaken as lewrie was that he was offering a threat of violence to an officer fore uhm he gulped shiftyeyed for now mister handcocks lewrie allowed after glaring hot and taking several temporising restoring deep breaths for you sir youve done nothing worthy of hanging for yet lewrie lied aye sir thankee sir handcocks muttered sounding almost grateful we should go sir he prompted as pendarves and towpenny reluctantly piped the call which bales had bade them amidst the scamper and thunder of feet heading for the capstan the messenger cables the nippers and the shrouds which led aloft to the yards they paced aft to that companionway ladder near the taffrails once more in silence as the afterguard trudged to the kedge anchor cable to the jears and halliards for the mizzen topsl and spanker i dont know what led you to take part in mutiny mister handcocks lewrie said in a low voice what grievances you had that stirred you to rise up gainst lawful authority or take such a prominent part in it how long you helped its planning handcocks merely breathed hard his gaze fixed shoreward but i warn you now mister handcocks lewrie whispered it is getting out of hand its grown a life of its own and you have no control over it do you have any real say in the ships committee it might be best did you speak out for temperance threatening a captain will lead to blood sooner or later first we move out of gunrange next time will it be the texel a french port out to fight channel fleet now theyre restored to duty sure i dont know sir handcocks groaned sounding strangled maybe were being shifted cause parker bales and their lotre afraid of sensible hands taking the spithead offer lewrie suggested so they dont lose controlcause thats not what their paymasters want a settlement their foreign paymasters mr handcocks sir if ya pleasel handcocks begged as they got to the top of the companionway all but wringing his hands in abject misery mister handcocks bales has more in mind than redress of your socalled grievances lewrie intimated striving to sound matey and concerned ask yourself what that could be his dislike of me however though i cant recall ever meeting the man beforeone would think he held a personal hatred whatever it is mister handcocks dont be too caught up in it this could gallop out of control in the blink of an eye the spithead offer its fair twixt you and me ill say it was overdue aye but its all youre going to get dont lose your warrant or your head asking for a jot more or let things turn violent hmmm if youd go below now sir capum sir handcocks replied wincing and bobbing his head in agony lewrie gave him a hearty clap of sympathy on the shoulder to buck him up and if that didn t light a fire under his nutmegs lewrie told himself once below and out of sight dont know what will and if he cant take a hint then to the devil with him brandy aspinall brimmin lewrie called aye sir comin directly twos a nearrun thing i didnt get beaten senseless lewrie had to admit to himself pushed it almost too far i did but at least i made bales an ogre to the hands gave em another think about how dangerous this is put caution in handcocks a few others hmmm this bales now lewrie thought as his brandy came hed revealed that hed served as a quartermaster and masters mate at one time might have aspired to admiralty warrant as a sailing master too lewrie pondered idly pacing his cabins mustve blotted his copybook though or lost his patrons when turned over into a new ship lost his rate when a new captain had come aboard with his own favourites in tow that would explain his grudge against the navy lewrie decided but he threatened me directly as if i owe him for something from his past and hell make me pay no matter what happens will he for the life of me i cant recall lewrie grumbled sir nothing aspinall just maundering scotching the cries for putting me ashore as if hes savin me for something well lewrie scowled in thought best for him if he did igetunder his skin row him to rashness expose his weaknesses or his true motives reverse our positions and hed be ashore in irons quick as you could say jack ketch after a keehaulin or two it would be so easy for bales to hide in the navy even was he a bounty mutineer there were hundreds of jumpers who enlisted over and over gave false names to a ships first officer got the joining bounty then scampered to try it on again and what would he look like without that full beard of his lewrie wondered and why in this particular incarnation did bales pass himself off as balesif former deserter malefactor or mutineer he was had he served under the unfortunate old man had he been aboard hardluck ariadne during the revolution bales appeared to be in his midtolate thirties old enough to have been a teenaged topman or cabin servant back then hmmm that bore some thinking about christ lewrie suddenly gasped coming out of his dark study proteus was underway her hull timbers beginning to creak as she worked slightly canted by the wind underway under the charge of the common seamen and that bastard bales or whomever he was lewrie dashed to his aftercompanionway ladder rushed up it to stick his head above the hatch coaming there was no sentry to detain him so he cautiously climbed further to take stance beside the flag lockers at the taffrail and sternpost expecting the very worst unfortunately nothing was out of order she was well inhand under topsis spanker and inner and outer jibs everything bristol fashion and bales stood with his hands in the small of his back amidships of the quarterdeck looking upward and outward with the cool professionalism of the saltiest watchofficer it seemed that the mates the common seamen could sail her anywhere they wished lewrie grudgingly decided holland france over to ireland the great south seas if they bloody wished damme lewrie whispered slinking below before anyone spotted him and hooted in derision at his surprise and disappointment book four tua nunc terris tua lumina toto sparge mari seu nostra dolos molitor opertos sive externa manus primus mihi nuntius esto cast now thine eyes upon the land upon all the sea whether it be men of my own land or strangers that are planning secret treachery be first to bear me news argonautica book v valerius flaccus chapter twentyfour if proteus had lacked information before her isolation became even worse once the mutinous fleet had shifted out to the great nore their parliament had already banned letters to or from shore now tweenship visiting which was usually allowed had been cancelled as well oh there was still visiting but it was done by the representatives from the parliament ship hms sandwich alone the daily parade of rowing boats filled with cheering leaders and sycophants accompanied by noisy ships bands and a sea of gay flags monday the twentyninth had been restoration day and to celebrate king charles iis return to the throne after the end of commoners rule the mutiny ships had fired the usual gun salutes and hoisted the royal standards for a time though the weather was cold and gloomy blowing half a gale of wind off the north sea even harbour waves high enough to stir and rock the lineofbattle ships like fishing smacks a rather odd act lewrie had thought for a pack of mutineers hellbent on hanging the monarch to read their truculent diatribes but there had been no ropeyarn day after no special feasts no libertymen allowed ashore to carouse and toast the king in the pubs once the royal standards had been lowered they had returned to a lacklustre waiting and workaday chores of shipkeeping rumours mostly third or fourthhand spoke of president parker and the fleet delegates meeting ashore with the lords commissioners of the admiralty others spoke of pilots called aboard to steer them to france six months arrears in pay to be settled on the morrow the only thing sure was that no one but parker and the other leading negotiators and their boatcrews were allowed liberty in sheerness delegates had made the rounds dictating a new regulation that said a man must apply to the fleet delegates for a pass after approval by his own ships committee and the matter decided by parker himself anchored that far out the mutineers had also lost the services of the many vendors bumboats their pastries meatpies gewgaws or smuggled spirits the shoes shirts and slopclothing better than what mr coote offered the tobacco sweets or treats that sailors bought to liven the dull sameness of ships fare though some pedlars tried to make the long row or sail out to the mutineer ships their numbers were not a third of the usual or previous days one thing lewrie had determined by keeping an eager ear open to the complaints of his crew what joining bounty they had gotten as volunteers had already been spent on slop stores what little theyd hoarded for contingencies had gone for the wild sprees that had followed the mutinys eruption the poor bastards were broke the bumboaters couldnt squeeze a single farthing more from them and expecting the worst from an impatient government were not of a mind to extend them any credit against future pay vouchers either now that they were reduced to plain commons and the skimpy daily rum issue whole days of skylarking hornpiping and delegates shouted harangues could not relieve the monotony of navy routine resentments arose too over how long this mutiny of theirs might take before winning the wishedfor results most especially they resented the strident militancy and highflown airs of the fleet delegates of their brandnew floating republic and the women lewrie could recall hugging himself with joy article the third of their compact declared that no woman shall be permitted to go on shore from any ship but as many may come as please when they had been anchored hard by garrison point that had been a lark now though the women were becoming burdensome one more irritant proteus had over an hundred livelumber not two dozen of em authentic wives who had come out to stand by their real husbands no the rest were sheerness or chatham whores the hired doxies and drabs brought out in the bumboats by brothelkeepers pimps or boatmen who got a share of their earnings in return for passage the hands had been eager to speak up and claim the prettiest and cleanest youngest and most fetching declaring them wives whod turned up to stay with them whilst in harbour to be kept on their money and rations even some of the most raddled who were normally turned away had remained knowing that someone less choosy would turn up after a few hours down on the gundeck and all that semipublic rutting to whet appetites or remove fears and even honest married men might succumb the young and inexperienced turned heady with lust theyd not been turned away by the surgeon mr shirley and his mates so they werent poxed so they would usually stay aboard as long as a ship was at anchor and out of discipline as long as their husbands had money for their sexual favours and upkeep and not a single minute more now the fairer sex even the frailest sweetest and prettiest and there were damned few of those to start with were sniping and snarling over being pressganged without pay they were definitely not a pack of shrinking violets to be put off stalled or used without solid coin either born with or developing by necessity a gravediggers chary soul the average sailors doxy was a flinty chit no one to trifle with coquetry and languid lashfluttering charms of perfumed london courtesans shammed passion and affection were beyond them mostly it was hoy jack wanna poke now without money to earn without civilian fripperies off the mostly absent bumboats kept from leaving as strictly as the sailors and now reduced to the same saltrations tilehard ships biscuit the same pease porridge and already semirancid navyissue cheese and with but a sip of small beer or a share of their mans watered grog they posed a greater threat of countermutiny than anything lewrie or his officers could conjure up clearly the honeymoon was over he snickered in private and schemed upon how to turn it to his advantage lewrie paced the larboard gangway for exercise all the way to the bower anchor catheads and the break of the forecastle round the belfry then down the starboard gangway aft to the quarterdeck and the traffrails to begin another circuit to be seen by his men unruffled calm and serene no matter his predicament to point out things needing trimming or reroving a lick of paint or tar to the mates and leading hands reinforcing his authority and eliciting information mornin mash bearin up he would brighten whenever he encountered a face he could put name to in his raw new crew mornin landsman furfy mornin landsman lucas bannister christ what an eye man run into a rammer in the dark did you run outta money siren run into th wrong drab sir the sailor griped daubing at his impressive shiner with a soggy neckerchief knocked im flattern a flounder sir middle grace chuckled ah a fearsome woman not one tcross capum sir he said with a jut of his chin towards the blowsy blonde whod mocked lewrie before nancy sir she named herself swaying her broad hips at him as she paced over near the bottom of the gangway lip below him putting on a lascivious air out of harddrilled habit lewrie suspected aye i put him down the skint pup she boasted hands on her hips and leaning forward to sport her ample bosom at him ya give me a dozen lashes capum or a dozen o somethin else d be yer pleasure and my dear wifed black both my eyes nancy lewrie quipped give a poor girl a chance capum she pouted with what she must have imagined was an enticing note to her voice none o yer ladsve two pence trub tgither you leave em anything to rub at all mistress nancy lewrie was quick to reply enjoying the banter with her even a nubbin by god scrubbed up she dont look half bad he thought tad stout but thats teats an hips mostly blonde prettyish gawd she threw her head back and cackled proud that shed rubbed at least one twoa halfdozen of his hands down to nubbins before theyd run out of coin brassy bold freshfaced totally amoral was a time twas my favourite sort he told himself i wager you ve moren a nubbin in yer britches capum sir she suggested drawing a chorus of ooohs from the hands nearby care t spank me fer bein mean tyer men handsome officer like yerself id even enjoy it nor charge ye much darlin now how could i do that mistress nancy lewrie felt obliged to pout in disappointment and a firm spankable bum im certain you own too but like you say now the hands are skint how fair dye think itd be for me to savour what the lads no longer can damme bet it is he all but salivated now lets see what they think o that aha sage nods bless me old firm but fair dammit thell capum nancy groaned swiping at her hair irritatedly thout they let meun tother girls ashore how am i to keep meself well youve what youve earned to spend on the bumboats lewrie suggested til they let you and the rest go did you spend that well theres bales and the other committeemen theyve still got coin ill wager planned this for a long time probably laid a store omoney aside for it them with the green cockades nancy sneered spitting on the deck in derision mouths they got fine words no nutmegs though too busy teven play wif their own cocks another hearty laugh this one directed at their betters oh trust a leery chary english sailor to turn on those over them as soon as they began to put on the qualities airs there was an inbred deference to your average englishman be he tar or rural daylabourer a costermonger or houseservant he would doff his hat knuckle at his forelock and scrape out a bow to gentlemen and ladies and most of the time as long as orders were reasonable would obey he had trouble with obedience though when it came to being bossed about by those no grander than he wasor who had risen from his level to greatness officers and midshipmen sailing masters and surgeons were from the quality the squirearchy or aristocracy the upper level of middling rank used to being obeyed and the sailors were used to obeying and even expected the better sort to make the decisions now though another reason for resentment lewrie schemed nancy encouraged by the laughter her comment had got hoisted the skirts of her gaudy sack gown to display her calves they were bare instead of sheathed in the usual cotton or opaque silk stockings slimmer and more alluring than hed suspected clean too not smutted with tar or soot rather cunning little feet not even a thumbworth mistress nancy lewrie pretended to gawp in astonishment not even a nubbin less than a nubbin damme ye dont think they traded weddingtackle for green cockades hey they made sure that every man had pledged fidelity gave oaths as firm as wedding vows and sported the red cockade of rebellion but then said that red cockades must respect green cockades as their superiorsas good as officers nancy gave out a shriek of mirth which made the rest feel free to roar their appreciation of his jest too hoy then another harridan bellowed from below him this one a much fiercer old bulldog practically towing a rather pretty younger miss with her by the hand daughterun me fine sir damn my eyes i wont let her spread fer free nor lift my skirts fer nothin neither th skipper o this here barge are ye well then thout you pay us tstay give us a boat tgo ashore ya tightfisted bastard and then lewrie sighed there were some whod skipped classes the day they took up deference i have no control over that mistress lewrie told her taking off his hat and laying it over his heart to show the old strumpet just how sincere he was and giving the old bats fifteenyearold protйgй a good going over with his glims the fellow calls himself captain of thishere barge for now is named bales youd have to take it up with him and his committee you want pay youd best ask of them to give you your daily bread and your daily shilling or a boat what goodre the likes o you then the old woman scoffed til this crew accepts the spithead terms the pardon and returns to discipline maam lewrie informed her theres nought that i can do not with a pistol to my head or a knife in my ribs i cannot me id be happy to oblige you and put you ashore with all your earnings where you can buy yourself and charming daughter a meal and a bottle when you wish but he shrugged most eloquently and sadly doffing his hat and making a departing leg to hoary harridan bountiful nancy and the unknown but luscious littleun he departed with the gay sounds of curses slurs demands and arguments in his shelllike ears another bloody fire lit he sniffed now lets just see who gets scorched by it hands who now couldnt afford to put the leg over but presented with mostly desirable pulchritude everywhere they looked real wives who wished the paid variety off cause their husbands still had money and didnt need the temptations trolling about for tuppence mutineer leaders maligned and another resentment and suspicion raised against them did they really have some hoarded coin and took time from their incessant preaching of mutiny and rebellion to put the leg over one of the whoresespecially one of the prettier onesthemselves and the disgruntled impressed whores oh were a happy little ship we are lewrie chortled silently a tiddly little ship chapter twentyfive and by the time eight bells of the forenoon watch had finished chiming lewrie was quite pleased to see that proteus had been given a new cause for upset the hands had queued up at seven bells when clear decks and up spirits had been piped for the grog issue a keg of rum so stout it was almost pitchydark and treacly had been fetched up decorated with yellow paint the navy seal and the ancient motto the king god bless him with it had come a butt of water and the miniature mugs to be mixed and diluted twoforone which would yield each hand the equivalent of a halfpint of grogall carefully guarded and administered by the master at arms and ships corporals the purser and mr shirley the surgeon mutineers or not the ritual was not to be tinkered with for sailors were a conservative lot as illsuited as a cat to a sudden change in daily routine or surroundings the new leaders aboard obeying the stricture in their compact to respect officers and their orders clung to the notices on the watchandquarter bills as to how much grog each man should get was someone being punished by deprivation and the agreements among the hands themselves as to whether another got not only his own but sippers or gulpers of another mans for sewing up sloptrousers to a better fit standing a watch making a useful article or settling wagers between them usually it was a cheerful time when the crew lined up to take their ration jealously watching for the slightest shortage when their measure was poured out it signalled the end of the mornings exercise at saildrill small arms or gundrill and the onset of their midday meal for rum issue the offgoing watch and the oncoming both mingled for a while crowding them all forrud toward the focsle belfry this time it was even more crowded as wives children and the whores gathered round for their share wheedling whining bawling or cajoling if the men didnt have money anymore at least they had rum to offer the whoresd settle for that how are we fixed for rum mister coote lewrie enquired twelve weeks worth sir at normal rates of issue longer did we water it at threetoone the purser answered crisply knowing his sums to the groat we did not receive our total due before whichd be cause for mutiny of itself sir lt langlie said the pigs midshipman peacham felt free to interject pigs ah lewrie breezed on as if he hadnt a care in the world reminds me thankee mr peacham speaking of trough mister coote how stands our food supply then nigh on the full sixteen weeks captain sir mr coote told them depending on whether we are responsible for victualling the dependents with them aboard sir more like ten weeks worth nine are we profligate then this could go on forever lt ludlow gloomed hed not made many appearances lately and when he had attended officers meetings hed kept his own counsel merely frowning glowering or grimacing without venturing either opinions or suggestions or any comments that hadnt been elicited by a direct question hed not kept up his toilet either lewrie noted ludlow s waistcoat was dingy with smut and foodstains his shirt tanned at collar and cuffs from long wear and his beard stubble a light coaldust smear on his chin and cheeks no not forever mister ludlow lewrie countered did any of you take a gander at the shore today note whats happening in sheerness uhm that it seems rather quiet sir midshipman catterall ventured without the seamen allowed ashore do you lift a telescope youll find some pleasing sights ashore lewrie beamed now let me ask you all another question what will be served for dinner sir had he been driven daft by the mutiny was the look they sharedhad proteus stolen the wits of another captain whats cooked for the hands dinner mister coote uhm the usual tuesday rota sir pound of biscuit and two pounds of saltbeef per man per day the purser informed him no shore tommy no beeves or hogs for slaughter lewrie pointed out nor will there be in future viceadmiral buckner and commissioner hartwell have not seen fit to deliver fresh victuals out to the ships this morning really gentlemen you should take more notice of things around you he chid them with mock severity tsking a time or two with a sly leer do you look shoreward you will see soldiers and workmen atop the forts mending whats been neglected for far too long i shouldnt wonder troops of militia and regulars patrolling the streets standing guard over the dockyards and quays you could espy civilians departing evacuated or of their own accord oh therell be some tavern keepers and whoremongers who stay and reap the bounty from all these soldiers soldiers gentlemen he said beaming his delight mostlike with orders to arrest any mutineer who gets ashore to cut them off completely i believe our lords commissioners have been down to sheerness and told parker and his men to get stuffed perhaps it wasnt our mutineers idea to avoid shore hey and gentlemen do you look close you may see some activity just a bit upriver of garrison point boats working looking very much to me as if theyre laying a stouter boom across the medway his suppositions sounded inspiriting they all seemed to perk upyet didnt dash to the bulwarks that instant looking hesitant tell me what im s posed to think lewrie sighed to himself swear what a pack of codswallops there was a glad interruption from up forrud some hands were squabbling over the rum issue one man had offered half his ration to a whore but it sounded as if he already owed gulpers to one of his messmates who wasnt going to be shorted neither would the doxy take less than a full half of a half dont you see gentlemen he posed to them this isnt any fun anymore theyve had their ropeyarn days their drunks their ruts theyre as broke as convicts no more skylarking ashore and no more fresh food either no more quim less they resort to rape have to live on searations share spirits and victuals with women they cant have less they trade food or drink too many mouths aboard and shortcommons if this goes on much longer anchored out where its boresome and theres nothing to do but stew and fret bout what admiraltys doing when its going to end and how now do you take pains to make em see whats going on ashore and why undermine their morale sir catterall piped up tumbling to it at last so they give it up take the pardon so close to the queens channel too mister catterall lewrie muttered stepping into the taut halfcircle of officers warrants and junior petty officers where a crew a ship did they get fearful or their commitment to the mutiny had begun to waver might think that escape from the nore might be the best choice sirs as a way to take the spithead terms the pardon and signal their denial of the mutiny by a return to duty seaduty god bless the mutinous members of our little parliament he sneered putting us where itd be easier to sail off when we retake the ship sirs mouths gapped even wider as jaws dropped at the idea sneaky grins replaced puzzlement with two twodeckers anchored near us sir lieutenant ludlow said with a sneer of hopelessness upperdeck gunports open and primed to fire on any ship that shows a scrap of sail tries to upanchor damme mister ludlow lewrie scoffed and here i thought you were the firebrand determined to draw blood tother day when it seemed we had a chance to keep the ship sir ludlow shot back not just surrender her like a craven consider yourself under arrest sir lewrie barked suddenly fed up with the man go below and confine yourself and your insolence to your cabin by god you go too far sir have done since i came aboard ludlow s jaw found cause to drop and he visibly paled like to faint he seemed to reel or stagger whether to fall to his knees in apoplexy or take a damning step forward to threaten a superior officer it could be taken either way marine lt devereux reached out to take him by the upper arm to support or restrain him this could be taken either way too you ludlow blustered now see here sir ah i see sir unhand me you tailors dummy ah ah very well sir i will as always obey my captains orders sir very good sir lewrie sniped through hairthin lips then kindly do as i have ordered mister ludlow ludlow had mastered himself had control of his body once more though he never would learn how to conceal the emotions that erupted on his phyz and those were stony and bloody he doffed his hat and made a leg in a mostformal conge then turned on his heel to stamp away after sharing a bleak but knowing look with midshipman peacham uhm sirlt langlie whispered after a long embarrassed silence though he stated his case uhm well insolently there is the problem of those twodeckers and their guns i doubt they keep a zealous watch mister langlie lewrie muttered back too bored weve not held saildrill lately or had our people at the artillery with the shore cut off from them and our mutinous committee worried suggestions from us as to drilling back to passing competence might find a welcome ear no shot no powder in the guns but make and furl sail put men aloft on the yards if we do it often enough then it may not draw much attention when we do it for our escape when we cut our cables no pilot aboard sir mr winwood pointed out lowering his voice to a conspirators hiss tricky passage shoals sands flats where we could run aground but could you do it mister winwood aye sir winwood allowed and that rather reluctantly it would be a perfect bitch did they take the ground and under fire from a twodeckers heavy guns the tides though do we sail out with the ebb to speed our way itd have to be in daylight sir the flood runs at night and will take us into the medway or sheerness might be a safer escape sir if the government has garrisoned sheerness gainst the mutineers retaking us dark as a boot scudding off a north sea blow sir harder to shoot at there is that mister winwood lewrie allowed but wed have to run past a great many ships before we got there herehe said casting a hand out toward the beckoningly empty eastern horizon were less than a mile mileandahalf the rangetorandomshot of an pounder from showing them a clean pair of heels were in the outer i row of the great nore less than a mile from the buoyed channel most of the other ships are streamin back from a single bower when the flood runs they point outward when the ebb runs theyre facing sheerness sail exercise make a slow way up to short stays under reduced sail then furl and fall back do that a few times each morning and sooner or later theyll take no more notice of us but one time the last time we cut and keep on going turn of the tide mister winwood with a suitable slant o wind doable dye think aye sir doable winwood replied gravely but with a nod of conviction and determination the gunboats sir lt wyman enthused almost hugging himself to contain his eagerness theyve lost em sir theres no one to chase us did we get a way on on restoration day during the gale when even massy twodeckers had been tossed about the eight commandeered gunboats which had been stationed at either end of the fairly snug double crescent of warships had been all but swamped by breaking waves and had finally gone into the calmer waters of the medway for shelter just in time for admiral buckner to stir himself to action at last and take them away from the mutineers uhm there is the additional problem of arms sir marine lt devereux sighed pulling at his nose in thought beyond our own weve none though we have identified hands who remain loyal and we know who supports the mutiny would fight to keep the ship we are a bit thin on the ground compared to their numbers and they now are armed sir another pesky problem that bales had finally tired of being denied the arms chest keys by lewries aloof truculence and had torn the locks and hasps off the chests with crowlevers from among the gun tools hung over every mess table to distribute muskets pistols and swords aye they are lieutenant devereux lewrie sombrely agreed but then so are the loyal men damme sir they were forced to take the oath they wear the red cockades dont they and so do a goodly number of the fearful and the uncommitted whod let themselves be blown willhe nillhe by either faction let themselves be blown to sea and out of danger if it came to it theres a mixture of all factions in every watch good sir every division or workparty we know who the ringleaders are who the firmest supporters are do we get the drop on them when the time is ripe take the deck and keep a fair number of true mutineers below long enough arms are common aye sir lt devereux pondered his aristocratic features creased in thought as he pondered something pleasant put his wits to work on a tactical situation a lightning raid a coup they have to allow all hands have arms watchandwatch else it else it seems as if the real mutineers dont trust the rest lt langlie smirked and they cant have that sort of resentment in their ranks as if they dont now sir midshipman catterall quipped in sotto voce if they dont have it now we could make sure they do soon lewrie hinted do we drop a few sly rumours theres grievances beyond the mutineers demands aboard we must exploit them we believe we know who among the crew we can trust those clever enough to keep mum til our time comes those who can chat up the rest and sow even more seeds of discontent the mutineers have helped us in that it was goggling time for his officers again one more reason to stare at him as if hed grown antlers or broken out in purple blotches theyve cut off news from shore dye see lewrie slyly explained no more rowing tween ships to visit cousins brothers or old shipmates either what morale our people have is become entirely internal to proteus theyre already showing signs of boredom with cheering and speechifying now what else dye think they could get hellish tired of do we put our wits to it hey when our chance comes then sir mr winwood gravely mused shouldnt we get the women and children off the ship out of the way of any fighting itll require some fighting i expect sir without their wives and uhm without the distracting er that is to say entertaining presence of the ah them winwood flummoxed trying to find a christian way to name that which he disdained thout the whores an strumpets mister winwood lewrie rephrased for him taking a bit of joy in twitting the man by employing plainer terms ah aye sir winwood actually blushed fallen women or not sir they are the frailer sex taint right for them to be exposed to violence no matter their stripe or station without women aboard would they not become even more dispirited with nothing to do but dwell upon their dismal situation and i believe mister coote will bear me out that they are eating us out of house and home sir week or two more of feeding useless mouths and well deplete our victuals then when we do cut free wed not be at our best state for duty hmmm lewrie frowned in thought clapping his hands in the small of his back and studying the toes of his boots the tarred oakum seams in the quarterdeck planking no mister winwood their being aboard and out of reach for want of money is troubling to our tars so well keep em as one more cause for upset if they are eating us out of house and home then bales and handcocks might put them on halfrations put the whole crew on halfrations sooner or later no quim and shortcommons our jacksll never stand for that weve need of the whores believe me chapter twentysix a little after the midday meal had been served to the crew and they lazed in postprandial ease for a halfhour during which time the officers dined lewrie was surprised to hear a hail from an entryport to an arriving boatone which didnt draw the requisite cheers that the delegates prefered he was making the best the best he could of his dinner which wasnt much more than the same saltbeef that the hands had fed upon and was more than happy to abandon the effort and saunter out on deck to satisfy his curiosity he was further surprised to see that a bumboat had come alongside mr morley of the ships committee was speaking to the hopeful trader and summoning bales to make the decision about letting strange people aboard the boats skipper was bowing scraping and gesticulating as humbly as a levant rugmerchant pointing overside and leering suggestively even more whores lewrie wondered his mate in the boat passed up a wooden cage in which several plump chickens resided shedding feathers and dung as they swayed up on a light whip and squawking their unwillingness to be so impressed into the royal navy their upset spurred other creatures into protests and lewrie heard the squeals of piglets drawn by gustatory fantasies lewrie drifted forrud fingering his purse for ready coin well damn th authorities says i the bumboatman was crying no manll tell a willis he cant sellta whoever he wishes mate hoy there captain sir no more fresh stores tcome admiral saysta cut em off wager a plump henr twod suit ya sir whilst yer forced twait yer officers too sir hens geese a plump torn turkey fer th gunroom roast piglet wi cracklins an gravy by sundown do ya buy this hour sir loaf bread sweet biscuits fresh cheese thatll melt in yer mouth sir hoy now wholl buy does thisn let me aboard hey give a poor merchant a chance willya full or not on navy fare the hands drifted over to see what he had up on the gangway to peer over the bulwarks or below its lip to grumble and insist that bales let him come aboard most especially the whores might not see another brother bales handcocks speculated tyrantsve mostlike scared th rest o th bumboatmen from tradin threatened ttake away their permits sure very well bales sighed no private spirits mind weve articles against it mister willis he warned the vendor youve no doxies in your boat so i cant see the harm let him enter bales decreed in a loud voice like moses reading the first commandment to a glad cheer from the bored crew and the deprived womenfolk willis the vendor and several of his assistants clambered up to the gangway some of them descended into the waist to show off samples of their wares children began shrieking over gooey sweets or stickily sugared buns they wished the warships waist quickly became a village green on market day willis the vendor came aft to confront lewrie and the rest of his officers who had come up fingering their own purses or delving in their breeches pockets to purchase those luxuries which enlivened their own lives oh sirs ive so many fowl im chickenpore an theyll go for lessn anybody elsed charge ye my bibleoath pon it tothers cut off from tradin skeered off from tradin by that admiral buckner and that new genrl grey just come tsheerness with all his soldiers the man bubbled most brightly wines sirs brandies sirs not for the likes o them lads down yonder but off cers can have

halfcrown each captain sir a crown th pair damme thats moren reasonable lewrie was forced to say bought up th stock o other vendors lewrie could hear a vendors assistant on the lower deck bawling the explanation bought for a song when they saw twas ruinous for em th craven poltroons bought cheap sold cheap come one come all no pushin there lad ill take the shoats lewrie said looking for aspinall to come and take charge of them and opening his purse for solid coin a brace of geese too a full pound for all is it an heres yer change good sir the vendor winked handing lewrie a folded square of paper shame it is good englishmen forced tuse paper money but there tis he winked again lewrie pocketed the note in his breeches and gave this fellow willis a dumbstruck nod of understanding no matter th rest o th cowards sir willis assured him you can count on williss fer all yer needs be back wheneer th ole nore weather allows me sirs keep ya in yer best tucker cheer ya with spirits as good as any fine merchant in london would and so i will good as williss roomsd treat a lodger suchz yerself i know it well lewrie admitted with a nod keeping a grin of comprehension from giving the game away but ah thought ya would captain lewrie this willis whispered as he twisted his torso to one side to pocket more money from the other officers whod made purchases with another brief wink you will come often then i take it sir lewrie asked evry tother day do th weather allow sir willis boasted in a normal voice good lewrie smiled id hate to be deprived out here of anything needful a newspaper next trip sir or my names not willis the man guffawed as if at a private jest zachariah willis ah lewrie nodded the scales of mystery torn from his eyes of course every arm of hm government had been sicced on this mutiny on the spithead mutiny before it nepean had said that agents working for the duke of portland the kings witchfinder and seeker of dangerous dissidents had been delving round portsmouth and plymouth for signs that the mutiny was foreignsponsored every arm of hm government both the spiritual and temporal mostlike the established church of england had already sent out circulars to every vicar urging them to preach loyalty and obedience from their pulpits i and should a tiny bureau of the foreign office be told to delve to finagle undermine and investigateperhaps even go so far as to eliminate the most infamous rabblerousers well zachariah a clue to zachariah twigg that coldblooded ruthless old cutthroat spy of lewries long painful and dangerous association in the far east tween the wars the ligurian sea not so long ago in and someone official was establishing underground communication to him to all captains whod not been put off already looking for information imparting information encouragement orders that folded square of foolscap was burning a brand upon his thigh pity i have so little to give you mister willis lewrie said with an apologetic shrug but i didnt anticipate your arrival i blieve though when next you call ill have a proper list of my wants and needs ah thats th spirit captain sir willis cackled with glee all brassbound navy like cant scuttle cross a duck pond without a man havin his lists an ill be honoured thave em from ya he hinted lewries lips opened and he felt the urge to take the man by the arm that instant to pump him for more information or tell him about the state of the mutiny aboard proteus but this fellow who pretended to be willis took a halfstep back squinted in worry and gave him a brief but vigourous negative shake of his head see some othersve found th courage tcome out an trade with the ships willis said instead further pretending to frown pointing outboard hope youll not be fickle an let just anybody come sell to ya sir lewrie looked outward despite the likelihood of decent profit there did seem to be an increase in the number of traders bumboats by the other warships now there were smaller rowboats from sheerness minster or leigh alongside some crying their freshdredged oysters or freshcaught fish thrivin trade sir this willis simpered dspite prohibitions gainst it admiral buckners or parkers lewrie muttered mums th word on that head sir willis responded smugglin are you lewrie barked with amusement and willis looked like to about jump out of his skin in alarm in point of fact lewrie suspected he had a poor repute with the twiggs of this world it was evident this man had been warned he was dealing with a looselip a slender reed perhaps hed been promoted to nitwit who was nowhere as clever as he thought himself well damme lewrie pretended to sigh in resignation how elsed i or anyone in england have our tea silks or lace without a smuggler at the root of it ah ha willis nervously laughed at that all but shivering in relief that lewrie had grasped that the bumboats were indeed smuggling but in the kings name that despite the reports lewrie wasnt a raving twit and that he hadnt gotten him killedyet but a very english trade sir hey long as it stays solely english he purred in question after hed gotten his wits and control of his sphincter back that is which subtle query gave lewrie pause damn me this is gettin a tad deep he thought had as spoonin up some willin chit right under her husbands nose how to say it hes as good as put it to me direct is our mutiny homegrown or foreignbrewed and what do i know oh there may be interlopers now and then who hope to prosper at it lewrie cautiously replied with wit enough to growl indignant though not for very long its a homegrown trade mostly thats to say ah uhmmm horse turds even i cant make sense of what i just told him oh exactly sir willis said his eyes hooding and crossing in perplexity as he could take no clue from that either well sir take joy by yer leave ill search out some other customers the smuggled letter for that was what his change had been stated what he already prettymuch knew or had deduced it began most ominously though with the dutch fleet is ready the additional demands of the nore mutineers had been presented to visiting lords commissioners of the admiralty and had been rejected outofhand the spithead terms would be all they would receive and those terms were not the defamed orders in council but were legitimate acts of parliament for all to read copies of the acts and copies of the kings pardon were being smuggled aboard the recalcitrant vessels at the nore to convince the deluded or ignorant that they should take them and return to duty be pardoned without any hard feelings upon receipt of those did his crew still refuse to return command of his ship to him and return to discipline the letter bore specific orders for all captains and officers still aboard mutinous ships to quit their vessels at once and report to admiral buckner ashore damn damn damn lewrie sighed hunched over the letter at the transom sash windows right aft huddled up in a corner of the settee atop his lazarette stores how could he leave her when his plots to retake her had barely been set in motion had yet to bear fruit he agonised with the kings pardon and acts of parliament aboard for all to see there was more than a good chance that proteus would strike the mutineers flags and hoist her proper colours but it was a direct order scribbled at the bottom with viceadmiral buckners signature to disobey did the crew prove obstinate was to risk not only this command but his entire career he crumpled it up into a tight ball thinking hard which gay noise brought toulon from a sound nap atop the winecabinet swishing his tail in expectation of a brandnew unmunched unswatted toy he plopped to the deck meowed enticingly as he hopped into his owners lap trying to paw it or bite it from lewries hand lewrie idly stroked him as he unfolded the letter to give it a second reading hoping for an escape clause no no hopes of that but information he had leapt over before channel fleet was returned to duty admiral duncan at great yarmouth was to sail to the texel channel to block the exits of the frenchcontrolled dutch batavian navy channel fleet would be no help here brest cherbourg st malo and le havre already bristled with warships invasion galleys to carry troops and escorting gunboats that armada was weatherbound so far but was rumoured to be on tiptoes prepared to descend on ireland or perhaps even on england s south coast it was vital therefore and blahblahblah lewrie softly groaned sorry puss not a toy for you to his ramcats dismay he shredded it to tiny bits before someone else could read it well you can have it later he could toss it out the transom sash windows but that might raise suspicions if someone spotted him doing it but turned into a heaping handful of foolscap the letter would do mainwell for filler in toulon s litter box after a fragrant spritz or two of catpee no spy in the world would even try to retrieve it much less piece it back together oh sometimes youre so useful toulon lewrie told him do you know that yayysss oo are ill give you another sheet to play with would you like that toulon did eagerly bounding off to football pounce and mutter over a blank sheet most intriguingly balled far forrud into the diningcoach and back damme and it was such a good plan we had going too lewrie sighed quite bleakly as he gingerly disposed of that incriminating letters remains that late in the afternoon the tide was starting to turn his frigate streaming back from a single bower was beginning to swing on her cable turning her stern shoreward as the evening flood tide took her in the transom sash windows the alluring vista of an open horizon the puddledsteel glitter of the north sea and freedom was slowly being replaced by the sight of lowlying fen land to the northfoulness and shoeburyness the villages of great wakering and southend the partly exposed leigh and maplin sands at low tide an embaying fen landhemming him and his ship in chapter twentyseven when in doubt mope lewrie told himself of half a mind to begin packing his sea chests and of half a mind to have himself one more glass of claret and wait til after aspinall and his cook served up that goose theyd cooked for him a dull rumble interrupted his foul mood though the sounds of many voices and a knock on the door captain sir mr midshipman sevier cheeped leaning in the doorway to bare his noddys face disturbance on deck sir theyre arguing amongst themselves and some are calling for you sir havent built themselves a guillotine out o bosuns stores yet have they mister sevier lewrie frowned at him slumped quite comfily on the starboard side settee with his feet and legs outsplayed uhm a guillotine sir you know king of france chopchop uhm nossir its getting heated though sir the people wish you to address them ah then he brightened those smuggled acts of parliament and the kings pardon must have encouraged the moderates and faint of heart to relent already he rose tugged down his waistcoat plucked his shirt cuffs and clapped on his hat he emerged on the gundeck to witness a slanging match between determined mutineers ditherers and quitters theyd formed sides in unconscious scrums dividing themselves into packs laced with uncomprehending children and hectoring wives and whores prettymuch allied to the loyal side or the ditherers in the middle with but a few harpies siding with the committee or the leaders they quieted their arguments as he appeared and made his way to the starboard quarterdeck ladder parting before him even as seaman bales was still expostulating from the nettings overlooking the waist cutting off all food to us brothers bales bellowed to exhort his minions before lewrie could speak not even their damned substitute flour will they give us no more candles rum small beer damme no more rope tar or lumber either treachery the determined side shouted now you see what our king thinks of us mates how little he thinks of you his longsuffering and loyal tars how could a loving king deprive you thus whove served him so well in the past or let criminals like pitt henry dundas and spencer try to starve us out to get what they want that drew many boos and catcalls lewrie scowled as he ascended to the quarterdeck baless hotblooded talk was dangerous dissident cant the sort that could get any civilian tossed into gaol for treason he might have something interesting indeed to pass on to that willis fellow when next he came out to offer his wares he scowled too because he was loath to be drawn into a noisy beggars opera a bit of political theatre as it now seemed the mutiny had become but heres your captain brothers you wanted him to speak to you and ill not have it said your committee your fleet parliament wont abide by your wishes bales hurriedly summed up as lewrie stalked up to his side almost shouldering him aside from his rightful place bales tossed him a sneerful highnosed glare of satisfaction as if hed finessed lewrie into an impossible situation his smile of welcome and reason was a bloody sham for the others very well men lewrie said looking out and down you say you wish me to speak with you about what out with it the terms sor landsman desmond was quick to shout them they got out to us are they true they are lewrie assured them just as parker told you when he was last aboard pay rise and all everything spithead won for themselves is now yours if you submit and take the pardon dont say nothin bout riddin th ship o bad officers an mates mr morley objected doesnt give us th liberty we wanted either what about them say sir mister morley lewrie chid him glaring at him as long as it was going to take til he swallowed hard what about them capum sir morley blushed you know the objections to shore leave to inland leavetickets mister morley lewrie explained turning to speak to them all the admiralty never knows when the foe will pop out they cant idle their ships with a third or a half of the crews out of reach they leave it to the discretion of captains now i ask you lads how many of you have ever had a captain that wouldnt grant shore leave to those hands he thought he could trust to come back hey damned few aha he thought and so much for how dangerous that question was and how many of you knew men who couldnt be trusted to come back who were just looking for the first chance to scamper that you would trust he dared pose slackers idlers backbiters quite a few it should be said but spithead put offcers an mates ashore sir a foremast sailor queried acts dont say nothin bout it does that mean we caint lewrie had wondered about that unwritten clause the settlement had reputedly contained that term and the last newspaper hed gotten his paws on before this mess had started of course had decried the removal or replacement of officers the spithead mutineers had thought as tyrants cruel floggers and drivers this was dangerous ground did he sound approving of it hed be labeled a radical himself did he not he might lose this wondrous unlookedfor chance to finagle his crew back to duty like here as i recall he began crossing his fingers for luck officers were put off at spithead and plymouth here there are officers who have already gone ashore of their own volition and i must tell you true does this ship not take down those yard ropes lower the red flags and return to duty i am ordered to depart and take all officers and midshipmen with me leaving you your appointed captain and mates seaman bales mister handcocks and that lot he was heartened more than he could have ever imagined to hear so many voices raised in sudden distressful woe that he was going to leave them every captain remaining will do so every officer still on mutinous ships he shouted the gooduns and the bad lewrie added did admiral lord howe agree to that at spithead it was after officers had gone ashore from those ships too i dont know how they agreed to it how the lists were made up how they determined which officers did not return aboard but damme lads dye think its a thing theyd scribble down for all to see oh christ ive just cut my own throat he told himself there goes mygood odour my career im tellin em how to purge officers pushin em towinnow the gunroom while they had a hearty laugh and began to hoot whistle and catcall in what he hoped he could construe as appreciation he dared to glance over at his officers warrants and midshipmen they looked dumbstruck by his admission some outraged some queasily appalled now as for the rest of your demands lewrie roared raising one hand to gather their attention again what for ships to be paid arrears in wages down to six months before sailing they cant help you on thatun lads theres a war on and england s short of cash in peacetime they might could but not now that rise in pay youve already won even if you never mutinied thanks to spithead that increase for pensioners too for sickberth hands and those crippled to be paid off the increase in rations to sixteen ounces instead of twelve or fourteen that takes money too you said you wanted newcome pressed men to get two months advance in pay like a joining bounty for volunteers admiralty cant afford that either back wages and indemnification made to men whove run once before then gone back in service the same problem with that and an encouragement to bountyjumpers whod do it over and over again and deprive you of funds useless damned shirkers the lot of em and well you know it given a choice would you have a thing tdo with em no i tell you damme im rollin now rantin like a leapin methodist your delegates wanted those jumpers and runners to keep what theyd stolen from your mouths when you were ready to sign on serve king and country heart and soul and then not be arrested as deserters when justice caught up with em what you want them rewarded is that what real english sailors wish or is it some foreign radical shit someone in paris dreamed up to undermine the royal navy more hoots more claps and cheers and cries of no damme he exulted no wonder the reverends look so smug this is fun you said you wished a fairer split of prizemoney he ranted on rocking on the balls of his feet gripping the caprail to lean out over them as he got on shakier ground threefifths stead of your twoeights well if spithead could concede that point and the prevailing division wasnt cause for them to kick furniture then should it not be good enough for you uhoh losin em well as long as a fine frigate such as our proteus is swingin round the anchor in the nore youre not takin prizes are you he hooted you give me my ship back ill take you out where we can find prizes scourge the seas and give you a chance to get bloody rich even under the old division that got them back they were the bulk of them growling like famished tigers for a chance at pillaging enemy ships the hardcore mutineers could only glower grimlipped and swear to themselves and the last alterations and amendments in the articles of war lewrie deigned to sneer but youll note your committees and delegates never spelled out what changes or deletions they wished did they because some of em are wanted men pickpockets and thieves whove stolen from shipmates before duckfuckers and buggers who prefer the windward passage who dont want to be courtmartialed for it maybe it concerns article three holding illegal correspondence with enemies article five the one against spies or seducing letters or numbers eight or nine about stripping anything they want out of a prize and stripping and abusing people taken aboard a prize damme do away with these and we might as well hoist the jolly roger and become pirates is that what you want another loud outburst of noes is it twelve they object to the one against cowardice in action and neglect of duty he posed strutting now as aggressive as a guinea cock fifteen desertion or running away with a ship and its stores sixteen the one against desertion itself enticing others to desert or are they trying to cover their arses by doing away with nineteen twenty and twentyone the ones covering mutinous assemblies seditious words hiding or covering mutiny and sedition shitstirring over unwholesome victuals they put that in your compact so no one would be punished later well what dye think the kings pardon is about then twentysix bosun pendarves roared from the base of the mainmast maybe they like to neglect the steering the cunnythumbed bastards twenyseven an well all be allowed tsleep on watch a sailor on the larboard gangway shouted so what the devil is it they wanted then does it make any sense to you lads lewrie asked them once that laugh had run its course what do your delegates really want look you yonder he pointed ashore towards sheerness yesterday lads you could see a flag flying on top of a house ashore the flag of the lords commissioners of the admiralty lord spencer was here im told they came to negotiate to tell your delegates that the spithead terms were official acts of parliament show your leaders that the kings pardon was real well do you see their flag flying now an hundred heads craned to look no you dont lewrie screeched and why is that because your delegates spoke for you and told em to bugger off that they wanted more that you wouldnt take the spithead terms of settlement and wanted to hold out for all sorts of impossible things that youd defy your king turn your back on your country when it needs you the most and spurn a perfectly good offer turn your guns upon sheerness defy the rest of the fleet threaten the nationso they had no choice but to leave and cut off the dockyard stores cut off the ration boats wasnt wicked ministers wasnt a tyrannical king caused that twas the pride and arrogance of your delegates thats enough bales howled summoning his stoutest henchmen said hed answer questions not rant lads he lies no let im speak damn yer eyes arra th capums talkin sense desmond countered give it up someone cried give it up take the terms no you damned cowards lickspittles and wheres my sword when i need it lewrie goggled seeing a pushing shoving match break out on every hand it was happening a sudden unorganised countermutiny lookit tother ships theyre striking colours runnin up white flags ships corporal burton screamed givin it up too it was true from what lewrie could see as he whirled about in a furious disoriented fugue that almost made him dizzy there were at least a halfdozen warships where the same sort of melees were breaking out where the ominous yard ropes were being hauled down to snake back to the decks and the unadorned red banners of rebellion were fluttering down to here and there be replaced with proper naval ensigns and white flags of submission hands were springing to the flag halliards to the racks of belaying pins or bitts which secured proteuss yard ropes just as many were swinging their fists flailing about with guntools or whatever fell to hand to prevent them the cowards the confused or hesitant the women and children were hanging back thundering in panicky herds from one gangfight to another turning this way and that in response to cries for help from those whod strike to bitter battlecries from those whod hold out resist take her back lads lewrie yelled stumbling as someone to his left shouldered into him he shoved back faintly recognised one of the afterguard before bringing a roundhouse right fist into juncture with the fellows skull king and country he stooped to pick up the dropped belaying pin the man had been about to cosh him with and waded in on those who were shouting objections the loudest he heard a rabbity scream got a quick glimpse of a loyal sailor being stabbed in the belly with a clasp knife heard the dread popping of a pistol right he thought a real battle and no quarter haslip came at him with a cutlass lips drawn back in a feral grin almost hissing with delight a turn or two a parry or two and lewrie had the mans blade far out from his body he clubbed haslip on the forehead as hard as he could and danced away as the man went down like a toppled marble statue landing so hard on his back that lewrie might conjure that hed shatter pisspoor sailor pisspoor swordsman too lewrie sneered as he traded the belaying pin for the blade he hobbled off aft under a misdirected swing or two jabbing at shins or knees to gain running room as he tried to join lieutenant ludlow who had both hands around a mans throat and was squeezing him blue midshipman peacham was partnered with ludlow of course laying about with an iron crowlever from one of the quarterdeck carronades and two sailors whod tried him on were already down and bleeding give it up lewrie urged to all give it up rally lt devereux was crying rally on me come on men and two or three of his marines were with him fistfighting their way forward to reinforce lt langlie and the other midshipmen there was a sudden report the stink of powder and the fearsome thud of acaliber ball slamming into someone quite near another shot and lewrie heard and felt a ball sizzle past his ear even more shots up forrud another scream of anguish almost lost in the highpitched screams of terrified women caught in the middle of this fight then the deep doorslam booommm of a cannon drop it sir mr handcocks snapped facing lewrie with his own cutlass best sir really he wheedled nothing like aggressive were winnin got th pistols got th muskets lewrie brought his cutlass up to touch blades with handcockss batting at it to beat it aside as the master gunner retreated keeping his sword in play but only on the defensive lewrie had no time to sport with him he launched himself into the drill with a righttoleft downward slash and handcocks responded with a twohanded parry stamping his foot for a backward slash though yelping and giving ground never trained in using an awkward cutlass the same as a smallsword avoiding the point which lewrie was probing at him another loud cannon boom then another quite near a splash of water that towered over the quarterdeck as one of the twodeckers anchored close to proteus started firing on any ship which looked like it was defecting from the mutiny throw down yer arms fore i kill him marine corporal oneil screamed to one and all holding midshipman elwes with one arm with a wickedly gleaming midshipmans dirk to the terrified boys throat punctuated by another cannon blast from the twodecker which this time rattled everyones teeth as a solid pounder roundshot struck proteus in her timbers in the lower wale below the gunports bales strode up a pistol in his right hand with the lock back at full cock another in his left at halfcock he jammed the righthand pistol hard against lewries skull stiffarmed from his side throw down before i kill him bales roared panting with exertion and emotion yet grinning like a deaths head and seeming eager for the opportunity its over dye hear there he bellowed throwing his head back like a wolf at the moon by jesus does any manjack continue to resist the lawful committee ill put a ball in the captains head hear me surrender you perjurers you lying canting hounds run up the red flags fore we get shot to flinders lewries cutlass was too long to do anything with it with bales so close to his right side he changed hands laid the blade flat upon his chest so he could stab to his right with it he moved it forward felt the tip meet resistance against flesh pucker a dingy chequered calico shirt almost begin to grate upon a rib be the last thing you ever do captain lewrie bales grinned yet almost on tiptoe to back off and still keep his pistol in contact with lewries skull then itd be worth it you shiteatin dog they glared at each other each determined to die if it came to it neither yielding the other even a blink as they locked eyes in a moment of ultimate truth yet grinning clatter of steel on oak though cutlasses clasp knives iron marlingspikes and guntools being dropped the thuds of wooden weapons being abandoned too as the threat took the last resistance away no lads dont give up on me lewrie pled we almost had her back too late bales singsonged triumphant lewrie almost wet himself as he felt something cold and sharp poke at the left side of his neck handcocks with his cutlass even if he took bales with him hed still die he didnt dare turn to look youll hang for that mister handcocks lewrie swore even if you dont hang for the rest youll die for that give it up please sir handcocks begged short sharp but th donnybrooks done an weve th ship again no harm done give it up you lot bales snapped to the men behind lewrie midshipman elwes your precious captain think your little bandll prevail even if it costs two more lives gentlemen gentlemen men mostlike dead already here bales cajoled for nothing see the masts yard ropes rove again flags hoisted again you made this happen out of pride and arrogance now atone give it up another final clatter of weapons as they hit the deck curses as proud men were forced to surrender you last sir bales said swivelling his gaze back to meet lewries corporal oneil unhand the wee midshipman will you and mister handcocks id admire did you step back not too far surrender your cutlass captain lewrie its not as if its your own sword of honour is it drop it or die for nothing ill see you in hell bales lewrie spat knowing he was going to drop the sword and hating himself for it soon as im ashore your namell be known as a murdering bastard and theres no place on earth you can ever run and hide not from the navy you cant ill take the chance bales shrugged as if was no threat at all lewrie gritted his teeth and straightened himself erect with a forceful exhalation he lowered the cutlasss tip to the deck by his left side willed his fingers to let it go to clatter on the pristine whitesanded quarterdeck and turned on his heel to walk away to see the pain the accusing pain in the eyes of his officers hed failed hed been a coward before them better hed died with his pride his honour intact by god captain lt wyman muttered brokenly with tears in his eyes one hand out as if to shake i am so sorry sir i let you and the rest down but i couldnt see mister elwes butchered nor you shot down sir forgive me ah lewrie gawped realising it wasnt accusation hed seen but commiseration and the shame of their own surrenders youre a brave young man mister wyman and an honourable one had it been a fair fight without such a dastardly ploy christ and when did i ever fight fair he chid himself havent i sneered my whole life at the very idea get the knife or the boot in first and make it look honourable fair fight mine arse almost took her sir lt devereux gruffly muttered coming up to offer his hand as well do better next time what now we know there are more than we thought whore with us lewrie agreed taking his hand i count on it as i count on you lieutenant devereux all of you for a moment there took us all by surprise sir lt langlie said staunching a bloody bruise on his handsome brow be better prepared organised aye though we are ordered ashore i hope theres a next time but in the face of that he gloomed looking about how many are hurt mister shirley wheres mister shirley and his mates ere sir surgeons mate mr durant piped up clambering to the quarterdeck from the waist he had his leather butchers apron on fresh from the lowerdeck surgery it his hands and rolledup shirt cuffs were speckled with blood the surgeon an msieur hodson are below sir there are several wounded an one dead sir a man sous le nom de scuse is name is beamish e was stabbed sir i saw that lewrie nodded grimly uhm the man here who was shot i thought i heard a man being shot too mister durant ah oui captain durant shrugged with gallic coolness e is ver bad hurt anozzer loyal seaman cest dommage peraps an even dozen below who need care too et vous msieurs any of you who need care lieutenant langlie your brow sir lieutenant ludlow nothing to you sir ludlow snarled bucket o seawaters a better cure than your sortd give me mister ludlow lewrie seethed mind yer manners sir ludlow had come up at the first sounds of rioting had come to fight which was a credit in his favour he now bore a bleeding gash on his swordarm and a bruise on his face which was already yellowing and bluing another mark to his credit still damn all frogs sir ludlow went on wincing as he flexed his fingers in experiment might ask thisun where all the radical ideas o th mutineers came from he knew beamish as a loyal man and he knew to call the shot hand as loyalist too wager anything i have he knew the names of the conspirators days before vous minus durant bristled vous cochon insultant here speak english you damned ludlow barked whats he sayin damme does he dare insult me mister durant lewrie interceded you will apologise to the first lieutenant for calling him a moron and an insulting pig he is your superior officer and such is not allowed from a warrant mate to a commission officer at once sir durant simmered looked fit to whistle like a tea kettle to have his gentlemanly honour malignedheaved a great sigh swallowed his pride and stumbled out an apology and mister ludlow lewrie intoned you will apologise to mister durant for your own harsh words and your supposition that mister durant is a traitor or in the pay of french agents why sir ill be damned if you will sir now lewrie snapped goddamnit one dead a man close to death a dozen wounded we dont have time for any of this petty shit more to the point dont i expect my officers to behave like gentlemen to the hands and to each other now sir very well sir ludlow flushed lowering his chin and turning nigh to burgundycolour mister durant i apologise my pardons merci msieur ludlow durant replied wcwrstiffly thankee mister ludlow lewrie said turning to face him i have orders for us to depart the ship all of us given the fact that you responded to our melee with alacrity and courage i release you from confinement let us pack our chests sirs there is light enough for us to get ashore before dark if we leave within an hour let me thank you all again he said peering at their downcast faces most especially ludlow s for all you tried just now but well excuse me for a moment or two dismiss he paced aft to the taffrails with failed resisters the fainthearted and the sneering victors all giving him a wide berth he took hold of the caprail gripping the timbers til his fingers screamed best chance wed have the last chance he groaned to himself and its a bloody failure have to slink ashore with my tail between my legs ceding the field and the ship to the mutineers he realised encouraging them and their little victory so theyd be even more obstinate less prone to settlement some distant firing made him spin about searching for a source there ah christ he sagged making things even worse for him at such a bleak low point was such a thing possible was the sight of a frigate from the inner tier of ships flying a blue ensign at her main and spanker gaff with her royal standard at the fore sailing into sheerness on the flood tide escaping as he and proteus hadnt lespion he thought she wascaptain james dixon hed wanted to visit her when he had timebefore the mutiny had happenedto see if her captain was the same james dixon whod commanded a sloop or smaller ship that had taken part in his turks island adventure back in and compare notes and reminiscences about that time perhaps dig up some juicy dirt on the way thencaptain horatio nelson had bungled that fiasco dixon had managed to overcome his mutineers dixon had won free he went back forward to the binnacle cabinet to study her with a glass aye it was lespion and in the yards hms niger another frigate that morning shed been flying the red mutiny flags but now she also sported the blue ensign in defiance christ why not us too he muttered in selfpity envious of those two ships which were now or soon would be as safe as houses in the welcoming bosom of the admiralty feeling like the weakest most inept idiot whod ever put on kings coat he put the glass back in the binnacle cabinet rack and paced to the larboard bulwarks for something to grab onto scathing himself as he tried to relive those few breathless moments of confusion seeking a way he hadnt tried but should have he looked down on the waters of the nore as they flowed and catpawed alongside just beginning to be bloodied by a faint red sunset lir he whispered hopelessly youre a blocdthirsty sort this is your ship then pagan vengeful this your way of taking care of another english bastard samez the way you sorted out the lastun well hurrah then you won you really want this ship for yourself heart and soul then stir your salty arse up and help me daft he told himself straightening and peering about quickly in fear that someone had overheard him and would deem him as lunatick as that captain churchwell had been just before hed fled proteus daft as bats he silently reiterated to himself pleading to a celtic seagod might as well read some sheep guts for all the good that does sacrifice pigeons no better that bastard bales hes yours lewrie silently vowed his hearts blood is yours if you help me chapter twentyeight by sundown he was ready to leave taking his sea chests and a few necessary articles he emerged in the waist to find another mob assembled to see him and the rest of the officers off he expected to be jeered at by the mutineers but evidently the brief fighting had battered any taunting out of them had sobered them to the enormity of what they were dedicated to continue no man thelp em a committeeman cautioned let officers carry their own traps fer once dont be a whole bastard lincoln curcy the lamed cook spat lend em a hand there we do require a working party for our dunnage mister lincoln lewrie calmly demanded boring him with his gaze no disrespect to officers and mates remember i certainly will you know when this is over ah uhm lincoln grumbled unable to match gazes with him perhaps fearing the further consequences and harried by protestations from other crew members right then reeve a staytackle aloft captain a bright call came from the quarterdeck leaving are you it was bales damn him in quite good cheer come to gloat seaman bales lewrie coolly replied turning to look at him once more detesting that their places were reversed youre more than welcome to stay aboard sir bales told him with a taunting mocking tone to his voice she is still your ship after all i have my orders lewrie snapped hands in the small of his back as im certain bales you have yours from your revolutionary paymasters oh sir when will you realise that your crew turned against you of their own accord oppressed too long by too many grievances bales sighed theatrically it would be more political theatre to the last lewrie grunted in disgust right lads bales prompted but didnt get the amens and cries of agreement which hed expected well he posed and even that left them mute and shuffling in embarrassment lecture and prose all you like when im gone bales but for now just do stop yer gob will you lewrie gravelled a fighter to the end would you bales smirked crossing to the starboard ladder which led down from the gangway to the waist a worthy opponent to the last damme captain lewrie i enjoy our debates so much im loath to part with you so i wont i beg your pardon lewrie gawped we took a vote didnt we lads ships committee all put our heads together and decided wed take your advice captain lewrie and purge the ship of officers and mates we wish gone for good knew was gonna regret those words lewrie bleakly thought now we cant do without the sailing master bales explained as he clumped down the steps to the gundeck taking way between crewmen as easily as a lord strolling down the strand might part the poor with his walkingstick so mister winwood will remain aboard her just in case he winked at those closest to him causing sly mirth i shant mr winwood erupted do you try and force me to sail her out ill put her hard aground youll get no aid from me well see about that mister winwood bales shrugged as if he had no doubts about his powers to coerce when the time came we also voted to keep the rest of the officers aboard as an assurance if you will gentlemen that the authorities ashore realise just how determined we are though not all oh my no not all you must go ashore lieutenant devereux most of your marines wished to keep you but after this afternoons little setto you proved yourself just a bit too doughty a fighter one too dangerous to keep nourished in our breast as it were like the proverbial viper bales that wellstudied insult will cost you a stretch of the neck i promise you devereux smoothly replied as if relishing the event already and with the greatest enjoyment mister ludlow too bales shouted lifting his arms to strut out into plainer view the worst of the slavedrivers and floggers he exulted to stir up the silent shambling crew he struck fire on that stroke raising grumbles of assent some glad cries of at last from others and his creature midshipman peacham too that drew a much louder cheer ludlow and peacham protested their honour impugned to the quick but anything they had to say was lost in jeers and catcalls damme bales you cant do this you cant pick and choose lewrie shouted to make himself heard you cant detain us when weve orders to leave either thats kidnapping thats ah but we like you so much sir bales told him as the catcalls and verbal abuse heaped on ludlow and peacham continued weve nothing against you or the rest adair hes a likeable fellow the other midshipmen are good lads bales almost cooed midshipman sevier that lackwit mister catterall hes a jester an empty shell with or without our chests bales were going ashore and i dare you to try and stop us lewrie threatened without a boat sir bales smirked and no hand willing to aid you i say youll not sir he chuckled his eyes crinkled with mocking mirth if i have to lay hands on you sir if i have to put a gun to your head again ill run that risk what do you have against me bales lewrie demanded feeling trapped again powerless and utterly frustrated youve acted as if this was a personal grudge twixt us since you rose up to capture the ship did we ever serve together did i ever do you or yours a bad turn dont know what you mean sir bales taunted grinning wider rose up gainst tyrants sir same as the others now do you wish to think its personal cause you cant feature your faithful sailors turning on you or youre growing fearful at last well that is your problem sir are you becoming a bit fearful sir damned right i am lewrie queasily thought but ill not give him the satisfaction oh dont keep lying to me bales you mustve served under me on ariadne back in the both of us under poor old captain bales thats where you found your present name isnt it joined the navy again under his name cause your own was too well never heard of him sir bales intoned deadpan never was on a ship named ariadne either he swore then turned away to regain the crews attention and dismissing lewries presence last now lads what we agreed to who among the officers does the captains chiefest bidding who worked us harder than the israelites in egypt hardern cuffy slaves cutting sugar cane in the indies the second officer mister langlie wasnt it mister ludlows too cupshot most of the time to work us just abuse us but mister langlie did so off the ship with him oh i say dammit langlie gaped astonished to be tarred as black as ludlow what utter rot didnt none o us vote fer that landsman furfy complained in a loud voice speaking for a majority of the hands who were as astonished by that pronouncement as lt langlie was damme dont ya trust yer committeemen mates mr handcocks bellowed well see ya right you can count on it why would they wish me ashore sir langlie fretted as hands fell to at lashing up lt ludlows chests whatd ever sideparty bales hooted see the tyrants off with proper honours at least hey lads damme im no tartar no plantation flogger sir lt langlie said pressed close to lewrie by the sailors coming to tote the expelled officers chests ludlow and peacham i can understand and good riddance to bad rubbish frankly but he whispered derisively in spite of being outschemed once more by baless latest blow to his covert plan lewrie allowed himself a frisson of relief that peacham and ludlow would be gone outwardly though he gave lt langlie a tiny shrug of agreement a wee moue of disgust because they wish to strip proteus of any officer the hands like mister langlie he spat anyone with courage or wits or bottom who the peopled listen to bring them back round and retake the ship ah langlie winced for a moment i think i see what you mean sir me lieutenant devereux a compliment really sort of no matter lewrie cut him off his mind awhirl to rebuild the shambles of his schemesand suddenly chillingly aware of just what sort of lies or halftruths the truculent lt ludlow and his creature midshipman peacham might impart ashoreto their own advantage to his detriment look weve no time to write a report why it seems that im disobeying orders to quit her but i am held against my will i still have hopes of retaking the ship and will try to parlay becoming hostages into something useful well of course sir langlie nodded encouraging him you must give the authorities a true accounting mister langlie lewrie bade him in a fierce whisper of his own you know all of the ringleaders who to accuse that most of the crews wavering more than a minority loyal he rushed out pressed to furious urgency to say a halfhours piece in a single minute state of rations how long they could hold out names of the dead blieve i know what needs telling sir langlie assured him with a firm determined expression to bring our nastiest villains to book where the real infamy lies no matter lieutenant ludlow is senior to you and his place to make the report its vital lewrie sped on stifling the urge to beg as he dropped his carronadesized hint rest assured captain lewrie lt langlie said coming over all noble ill speak of everything infamous aboard proteus everyone he added with a significantly arched brow thank bloody christ lewrie thought ahtother thing do you come across some leery sorts mister langlie lewrie rushed out as if langlies assurances that hed cover his arse for him were neither here nor there some civilians who have no business in this but do theyll be government agents spies same ones who smuggled the pardon and the acts of parliament aboard in the bumboats ask for one going by the name of willis i think hes working for a fellow ive met before hell understand tell him ive determined our rebellion is homegrown mostly but i fear there are some of a more dangerous stripe exploiting it for their own ends turning it political didnt begin it i dont think but lewrie stammered in his haste to get it all said soon as i alight sir langlie declared offering his hand to be clasped rightmanly and ill pray most strenuously for your safety and your success with the hands sir i trust ill serve under you again sir be proud to aboard a free untainted proteus thankee mister langlie and im certain you will lewrie said at last realising there was nothing more he could do or say he took langlies hand and gave it a welcome shake pray i see you too sir coming oer the lip of the entryport to reclaim your place as her first oops he grimaced what sort o slip is that hmm useful my pardons mister langlie lewrie all but managed to blush a thing devoutly to be wished perhaps but best left unsaid itd be disloyal to mister ludlow no matter his temperament and he attained a gruff sadness for his last abashed poor old fellow thank you captain er i say thank you langlie croaked bedazzled by the possibility of being so honoured to even accidentally be offered the post of first lieutenant as a mark of his captains esteem i swear ican hear the wheels turnin lewrie told himself see puffs o smoke from out his ears hooked gaffed and landed langlie finally let go lewries hand and stepped back a respectful distance so he could doff his hat in a parting salute before following his sea chest up to the gangway to take his place in the peckingorder of seniority decreed for the departure of officers lewrie was quite pleased to note how many sailors came up to langlie how many of the marines approached lt devereux to share a few last kind words assurances that they werent diedinthewool rebels too but you devious shit lewrie chid himself watching them depart with langlie as first officer instead of ludlow would i have even had a mutiny aboard now if langlie truly is ambitious his account would expose ludlow s insubordination hell he needed turnin out him and peacham both notjust for this ship but for the entire navy couch my final report the right way and ill purge em as good as spithead ships cleaned out their gunrooms he reluctantly went below to unpack once there he faced his coxn andrews padgett and aspinall who had just released toulon who was bristled up and carping angrily at the indignation almost made it ashore lewrie shrugged sorry bout that not your fault sir padgett replied looking miserable uhm aspinall sighed scuffing his toes now were tbe aboard sir your goose is cooked so it would seem so now wouldnt it lewrie barked sarcastically uh nossir meant your supper sir aspinall yelped meant twas a shame wed leave without it and do ya feel peckish i can fetch it from the galley sir be a shame it goes twaste oh lewrie relented smiling and blushing that my pardons aspinall but since it seems ill not dine at admiral buckners by all means trot my goose out i am hungry dry too a nice bottle o your claret and the goose comin right up sir and a tot o brandy ttide you over whilst i fetch em now what am i going to do he asked himself once hed gotten his paws about a large snifter of brandy devereux gone now langlie my stoutest fellow conspirators even ludlow and peacham dimwitted insultin truculent but bredinthebone foes of mutiny and eager to fight when you let slip their leashes caused half of it but they couldve helped put it down i still plan to retake the ship gawd he squirmed at his boasting to langlie what empty posturing that was as if i have leaders left who could sway the crew to help me bales had been right he determined wincing again in recrimination and hellishastute too those left catterall he was very witty and droll smarmyclever but was he reliable adair was promising a clever lad sevier was a lackwit just as bales had deemed him with nothing behind his eyes but rote dumb obedience nicholas and elwes were too young to scheme or dissemble they could run covert messages at best chat people up the hands liked them would they blush and duck their heads though were they put to whispering ideas to proteuss people in seemingly casual conversations most likely he groaned lieutenant wyman a likely lad a sweet young fellow too reliable ever cheery and genuinely liked by the crew earnest and brave determined to do his best but would it be enough lewrie could imagine lt wyman uttering my goodness graciouses with his eyes blared like a virgin chambermaid the first time someone put a hand neath her skirts we need a halfdozen o me lewrie decided in a black humour a pack of the real ruthless bastards bosun pendarves and his mate towpenny mr winwood and his mates thats five men mr garraway the carpenter at least two of his crew his mate jacks purser and his assistant sailmaker mr reyne and at least one from ms crew mr offley the armourer twentyfive or twentysix people all told god it still looked hopeless the marines now bales had said that most of the marines had wanted to keep lieutenant devereux aboardall but corporal oneil the irishman one of the united irish for certain three or four of the privates were with the hard core of mutineers corporal plympton the devon man though and sergeant skipwith theres where he should make a sly approach with twenty to twentyfive of the fourtyman marine complement allied with him there just might be a chance yet suppers served sir aspinall announced at last hmmpfh lewrie grunted as he rose to go forrud to his table even if it did seem hopeless at the moment at least he could keep up his strength for that later he dearly coveted chapter twentynine it seems theres more than one way to vote yourself out of the mutiny mister pendarves lewrie gleefully pointed out to the bosun and his mate mr towpenny as they supervised the gundeck crew through a rare river discipline sailmaking drill thats two ships gone he said that loud enough to be easily overheard by many of the hands near them yet casually enough he hoped that it would not come across as contrived it had been hard personally galling for him to get this sailmaking drill staged hed had to point out to bales that the crew had gone slack requiring exercise at seataskspractice at what lewrie had hoped was a rehearsal for their escapethen wait for bales to make up his mind as to whether hed allow it or not bless me not another sir pendarves replied almost as loud attracting even more hesitant attention as theyd rehearsed earlier the clyde frigate too mister pendarves lewrie shrugged at a seeming loss she isnt in the anchorage this morning and when i went aloft with a glass i could have sworn i spotted her anchored inshore must have slipped her cables and drifted into sheerness on the flood tide last night now san fiorenio too a bit more theatrical thathe grinned but out to sea on the ebb the san fiorenio frigate originally assigned to carry princess charlotte and her new husband had eloped in broad daylight sailing out to sea where a merchantman had guided her to deep water she had attracted vicious but poorly aimed and ineffective gunfire from nearby mutiny ships stalwart mutineers had crowed over the gunnery display jeering that such would be the fate of any deserter and who wanted such halfhearted bastards as them anyway but it had been sobering to proteus crew and after yesterdays brief counterrebellion and the restive misgivings his own sailors had felt after it had been put down by delegate force lewrie could conjure it had heartened those gnawed by grave doubts for san fioreno had sailed free no matter how the ships committee or fleet delegates explained it everyone could see that two ships had found their courage and their common sense and were now clear of damnation that atop his sailors misgivings and grudges were all to the good for his scheme proves it can be done lewrie gloomed to them and me maybe theyll take heart from it find the bottom to stand up to bales or maybe its already too latetwo ships escape they re sure to be on their guard now even stricter than before did we lose our best shot at it cause we failed yesterday buck up damn ye now perish all gloom and play up mehearty were halfway there i can smell it his crew was acting sullen and restive moody and grumbling at their drills in silent wooden obedience glumly going through the motions with their minds half on their own troubles over the necessity of drilling of course but for also still being there trapped and damned by admiralty by the nation itself now desmond thats not the way tbelay that clewsheet pendarves grumbled almost sighing at the futility of teaching hapless landsmen even a tenth of what a crewman had to learn lemme show ya again morning desmond furfy lewrie nodded most sunnily at his irishmen they mumbled back greetings torn between watching pendarves and the ropeend and their curiosity capum sir desmond whispered is it true sir that two ships got clean away looks that way desmond lewrie agreed faith an dye think any o their menll be hanged sir as they returned to duty now sir desmond queried fearful of the other sailors who might overhear and report him only the villains id expect desmond lewrie informed him only the villains aye them asd kill a body do e not keep his oath furfy almost shuddered there are tyrants lewrie muttered guardedly and then therere tyrants furfy it seems therere tyrants before the mast too furfy was a simple soul lewrie suspected his large bulk seemed to deflate to half its size as he heaved a helpless sigh but shook his head up and down in agreement as if completely lost or doomed bad as th houghers or whiteboys michael desmond commiserated join help out keep mum or die cause theyll niver let a body go bout his own busness nor stand apart i never thought willing duty was tyranny though lads lewrie hinted wondering what in blazes desmond was talking about some antienglish secret societies back in ireland broke their bibleoath they did though sir desmond carped in a louder voice as they all sensed the presence of a committeeman on the gangway above them for his own protection lewrie decided no goodll ever come from such as that capum the committeeman an ordinary seaman named ahern another irishman gave a faint nod of approval and a sniff of satisfaction before he turned his attention to other things and whats the value of a bibleoath exacted at the point of a sword desmond lewrie posed one thatd drag you down to hell do you honour it along with the cynical bastards who bound you with it furfy the faint soul automatically crossed himself desmond was made of quicker wits though for he slyly smiled why twould be no oath atall sir desmond chuckled softly now was a man ttake an oath worth honourin capum lewrie wasnt sure what desmond was getting on about that time either but he felt it wouldnt go amiss did he reward him a wink and a tap of his forefinger beside his nose before resuming his seemingly casual stroll about the decks towards the quarterdeck seeking out sergeant skipwith to see what he might have to say he found him supervising practice with a quarterdeck carronade these marines were free of pipeclayed crossbelts cartridge boxes waistcoats hats and bayonets of the sentries though they still wore their short hangers on their left hips hung from shoulderbelts discipline was still at full bore though for they still wore their hair pulled hard back in a tarstiffened queue formed over a rat and were sporting the cruel stiff leather neckstocks no matter that they worked at an unmarinelike exercise charge with cartridge skipwith intoned and one man pretended to cradle a sewn cartridge bag of powder into the squat gun bore while a second man plied the flexible rope rammer down the barrel to seat the imaginary charge shot your piece and the first man pretended to heft a pounder ball down the bore lewrie waited til theyd gone through the steps of ramming the shot down firm against the cartridge stepping back and seizing up the runout tackles pricking the cartridge bag down the touch hole priming the flintlock igniter fiddling with the elevation screw tightening the compression baulks to either side of the slide carriage and pretending to traverse aim and fire three rounds in two minutes sergeant skipwith lewrie asked detachment shun skipwith yipped and sprang to quivering attention as if lewrie had snuck up on his blind side and goosed him aye aye captain sah three rounds in two minutes sah at least long as youre loading such heavy cartridge and shot sergeant lewrie chuckled well er aye sir skipwith darkened making his gunteam smirk as much as they thought they could get away with but i know well make three rounds in two minutes when its for real sir i get us out to sea where we can load and fire for real then well see sergeant skipwith lewrie said strolling up to lay a hand on the breech of the short pounder i did not time you but i am certain you were managing quite well men as lieutenant devereux had assured me you would even if it is unfamiliar to you hmmm he thought three more who seem crestfallen at the mention of their absent commander now that they were freed from the demanding but mindless labour and had time to dwell upon it marines can do anything do they put their minds to it right sergeant lewrie joshed ever and amen sir skipwith proudly barked even unbending enough to display a rare smile of pleasure mister devereux said we could do it sir thelp the captains sailors out sir then we will do it sir of course given the anarchy of the times he dared put in a sly dig at sailors as marines ever would that put a beamish glint in every lobsterbacks eyes for a second or so and stiffen their backs with pride as they stood at attention by the gun been at it long have you sergeant skipwith lewrie enquired offhandedly halfhour sir skipwith told him well then id imagine a turn at the scuttlebutt up forrud would not be sneered at lewrie allowed besides all the rumbles are scaring my cat out of a years growth even making my gunners go green with envy hey aye aye sah skipwith replied taking the hint squad quarterhour interval dismiss after the privates had sloped off towards the water butts lewrie turned to sergeant skipwith sorry if i interrupted sergeant and for presuming to issue orders direct stead of through your own officers but since lieutenant devereux is ashore understood sir skipwith replied a tad less starched whats their mood this morning sergeant skipwith lewrie asked clapping his hands in the small of his back whilst pretending to inspect the carronade any of them wavering after yesterday an idea of how many of the marine complement we could trust did we ah sir skipwith gravely nodded stepping up closer as if responding to a question lewrie had posed about the gun beg pardon for sayin so sir but i was hoping you were still of a mind to take back the ship even if mister devereux is now ashore sir i am lewrie vowed sure he could trust skipwith to keep mum could have done it yesterday had we known thered be a scuffle among the hands corporal oneil though goddamned paddy duckfucker skipwith graveled umm beg yer pardon sir thought prettymuch the same of himlewrie snickeredwhen he put that dirk to mr elwess throat many of his sort sergeant nossir skipwith replied twisting up his face in disgust at

chances tmake him proud be proud of themselves too sir theyre close tgivin it up i think be hard to get anything done on the sly though sir committee has said they wont let anyone assemble below after lights out anymore dont want any of what they call perjurers to the oath sir but you could still stir the pot sergeant lewrie queried into sheerness out to sea either way depending on when it comes and the tide state well need to be ready to spring into action at a moments notice fiddle with your watchandquarter bill perhaps isolate oneil and that mollo the others in one watch halfandhalf sir skipwith suggested then its only three toverpower on deck and three tjump below decks just as long as they dont get excited and start titterin in their hands lewrie warned give the game away fore aye theyre younguns ill allow sir skipwith gloomed but theres some with foreheads biggern a hen we could tell off at first he quickly added with a hopeful set of his shoulders and you know how it is captain sir skipwith leered as scared of a noose as most ofem are now they see how things stand praps theyll be more gulpynervous than titterin an the ringleadersd not know the diff rence and they are

frigates managed to cut free well sir im certain they wont sergeant thankee lewrie replied giving skipwiths shoulder a grateful squeeze you carry on with the undermining and shuffling and ill search us out the opportunity do you tell em ill move heaven and earth to get their officer back aye sir ill pass that along sir pleasin lewrie felt like humming to himself as he resumed his strolling all but strutting with delight its comin together maybe as soon as tonight once its dark as a boot sheerness or seaward thats the question seaward id prefer but inshore might have to suit look up mr wyman the middies have em in for dinner aha let em know we can now count on the marines make a final list of friends or foes hells tinny little bells as downcast as shitscared as most of the people look this mornin we justmight could pull it off tonight backed into a corner damned by everyone from lands end to john o groats time runnin out on em one wordd send em to their knees in gratitude mostlike we could cheering interrupted him making him snarl petulantly a reedy thin distant cheering from down the line of anchored ships that began at the far end and swelled towards proteus like the onset of a gale he went to the bulwarks to see what nonsense had them going this time another parade of boats and bands oh christ he gasped espying a cloud of sail offshore a glass now he bade turning his head to see midshipman sevier near the binnacle cabinet my glass mister sevier quickly once he had it in his hand he slung it over his shoulder like a carbine and scampered into the larboard mizzenmast shrouds til he was above the catharpings near the fightingtop dutch french he fretted opening the tube out of its full extent panting a bit too and damning the enforced idlness of these last few days surely it wasnt his fault that a brief ascent winded him there enemy ships come from the texel before admiral duncan could take up his blockade the van division of a feared invasion no they were beamreaching off a northerly which would blow a deadmuzzier for the texel s narrow north shore exit so they couldnt be the dutch fleet french then no again he grumbled theyd have had to come upchannel first weather the straits of dover the downs and goodwin sands channel fleet itself come to shoot the nore ships into submission well maybe but the tailend ships seemed as if theyd come from the north scudding off the northerly winds before they wheeled about inlineahead to follow the others which were coming in for the queens channel and the outer anchorage on a soldiers wind duncan he cried with glee the north sea fleet ordered to the nore to put the mutiny down someone found his nutmegs at last now well see something by god he lifted his glass again leaning back into the shrouds with one arm cocked through the ratlines smug with victory and pitying the poor fools who were cheering the sight of the arriving ships in a halfhour when they opened their gunports and ran out their batteries theyd be laughing out the other side of their necks ah he shuddered perhaps not for atop the oncoming lineofbattle ships foremasts he saw a dread red plainness to the flags they flew no royal cantons no cross of st george or st andrew plain stark red battle flagsmutiny flags aye the north sea fleet had arrived in open rebellion chapter thirty a bloody unmitigated damned disaster lewrie fumed pacing furiously from starboard to larboard in the daycabin of his quarters while his remaining officers and midshipmen stood or sat enough to make a man weep sir mr winwood spat looking as close as hed ever come to letting his despair overpower him thirteen sail of the line they have now nigh on ten thousand seamen and marines in rebellion encouraged he trailed off in a sigh theres been battles won with less midshipman catterall had the lack of tact to say almost under his breath and even mr adairs warning elbow in his ribs only caused him to grunt and glower back in ill humor he was senior midshipman two years older than adair and the cock of the orlop cockpit ever the nudger not the nudgee oh yes there have been mister catterall lewrie sniped back thank you so much for bringing that historical fact to our attention uhm sorry sir catterall reddened trying to pull his head in like a tortoise he found something intricate in the turkey carpets design to be fascinated by the heart of admiral duncans north sea fleet the bulk of his twodecker gun warshipsmontagu belliqueux repulse standard lion and nassau along with the inspector sloop and the fireship comethad come in around pm the previous afternoon captain william blighs hms director had been part of that fleet but had mutinied whilst anchored at the nore so no one expected that admiral duncan had much left to work with if he still intended to blockade the texel channels if it came to a fight with channel fleet to put down this mutinyif one could still call it a strictly naval mutiny and not a burgeoning revolutionit would be a closerun thing even if channel fleet owned larger more powerful s s and ships of the st and nd rate compared to the weaker shallower draught s from great yarmouth more useful near the dutch shoals if it came to a fight lewrie glumly suspected itd be no fight at all channel fleet might have been saved from mutiny most of the grievances satisfied but would that be good enough for them to fire upon other british tars should that come itd surely be the end of the royal navy mostlike he imagined the two fleets would meet and blend overthrow authority again and would then be fully provisioned at sea beyond the reach of reason not just the royal navy though oh no perhaps it would be the tiny spark in the pan like that one at lexington in the lost american colonies that had begun the revolt against the crown and britain would be torn asunder republicans and jacobinist levellers versus royalists hardpressed as the commoners were by the demands of the war and the new taxes it might be wealthy against poor too the irish of course encouraged to throw off the yoke of english occupation scotland too uneasily forced into submission since the last rising of the clans in the there is the possibility the new arrivals are not victualled as well as the original mutinous ships sir mr coote offered in a hopeful gesture and with supplies now refused them perhaps they cannot stay here at the nore for very long i rather doubt that mister coote lieutenant wyman sighed though it is wishful they were to all accounts provisioned for an extended spell of blockade duty off the dutch coast from what i heard from our rumourmill they defected after receiving sailing orders to join admiral duncan meet him at some rondy somewhere off the coast lt wyman did not wear disappointment well he looked like hed aged ten years in the last two days and was not as prone to appearing surprised or startled any longer most unlieutenantlike he slouched on the starboardside upholstered settee with his legs out and his hands in his breeches pockets like one of hogarths sketches of an idle roisterer with a killing head the morning after and where do they think theyd get provisions with every port closed to em mister coote lewrie fretted aye mostlike they are wellprovisioned for up to six months at sea gawd cant last that long can it sir midshipman adair queried else the wind shifts sooner or later and the dutch get out to sea the french fleet at brest bound for ireland weve been fortunate in the weather so far sir thats so sir the sailing master nodded stuffing tobacco into his clay church warden pipe but a man whod depend on weather for his salvation is the hugest sort of fool i cannot but think that the merciful hand of providence has controlled the contrary winds this long during our travails sirsto grant his most favoured nation a space in which to save ourselves but such divine mercy is not forever a tiny space lewrie mused mussing his hair as he came to a stop behind his desk for a moment envying mr winwood the comfort of his pipe and tobacco hed never taken up the custom and the time he had been forced to smoke with the muskogee indians during the revolution hadnt exactly made him a devotee of the noble weed is it not true mister winwood that god helps those who help themselves as you say its only the fools who lift their hands in supplication depending on the lord not their own efforts to save their skins well there are some believers sir winwood winced not in the established church of course who hold that is the almighty truly almighty he can do anything even for the weakest and most powerless it has been my experience though sir that was a man adrift at sea in a small boat amid a raging gale the good lord might look down more kindly on the sort whod strive in league with divine assistance not lay whimpering in the bilge sir though i must confess the bible is replete with examples of the utterly hopeless being salved at the last moment through no action on their part but deep abiding faith and a fervent prayer he puffed away quite contentedly wreathing himself in aromatic blue fumes after delivering what to lewrie sounded mightily like a paradox this but on the other hand take the case of abraham sir and the offering of his beloved son on the altar in the desert wilderness mr winwood began to expound youve prayed fervently on this i take it mister winwood lewrie asked him well aye sir winwood admitted as if surprised that anyone might suspect that he had not and i take it that all of you gentlemen as christian english gentlemen have prevailed upon the good lord for guidance and succour for victory over our foes and a way out of our wilderness oh of course sir they mumbled back as if by rote though looking a bit cuttyeyed that they had perhaps not but were making the proper noises then we cannot fail lewrie thinly smiled tossing in a stab at hardy noble christian gentleman himself and with divine aid we will retake proteus god willing he piously concluded and thus endeth the epistle he sourly thought having no time for winwoods parsonlike pontificating or is it here endeth damme i must pay more attention next time im in church but how sir now that lieutenant wyman waffled aye theyre encouraged mister wymanlewrie grinned at him ill grant you for the nonce i doubt though that these newcome ships are as radical as some theyve not been cut off from news from london and know of the royal pardon and the acts their arrival here at the nore is i suspect a temporary thing their way of assuring themselves theyre included in the terms showing support for the nore sailors who might appear to be excluded for the moment dont know that at all he admitted to himself whistling past the graveyard spinnin fairyshite doubt theres been much communication tween great yarmouth and the nore either they havent had a chance to take their measure of our mutineers once they see what a pack of radicals they are theres more than a good chance itll make em queasy were still anchored out in the seaward row close to the queens channel the newcomers are crowded in on either end were still dealing with the two ships anchored closest to us and one of those came within a quimhair of overpowering their mutineers now granted the other one fired into us but if we continued saildrill making up to short stays before backing and filling we can lull them to think nothing of it just as we originally planned weve most of the marines on our side now ready to act the next time sir are you sure theyre still with us now the mutinys reenforced and their spirits lifted mr coote worried aloud a day or twos excitement lewrie said dismissively hoping that he was right feeling forced to be optimistic if only to prevent his officers from sinking into the blue devils a day or two more and theyll be back to their doubts and misgivings thinking of the courtsmartial and gibbets heres what we should rumour about the north sea fleet is here so they can be included in the spithead terms and nothing more theres no contact allowed with them either so our hands wont know the diffrence but they would sir mr adair plumbed the fault to it quite quickly the fleet delegates will swear theyre in agreement with all their terms unless they already are sir midshipman catterall gloomily pointed out you are quite the font of cheer mister catterall lewrie said rather frostily delivering a withering glower right then we say theyve been deceived now theyre here cause theyve no wish to be against crown and country or be part of a floating republic forever theyre ready to sail to aid admiral duncan even if the delegates in the pay of foreign powers wish to prevent it plausible he asked and our people are already leery of the fleet delegates and their radical insolence to authority sir midshipman adair excitedly chimed in why they already take half what they say with a handful of salt north sea ships and ours deceived thats the spirit lewrie nodded with pleasure he had put a bit of iron back in their spines and had cobbled together new reasons for his ships hands to despair once more thank you gentlemen i think we should begin spreading our moonshine and about time for us to conduct sailmaking drill hmm ill be on the deck later to see how it goes both the saildrill and our rumourmongering once they had departed though he flung himself into his desk chair with a fretful sigh and rang a tiny bell for his steward any coffee left on the candle warmer aspinall nough for a cup at least sir comin right up aspinall delivered the cup atop a new sennet place mat as intricate as holland lace nice work that complex lewrie idly congratulated him aye sir some o the irish ladsre teachin me their gaelic knots aspinall proudly admitted under andrewss and others tutelage aspinall had become quite good at decorative ropework fashioning some brooches bracelets even rings as well as place mats and such some of em still know their old ways what they call celtic ill pare a bit more sugar for ya sir wont be a tick lewrie studied his mug the coinsilver engraved present from his former jesters while aspinall scraped at the beehiveshaped lump of sugar in the small pantry hmmm he stared at the engraving setting it down to rotate it with a thoughtful expression admiring the profile of jester rushing along with all plain sail set a bone in her teeth led onward by that mysterious forearm and sword with the dolphins and seals dancing aspinall he mused aloud sir you associate much with our newcome irish do you some sir are many of them in on the mutiny dye think lewrie asked not that many sir aspinall discounted most of em are as poor as churchmice just wantin decent wages and a chance to get by sir not much work in ireland troubles and risins and most of em wishin a wide berth o those like desmond and furfy count them with any education on the fingers o one hand sir a chearly lot i must say though for all that singin and hornpipin at the drop o your hat sir full o grand stories too sir why irishmen could talk the birds from the sky and not repeat themselves for three days runnin sir you ever tell them stories aspinall they pump you for information lewrie pressed a captains steward could be an unwitting font of intelligence for the disgruntled some stewards traded on their access lord sir get a word in edgewise aye some bout how we had a lucky ship sir and you a lucky captain ever tell them all about jester lewrie pressed getting inspired at this welcome news and the strange fey things we saw he swiveled the mug about and pointed at the dolphins and seals and the seagods arm tapping his finger by them and how much do they know about proteus they came aboard after chatham they may not know all her short history her launching the change of her name the irish sawyer and his boy who convinced her to take water dribs an drabs here an there i spose sir aspinall said with a shrug that proteus was an ancient seagod aspinall lewrie smiled a very old shapechanging seagod this ship murdered a protestant angloirish vicar drove an angloirish captain ashore mad as a hatter but so far he added rapping his knuckles for luck she has nothing against me for ive seen an old seagod jester and me we were a lucky ship together a blessed ship aspinall but by whom by at ole lir sir aspinall replied and lirs an irish seagod aspinall lewrie nodded happily lir proteus same old gentleman cleared her hawse proteus did so id come aboard her as captain god i am such an egotistical bastard he silently grimaced to himself and a damned liar too oh i think i get yer meanin sir aspinall grinned slyly a proud willful ship a living ship she is lewrie said too proud to let herself be shamed by serving an angloirish captain too proud and haughty to be involved in something shameful either and too savage in her anger gainst anyone whod let her be shamed in his name vengeful arrogant bloodthirsty a ship to serve chearly in his name lord sir aspinall gulped talk like at fair gives me th shivers your irish mates forrud they tell their old tales like they halfbelieved em aspinall lewrie smirked oh aye they do sir even desmond besteducated o their lot sir all his songs an stories you tell em our songs and stories aspinall lewrie schemed jester and the burial the seals the seals off italy the morning we caught that french bastard choundas in the adriatic at that pirate isle proteus wants out of here aspinall before shes smeared in shame for all time and no good what do they call it no good cessll be in her if she doesnt for any manjack who doesnt aid her or him whose name she secretly bears can you whisper that to em lad oh aye sir i can aspinall agreed you and the bosun he already knows her nature hunt up bosun pendarves mister towpenny theyre west country men almost good as irish you tell em for me aspinall i cant twould sound like crowing and get me tossed in gaol as a hereticor bedlam as a loonie ill get started then sir iff n ya dont need nothin else no nothing else aspinall you go visit your irish friends god helps those who help themselves he told himself after his steward had departed now which god welleither one ya know im desperate and a gallopin lie in a good cause is forgivable chapter thirtyone another day another harangue lewrie thought with a scowl as he pared his nails with a small pocket knife the boatparade of delegates had come with a band flags their green cockade speakers and another rant that just might take up half the forenoon watch if past performances were anything to go by must be gettin dotty he told himself but im almost lookinforward to the entertainment he sat most uncaptainly slouched in his personal woodandcanvas folding deckchair of his own devising feet up on the compass binnacle cabinet conveniently near the speaker so he could hear all that transpired yet far enough away to disclaim any real curiosity enjoying the wan sunlight and fresh air should anyone enquire lazily as was his secret wont now hark ye twhat those cringin cowardly tyrant ministers from london have sent us thinkin wed cringe an knuckle under the idiot mccann raved from the forward edge of the quarterdeck brandishing a sheet of paper over his head ahem he announced lowering it so he could read it george rex whereas he bellowed upon th rep represent damme lewrie had himself a pleasing smirk of glee over mccanns nigh illiterate ignorance well hidden by the shade of his cocked hat of our lordscommissioners of our admiralty respectin th proceedins of th seamen and marines on board certain of our ships at th nore hah all ships at th nore an more to come count ont lads here uhm where th devil was i ahem we were pleased to command our lordscommissioners of our admiralty to signify to th seamen and marines our gracious intentions ex hmmph under our sign m manmeans he writ his namethen bearin date at saint jamess th th day of may instant and whereas our right trusty and beloved devil take em he says earl spencer th lord arden and rear admiral young are trusty th old halfwit loony as a bedbug an everbody knows it here someone with good eyes read this shitten thing brother bales youre a scholard aint ye bales lewrie noted was ever eager to step forward and bask at centrestage a quickly whispered conference mccanns tarry finger on the place hed left off and bales began to declaim did cause our gracious intentions expressed in our declaration to be signified to the crews of our ships at the nore and did require such crews to return to their due obedience accordingly and whereas it has been represented to us that some of the crews of our said ships have been desirous of returning to their obedience accordingly but have been prevented from doing so by violence who by jesus mccann howled peering about the gathered hands as if seeking witches in new england making the crowd of sailors balk and cringe no one i know wants treturn tduty by god violence twaddle were free men here of our own free will for th cause then why lewrie almost chuckled to himself did fleet delegates now travel in very wellarmed packs escorted by weaponsheavy guards read on brother bales read on mccann boomed bales shrugged then turned back to face the crew below him in the waist crowded on the gangways ah doing so by violence and others of our ships in the actual discharge of their duty having been fired upon and attempts having been made to prevent some of our ships from proceeding according to the orders of their commanders and whereas such continued perseverance in rebellious and treasonable attempts against our crown and dignity bales began to mutter and frown at those words and lewrie perked up his own ears rebellious and treasonable were not words idly bandied about louder damn ye we cant hear some hands demanded uhm after repeated admonitions and offers of our gracious pardon render it necessary for us to call on all our loving subjects to be aiding and assisting in repressing the same listen mate we best not bales fretted turning to mccann as if pleading to leave off go on brother bales louder whats it say then mccann insisted oblivious to the consequences bales dashed a hand cross his brow as if sweating lead pistolballs he peered about the deck for a bit of help it looked like someone with sense he might appeal to lewrie lowered his feet blew breath on his nowtrimmed nails and sauntered a few feet further forward suddenly filled with hope as he realised that the kings letter was an ultimatum bales heaved a petulant despairing shrug then continued where he had broken off we have thought fit by the advice of our privy council to issue this our royal proclamation and we do hereby strictly enjoin all our admirals generals commanders and officers of our forces by sea and land and all of our magistrates whatsoever and all others of our loving subjects that they in their several stations do use their utmost endeavours according to the law to suppress all such mutinous and treasonable proceedings and to use all lawful means to bring the persons concerned therein their aiders and abettors to to justice some few still dared to boo or hiss like geese the rest stood rooted by alarm it was an ultimatum his majestys patience had come to an end and we do hereby strictly enjoin and command all of our loving subjects whatsoever not to give any aid comfort assistance or encouragement whatsoever to any person or persons concerned in any such mutinous and treasonable proceedings as bales paled as they will answer the same at their peril and also to the utmost of their power and according to the law to prevent all other persons from giving any such aid assistance comfort or encouragement given at our court at saint jamess the st day of may and in the th year of our reign g god save the king what mccann erupted in spittleflinging fury goddamn th y bugger is more like it listen brother bales its whats written here you fool bales screeched back at him see it its how any royal proclamation ends damn your eyes glorious lewrie felt cause to exult in his heart oh thankee jesus maybe lir too they should never have read that to the mutineers when the crown spoke of rebellion or revolution and portrayed the mutineers as treasonable that could get hundreds hung higher than haman and to order the entire nation to deny any mutineer aid comfort to deem anyone who did as coconspiratorslike the romans lewrie could recall from his schooldaysexiles had to leave the furthest border of the empire and never return shunned as lepers and denied all aid on the wayneither fire nor food nor forage he thought the phrase was or end up nailed to a cross exile and aider alike the king demanded that family neighbours friends wives even shopkeepers publicans and whores shun the mutineers now the children flee from their fathers sight lest they be tainted and taken up opportunity lewrie exulted look at em waver even the stout radicals grim as a cartload of condemned men on the way to tyburn and the gallows empty threats i tell ya mccann ranted too stupid to realise the harm hed done his cause the common folk are with us we got th north sea fleet in spite of any royal decree thirteen ships of th line strong enough tsail right up tlondon bridge smashin all th forts along th way take th arsenal at woolwich all th guns shot an powder gather up th soldiers too just ripe for comin over to us and dont ye doubt it brothers theyre tremblin in their boots and youre whistlin past the graveyard lewrie thought now lads ill show ye how our floatin republic answers those highflown tyrants an butchers wrote in plain english not all that giltan beshit ahem mccann said producing another letter brother mecann lewrie could hear bales urge laying a hand on his arm to dissuade him its too much for them theyre fearful let em stew an fester on the kings writ brother bales no they shant thisll nip fear in th bud are you growin fearful brother bales turnin cool to th cause backin off like parker is mayhap this ship should elect you daytday like we do him nossir lemme go ahem mccann shook loose of baless restraint and drew a deep breath my lords he roared we had th honour treceive your lordships proclamation for we dont conceive it tbe his majestys accompanied by an insipid address from admiral buckner they met with th fate they justly deserved how could your lordships think tfrighten us as old women in th country frighten children with such stories as th wolf and raw head and bloody bones or as the pope wished to terrify th french republic with his famous bull at th beginnin of th revolution know gentlemen that were men men long tried for courage and per perseverance in a cause not altogether so interestin to ourselves as the present shall we then now be induced from a few paltry threats tforsake our glorious plan an lick your lordships he paused to titter feet for pardon an grace when we see ourselves in possession of thirteen sail of as noble ships as any in his majestys service and men not inferior to any in the kingdom do we demand anything but what justice licenses and preservation approves th few reasonable articles weve presented to your lordships should have been attended to in a respectful manner otherwise by your deferrin it a few days longer some others may pop up their terrific heads tstare your lordships in the face we have nothin more tsay but hope you will take th necessary steps to save the country from a civil war which may end in th ruin of yourselves and uneasiness in our gracious sovereign to whom we have ever been and will be loyal whilst theres a chance oi our grievances bein addressed with regard to our havin fired at th san fiorenio be it known to you that we are very sorry that we could not sink her as without regard to th league she had entered into with us she basely deserted we wish your lordships likewise tobserve that th article number six shall extend to all persons condemned to imprisonments or any other punishment by th sentence of th courtmartial as well as to prisoners who have not been tried and that all persons now aboard labouring under any such sentence be from this time entirely free we have th honour tbe your lordships very humble servants th seamen of th fleet at th nore god lewrie shuddered in awe now youve really stepped in the quag right up to your eyebrows i wouldnt post a letter like that to a dead lawyer threatening civil war my lord if the kings proclamation hasn t taken the wind from their sails then that damnfoolery surely did of all the belligerent boneheaded chatter was breaking out on every hand again and the stunned mutterings pro and con swelled up from the gundeck out of his sight lewrie began to walk forward into that maelstrom of doubt sorting his thoughts for a choice telling phrase or two which would scuttle bales mccann and proteuss mutiny once and for all no keep him back there bales cried wheeling about as one of his minions tugged at his sleeve to point out lewries intentions not this time you dont see im below he ordered those supporters on the quarterdeck hes nothing new to say to us ill not have it all officers mates and midshipmen will go below now and before the crew knew he might have spoken before most even could espy his presence lewrie was seized and hustled aft to the companionway near the taffrails and down the narrow ladder to his cabins the arched crosshatched timber hatchcover was slammed down over it a moment later as lewrie stood massaging his arms where theyd taken hold of himthough with a lot less violence than hed expected from them fear of the consequences lewrie suspected now the consequences had risen gallows high the door to the gundeck slammed open against the partitions of the chartspace and aspinall padgett and coxn andrews were hurled inside to join him in the few bleak seconds allowed him lewrie got a glimpse of sailors gesticulating and jabbering back and forth angry fists being shaken in faces some making pushoff gestures of conciliation as they argued for or against continuing the mutiny amidst wails from the confused womenfolk and mccanns voice which soared over them all rasping harsh and shrill so loud his words could clearly be made out even through the thick deck timbers overhead spread th ships out so we really give th lyin bastards summat tthink about we dey threatenin tflog any mon who goes against de oath sah douse him in th sea andrews carped rubbing his arms as if to wipe the mutineers taint off not to ease bruised flesh he was scowling hellishangry even after years of freedom after running away from his slavemasters on jamaica he showed an aristocrats loathing for being pawed at ssshh lewrie bade him pointing a finger aloft wont issue rations then well take what we need mccann was bristling hundreds o merchantmen every day navy storeships be fair game too a feast bound upriver tlondon in every bottom by order of th fleet parliament well starve london swing th people oh lord thats revolution for sure sir aspinall gasped hush lewrie snapped all but cupping his hands to his ears anythin perishables free but grain coal anything else well stop here in th thamesmouth lads brother seamen in merchant ships theyll side with us o course they will by next week well be twenty thousand thirty thousand strong in a fortnight well lay our guns on alia london do they not give us our due brother bales upanchor an make short sail for the rest trailed off into gibberish then nothing when mccann stopped talking for the horde and directed softer comments to bales lewrie dropped his hands to his sides and lowered his gaze to stare at his tiny clutch of loyalists oh lord sir aspinall said again in a weeer voice they really meanta start a rebellion damn traitors they are were all along sir an just hidin hit til hark sah andrews said cutting him off cocking his head to one side but they could all hear the drum of horny feet on oak decks the rustle and thump of coiled sailtending lines being taken down from the racks of belaying pins and dropped on the deck where theyd feed out smoothly the preparatory creak of rope as men scampered up the shrouds and ratlines to the tops and upper yards the groan of the capstan as it was slowly rotated to free its drum before the messenger cable could be led to it and wound about it so the ship could be heaved into shortstays above her bower anchor proteus trembled gently to the movements as bales and his mutineers prepared her to get underway lewrie went forrud to the door and pulled it open to look out at what was going on hoping someone anyone might put up strong objections but worried as they seemed they were still cowed by rote duty cowed by force of arms and the threat of punishment from their rebellious leaders the habit of obedience drummed or lashed into them damn em nossir landsman haslip leered at him with a musket held at portarms across his chest you stay blow sir he insisted taking stance to block lewries exit at his shoulder was marine private mollo also armed with a musket an no talkin neither dont ave no need o you sir none atall he grinned evilly the deck was its usual bedlam of course as gangs of men stood crowded together at jears halliards liftlines clews and sheets and no ship ever had room on deck for all of them to work at once not with all those men at the capstan the nippermen along the messenger and the heavier cable it was shouldertoshoulder as dense as the packing of slaves on a blackbirder on the middle passage and with so many women and a fair number of children aboard taking up precious deckspace here now the old trollop with the passable daughter yelled advancing on the doorway and lewrie felt a sudden flood of gratitude that mollo and haslip were armed she looked so angry and full of lust for blood shed turned plummypurple daughter and that nancy were close on her heels followed by at least a halfdozen more shipwives all howling bloody murder git out me way ya goddamn beanpole i wanna word with at useless capum yonder the old harridan shrilled aye hes got some splainin tdo miss nancy threatened damme wonder why i ever thought

doffing his tarred hat you go right in in the face of that lewrie retreated to the middle of his daycabin as about ten women swished in like a macedonian phalanx bristly and outofsorts arrr some live bettern others i do declare old trollop remarked looking round at the furnishings lewrie kept a harder eye on the lissome daughter who was picking things up and valuating them books plates cupsspoons napkinrings anything that wasnt locked up or nailed down and several others were coughing strolling and shopping too a sure sign theyd practiced the shoplifting lay a time or two together well frisk

he said invitingly waving a hand about the cabins claret well now several oohed or ahhed ain niver had a claret sure ye aint got no gin one of them had to carp though they shoved dining table chairs out in the open tried to shift his desk chairs but found they were fiddled down filled the settee to starboard overfull even perching on the arms and clucked and put on airs as they got their glasses mugs or coffee cups filled from a hastily decanted pewter pitcher getting lordly for lordly guzzle well burgundy lewrie sniffed to himself not good claret and i doubt theyll know the difference gad look at em slosh it back that fivegallon barricoe ii be gone in an eyeblink now ladies he began accepting a sherry glass full of the wine himselfto be chummy i have to warn you what our king said is that he no longer looks on this as a mutiny but as an armed rebellion against the crown and anyone who persists in it is labeled a traitor to king and country from the moment it was read just like readin the riot act before the soldiers come to clear the streets once you hear it you have no more excuses for creating a disturbance god o mercy theyll string us all up one of the older ones wailed into her hand her fine claret forgotten and her eyes red tosh ya silly ol cow nancy gravelled tossing her chin and her hair wont hang poor whores cept those that sided with rebels transport some maybe she said levelheadedly examples like gawd i dont wanna go tno new south wales lissome daughter whined tother end o th world nigger savages an snakes tigers an dragons i seen em in a book i did real dragons with tongues o fire an coalblack murderers wif pointy teeth too hmmph lewrie heard coxn andrews sniff in disdain he gave him a shrug to commiserate with him over the pigignorance of whores oh worse than that lewrie winced almost sucking wind between his teeth trying to recall all hed seen in the far east or in a recent account of the flora and fauna of that part of the world lord whatd be worse sir lissome daughter blubbered seasnakes long as this ship lewrie intimated forebodingly crawl right out of the water and swallow folk whole poisonous snakes but with mouths that big it doesnt matter much now does it snakes and scorpions on land spiders big as soup plates poisonous too i read crocodiles fiercer than the ones in egypt plagues of flies as bad as the bible a lot of sickness cant even wet your feet in any stream thout you get bit by something cant sleep safe they sat gapmouthed looking physically ill an that whatchyacallem they read hit says if we be took with rebels were rebels too then the redeyed one sniffled thats what it meant yes lewrie sadly intoned means any person who sells em anything associates with em or even knows who they are but doesnt speak up will be called a rebel too cant hide em out from the law either if you dont stop others from helping them thats enough for a court to rule you guilty just like it urged me to do my utmost to quash them and take back this ship and return it to proper duty proteus was shimmying now heeling over a few degrees from upright as she paid off from the breeze under the barest amount of sail making a queasy leeway not yet under helm control hoy where they be takin us then old trollop barked getting to her feet in a huff dear god not tfrance surely no just a bit across the great nore lewrie patiently explained putting on a sad smile to calm her recall what that delegate said about blockading london theyre shifting ships so they have a line right across the thames approaches further apart dye see further out from each other he schemed hopefully where theyd have to guess the range and would have to be quick off the mark to hit proteus with their first unorganised broadsides before she got far enough away to show them a clean pair of heels far enough that it would take too long for a reenforcing boarding party to come help their mutineers should they overpower them aha we didnt want no part o this capum sir nancy insisted kept us aboard pressganged wasnt our doin you could speak up for us couldnt ye capum lewrie kept us broke an poor as them th shitten cheats one more spoke up sarcastically one of the more pragmatic variety here we could go board them new ships long as thisn writes a letter to th magistrates tellin em were innocent long as were kept out here why cant we turn a shillinr two i ask ye we gotta eat no visiting tween ships lewrie pointed out quickly thats one of their rules besides the way i hear it told the north sea ships came here to get paid cause theyre stonebroke too ya mean theyre skint too nancy sneered gawd i just knew it een with our gowns on were just fucked is all wouldnt be th first time that appened nancy old trollop hooted wi half our trade kneetremblers in an alley cheap shits too cheeseparin trent a room an all that tar an splinters from cratesn barrels on me bum come mornin no he didnt particularly wish to picture thatever gawd whateverll we do then lissome daughter blubbed tears streaking her face hung or transported fer life oh were jus whores not like respectable folk so they wont care if they string us up by th dozen after we done so much fer th navy too you can help me lewrie suggested help me take the ship wot do something else for the navy ladies lewrie muttered covertly suddenly inspired as he paced out between them you know who the real hardbitten mutineers are as good as us you live a rough life cheats who wont pay first pimps trying to recruit you and take all your earnings others of your sort whod fight you for the good corners the better taverns right dont you have to carry some uhm persuaders for your own protection aye they allowedyes they did coshes leather sacks full of lead balls dago or spanish knives that flipped open or wickedly sharp shaving razors lissome daughter brought forth a pair of hatpins and rewarded him with a happy nod of understanding lewrie rewarded her with a beamish leer and a slyboots chuckle lissome daughter sprang to her feet and walked right up to him all smiles lor capum lewrie sir she gushed throwing her arms about him going on tiptoe to kiss him on the cheek feller smartz you a fine gentleman i just knew youd find a way tsave us well thankee uhm dont blieve i ever caught your name lewrie blushed quite happy to return her warm promising embrace sally blue sir she giggled swaying back and forth as if it was a dance sally fer me name an blue fer me eyes well uhm well pleased to make your acquaintance mistress sally blue rather well uhm he flustered wishing he was alone with her and the rest shooed out to commit mayhem that instant she took the hint and flounced quite coquettishly back to her wine glass with a practiced but fetching gleam in those blue eyes of hers now give im is bloody watchn chain back sally mistress nancy wryly sniggered gawd mens brains they all shrieked all lewrie could do was shrug haplessly as sally blue returned his watch to him he felt like patting himself down just to see what else her clever fingers had pilfered the coy little minx so yer sayin miss nancy puzzled after draining off her wine and beckoning aspinall for a refill with us youd have moren enough toverpower bales an his lot that right assumin they keep their brains where it seems i keep mine lewrie confessed with a disarming sheepish grin aye so do we come over all loveydovey an swoggle em youd clap em in irons an take your ship back the buxom lass conspired keep some of em below an busy long nough exactly nancy to a tee lewrie smiled then ya put us ashore cause we aint gonna stay out here not a minute after nancy declared for them all turning to see them agree with her not with evry hand turned against us if we stay longer than we have to we take her back nancy lewrie promised ill see that you all get ashore and back to your own beds back to making money with a letter to admiral buckner praising you for what you did for me with all your names on it why you might even be called heroines get your names in the paper thanks of the admiralty the king that would mean sailing in towards sheerness he regretted it but if thats what he had to do to gain allies fiddlers pay old trollop snorted in derision thanks an wine an then get out th door hmmph aye capum lewrie nancy smirked at him thats all well an good but times is hard an moneys short so whats in it for us ukohl he flinched chapter thirtytwo the mutinous ships at the nore were now arrayed in a single long line right across the navigable waters of queens channel and thamesmouth with a halfmile separation between ships proteus hadnt gone very far and was in fact now directly north of minster and cheyney rock oyster ground and when the ebb ran she streamed back from her anchor into the queens channel into deep water with her stern half facing the inviting escape route into the north sea several smaller warships patrolled the inner and outer face of that barricade to stop and inspect the papers and cargoes of every vessel that tried to sail up or down the great river so far mccanns ravings hadnt come true no provisions from civilian merchantmen had been removed and shared out to those ships short of supplies of course lewrie was now beginning to understand just like there were tyrants and then there were tyrants there were delegates and then there were delegates and mccann didnt speak for them allthank god proteus began her ships routine at daybreak with the hands up to scrub decks and stow bedding there would be no more drills though bales had had enough of those and was leery of any more sailmaking after the decks were spotlessly sanded and sluiced to pristine white perhaps as a way to regain the crews lost enthusiasm for the evolving mutiny seaman bales decreed a day of ropeyarn sloth and led them into the requisite morning three hearty cheers before dismissing them for their breakfasts and got back what sounded a bit like proper йlan in their openthroated response ropeyahn sah andrews smiled ducking back into the cabins evahbody gon caulk or idle aha lewrie sighed looking glum it was perfect the enforced halfmile separation the crew restive and gnawing on their worries and now idled for the day plenty of reason for any sharpeyed watcher to nod off and let his guard down plenty of time for his new vanguard of prostitutes to insinuate themselves with the diehards and disarm them one way or another he looked at wyman winwood and his midshipmen who were aft to breakfast with him there would never be a better chance not in a month of sundays yet he fretted his mouth gnawed at his lips in indecisiveness it could still fail go horribly wrong and more innocent men be killed or injured more loyal hands hurt and let down by a second failure after scheming for so long feverish for an opening if they tried again and were beaten again thered never be another hope of salving proteus what they pay detached captains for he writhed in silent agony be king and foreign minister and god all rolled up into one with yer head on the choppin block if you re wrong come on ya damn fool a bit o backbone a pinch o wits say something theyre waitin forenoon or wait til the first dog lewrie muttered just to fill the echoing void to temporise a bit more while his creaky wit churned try to sail past the guns of the rest with frigates and a sloop of war patrolling inshore i fear itll have to be midmorning gentlemen no chance to retrieve lieutenant devereux and mister langlie til this is done and we can put back in for em but do we proceed sir lt wyman dared press aye we do lewrie sighed feeling like it was wrung from him on an inquisitors rack alert sergeant skipwith and mistress nancy charge your pistols and hide them on your persons swords might alert them lets say uhm six bells of the forenoon with a ropeyarn day theyll begin queuing up forrud before the rumcask comes up in no particular order with nothing moren grog on their minds we must hope six bells gentlemen aye lets proceed with it gawd he shivered as they departed flopping halflimp into his desk chair im trustin to luck marines who can playact innocent and a pack o whores but he opened the mahogany box on the desktop and extracted two longbarreled singleshot pistols to clean them and charge them and check their flints and mechanisms andrews set to at his second set of doublebarrel mantons and aspinall and padgett got busy with padgetts two small singlebarrel pocket pistols you hear me shout andrews you come running with my hanger lewrie bade him your spare cutlass since you know how to use it i will trust you aspinall to guard my back with one pistol and you to my other hand mister padgett closein belly shots no tricky work aye sir padgett nodded in his lugubrious quiet way with a fine sheen of sweat on his forehead already and his long clerkish inkstained fingers juddering a little in fearful foreboding daft lewrie deemed it bloody ragin daft still by am thered be some fewer mutineers aboard mr handcocks and morley would be aboard sandwich for the daily wrangle and theyd take a boatcrew with them about half of those the diehards six or seven less for them to overpower so christ so hellish daft halfhour to go to the appointed time for the uprising lewrie posing at music by the taffrails since it was a dry day with no rain some sunshine and a bit of wind wind square out of the north about perfect for a ship bound out so she could beamreach at first to deep water then haul off to large or fair down the queens channel bosun pendarves had been told off to take and hold the forecastle with some few trusty men to cut the anchor cable and hoist the inner and outer jibs so proteus would bear off to her larboard southfacing side and drift mr towpenny and a few more would hoist the spanker from the mizzen to get some drive on her let fall the fore and maincourse to hang loosebraced and baggy for speed and not worry about the topsls or tgallants til theyd gotten the last of the mutineers subdued with a brace of longbarrel pistols shoved down into the back of his breeches under his uniform coat sitting on the flag lockers wasnt the most comfortable thing hed ever done as he tootled away on that tinwhistle of his louder than his usual wont to sound casual and harmless derry hornpipe portsmouth lass tomorrow shall be my dancing day he ran through his repertoire and a damn thinun it was of the old old airs the celtic gaelic west country tunes he knew lt wyman as jittery as a whore at a christening sawed away on his violin with its case ajar at his feet where hed concealed a brace of his own pistols in addition to the pair hed secreted under his own coat he struggled in midsaw uttering a shuddery uhoh for approaching them on the quarterdeck were a clutch of irish hands and lewrie wondered if a cry of i didnt do it might help as his tootling faltered to a stop beggin yer pardon sir desmond said doffing his hat and making a short bow know we aint tbe on th quarterdeck without an off cers leave sir but dye know a slip jig sir they havent tumbled to it yet thankee jesus lewrie shivered a slip jig he managed to enquire with forced cheer aye sir slip jig or hop jig they calls em english dont allow our music played back home sir but theres times we sneak away an play em still in a remote shebeen heres one sir by your leave desmond smiled producing his lappipes furfy was with him along with ahern kavanaugh and cahill and they took seats flat on the deck the ships lamed fiddler joined them one o th easier ones tplay sir called will you come down tlimerick youll master th tune easy capum sir mister wyman sir it was a catchy tune though a difficult one to follow for the tempo changed several times throwing lewrie and wyman off so for the first few minutes they sat with their hands in their laps you try her now sir desmond urged as furfy swayed and beat the time on his meaty thighs and the other three began to dance stiffarmed but footloose they were beginning to gather a crowd of sailors who had nothing better to do on a ropeyarn day and temporarily allowed access to the quarterdeck by their leaders lewrie shared a sick look with wyman as they lifted their instruments thinking they were exposed and a step away from being seized and disarmed and for the short meantime mocked and derided a fine auld air sir desmond rhapsodised as he pumped away with his elbow to stoke the uillean pipes in his lap keyboarding the notes suitin for lads who cling to th auld ways an legends an tales o th auld gods sir desmond added when he saw that his hint wasnt broad enough seen selkies for real have ye capum lewrie arra yer a blessed man sir an banshees in th riggin croonin th poor lad a keen ah aye pretty much like that lewrie replied hiding his gasp still not knowing if he was being twitted or reenforced for th auld god who cant be named sir and for his ship desmond muttered with a proud smile and an affirmative nod of his head do ye let us play an sing our auld songs sir and were yours you say th word capum an well be like th minstrel boy i spoke tye of our swords at least thy right shall guard an one poor harp tpraise ye desmond shrugged modestly about his talents my word ont lewrie blurted out at once in spite of a nagging fear he was exposing the plot to a clever burrower desmond widened his smile and gave one more cryptic nod as his lips encompassed the mouthpiece of his pipes and when lewrie looked up landsman furfy that simple soul was beaming fit to bust we cant fail now lewrie thought in secret glee as he essayed a passage of will you come down to limerick on his tinwhistle with a fair portion of the irish lads with us who can be against us boat ahoy though was shouted down over the larboard side delegates the boats bowman cried back proteus delegates damn damn damn handcocks and morley returned and at least four mutineer oarsmen in the boatcrew with them a cause for another speech or harangue with all hands summoned on deck to listen and no chance to delay or disarm their supporters below it had certainly drawn bales already with haslip mollo and a few committeemen up from a meeting on the berthdeck men who held arms at their sides or in their belts by dint of long custom by now they played through the rest of the tune and desmond began to rattle on about another he particularly liked whilst handcocks and his partner clambered aboard and had a few words with bales on the gangway try as he might lewrie could not help riveting his gaze on them to see what would happen which was prettymuch nothing after a minute for they broke up and drifted away as lackadaisical as anything still ignorant of what weve planned lewrie sighed in relief then bales looked over his way at the impromptu concert and he smiled one of his astute knowing and pleasureably evil smiles which made lewrie come within a cropper of filling his breeches in terror he knows he chilled or he has somethin wicked in mind and he didnt know which was worse to fret over uhm you called it lewrie made himself ask molloys favourite some name it sir my sweetheart jane it is to others desmond replied tossing a worried look over his shoulder too by god you perjurer someone roared a moment later just as desmond and the ships fiddler could begin to play the old reel no more heart for it have ye whats this whats this then pistol in yer pocket have ye what for ye damn traitor oh christ lewrie sagged feeling physically spewing ill corporal oneil and a sailor were manhandling private pope up from below shaking him back and forth between them like a ragdoll in a hounds jaws up from the midships hatchway by god ill see ya flogged for it morley was bleating as he scampered nearby seized up an dunked from th mainyard til yer lungs pop here brother bales lewries party scrambled to their feet lewrie hissing at them and crooking a finger to draw them close about him he drew a pistol and handed it to desmond lt wyman gave up one of his to cahill and used his toe to open his violin case to extract the other pair keep em well out of sight lads lewrie cautioned if we dont have a chance hold onto em for later he said walking forward to the quarterdeck nettings he saw andrews below through the opened skylights gave him a confirming nod to summon the others arming yourself against your shipmates are you bales asked loudly bosun plait me a cat youll flog him raw douse him overside from th mainyard morley objected ill not do your flogging for you pendarves countered his arms folded cross his chest by god sir i tell you you will bales yelled or youll be tied to the gratings and well have ourselves a bloody bosun in another minute all hands all hands on deck muster aft to witness punishment christ its over lewrie groaned nigh to tears with his face screwed up no by god what sally blue had climbed to the top of the midship companionway her hair undone and long down her back her sack gown held up with one hand over her breasts for modesty as she came up to watch the show a moment later miss nancy the blowsy blonde came up to stand beside her redressing herself hurriedly as well but they were smiling tipping him the wink too and with the smile of a sweetsouled innocent lissome little sally blue drew a finger cross her throat dropped lewrie a curtsy and let go the top of her gown to hang round her waist and stuck her tongue out at him impishly as that exposure took the interest of the hands already on the gundeck spectacular young bouncers lewrie exulted in spite of the circumstances and encouraged by that hussyish demonstration about as much as he was going to be encouraged cleared his throat and drew breath you shall not he bellowed in his loudest quarterdeck voice hands in the small of his back close to his remaining pistol you will flog no man aboard this ship you do not have the authority or the right you never had and you never will not over my people political theatre to the end he snickered as he went over near the larboard ladder to the gundeck looming over the upraised grating where oneil and the other mutineer were stripping private pope of his waistcoat and shirt waiting to seize him up bales glared up at him disliking their respective positions we shall captain lewrie for an example bales sneered back youve brought shame enough to this proud new ship you shit lewrie snapped taking the steps one at a time slowly eyes ahead and seemingly paying no heed for his balance as he descended taken her into a mutiny shunned a good settlement as good as declared war upon your king and country beguiled good men to folly ready to drag em all down to hell with you long as you dont go alone you seize him stop his gob bales snarled weve not time for his lies by god do it by god better we flog him just like mccann hed made a serious error though bales had wit enough to realise it it was hard to miss for most of the hands catcalled or booed baless order and his threat no one rushed over to seize lewrie either and almost everyone studiously kept their hands in their pockets or peaceably at their sides as he continued down to the foot of the gangway ladder to confront his enemies whats in it for you bales what makes you so dead set on the ruin of this ship and every man in her lewrie scoffed certain hed have the upper hand after that wink and smile after desmonds pledge of support he took time for a slow scan about the deck and was glad to see that more than a few of the diehards were not present french money treason revolutionary fervour hatred for me personally whatever it is it clouds your judgment leads you to violence you men there turn private pope loose mister devereuxd be ashamed was a man of his flogged for no good reason he bellowed using lt devereuxs name like a magic talisman shut up shut up you bales cried drawing his cutlass and raising it on high taking a step forward as if hed strike lewrie down you bastard he screeched panting hard his neck corded in emotion here now mr towpenny shouted elbowing his way forward to take baless sword arm got no use for ya bales but ya harm capum lewrie an ya lay evry manjack in a noose for murder let go of me you arsekissing dog bales whirled shoving towpenny off him and lowering the cutlasss point as if to skewer him lewrie was jostled from behind almost drew his pistol in fright but it was desmond and furfy ahern cahill and kavanaugh coming down the ladder past him to take guard on his righthand side as theyd promised aye show yer colours at last bales twopenny taunted him baring his chest to dare him to stick him thats yer floatin republic aint it all yer talk o votin an debatin an it comes t th power o yer sword you aint no man tfollow dye hear there he roared as if to summon all hands on deck ya want thang for this bastards spite turn him out fore ya share his ruin youre a loyalist mister towpenny you got no right ttell us how tconduct ship busness haslip sneered coming up with his clasp knife drawn to defend bales do for em both like ya said man vote vote vote desmond began to chant armswinging at his fellow irish to get them to join in shut up you witless paddy bales snapped turning his sword on him by christ well stick it to the end ill do for any hand who wont keep his oath now get back to your cabins lewrie before i take my pleasure of you now and be sure of it at last nope dont think so bales lewrie said with a shudder of commitment he had at least ten loyal people close at hand his whore platoon had kept several of baless hottest below and the marines on the gangways were fidgeting with their hanger or bayonet hilts cutting their eyes at their foes or whoever you really are you hate me its personal he shouted loud enough to carry you dont give one wee damn for anyone else to hell with you lads shut up you monster shut up bales screeched turning back to lewrie with his cutlass raised again strike lewrie howled digging desperately under his coat to free his pistol scared hed get skewered before he could or shoot his own arse off if the mechanism got hung up on his waistcoat belt the cutlass tip came nearer as bales began to lunge his face constricted by fury as he realised lewrie had organised a rebellion despite his watchful guard his superior wit his thoughtout plans im rolston you whoreson he howled stumbling forward off balance a bit from being jostled lewrie flicked up his left hand parried that wicked blade off with his pennywhistle and his foe goggled in stunned disbelief rolston jesus o course lewre goggled himself rolston almost chesttochest balesno rolstongaping that hed been denied his longsought vengeance by a tin pennywhistle as lewrie raised a knee and got him a goodun in the nutmegs which whooshed the last startled air from the mans lungs then desmond and furfy leaped into the fray pawing balesrolston down and piling on to drag him to the deck and seize his swordhand lewrie at last got his pistol out shoved over near the larboard ladder rails and leveled it at corporal oneil who was ready to skewer him with an infantry hanger the dogsjaws already back at full cock a hasty triggerpull blam and corporal oneils rage was quite flown awayalong with the back of his head splattering gore and brains on the other mutineer whod been holding private pope hed lost his stomach for mutiny and dropped his weapon raised his hands and knelt as pope scooped up both pistol and cutlass and gave him a boot in the belly before spinning off in search of someone else to fight a fight by jesus yes lewrie crowed to himself seeing melees on every hand old trollop and sally blue whacking the stuffing from a mutineer whod displeased them or cheated them mostlike swinging sandfilled leathern coshes with amazonian howls of glee some of the waverers the sheepinthemiddle bleating in alarm and backing up to the trunk of the foremast hands conspicuously empty and uninvolved bosun pendarves on the forecastle hewing about with a tarpaying iron loggerhead as the armourer mr offley was hacking at the bower cables and four men defended by pendarves hauled away lustily to hoist the jibs and andrews eschewing his pistol but clashing his cutlass against mr morleys lewrie stopped to pick up the cutlass at his feet pulling like hed jerk a turkey leg off the carcass to wring the leather wrist strop from baless rolstons hand and making him howl while desmond and ahern lay atop him to keep him out of action aha lewrie espied haslip and stalked after him haslip had no taste for danger like all sealawyers and gibbered in spittley panic as he backpedaled before landsman furfy came up from his offhand side that is plucked a pistol from haslips nerveless fingers and lifted him high in the air as easily as if haslip was a kitten the irishman gave him a fearful shaking then took a deep swing like some foredeck hand ready to swing the lead to sound the waters depth and hurled haslip screeching thin and rabbitygawd lewrie could not quite feature it but haslip cleared not only the lip of the gangway but the larboard bulwarks as well blubbering i cain swimbefore he dropped from sight followed by a mostwelcome but mortal splash spanker lewrie roared dashing back to the quarterdeck in a giddy bounding rush where he could see better his quarterdeck once more where he could command robbed of reenforcements taken unaware and surrounded by secret defectors all but the last of the mutineers were now out of it disarmed and held down out cold or bleeding on the decks and gangways mister towpenny hands to the forecourse halliards hands to the starboard braces mister pendarves sheets jib sheets sheet home and flatin yer jibs with a groan and a gunshotlike pop the bower cable parted in a flurry of dry ropeshards and slithered out the hawse hole and over the side proteus was free of the ground hms proteus was free and paying off her bows to point south towards the isle of sheppey paying off and shuffling alee as the outrushing tide took her backed jibs were barnsiding taut bellied out the spanker above his head winging and fluttering as it soared aloft the gaffjaws and woodball parrels groaning and squeaking as the upper gaff scaled the mizzen as high as the crojack yard bowsprit jutting upward sweeping soueasterly to parallel the queens channel mister winwood sir lewrie called out lay her head eastsoueast mister towpenny the forecourse smartly now thats the way my bully lads thats the way my proteuses haul away all he couldnt help giggling stamping his foot and flinging wide his arms to hoot and howl to the heavens as proteus began to gather way singing along with the beginning notes of a ship under sail with the gurgle and chuckle of salt water round her rudder and transom post and under her forefoot the apparent wind just beginning to whistle in the rigging free by god free he bellowed sir mr winwood said coming to his side dont know the channel all that well sir hoped wed have a pilot aboard do you allow me to steer more easterly out to midchannel hate to take the ground an outbound ship to guide us like san fiorenio tother anyone know the queens channel good as a harbour pilot lewrie roared down to the gundeck where the bedlam was at its greatest with mutineers herded to one place sailhandlers trying to do their work in the room remaining mr shirley and his mates poking and prodding those still down on the deck and a pack of loblolly boys traipsing along in their wake with their narrow carryingboards er know it pert well capum old man grace shouted back me an me son been up an down it fer years sir not in a big ship but come up here seaman grace you and your son hell bring the grandson too assist the sailing master til we reach deep water aye aye sir skreakings and squeals of the lignumvitae sheaves of the pulley blocks as the forecourse finally reached its limit of travel and the maincourse began to ascend too more squeals as the braceblocks to the courses took a strain as the braces were trimmed in to cup wind boom from astern at last and a few seconds later a cannonball went shrilling past proteuss starboard side very wide of her and hopelessly high the balls first graze raised a feathery plume at least a quartermile beyond and well alee showin em our stern mister winwood aye easterly as much as you wish lewrie agreed crossing to the binnacle rack to fetch a telescope he could see several ships near their recent anchorage that had opened their gunports but it was a haphazard thing as irregular as a beggars teeth and he doubted if theyd get off a killing broadside before proteus got out of range boom another piece spoke but it was a forecastle carronade on one of the gunners not a longrange gun this ball was closer to lineofaim but couldnt even begin to reach her and fell very short not even skipping near sergeant skipwith lewrie demanded pacing back to the hammock nettings aye aye sah skipwith said stamping to attention you and the master at arms the ships corporals assist mister offley i want all our mutineers taken under arms in chains at once lewrie ordered especially that bastard he said pointing at bales with the tinwhistle which was by then prettymuch the worse for wear rumbold smyth and mash mr handcocks mr morley and private mollo two of the sailmakers crew bales and two other of the marines a few more faces hed come to loathe by then scooped up from where they lay or slumped on the deck some dragged up from below already in irons hooted and jeered by the victorious doxies whod bamboozled the lot of em seventeen altogether less haslip and oneil he hoped proteus had enough restraints to hold them if proteus had sailed into sheerness through a blizzard of gunfire hed have been able to dispose of them with the authorities now though escaping to sea he was stuck with them and he doubted his diedinthewool mutineers would go quietly theyd finagle and whisper perhaps cry out to the rest of the crew for help try to turn them back into mutineers and free them retake proteus bales especially there were a whole nest of vipers in his breast and he needed to be shot of them as quick as he could how though hmmm goodquestion he mused more cannonfire as proteus got a bone in her teeth and began to put speed gathering way out into queens channel beginning to bend her course a touch sutherly at elder graces suggestions sailing large off that north wind and the sea round her peppered by misses still but more guns were now involved and there was a mutineer frigate far up near the warp off the north shore that was speeding down on proteus to intercept abandoning her clutch of ten or twelve captured merchant ships to punish a defector mister wyman lewrie snapped turning to his second officer aye sir wyman replied still smiling dreamily over retaking the ship you are now my first officer mister wyman lewrie said ah i see sir my goodness gracious wyman sobered that was an onerous job of work he hadnt thought to expect sure that lieutenant langlie or even ludlow might return aboard get sail on her mister wyman quick as dammit lewrie said before yon rebel frigate catches us up topsls and tgallants the foremast first to lighten and lift the bows er aye aye sir wyman goggled then gulped reset his hat and cupped his hands round his mouth hoy there all topmen aloft lay aloft trice up and lay out free topsls and tgallants smartly foremast handsomely main and mizzen lewrie looked aft that frigate off his larboard quarter seemed to be gaining slightly though not yet within range of her foredeck chaseguns heavier stuff was peppering about astern though someone had gotten a rd rates lowerdeck pounders in action at last and three or four roundshot went moaning past proteus rustling the air with the sound of ripping canvas to splash about a quartermile ahead of her bows turning to follow their flight and seeing those towering plumes of spray lewrie could see several merchantmen far beyond out to sea some coastal fishing boats slanting in towards the thamesmouth or the medway or at least they had been until theyd seen firing and gotten a fright for they either fetchedto or broadened profiles even as he watched steering clear of something they didnt wish to be involved with coasters lewrie thought find myself a coaster warm him off of thethames and get him to land my chained mutineers somewhere else turn em over to a civil magistrate if not a navy officer wheres the impress services theyd suit harwich whitstable herne bay bloody margate ere miss nancy was crying scampering up the starboard ladder to the quarterdeck with several other doxies in tow were goin out we wanna go back tsheerness capum not tseaf aye whatre ya playin at sir sally blues mother carped by god didya play us false ill have yer gizzard ladies lewrie boomed spreading his arms in greeting just as chearly as anything to placate them you did it by christ mr winwood could be heard uttering a scandalised groan my undying thanks to all of you he pressed on quickly taking off his hat making a formal leg to them twas a fearsome and brave deed you did in your kings and countrys service and i will be sure to list each of you by name with the firmest recommendations to viceadmiral buckner the first secretary to admiralty mr evan nepean aye ill write his nobs king george himself swear i shall telling them what splendid patriotic women you are and honour our pact i assure you but he said straightening and pointing astern we arent out of the woods yet we almost lost again and it was happenstance that we beat em down when the tide was running out not in i will set you ashore promise but we have to get out of the range of their guns first wait til dusk no longer swear it he didnt think it would go amiss to walk amongst them though he suspected they still had their impromptu weapons about their persons bestow kisses on workhardened hands buss cheeks on the youngerand cleanerand speak a few personal words of congratulations and gratitude sally blue responded most eagerly flinging her arms round him again and he patted well perhaps stroked as well her slim back as she jounced atiptoe and squealed nicely it seemed to mollify them oh give im is fob back sally miss nancy chuckled when theyd untangled from their embrace relenting to his logic sorreyy sally blue blushed quite prettily habit like right then capum lewrie miss nancy shrugged well wait til dark you kill any of em miss nancy he had to ask hurt a few i reckon she shrugged again aye one o them committeemenat kever feller ravin bout settin light to th powder store fore hed let th ship be took so she drew a hand across her throat though not with as much enthusiasm as sally blue had the moment before the countermutiny had erupted lost intrest fer quim too quick couldnt old im back lewrie nodded thinking on how hed manage proteus as a fighting ship without master gunner mate and yeoman of the powder oh shit he suddenly realised we couldve been blown highern a kite i do blieve i need me a sitdown and who slit kevers gizzard for him you nancy he wondered damme dont know why i ever thought her attractive theres some women just too dangerous tmess with he looked aloft saw the topsls on both fore and main drawing the fore tgallant heaving upward from the fighting top almost in position halfopen and flagging like a rattle of musketry he turned to look back towards the great nore what cannonfire directed at proteus from the anchored ships wasnt reaching them and was tailing off in a weary acceptanceand it had never been more than halfhearted the frigate to her north still stood on though slanting more to the sousouwest back into the queens channel as if she was breaking off pursuit too cant trust their own hands to chase us too far lewrie realised with joy fore they get ideas about escape in their heads too things well in hand mister winwood he asked walking back to the helm where winwood was buried in his charts and the two grace men were craning their necks and conferring on where the next deadly shoal might be good as may be expected captain winwood allowed not quite sure he liked being counselled by two common seamen wasnt he sailing master the admiraltychosen sage responsible for safe navigation in th main channel sir elder grace grinned an clear o th worst bars an shoals so far markers an buoysll see us right very well mister winwood seaman grace carry on lewrie nodded and thankee thankee both or all three that is he added as their songrandson crooked his neck to follow winwoods finger on the chart between their legs seeing a wonder hed not suspected could be pictured or written down that lore hed learned from the cradle mostlike for your loyalty and steadfastness through all our troubles i believe mister winwood well be needing a replacement for your irish masters mate mister nugent well aye sir winwood frowned move one of the quartermasters up one of the mates to replace thatun and mister grace here he nodded at the elder advanced to quartermasters mate very good sir winwood nodded whether he liked it or not and young grace sir lewrie said squatting down mister peacham is ashore permanently pray jesus for the short time we must promote mister catterall an actinglieutenant mister adair too as third officer that leaves an opening in the midshipmans mess would you be interested master grace he asked the boy try your hands as a trainee midshipman for a poor fisheries lad with no hopes of a naval career it was a miraculous bolt from the blue aye he was more than eager good then lewrie said rising to his feet carry on mister winwood make us a good offing but well lurk off to the south for a while longer deep water off herne bay whitstable by dark well close the coast and land our prisoners and civilian women should we not come across a coaster or large fisheries boat we could pay to put them ashore aye aye sir winwood perked up glad to be rid of the women at last know most of em sir elder grace supplied still peering at the seaward horizon with one hand shading his eyes beg pardon but do ya wish itd be best did i hail em they know me but theyd run from a navy ship expectin a press gang sir very well grace well do it that way lewrie nodded ill go below for a moment then mister wyman you have the deck sir i have much to write fore dusk and little time in which to do it proteus had been slowly hobby horsing over the tiderun surging a bit to the press of the winds now her bows lifted as a wave a sea wave crested below her cutwater and broke to cream down her flanks a cheer went up for she was now truly free and halfway to salt ocean mister wyman lewrie roared haul down those yard ropes haul down those red flags mister catterall fetch out a red ensign from the aft lockers and bend it on put us back under true colours he went forrud to the edge of the nettings to look down on his crew it was a thinner crew than before barely the numbers he needed to work her or fight her and god knew when hed get more especially sailors he could trust implicitly perhaps the entire navy would have that problem from this moment on no matter when the nore mutiny was over and it would be over he was mortalcertain with his crew as a guide there werent enough wildeyed radicals to sustain rebellion when that wasnt what the most had sworn on for days weeks even but sooner or later it would be over he just hoped it ended before england s enemies took advantage of it they stood on gundeck or gangways now the topmen were down off the upper yards looking to him their captain proud and pleased the sullen who still might prove untrustworthy the frightened and confused whod always wavered in the middle thankee lads thankee he said taking off his hat in humility were now returned to duty the spithead terms are yours see you yonder he cried spearing an arm aloft red ensign at the mizzen peak where it belonged h m s proteus he roared won back from the brink of shame by men a proud ship redeemed a proud young frigate manned by a proud crew mister coote sir i note it is now a quarterpast noon blieve clear decks and up spirits is late sir well splice the main brace proteuses ladies and wives alike that raised an even greater cheer slates clean again he shouted as they began to queue up at the focsle belfry and nary a man who returned to duty will ever be charged you hear now when you drink drink to yourselves drink to success for our ship may her fame never be tarnished again chapter thirtythree nigh to dusk and hms proteus lay fetchedto a scant five miles off herne bay and whitstable theyd come across a margate lugger two hours before had had to run her down and fire a warning shot to bring her up then perplexed the very devil out of her captain by having elder grace call over to her for hed known her identity as soon as her patched sails were close enough to fill a telescope hoy jemmy vernish ye want tmake some money aye captain vernish did and had come aboard to haggle out the price for carrying prisoners despatches and whores into whitstable prisoners dumped on the local magistrate whores wafted upriver behind the medway booms to sheerness in shallow oyster dredgers owned by men whom middle grace recommended glad you have em chained capum lewrievernish had smiled for my own piece o mind and for the constable at herne bay not one youd call a capable feller god help him despatches lewrie and padgett had scribbled away in a fury and a flurry of ink to get them all done in time he wrote to admiralty admiral buckner even the king as hed promised praising the loyalist hands whod stood by him naming those who had wavered but rallied to his sideand damning the prisoners citing their crimes he urged for langlie devereux and most of the others sent ashore to be sent posthaste to whitstable swearing he would patrol close offshore to await their arrival as long as he could as for lieutenant ludlow and midshipman peacham he strongly hinted at their assignment to another ship since their brusque and abusive dealings had been partly responsible for stoking the fire of mutiny in the first place despite his cautions to modify their behavior the reassignments and actingpromotions he had made being very shorthanded and shorthanded though he was and his crew inexperienced or not he wrote that barring orders to the contrary it is my intent to remove my ship as far from mutinous assemblies as possible til my taint is scoured away by dint of routine discipline and instruction in seamanship restores her people to complete obedience therefore once my officers are aboard i shall sail at once for the texel to bolster what few ships admiral duncan has got shorn as he is for the moment of twodeckers i see this course of action as my bounden duty in such parlous times with the threat of battle or invasion ever before us god but im a toadyin wretch even he groaned as he read his prose what a canting bastard but it will read well with those who count he told himself and i didn t trowel it on too bloody thick recommendations for his distaff reenforcements his whores a draught on his funds to his solicitor matthew mountjoy in london to pay them or their representatives a certain sum each hmm lewrie thought and a rather handsome sum it was too thirtytwo women at ј per that atop the pound note hed slipped each one after theyd made it to sea and the five shillings per for passage with vernish and the money padgett would carry to buy their further passage back to sheerness too and if padgett thought he was going to enjoy his short voyage with em then god help the poor lad finally it was done and all but the personal copied into his letter books with padgett aided by mr cootes jackinthebreadroom clerk who would spell padgett until he could return aboard he still had to update his watchandquarter bills of course but that could surely wait lewrie rather hoped hed get langlie back as his first officer quickly then he could saddle him with the drudgery thats what first lieutenants were for by god lewrie could gladly contemplate proteus heaved and clattered slowly on a slack sea now that the tide had turned for the night and sundown reddened the western skies laying cocked up to weather near captain vernishs dowdy old luggerwhich went by the grand name of marlborough proteuss boats were hard at it stroking over to her filled with ironbound men some waited on the larboard gangway for their turn in the boats pleading sir captain lewrie sir mr handcocks smiled sheepishly with his wrists before him hope ya put in a good word for me sir didnt mean no harm ever stood up for sailors rights sir same as evry other hand didnt wish tbe a delegate sir but th lads chose me an i couldnt say no now could i sir keep em on th straightun narrow its over mister handcocks lewrie grunted having no wish to bandy words with the man you a man with years at sea admiralty warrant god help you mister handcocks for i cant but sir handcocks began to beg then broke off as he got his pride up biting back what else he might have said gnawing on his cheek lining as stoopshouldered as a man already convicted and there was seaman bales rolston really lewrie had yet to dredge up his christian name after all these years when they had been midshipmen together aboard hms ariadne under captain bales so long ago in bales even in chains and shackles still exuded an air of coolly aloof superiority a sneering damn yer blood glint to his harsh phyz even without the beard lewrie would have had no clue as to who he was perhaps someone else in the navy mightve lewrie had made sure that his report had contained baless secret identity with what few hints hed gleaned about his prior service the boasting hed made when first theyd shifted proteus to the double crescent anchorage that hed once been a masters mate balesrolston glared daggers at him lewrie felt happy enough to return him what was known in the sea service as a shiteatin grin you really plan this rolston he idly enquired taking a few steps closer right from the start did you one of the schemers in sandwich why should i tell you anything lewrie rolston sneered back keep wondering and the devil take you as im sure he will sooner or later rather think hell see you first you dog lewrie continued to grin enjoying goading him did you really come off a frigate up at chatham hussar was she bales sniffed in derision but nodded in the affirmative just an able seaman after all these years lewrie taunted found your proper level i spose yet a naval career begun with such promise my my lewrie snickered rocking on the balls of his feet keith ashburn you remember keith dont you rolston postcaptain into the tempest frigate and that was in in the med so hes sure to have risen higher by now young shirke i heard he got command of a brig owar last year made commander even bascombe that idiot hes a lieutenant too yet you on the other hand you ruined my career for me you sonofabitch rolston growled lifting his shackles as if he still wished to strangle his tormentor but was held by the marines as his side ruined it yourself rolston when you pushed that topman off the topsl yard i never pushed him he fell gibbs that was his name aye lewrie chirped been ridin him for weeks puttin him up on charges as i recall threatened hed be flogged were he the last man off the yard again he fell he was clumsy i tell you you were the one called it murder starting your vicious rumours backbiting in our own mess never a bit of it lewrie frowned though that was close to how he recalled it for hed taken an instant dislike to rolston the moment hed shown up with ariadnes boat to fetch him out to the ship his first morning in the fleet you were guilty as sin never came right out and said it mind lewrie qualified but i did beat all round it take him down a peg got out of hand by god ill settle for you yet lewrie you always were the worst sort of bastard bales snarled aye and you tried right after captain bales chid you to take better care of your people aloft came at me with your dirk in the midshipmans mess fore a halfdozen witnesses lewrie retorted in sudden gloating heat tried to murder me by god thats what got you broken rolston thats what cost you your career signed aboard another ship under another name did you rose to masters mate did you crow well what stupid criminal thing did you do there to end up nothing but an able seaman you try to murder someone else go fuck yerself mate bales chilled closing down against any more abuse he glowered at his wrist shackles for a moment shook them as if seeing them for the first time lewrie had almost turned away to other things but was caught by a harsh mutter whipjack sham of a sailor you were lewrie still are for all i know bales spat shrugging as he realised his defeat come with your rich purse your allowance your lordly airs your nose in the air and your hands soft and clean nothing but sneers for the rest of us the ones who cared for a commission god i cant tell you how much i despise you you and all your privileged sort all i ever had was ships and the sea and hopes to advance but you scuppered those didnt you ran into your sort all my born days thinking men before the mast less than animals tools that speak long as they dont dare speak backludlow you youre all alike when you get down to it cruel dismissive sneering officers ah but you wished to be an officer rolston lewrie snapped seeing how he could stick the last inch of spite in and give it one last twist all you are is envious not admirable all your years before the mast and hating every minute of it every manjack you had to serve with and play up mateycause you were never matey with any one as i recall rolston you despised em mostlike you seethed at being ordered about by mastcaptains and mates who didnt have a tenth o your intellect didnt you god help the navy had you made a commission for youd not have been a whit kinder to a ships people than ludlow was you are a ludlow deep down rolston onliest trouble is you never had the chance tbe a bastard i took joy of suspecting that you pushed gibbs aye cause i didnt like you then and i dont like you now if that spurred you to try and kill me then it was the best service i ever did the navy cause it kept you from abusing sailors maybe even killing more of em as the worst sort of officer listen lewrie you rolston blanched gag him private lewrie ordered his marine guard til hes aboard the lugger i think weve all heard enough of this murderous bastards guff the boats were now beginning to transfer the doxies leaving the prime ringleaders for one last wellguarded load lewrie went over to say his last goodbyes since they were expensive goodbyes he felt he should get his moneys worth he took a soft bosomy hug from miss nancy pecked her on the cheek and wished her well assuring her that his solicitor would have their money ready for them and did nancy actually return to sheerness for a payout with the others he would be damned surprised hed heard of honour among thieves but how far that stretched well perhaps theyd go in a wellarmed committee keeping a wary eye on each other til they had bank notes in hand gbye capum lewrie sir sally blue said most mournfully working up tears in her eyes as she came to take her turn down the battens shed gathered up her few pitiful belongings in a scrapedbald carpet clutchbag and was turned out in a fresh gown and hat lewrie had not seen til then scrubbed up too and even in the nighdarkness she looked as chaste and missish as any squires daughter of a sunday she opened her arms but lewrie was twicebitten and thrice shy by then yet the woebegone disappointment on her gamin face caused by his refusal made him relent despite his fear of being pickpocketed to instant poverty he smiled cocked his head and held out his arms in welcome she stepped close and to his considerable alarm and sudden thrill it must be admitted ground her things and groin against him with a puckish twinkle bestowing a gentle buss near lewries gawping lips so long sally blue he said still trying to stay aware where her free hands might roam take ye joy have a safe voyage and a good life after thank you again for all you did to get me back my ship never forget you mdear theres a sweet young chit you come back to sheerness capum lewrie sally blue whispered hot and alluring in his ear enveloping him in a faint hint of a freshdabbed scent in her hair you come look me up at checquers th public house sometime at th crown an anchor but thats no place fer a fine feller like yerself jus leave a note la yer such a kind an gallant gennleman dont git much chance tmeet such in my line o work what ya said ywrote them swells bout me she cooed as she fell back a halfstep to lay hands on his shoulders and look up searchingly into his eyes don forgit hits sally caruthers not sally blue same as ya wrote down to yer banker man send fer me an ill come runnin an ill treat ya to a wondrous time wheneer yer in port long as ya dont ask me tcome out tyour ship no more kinda lost me taste fer that sally said with a frazzled moue and a gentle chuckle i quite understand sally mistress caruthers lewrie smiled back as he let go of her stepping back to doff his hat to her as fine as he would to any ladyguest well see perhaps he did not say that mostlike hed never seek her out or send her a bidding note but then he didnt exactly say that he wouldnt either for she was a wee fetching thing slim and pretty like a rose grown on a dungheap and sure to be as bouncy and exuberant as a halfbroke colt his hands felt the need to twitch though to see if he still had his watch chain fob coinpurse pocketknife loose change his silk handkerchief his breeches buckles or even his horn comb she laughed again at his strangled look a quite fetching titter as she looked him up and down as if to fix him in her memory biting on her lip no fear capum lewrie sir she beamed didn take nothin not this time youre too fine a man tpilfer well bye capum lewrie fer now adieu mistress caruthers he bowed milady a ahdoo captain lewrie she pronounced more or less correctly dropping him a deep curtsy and a graceful incline of her head that would not have been out of place on the strand or at st jamess palace til we meet again good sir she hinted from beneath her bonnets brim ah a sweet chit he thought as he handed her to the entryport gate as she swept her skirts to turn outward and lower herself overside by battens and manropes tryin tgain manners and style i just might look her up arr ye keep yer fuckin eyes awrf me bum ya googlin shits mistress sally blue caruthers chid the boatcrew below as she heard their appreciative moans and whistles ain none o yew gettin een a fingerlark so hush yer gobs then again perhaps not he sighed with a wry grin at last the final boatload of women and sailors children had gone the darkening seas were getting up a tiny bit more boisterous and the wind was backing from due north a wee touch more with each gust presaging a switch to nornoreast in an hour or so perhaps lewrie was anxious to get underway make an offing from the shoaling coast before he was caught on a lee shore at night and it would be safer for the lugger to get into port before the rising shifting wind raked up rollers over the bars which might poop her the last boatload though he simply had to stay on the gangway to watch handcocks morley and rolston go along with two more of the greencockaded committeemen everyone did it seemed no sailor wore their red cockades any longer once proteus had escaped for sure her wake had blossomed with their discards and their frigates creamy sternfroth had resembled a seabrides train on a bloomstrewn church aisle bales he was still unable to call him rolston his ancient dislike of the boy hed been so long ago had been dismissed from lewries ken ages before he despised the twisted jealous radical hellspite the man had become in his latest guise once the boats returned mister wyman ready the hands to recover the boats and stow them on the crossdeck tiers lewrie said aye aye sir lt wyman piped from the companionable dark a number of handheld muscovyglass lanthorns along the rails threw amberyellow moonglades so the hands could see what they were doing and captain vernishs luggers lights competed to turn the patch of sea between them into a gently heaving glittering sheet of molten gold him and the others gone lewrie decided as the ringleaders got pushed to the open gate of the entryport then this shipll be clean untainted like i told the hands the slate erased then we make of her what she should be what proteus deserves to be he mused handcocks went down the battens chains clinking at every step then private mollo stripped of his red tunic for he didnt deserve to wear a real marines jacket morley next complaining and whining as he descended to a sure death a few days or weeks away once the court martial jack was hoisted at the nore the crew lined the larboard side perched in the lower shrouds or hung halfover the gangway bulwarks for a better view of the departure of their tormentors their fallen heroes a few of the stauncher loyalists hooted softly as they left some of the particularly threatened or browbeat but most were still just too numbor too unsettledto utter a peep go on then ya bugger corporal plympton urged rolston the last of them think we got all night for th likes o you rolston would go game he sneered a faint smile of disdain for the gathered seamen chinhigh and clearly disgusted as if to wonder out loud why hed ever thought he could make a revolution with such a poor grade of malleable clay trying to stare individuals down and make them duck and cringe in shame theyd failed him stiffly he shuffled in leg and wrist chains his back straight as if he was determined to face his music with the innate superiority and courage of a commission sea officer a cultured educated gentlemanwhich to his lights hed always beenbut for admiraltys guinea stamp he twisted his neck straining the cords of his throat like a man fighting a tightening noose and his badly tied gag fell away damn the lot of you rolston gravelled silencing what halfhearted jeering thered been faithless cowards weak as water to think i believed you were men worth saving but you never were you will always be sheep youll always buss the rich folks arses he turned his back outwards shuffled his feet so the chains on his ankles wouldnt tangle on the entryport lip took hold of the manropes and began to descend glaring fireandbrimstone at them lewrie stepped closer to the port gate to make sure that rolston was well and truly going away happy to see the back of him lewrie felt a brush along his right boot heard a faint grumble in toulon s throat as he moaned and spat as if even a cat could recognise evil when he saw it clankshufflethud clankshufflethud rolston jangled taking his eyes off the unfaithful sailors to peer over one shoulder to see where to place his feet below the gunports and wale and men in the cutter were shuffling to make room for him on a centre thwart he glared back up once he was sure of his footing stepping down with an old sailors expertise now hed found a rhythm oowww he yelped of a sudden and his hands on the manropes flew open his eyes widening in surprise shit softly from the bowman in the cutter when he let his boathook slip off the deadeyed shrouds on the mainchain platform and the cutter began to drift free though its stern was still secure to a painter he stabbed out and down and missed rolston stabbed out too got his right hand around a manrope with a petulant frown and childlike purse of his lips at almost falling getting dunked eyes slit upward to see if anyone had dared kick him or prick him then proteus heaved a bit as a rogue swell lifted her rolled to larboard as if bowing alee below the oarsmen were dipping their freeside oars at andrews direction to stroke her back to the hull where the bowman could hook on once more but it was as if everyone had caught a cramp as their looms tangled in confusion proteus a few degrees from horizontal and rolstons feet went out from under him as if the battens were slick with tallow or hoared with seaice he dangled by that one hand swinging his feet for a place to stand swinging his left arm to a grip on the lefthand manrope then the right one below his precarious grip aahhh he yelped again as the seamen on the bulwarks and shrouds gasped or moaned with alarm bosuns mate towpenny scrambled past lewrie to the top step of the battens to reach down when no one else looked like theyd help him well damme toulon moaning and spitting bottled up and archbacked leaping atop the bulwarks before lewrie and balancing easy on four closeplaced paws ahhhf rolston cried again his right hand flying open as if hed grasped a redhot poker and fell his yelp of pain and incredulity turning to a thin disbelieving scream he plunged into the giltlit sea in a huge eruption of foam and spume like a moth seared from the air into a blossom of yellow flamepoints in a chandelier down rolston went into the gap twixt ship and cutter oarsmen and bowman swinging oars out to probe for him underwater for him to grab should he meet up with one as the splash plume subsided like a guttering candle flame the mutineer corked back to the surface as most divers must at least once hands stretched high as if in supplication he heaved a great gasp of air even as another wide welter of spray erupted round himas if a beast had risen from the great deeps expelling its whalebreath after an abyssal sounding nnoo rolston screamed disbelieving accusing eyes locked on lewrie above him cut off suddenly as he was dragged back down in an eyeblink by the weight of his shackles and chains holy lewrie gasped feeling his nape hairs bristle with a sudden terror he barely heard the shocked tumult that gusted through his sailors barely heard the long eerie moan from his cat right by his left elbow over the distant rushing ringing in his ears all that remained was a spreading fading greywhite target of roiled water with a bullseye of the palest winking lanthornamber like a seabeasts eye that faded away to ripples lewrie turned to see many of his hands crossing themselves or standing gapemouthed in awe looking at him there were whispers soft sibilant sighings and almostwords he strained to fathom that came on the fickle night wind ah hmm then lewrie finally managed to say removing his hat to swipe at his hair that felt clammy and suddenly cold on that night wind from a gush of funksweat reckon hes a goner sir lt wyman ventured to say breaking the spell very well mister wyman lets be about it then finish the ferrying quick as you can andrews then we must get underway this wind is backing lewrie ordered clapping his hat back on and placing his hands square in the middle of his back take the ships boats in tow for the nonce ready to make our offing are you mister win wood aye sir but some of the people are saying the most blasphemous unchristian things sir pagan seagods and vengeance im sure tis nothing of the sort mister winwood lewrie said sure he was lying through his teeth we should put a stop to it sir at once winwood insisted as prim as a slapped vicar the simple minds of your common sailor and so many superstitious irish aboard why have we learned nothing sir lewrie asked him our common sailors are nothing like simple or childlike we just saw that at the nore and spithead do the people come to believe that proteus had an odd birth an air of mystery about her a soul if you will whats the harm in it perhaps theyll serve her more chearly for that from fear captain winwood countered nigh to scoffing for the ship sir if she demands it lewrie allowed turning to stroke toulon who was now washing himself as if he hadnt one care in the world pride stubbornness thats more important among them than navy king or country the ship and their mates are paramount if you get past all the patriotic cant shame of failing mates good officers like lieutenant devereux for our marines that makes em toe up and stick it in a scrap discipline and fear of punishment that only goes so far but it doesnt inspire them mister winwood winwood got cuttyeyed seeing his point but not liking it well not encourage such moonshine sir but let em have a spindrift and a sense of bein unique men servin a unique ship in the longrun it really doesnt signify uhm very good sir winwood surrendered though dubious let him think what he likes lewrie thought turning away to see to getting his ship underway i begged godand lirthe both of em to get her back i promised baless rolston s hearts blood for it whichever answered my prayer well that dont signify either as long as i have a proud ship epilogue forsan et haecolim meninisse juvabit perhaps someday it will be pleasant to remember these things virgil hms proteus lay peacefully at anchor in the port of harwich up the coast from the nore she was finished with provisioning and her people were outofdiscipline after six rugged weeks at sea off the texel six weeks theyd bluffed with but a handful of ships to shut the door on the dutch with admiral duncans two or three liners anchored almost aground right in the channel and proteus and a few other frigates or sloops further out flurrying bogus signals to a pretended fleet under the northern horizon with battle expected daily lewrie had found his external bogeyman the roweled spanish spur that focused his crewmen on learning their trade as quick as they could now she was of passing professionalismstill with some raggedness about her of course but lewrie reckoned that shed just about do so when she had been relieved by the nore ships the reassembled north sea fleet which had given up their mutiny not ten days after proteus had escaped everyone had been more than grateful for a spell in harbour the skylights were open to cool his greatcabins as he worked and he could hear the voice of lieutenant devereux drilling his marines on the quarterdeck above him the clomp of booted feet as they sweated through closeorder under arms music drifted up from the berthingdeck where the hands idled with a new lot of temporary wives down by the sally gardens he recognised pausing in his writing smiling to himself since hed learned a thing or two himself learned to play a few new airs on his battered but straightened tinwhistle boat ahoy aye aye marines by the left quickmarch though the crew had settled into a troublefree navy routinefor the most partsummoning marines to the entryport boded ominous that aye aye might mean the presence of an officer in the approaching boat or it might be thomas mccann come back from his tar and chains there was a stamp by the door the rap of his sentrys musket butt midshipman nicholas sah come captain sir little mr nicholas burst out flushed and excited the first officer mister langlies respects sir and i am bid to inform you that weve a visitor arriving a soldier a real general he appears sir good god lewrie replied with a frown startled to his feet and grasped for his coat that hung on the back of his chair he only knew one general his father and what the devil was he doing in harwich lewrie feared the worst there had been no fresh letters from anglesgreen since he had taken proteus over to holland whilst recent bumf from his solicitor tailor couttss bank chandlers and such had come aboard with langlie and devereux despite his own letters home thered been no replies and he could explain that away only so long with the urgency of the spring planting season he dashed out of his greatcabins up the starboard ladder to the gangway and entryport as the marines formed up and lt langlie had bosun pendarves shrilling like a starved harpy on his silver call to assemble the crew present ships compny off hats face to starboard and salute langlie bellowed a cocked military hat loomed over the lip of the entryport the bosuns calls tweetled a long complicated trilling gold lace then appeared damme it is my father lewrie thought with a deeper frown sir hugo saint george willoughby got safely to the deck almost spryly gaily and stepped inboard grandly doffing his hat to one and all with a condescending smile on his phyz like a hero might at the theatre cheered and clapped for his most recent exploit and basking in his glory from a logebox before the curtain rose howdy do sir charmed im certain young sir sir hugo said as officers and midshipmen were named to him ah he finally cried theres my son embrace me lad and give ye joy making lewrie feel like a schoolboy just back from his first term at boarding school and about as embarrassed what in the world are you doin here whats happening at home youd not come less there was something horrid lewrie babbled as he suffered himself to be bearhugged bounced and dandled thumped on the back so hard for a moment he could conjure that someone had died and left him a huge bundle he could not imagine his father acting so paternal else patience lad sir hugo muttered in his ear and all will be told everyones well no worries on that score he released lewrie at last stepped back and whinnied louder for everyones ear

ye haw he beamed like a wellfed buzzard thanks of parliament too ah congratulations lewrie replied just whod you kill hawhaw sir hugo guffawed tweaking at the fabric of his new and fashionably snug breeches no for my duty suppressing your nore mutiny arrived just after your ship scampered under general grey and buckners replacement admiral lord keith keith elphinstone when i knew him at toulon alan supplied handing his father a tall stem of champagne balls of brass too the very one sir hugo quite cheerfully agreed i brought our yeomen militia up tlondon got brigaded with some kentish regiments and got the brigade when the firstun fell off his charger howlin drunk man cant handle his drink surely cant handle his troops first ive heard lewrie found cause to snicker despite continuing fears that a tragic shoe was about to be dropped though that tipple was as important to the army as gunoil bit of a muddle for a while sir hugo preened on one damn regiment went surly on us near woolwich some others traipsed into camp with only half their muster rot sir radical republican rot worsen ever id imagine in england but we put it right stiffened the tilbury forts garrisons reclaimed some ships that had mutinied up the thames marched down to sheerness and put spine in the town damme though sir hugo wheezed in pleasing reverie missed the sight on the kings birthday alan everyone firin th hundredgun salute mutineers too damn their eyes made the ramparts at garrison point collapse one gun wouldve done it and thank god we never had tcannonade the mutineers for real but its over now lewrie said sipping at his own champagne and feeling impatience to get past the pleasantries almost some courtsmartial still awaitin hellish docket dye see that parker fellow went for the high jump after that we marched off for home got presented at court my way back through the city when the thanks and the promotion came his nobs the king he thinks high of you that letter you wrote him he does lewrie could only gasp well those whores of yours became ah certain loyal and patriotic women of sheerness but all in all he thinks youre th knacky sort never hurts when hes in his right mind that is well well lewrie had to gasp again and sit down now about personal doins sir hugo said sobering and cocking his head at aspinall who was puttering and hovering aspinall do you go on deck for a while my father and i wish to chat private for a spell lewrie bade tensing once more damme never saw ye as a ship captain alan in the far east the best ye had was a dogs manger for quarters sir hugo said as he peered about appreciatively not innocently thoughthere was a tad too much of the smirk to his face for that navy lives right well i must say a poor thing but mine own lewrie quoted shifting uneasily in his chair fine quiet damn near stylish place tput the leg over any willin mort im bound sir hugo leered on damme toulon attracted by sir hugos idly swinging highly polished boot had come to greet the new face he leapt into sir hugos lap and swished his tail rightchearly reaching up to bat at those glittery gold epaulets with their tantalising gilt cord tassels nice kitty sir hugo glowered now bugger off damned near crosseyed in perplexity and with a tiny ummph of disappointment toulon did though sir hugo hadnt moved a muscle father what always were fonder o quim than yer avrage feller i recall sir hugo frowned studying his son over the rim of his glass mad for it from yer first breeches right so lewrie attempted to bluff christ who blabbed was his panicky thought though and just which liaison of mine was blabbed about did sophie that just after caroline fetched sophie and your kiddies back to home there came this damn letter damn good hand expensive paper one o those catty things from a concerned friend someone hates ye worse than muhammadans hate roast pork what the devil dye mean someone hates me lewrie flummoxed lots of people hate me id expect god knows why whatever did it say then the court takes note ye didnt try tdeny it straightaway sir hugo quipped looking coolly amused well how can i do that when youve yet to tell me whatthebloodyhellsinit lewrie snapped back it described ah yer diversions in the mediterranean a certain sham corsican countess no moren a common whore named phoebe aretino oh lewrie felt the need to gasp again shit it was out at last lewrie had himself a deep draught going icy inside then tmake matters worse some genoese mount claudia however dye say it his father prompted scowling mastandrea lewrie croaked claudia mastandrea but she was secret government business a french spy and and you were ever the patriotic sort sir hugo felt the need to cackle court also takes note ye know the lady in question knew rather biblically and the worst part worst alan sighed jesus last year when your ship was in the adriatic sir hugo went on relentlessly you rescued some greek piece a widow once married to a catholic irish trader in the fruit trade it said currants lewrie weakly supplied without thinking right then sweet currant duff sir hugo sniffed as if it was all a titanic jest took her tlisbon board yer ship as a cabin guest saw more of her in lisbon too fore she took passage to her inlaws in bristol yer nameless informer knew all that her new address and the fact that when the widow connor turned up on their doorstep she was ankled what lewrie yelped his features paling wheyishly and just about ready to tear his hair out in consternation what preg no we i that is uhm thought i taught ya th value o good cundums alan me dear sir hugo sighed worldlywise as if disappointed in him venetian or dago made were they hard tfind at lisbon when i was hidin from creditors in oporto they surely were damn all romish countries and their meddlin priests p pregnant lewrie could only splutter impossible for i had threedozen of mother greens best i assure god he thought though that first night we didnt too mad for it right after i rescued her from the serb pirates one bloody incautious night just the once that was simply too unjust despite his predicament for a glad second or two he recalled summersheen sweat and slippery bodies going at it like stoats quiet whimpers instead of wee screams so her son could sleep through it in his hammock god at least four bouts or more august thatd beentheoni had taken ship from lisbon in october and wasnt showing then he caught himself counting the months on his fingers fine thing tmaster mathematics his father commented in a hellishpleased humour as if scoffing a cully who dared to be half the man that he was mistress connor was delivered of a healthy boy your informer says papist baptised though alan james connor do ye see hellish coincidence aint it dear lord lewrie said topping up their glasses bein in trade an all sir hugo sneered the bristol branch of the connors can add too and knew there was no way their dead son couldve quickened her so her new inlaws truckled her right out soon as she bloomed the damn foreign chit and what can ye expect of dago trash damme the connors must be rollinin chink thave such touchy morals never could afford em me but mistress connor has her dead husbands halfshare o th currant trade plus a good claim on their share with a wolfish lawyer she lit in london livin just as high as any righteous widow your concerned friend knew her address there too looked her up on my way back to anglesgreen your dear wife bade me you what alan said with a wince sure the game was up after all this time at carolines urging she did and did his father try to put his leg over how was she how did she is he really he has your eyes sir hugo cooed it was true then after all these years hed sired a bastard one he knew of at any rate one he had to own up to well thered been soft rabbit up the appalachicola but hed scampered long before shed borne his git on kings business fetchin wee lad sir hugo said holding up the bottle to see if theyd need a replacement soon and ill give ya points me son for taste a devlishhandsome woman is mistress theoni connor those big amber eyes almondslanted and all her chestnut hair and still trim as a spinster lass despite bearin two gits so what did you tell caroline lewrie enquired crossing his fingers for luck feeling the urge to cross his legs too partways the truth sir hugo replied taping his noggin and looking especially sly lewrie felt like putting his head on the desk and blubbing partways lad sir hugo chuckled whorin runs in the famly blood so does artful lyin told her yes shes a newborn and she did name him after you but for savin her and her son michael from rape and butchery for helpin her tvenice to cash in thence tlisbon and the packet ship for bristol out of gratitude but i also said i didnt see a bit of resemblance thank bloody christ for that lewrie whooshed in relief i mean thank you father that was hardwrung from him lewrie could not recall too many benefits hed ever gotten from the man to thank him for lied mainwell if i do say so mself sir hugo told him as he smiled your ward sophie did too sophie hey she never knew theoni so oh phoebe aye thatxm sir hugo chuckled poor chit got flustered when home remember does sophie begin tbabble more frog than english shes up tsomethin but sophie assured caroline this phoebe chit was just a seamstress and maid from toulon came aboard your ship as a refugee with hundreds of others and served sophie til she got off at gibraltar your cabin was arseholes and elbows with emigres no privacy anyway so what did caroline make of all that lewrie dreaded to ask that theres a damn sight too many women so grateful to ya tsuit her allowed that it all might sound innocent you bein so manly and fetchin or so she said but theres a bit too much of it said maybe the damn letter was from some termagant mort youd spurned oh good should there actually be one in that category hmmm forehead creased lewrie asked crossing his fingers again nigh a yard deep sir hugo related muttered somethin like where theres smoke theres fire more fool you me lad marryin a shrewd woman id o cautioned ye tstick with stupid if i knew you felt the marriage itch slackwit women may fluff up jealous never for th right reasons thank god so ye can get away with more now alice lord i couldve had her maid in the soup tureen and she wouldve said the tang was off was all so carolines mollified completely well lets say she almost was til your solicitor wrote to her sir hugo said beginning to smirk and chuckle underhis breath as he topped their glasses with the last of the bottle beg pardon needed seed money daylabourers wages feller said that she couldnt get as much as shed requested since yed promised onehundredsixty pounds to some sheerness women for ah services rendered but that was for helpin me they werent i never stap me didnt i caution ye quality beats quantity all hollow me lad sir hugo had the cruelty to hoot in high humour thirtytwo of em surely the number told her it was preposterous lewrie spluttered some more growing numb ill not get in the middle o that un sir hugo vowed aye itd look that way wouldnt id lewrie sighed to himself am so well and truly ruined do i go home ill mostlike be shot on sight her brother governour always was toppin fair with pistols we need another bottle his father pointed out gad yes i expect we do lewrie replied stumbling over to the winecabinet and fetching one himself stripping the lead foil off and fiddling with the cork oh give it here cunnythumbs i know my way round a cork sir hugo crankily told him there dye see slap twist pop think its safe to go home lewrie enquired once reenforced not if you care for breathin no not for a while gathered from the keyhole like thingsll be moren a tad frosty for quite a spell time heals all wounds they say though shell still write though she suggested separate letters to yer children so ye and she can thrash things out in private missives i also gathered shes of a mind that your navy can have yetwas best youre at sea and absent at least a year in foreign climes she said tme direct i did fetch a letter along sorry lad tried me damnedest but he slid a rather slim letter across the desk making lewrie lean far back from the edge half expecting it to burst into flames and whilst i was passin through london on the way here alan i also stopped off tsee your mistress she bade me bear a letter to ye as well shes not my mistress lewrie felt need to growl ive not seen her since lisbon not heard a word oh is she not his father drawled amusedly may have little need o yer loot hindi word for plunder bytheby but ive ears me lad i know th sound o fondness when a lady speaks of a feller how she asked after ye an all he added softer more kindly he slid the second over this one was thickermuch thicker and whichll i end up readin first he asked himself fearing to touch either yet unwilling to shuffle them into a drawer together that damned concerned friend letter he said instead is there a single clue as to where it came from who wrote it no return address o course his father said with a shrug of his shoulders making his epaulets dance and glitter as i said it was a good hand quite cultured in fact costly paper but no identifying seal in the wax who mightve known about your mediterranean doins lucy beauman old amour from the caribbean lewrie confessed lady lucy shockley now she was there in venice i turned down her advances well theres a wonder his father hooted once more married woman throwin herself at me and havin it off with another navy officer commander fillebrowne at the same time lewrie spat railing at lucys morals oh such shameful doins sir hugo mocked well i quite liked her husband could she be your anonymous correspondent then doubt it lewrie frowned in thought all but chewing a thumb nail a bold florid penmanship as i recall rich as croesus even when single but sheep could spell better than she could well hmmm his father prompted with a purr fillebrowne clotworthy chute diddled him with some expensive instant antique roman bronzes you recall clotworthy from harrow unfortunately yes i do his father said with a grimace fillebrowne bedded phoebe after we fell out boasted of it to row me how he learned of claudia though that was before his ship and mine served together though phoebe knew of claudia hells bells yes twas the reason we parted i couldnt tell her it was orders and knows nothing ah recent with which tplague ye his father asked almost looking relieved beyond mistress connor not a damn peep lewrie declared rather relieved by such a revelation himself if not him though i cant imagine whod be such a bastard or bitch mistress connor herself more fond o ye than she lets on oh surely not might as well accuse harry embleton lewrie scoffed and he hasnt a clue a decent hand or the wits well prhaps thisll blow over then given time and when back in anglesgreen ill tell caroline how aggrieved ye were by her suspicions how sunk in th blue devils took all aback as i think you sailors say thatd be a wondrous help father thankee and his father began to coo again when passing through london on the way as it were might there be anything youd wish me tsay to th handsome theoni connor i lewrie began to say staring off at the forward bulkhead where his wife carolines portrait hung in the dining coach i dont know quite what to say she deserves more than i mean give me her address a letterd be best a few days time to think about it then write to her before we sail for the texel again besides he attempted to make a jape i know you of old dear father id never put it past you not to inveigle your way into her good graces and her bed out of familial paternal duty if you think id do that to th only son i care tclaim then youve worse problems than a suspicious wife my son sir hugo said with a wry shake of his head were i not comfortably ensconced as it were already id be sore tempted i admit odd though that you would come over all possessive of her thats what i mean when i say youve a worse problem not her your bastard either guilt and a sense of responsibility towards them doesnt quite explain the sound of your voice oh my son my foolish son he gallingly mocked rot lewrie shot back mine arse on a bandbox but he found himself diverting his eyes from that portrait on the partition found himself instead passing a hand over his eyes as if to block it out gawd lewrie squirmed in the beginning throws of agony too scared treally face either read either letter what tdo what tdo get mine arse to sea thats what he told himself theres the dutch sure to sail out sooner or later th frogs ready to fall on ireland or us poor proteus still so raw and barely battleready compared to those problems what matters my puny and if proteus isnt ready then caroline theoni my children her child what if england s conquered what life would they have if my navy doesnt he almost gagged and wished he could throttle himself oh right he chid himself chagrined try t couch it so noble such ragin patriotic twaddle what a lecherous fool i am and in it for sure now up tmy eyebrows he prayed that proteus would be ordered back out to sea instanter to the sea his final perfect haven where a man had a chance to think where it would seem a man was safe where he had no opportunities for stirring up more trouble for himself hopefully for a long time to come afterword ive always liked to open things with a bang which is why this installment of the alan lewrie saga began with the battle of cape saint vincent on valentines day quite apt that holiday in light of lewries later troubles with the fair sex saint vincent was the first great breakout event in the career of horatio nelson his actions were totally unheard of and a reason for a court martial and firing squad at the taffrails a la admiral byng had he failed nelsons solo charge into the teeth of the larger norwest part of the spanish fleet so they could not shake themselves out in battle order or close the gap behind admiral jerviss fleet confounded them he risked their overwhelming fire yet boarded and captured one then used her as his famous patent bridge to cross and board a second larger lineofbattle ship that had come to aid the first nelson was promoted to rear admiral and became a household word got command of a squadron of his own and began to apply a unique allornothing style of seafighting all three good for his craving for glory beginning an unbroken string of lopsided annihilating victories thats not to say that i still dont think nelson was about three hotdogs shy of a picnic at times the economic problems when lewrie got home were true taxes were high wages had not kept pace the industrial revolution had been jumpstarted by the need for mountains of war materiel almost overnight a tranquil pastoral rural england was ripped from its doldrums into the steam and machine age and with enclosure acts stealing poor crofters common lands drove a horde of displaced farm workers into the cities and manufacturies later this exodus would give rise to the squalor wage slavery oppressive daylabourer poverty and other evils resulting that dickens wrote of in his condemning novels of the s and s with all this upheaval following democratic revolutions in the former american colonies and the republican revolt in france and now being exported by forceofarms by french conquests to the rest of europe mostly welcomed in the beginning by the common people who got conquered it was no wonder that england and the british isles looked more than ready for a social explosion from the bottom up the only people who could vote were those who earned or owned property worth ј per annum in some rotten boroughs and in more than a few normal the number of voters were as few as thirty perhaps twelve or a mere three or five the powerholding voters elected their own kindthe educated landholding welltodo even the titled or the sons and soninlaws of such who were easily controlled the socalled house of commons was hardly representative of the vast bulk of voteless commoners back then though there were some progressive new men who championed commoners rights such as sir samuel whitbread the ale kingwho was rumoured to have been seen conferring with some mutineers near the nore in the beginning there was already an uprising in ireland without the expected french arms and troops and angloirish tenant landlords overseers for the absentee landlords such as proteuss first captain and protestants were being burned out or refugeed to dublin the houghers and the white boys that furfy and desmond mentioned were irregular partisans preira who punished the rich oppressive and uncaring burning plundering and hamstringing houghing livestock british troops and angloirish militia units quite gleefully returned the favour all over the countryside the irish language music legends dances and the catholic religion were banned their bards priests teachers and leaders reduced to being homeless hedgefolk liable to arrest hanging prison terms or transportation for life overseas all while the songs and stories of ossian and ocarolan were madly popular with the english great stuff for making the british isles feel special and different from feelthy frogeatin frenchiesbut not good enough for their original owners the irish and the scots binns thelwall place priestley and thomas paine now exiled in france were merely a few of the influential men who spoke and wrote for more freedoms and were harried by the crown every meeting broken up by hired government mobs ordered by tory government ministers like pitt and dundas and prosecuted by the duke of portland men like the poet samuel coleridge a huge admirer of the american and french revolutions saw which way the wind was blowing and ducked for cover silenced and intimidated reformation of politics wasnt fashionable any longerand was too dangerous for dilettantes the real danger came from the many more anonymous writers and printers of penny tracts of a true rebellious bloodthirsty nature who called for real radicalismeven if everything had to go up in flames and as industry grew by leapsandbounds so did the first tentative workers guilds not owners guilds and trade unions although the government had outlawed them many a tavern pub music hall coffee house and printing shop was a forum for dissent and a fertile petri dish for revolutionary fervour in the spring of therefore england had never been closer to massive uprisings of the mob the havenots the voiceless and the war had just resulted in the introduction of the firstever income tax even middleclass shopowners and tenant farmers could be disaffected which is why books like james dugans the great mutiny and mr johnathon neales the cutlass and the lash which cover the spithead and nore mutinies are not catalogued under naval history but can be found under industrial relations the first mutiny in channel fleet at spithead and later down the coast at plymouth scared the bejesus out of everybody though it was as i wrote of it a rather respectful and dignified jackup a strike without smashed machinery punishment for scabs for the simple reason that no one in his right mind would trade places with sailors in those days or threats against the nation no one was hanged when it was over and the principal organiser speaker and representativevalentine joycewent on to participate in many battles there was no talk of revolution the duke of portlands agents sifted and probed all over portsmouth and could find no sign that it had been sponsored by anyone ashore or from overseas either the spithead mutiny was wellorganised the ships involved were united by prior service and contact because they had been based together sailed together and worked and fought together for several years admiral lord howeblack dick the seamans friendmet a respectful pleasant reception when he went down at long last to sit with the delegates and settle things whatever sentiments among those for the most part worthless quota men or the infiltrators from the united irishmen never arose it was strictly over conditions money shore leave and such that theyd mutinied and they were intelligent enough to keep it that way by the way the pay rise wasnt much a few more shillings per month for all the victualling board still tried to foist off their flour for fresh meat but the weights and measures were altered and they got rid of the worst officerslord bridport among them all officers had been sent ashore at spithead and plymouth and admiral howe and the delegates listed officers and mates to be denied a return by the posts they held not their names without formal courtsmartial and lowerclass common seamen as witnesses against the quality their reputations remained intact and as i related it only applied down at channel fleet a thing only to be abided by hm government once this caused problems later if lieutenant algy whiphand was the first officer of hms flagellant and got turned out because he was born a brutal walleyed bastard hes still free and in good odour with admiralty when assigned to another ship since his name was not put on paper only his position and years later if he runs into some mutineers from flagellant aboard hms pederasty and he has a long memory then god help the former mutineers there were also some senior officers who got yellow squadroned as unfit for future sea commissions the spithead mutiny at least weeded out a fair number of gummers and overaged ninnies who werent worth a pinch o pigshit already and action was taken about the real bastards who delighted in abusing their crews but it didnt cull many of the middle and lowerranks whod go on to command ships laterthose who were of the offwiththeirheads persuasion to start with and were utterly convinced after the mutinies that their sailors were the scum of the earth forevermore lewrie met quite a few real people in this book such as commissioner proby at chatham who really did christen hms bellerophon on a night of winter gales after shed launched herself whether proby really believed the sentiments i gave him for dramatic effect i do not know and ill thank his family to keep a cool head and lose the phone number of their solicitors if i portrayed him as more romantic or mystic than he really was evan nepeans descendants too viceadmiral buckner and commissioner captain hartwell at the nore were real people too poor buckner he really did command all and nothing no matter his vaunting title admiralty lost patience with him round the beginning of june and shipped admiral lord keith down to dictate in their name whilst still signing orders in buckners name but the old fellow was relieved soon after it ended thomas mccann and richard parker in dugans the great mutiny the yearlong loan of which i am most heartily grateful for from bob enriones personal collection thomas mccann was limned as a loose cannon hed been in hms sandwich but had been sent ashore to the naval hospital for skin ulcers where he railed against almost everything though his main complaint was the quality of the beer and hoisted a red flag from the hospitals roof mccann was such an irritating and fiery rabblerouser that towards the end of the mutiny he was kicked off his own ship and none other would accept him aboard sure every manjack would be hanged if found within a mile of him and he was the irksome sort who could turn missionaries into massmurderers that incident when mccann demanded the armschest keysthat really occurred but aboard captain william breadfruit blighs hms director rd rate gun bligh told him rather calmly given his allergic reaction to mutiny by then that he couldnt have them and mccann went bugeyed snotslingin nuts howling by god was i in director id have the armschest keys though he was at the moment aboard that ship and armed to the teeth to boot richard parker was a more enigmatic character because no one i could find for research knew much about him richard parker had entered the navy young had been a masters mate perhaps a midshipman and was reputed to have gained a lieutenants commission before challenging his captain edward riou to a duel dismissed from the service parker tried his hand as a private tutor teacher and schoolmaster essayed a few commercial pursuits but failed at each he last enlisted under his own name in scotland was now married and deep in debt he wangled a ј joining bounty to support his wife while he was at seaa mainwell job of negotiating thatand was in hms sandwich there is no record that parker ever called himself the president of the floating republic or admiral of the nore fleet he must have had some sense after all he did sign himself as the president of the fleet delegates though which was enough to get him hung in the end after being tossed out of the royal navy richard parker simply must have been infected with radical small r republican grievances as a failed gentleman who could not make a decent living his grudge against society must have been stoked by london corresponding society newspapers and tracts to a certain extentthough not perhaps as redhot as baless rolstons grudges in fact compared to the majority of the fleet delegates parker might have been considered a moderate he was educated and literate more so than the rest able to pen a telling letter and the perfect choice of the wildeyed radicals who appointed him spokesman and president later for trying to quell the greater foolishnesses of his fellow delegates he was punished by the end of his presidency every night at eight bells reelected every morning at eight bells so they could keep him under their thumbs it was parker though whose limited knowledge of legislation and his misperceptions from what i could gather who led the mutineers into thinking the acts of parliament settling the spithead mutiny were mere ordersincouncil or even if a real act or acts good but for a yearandaday poor misguided fellowhe even failed when acting as his own attorney at his court martial victim of his belief that he was capable and a man who did not lead quite as much as he was pushed from below a british naval historian told the author james dugan in ah the nore nobody will ever understand the nore compared to spithead the nore mutiny was a disorganised mess and a lot more violent none of the mutineers were as familiar with each other as the channel fleet and spithead ships had been the comment has been made that spithead was leaders looking for supporters whilst the nore was a disgruntled herd looking for leaders and they found people like mccann and parker and other firebrandsto their great loss it was brawling and violent from the outset with other ships and the shore being fired upon just after proteus escaped and those last few north sea fleet ships from great yarmouth had come down to be part of the mutiny effigies of pitt and dundas were hung from the yardarms aboard hms sandwich waverers perjurers to the oath and the remaining midshipmen petty officers and senior marines were ducked by hauling them up twoblocked to the maincourse yard then let go to sink deep in the harbour water as punishment some were flogged as rolston threatened and shown round the anchorage with cries of here is a bloody sergeant bosun midshipman etc for a time it looked as if the nore mutiny might topple the government a regiment near woolwich and the arsenal did wobble in their discipline and loyalty troops in sheerness and chatham did commingle with mutineer sailors ships anchored below the tilbury forts on the thames not twelve miles below the pool of london did join the mutiny at one time seventeen ships of the line and well over ten thousand men were involved blockaded london s vital upriver imports the downriver export trade and seized nearly two hundred merchant ships lewrie was lucky in escaping when he did for a few days later the ancient navigators guild the trinity house brethren removed all the buoys light ships beacons and channel marks near the nore in the night and extinguished the lighthouses none of the merchant ships crews joined hands with the sailors at the nore though and no foodstuffs were taken out of the captured ships the lack of supplies helped end the mutiny despite the boast that mccann made that the people are with us after the kings proclamation of st may quoted in full thankee very much the merchant sailors wouldnt even allow mutineers aboard their anchored ships sure theyd be hung with them the nore fleet did try to sail out en masse vilified in newspapers from the pulpits knowing there would be no sympathetic civilian or army revolt the green cockades erred badly by announcing that they would steer course for france and join their navy but when it came down to it most of the nore sailors even some of the initially determined hands were simply too used to being true blue hearts of oak and englishmen unable to turn real traitors become lifelong deserters or sever ties to home and kith and kin forevermore it is said that some sail was freed but not set and just as quickly was brailed back up again no capstans turned to raise anchors just as lewries crew did when he ordered proteus to set sail when the mutiny began as a final resort the nore fleet split into five distinct camps or schools of thought the largest group voted to stay in the great nore surrender and take their chances a smaller second group was of a mind to sail out for cromarty firth in scotland far from authoritys initial reach and make up their minds what to do later some wanted to sail for shannon and become a quasiirish navy to join the expected french invasion when it came if all else they thought to sell off the ships guns muskets powder and shot for what they could get to help arm the irish countrysidethen melt into the civilian population with the profits there were two other camps both forlorn and deluded by rhetoric right to the end of a mind for more radical thingsor simply too starkstaring bonkers to recognise reality if it crawled up to bite them on the ankles one group actually believed that they could continue a rebellion by sailing over to the texel to seduce admiral duncans few remaining warships into joining hands with them then sail back downchannel to the french port of cherbourg and become an english republican squadron of the french fleet the last group spurred by thoughts of the bounty mutiny with heady romances of lusty native girls perhaps by back copies of the national geographic and the discovery channel had a thought to sail to some nebulous new colony wherever and whatever that was beginning a new life of buccaneering and arrh yohoing but at the very last none of them hoisted anchor for any purpose they all ended up surrendering if you think that the tortured rhetoric that the mutineers used sounded a lot like the sort of socialist revolutionary bolshevik or peoples liberation army cant one might have heard in st petersburg in and in havana or pyongyang today ill admit that i was amazed too when reading their writings or recorded speeches it was trade unionism all hail the proletariat to a tee and the floating republic had an eerie similarity to george orwells novel or his animal farm green cockades were better than red cockadestwo legs good four legs better perhaps while delving among the stacks of the london libraries karl marx found his lingo for communism in the annals of the nore at the nore people had been wounded and killed damning insults had been uttered a republic had been proclaimed and a rebellion urged civil war threatened in the mutineers sneering response to the kings proclamation also quoted verbatim thankee and broadsides fired so there was little mercy for the nore mutineers crown admiralty and society had been humiliated and taunted enough at spithead they were not about to swallow a second more dangerous dose had the mutineers not been drunk on their own words and fantasies the nore might have ended much sooner and a lot more peacefully but their truculence was their doom mccann richard parker and dozen of others were hung as rebels as well as for being mutineers others were transported for life got long gaol sentencesa stalwart few committed suicide in the end most sailors returned to duty with the gains that spithead had gotten them and they had already possessed before rising their only comfortexcept for the part about removing officers and mates that did not apply to them i hope no one minds that rolston even i cant recall his first name from the kings coat served as a standin for richard parker and got what lewrie thought both deserved but trust lewrie to have a host of people in his past who wish to slip him a bit of the dirty and give him a comeuppance a talent pool upon which i may happily draw to challenge confuse and plague him but what would life be like if things ran as smooth as a swiss watch all the time hmm and weve plagued him pretty sore by now aint we old foes new foesit was looking rather neat with lewrie baddies til that letter showed up was it really lady lucy shockley nee beauman or commander fillebrowne a lark played by clotworthy chute or lord peter rushton a skewering connived at by harry embleton and uncle phineas chiswick zachariah twigg and his spy minions run amok in his dotage could it possibly really be theoni connor even phoebe aretino who wants him back claudia mastandrea still in the pay of french schemers admit it you didnt think of those now did you well no matter for now hes truly in the quag and will be an adventurous time and even i cant wait to find out what happens
