married poor excuse for a man hed scold himself on nights when the medicines mixed with the beer and his mood sank low on happier days he pretended to be an old cowboy this morning he was somewhere between those extremes his bunions hurt like hell two horses had died last winter and he was down to three skinny white mares and a halfblind sheepdog feed and hay bills ate up most of his social security but the nights had been warm for october and he hadnt dreamed bad and his bones felt okay it was hay that got him up at seven that morning rolling out of bed gulping coffee chewing on a stale sweet roll to hell with his blood sugar a little timeout to get the internal plumbing going and by eight he was dressed and starting up the pickup coasting in neutral down the dirt road that fed to latigo he looked both ways a couple of times cleared the crust from his eyes shifted into first and rolled down the topanga feed bin was a twentyminute ride south and he figured to stop along the way at the malibu stop shop for a few sixpacks a tin of skoal and some pringles nice morning a big old blue sky with just a few clouds from the east sweet air blowing up from the pacific switching on his

shirt and got out his chest was tight and he couldnt suck any breath into his lungs wouldnt that be the shits spared a free fall to oblivion only to drop dead of a damned heart attack he gasped and swallowed air felt his field of vision grow black and braced himself against the truck the chassis creaked and charley jumped back felt himself going down again a scream pierced the morning charley opened his eyes and straightened and saw the girl red marks around her wrists and ankles bruises around her neck beautiful young body those healthy knockers bobbing as she came running toward him sinful to think like that she was scared but with knockers like that what else was there to notice she kept coming arms wide like she wanted charley to hold her but screaming those wild eyes he wasnt sure what to do first time in a long time hed been this close to bare female flesh he forgot about the knockers nothing sexy about this she was a kid young enough to be his daughter granddaughter those marks on her wrists and ankles around her neck she screamed again ohgodohgoohgod she was right up to him now yellow hair whipping his face he could smell the fear on her see the goose bumps on her pretty tan shoulders help me poor kid was shivering charley held her chapter la s where you end up when you have nowhere else to go a long time ago id driven west from missouri a sixteenyearold high school graduate armed with a head full of desperation and a partial academic scholarship to the u only son of a moody hard drinker and a chronic depressive nothing to keep me in the flatlands living like a pauper on workstudy and occasional guitar gigs in wedding bands i managed to get educated made some money as a psychologist and a lot more from lucky investments got the house in the hills relationships were another story but that wouldve been true no matter where i lived back when i treated children i routinely took histories from parents and learned what family life could be like in la people packing up and moving every year or two the surrender to impulse the death of domestic ritual many of the patients i saw lived in sunbaked tracts with no other kids nearby and spent hours each day being bused to and from beige corrals that claimed to be schools long electronic nights were bleached by cathode and thumpthumped by the current angry music bedroom windows looked out to hazy miles of neighborhoods that couldnt really be called that lots of imaginary friends in la that i supposed was inevitable its a company town and the product is fantasy the city kills grass with red carpets worships fame for its own sake demolishes landmarks with glee because the highstakes game is reinvention show up at your favorite restaurant and youre likely to find a sign trumpeting failure and the windows covered with brown paper phone a friend and get a disconnected number no forwarding it could be the municipal motto you can be gone in la for a long time before anyone considers it a problem when michaela brand and dylan meserve went missing no one seemed to notice michaelas mother was a former truckstop cashier living with an oxygen tank in phoenix her father was unknown probably one of the teamsters maureen brand had entertained over the years michaela had left arizona to get away from the smothering heat gray shrubs air that never moved no one caring about the dream she rarely called her mother the hiss of maureens tank maureens sagging body ragged cough and emphysemic eyes drove her nuts no room for any of that in michaelas la head dylan meserves mother was long dead from an undiagnosed degenerative neuromuscular disease his father was a brooklynbased alto sax player whod never wanted a rug rat in the first place and had died of an overdose five years ago michaela and dylan were gorgeous and young and thin and had come to la for the obvious reason by day he sold shoes at a foot locker in brentwood she was a lunch waitress at a pseudotrattoria on the east end of beverly hills theyd met at the playhouse taking an inner drama seminar from nora dowd the last time anyone had seen them was on a monday night just after ten pm leaving the acting workshop together theyd worked their butts off on a scene from simpatico neither really got what sam shepard was aiming for but the play had plenty of juicy parts all that screaming nora dowd had urged them to inject themselves in the scene smell the horseshit open themselves up to the pain and the hopelessness both of them felt theyd delivered dylans vinnie had been perfectly wild and crazy and dangerous and michaelas rosie was a classy woman of mystery nora dowd had seemed okay with the performance especially dylans contribution that frosted michaela a bit but she wasnt surprised watching nora go off on one of those speeches about right brainleft brain talking more to herself than to anyone else the playhouses front room was set up like a theater with a stage and folding chairs the only time it got used was for seminars lots of seminars no shortage of students one of noras alumni a former exotic dancer named april lange had scored a role on a sitcom on the wb an autographed picture of april used to hang in the entry before someone took it down blond shinyeyed vaguely predatory michaela used to think why her then again maybe it was a good sign if it could happen to april it could happen to anyone dylan and michaela lived in singleroom studio apartments his on overland in culver city hers on holt avenue south of pico both their cribs were tiny dark groundfloor units pretty much dumps this was la where rent could crush you and day jobs barely covered the basics and it was hard sometimes not to get depressed after they didnt show up at work for two days running their respective employers fired them and that was the extent of it chapter i heard about it the way most everyone else did third story on the evening news right after the trial of a hiphop star accused of assault and floods in indonesia i was eating a solitary dinner and half listening to the broadcast this one caught my attention because i gravitate toward local crime stories couple abducted at gunpoint found naked and dehydrated in the hills of malibu i played with the remote but no other broadcast added details the following morning the times filled in a bit more a pair of acting students had left a nighttime class in west la and driven east in her car to the young womans apartment in the picorobertson district waiting at a red light at sherbourne and pico theyd been carjacked by a masked gunman who stashed them both in the trunk and drove for more than an hour when the car stopped and the trunk popped the couple found themselves in pitch darkness somewhere out in the country the spot was later identified as latigo canyon in the hills of malibu the carjacker forced them to stumble down a steep hillside to a densely wooded area where the young woman tied up the young man at gunpoint and was subsequently bound herself sexual assault was implied but not specified the assailant was described as white medium height and stocky thirty to forty with a southern accent malibu was county territory sheriffs jurisdiction the crime had taken place fifty miles from lasd headquarters but violent whodunits were handled by major crimes detectives and anyone with information was requested to phone downtown a few years back when robin and i were rebuilding the house in the hills wed rented a place on the beach in western malibu the two of us had explored the sinuous canyons and silent gullies on the land side of pacific coast highway hiked the oakbearded crests that peaked above the ocean i remembered latigo canyon as corkscrew roads and snakes and redtailed hawks though it took a while to get above civilization the reward was worth the effort a wonderful warm nothingness if id been curious enough i couldve called milo maybe learned more about the abduction i was busy with three custody cases two of them involving filmbiz parents the third starring a pair of frighteningly ambitious brentwood plastic surgeons whose marriage had shattered when their infomercial for faceliftinajar tanked somehow theyd found time to produce an eightyearold daughter whom they now seemed intent on destroying emotionally quiet chubby girl big eyes a slight stammer recently shed taken to long bouts of silence custody evaluations are the ugliest side of child psychology and from time to time i think about quitting ive never sat down and calculated my success rate but the ones that work out keep me going like a slot machines intermittent payoff i put the newspaper aside happy the case was someone elses problem but as i showered and dressed i kept imagining the crime scene glorious golden hills the ocean a stunning blue infinity its gotten to a point where its hard for me to see beauty without thinking of the alternative my guess was this case would be a tough one the main hope for a solve was the bad guy screwing up and leaving behind some forensic tidbit a unique tire tread rare fiber or biological remnant a lot less likely than youd think from watching tv the most common print found at crime scenes is the palm and police agencies have only started cataloging palm prints dna can work miracles but backlogs are ferocious and the data banks are less than comprehensive on top of that criminals are wising up and using condoms and this criminal sounded like a careful planner cops watch the same shows everyone else does and sometimes they learn something but milo and other people in his position have a saying forensics never solves crimes detectives do milo would be happy this one wasnt his then it was when the abduction became something else the media started using names michaela brand dylan meserve mug shots do nothing for your looks but even with numbers around their necks and that trappedanimal brightness in their eyes these two were soapopera fodder theyd produced a reality show episode that backfired the scheme unraveled when a clerk at krentz hardware in west hollywood read the abduction story in the times and recalled a young couple paying cash for a coil of yellow nylon rope three days before the alleged carjacking a store video confirmed the id and analysis of the rope revealed a perfect match to bindings found at the scene and to ligature marks around michaela and dylans limbs and necks sheriffs investigators followed the trail and located a wilderness outfitters in santa monica where the couple had purchased a flashlight bottled water dehydrated food packets designed for hikers a eleven near century city verified that michaela brands nearly depleted debit card had been used to buy a dozen snickers bars two packets of beef jerky and a sixpack of miller lite less than an hour before the reported time of the abduction wrappers and empty cans found a half mile up the ridge from where the couple had staged their confinement filled in the picture the final blow was the report of an emergency room physician at saint johns hospital meserve and brand claimed to have gone without food for two days but their electrolyte tests were normal furthermore neither victim exhibited signs of serious injury other than rope burn and some mild bruising of michaelas vagina that couldve been consistent with selfinfliction faced with the evidence the couple broke down admitted the hoax and were charged with obstructing officers and filing a false police report both pleaded poverty and public defenders were assigned michaelas dpd was a man named lauritz montez he and i had met nearly a decade ago on a particularly repellent case the murder of a twoyearold girl by two preadolescent boys one of whom had been montezs client the ugliness had resurfaced last year when one of the killers now a young man had phoned me out within days of his release from prison and turned up dead hours later lauritz montez hadnt liked me to begin with and my digging up the past had made matters worse so i was puzzled when he called and asked me to evaluate michaela brand why would i kid doctor we didnt exactly hit it off im not inviting you to hang out he said youre a smart shrink and i want her to have a solid report behind her shes charged with misdemeanors i said yeah but the sheriffs pissed and is pushing the da to go for jail time were talking a mixedup kid who did something stupid she feels bad enough you want me to say she was mentally incapacitated montez laughed temporary ravinglunacyinsanity would be great but i know youre all pissyanty about small details like facts so just tell it like it was she was addled caught in a weak moment swept along im sure theres some technical term for it the truth i said he laughed again will you do it the plastic surgeons little girl had started talking but both parents lawyers had phoned this morning and informed me the case had been resolved and my services were no longer necessary sure i said seriously said montez why not it didnt go that smoothly on duchay how could it true okay ill have her call and make an appointment do my best to get you some kind of reimbursement within reason reasons always good and so rare chapter michaela brand came to see me four days later i work out of my house above beverly glen in midnovember the whole citys pretty nowhere more so than the glen she smiled and said hi dr delaware wow what a great place my names pronounced mickaahla the smile was heavy firepower in the battle to be noticed i walked her through high white hollow space to my office at the back tall and narrowhipped and busty she put a lot of rollandsway into her walk if her breasts werent real their free movement was an ad for a great scalpel artist her face was oval and smooth blessed by wideset aquamarine eyes that could feign spontaneous fascination without much effort balanced perfectly on a long smooth stalk of a neck faint bruising along the sides of the neck were masked by body makeup the rest of her skin was bronze velvet stretched across fine bones tanning bed or one of those spray jobs that last for a week tiny mocha freckles sprinkled across her nose hinted at her natural complexion wide lips were enlarged by gloss a mass of honeycolored hair trailed past her shoulder blades some stylist had taken a long time to texturize the do and make it look careless half a dozen shades of blond aped nature her black stovepipe jeans hung nearly low enough to require a pubic wax her hip bones were smooth little knobs calling out for a tango partner a black jersey capsleeved tshirt rhinestoned porn star ended an inch above a wry smile of navel the same flawless golden dermis sheathed a drumtight abdomen her nails were long and frenchtipped her false lashes perfect plucked brows added to the illusion of permanent surprise lots of time and money spent to augment lucky chromosomes shed convinced the court system she was poor turned out she was the debit card finished two hundred bucks left in her checking account i got my landlord to extend me a month she said but unless i clear this up soon and get another job im going to get evicted tears welled in the bluegreen eyes clouds of hair tossed and fluffed and resettled despite her long legs shed managed to curl up in the big leather patients chair and look small what does clearing it up mean to you i said pardon clearing it up you know she said i need to get rid ofthis this mess i nodded and she cocked her head like a puppy lauritz said you were the best firstname basis with her lawyer i wondered if montez had been motivated by more than professional responsibility stop suspicious fellow focus on the patient this patient was leaning forward and smiling shyly loose breasts cupping black jersey i said what did mr montez tell you about this evaluation that i should open myself up emotionally she poked at a corner of one eye dropped her hand and ran her finger along a blackdenim knee open yourself up how you know not hold back from you just basically be myself im i waited she said im glad its you you seem kind she curled one leg under the other i said tell me how it happened michaela how what happened the phony abduction she flinched you dont want to know about my childhood or anything we may get into that later but its best to start with the hoax itself id like to hear what happened in your words my words boy half smile no foreplay huh i smiled back she unfolded her legs and a pair of highheeled black skechers alit on the carpet she flexed one foot looked around the office i know i did wrong but im a good girl doctor i really am she crossed her arms over the porn star logo where to starti have to tell you i feel so exposed i pictured her rushing onto the road naked nearly causing an old man to drive his truck off a cliff i know its tough to think about what you did michaela but it could be really helpful to get used to talking about it so you can understand me that i said but also at some point you might be required to allocate whats that to tell the judge what you did confession she said its a fancy word for confession i guess it is all these words they use she laughed softly at least im learning stuff probably not the way you wanted to thats for surelawyers cops i dont even remember who i told what its pretty confusing i said totally doctor i have a thing for that for what confusion back in phoenix in high school some people used to think i was an airhead the brainiacs you know truth is i got confused a lot still do maybe its because i fell on my head when i was a little kid fell off a swing and passed out after that i never really did too good in school sounds like a bad fall i dont remember much about it doctor but they told me i was unconscious for half a day how old were you maybe three four i was swinging high used to love to swing mustve let go or something and went flying i hit my head other times too i was always falling tripping over myself my legs grew so fast when i was fifteen i went from five feet to five eight in six months youre accidentprone my mom used to say i was an accident waiting to happen id get her to buy me good jeans and then id rip the knees and shed get upset and promise never to buy me anything anymore she touched her left temple caught some hair between her fingers and twisted pouted that reminded me of someone i watched her fidget and it finally came to me young brigitte bardot would she know who that was she said my heads been spinning since the mess its like someone elses screenplay and im drifting through the scenes the legal system can be overwhelming i never thought id be in the system i mean i dont even watch crime stuff on tv my mom reads mysteries but i hate them what do you read shed turned aside didnt answer i repeated the question oh sorry i spaced out what do i readus magazine people elle you know how about we talk about what happened sure sureit was just supposed to bemaybe dylan and i took it too far but my acting teacher her big thing is that the whole point of the training is to lose yourself and enter the scene you really need to abandon the self you know the ego just give yourself up to the scene and flow thats what you and dylan were doing i said i guess i started out thinking we were doing that and i guessi really dont know what happened its so crazy how did i get into this craziness she slammed a fist into an open hand shuddered threw up her arms began crying softly a vein throbbed in her neck pumping through coverup accentuating a bruise i handed her a tissue her fingers lingered on my knuckles she sniffled thanks i sat back down so you thought you were doing what nora dowd taught you you know nora ive read the court documents noras in the documents shes mentioned so youre saying the false abduction was related to your training you keep calling it false she said what would you like me to call it i dont knowsomething else the exercise how about that thats really what it started out as an acting exercise uhhuh she crossed her legs nora never came out and told us to do an exercise but we thought she was always pushing us to get into the core of our feelings dylan and i figured wed she bit her lip it was never supposed to go that far she touched her temple again i mustve been whack dylan and i were just trying to be artistically authentic like when i tied him up and wrapped the rope around myself i held it around my neck for a while to make sure it would leave marks she frowned touched a bruise i see it i knew it wouldnt take long to make a bruise i bruise real easily maybe thats why i dont do pain very well what do you mean im a crybaby about pain so i stay away from it she touched a spot where the scoop neck of the tshirt met skin dylan feels nothing i mean hes like stone when i tied him up he kept saying tighter he wanted to feel it pain oh yeah she said not his neck at first just his legs and arms but even that hurts when you go tight enough right but he kept telling me tighter tighter finally i screamed at him im doing it as tight as i can she gazed up at the ceiling he just laid there then he smiled and said maybe you should do my neck the same way dylan has a death wish dylans a freakit was freaky up there dark cold this emptiness in the air you could hear things crawling around she hugged herself i said this is too weird maybe it wasnt a good idea what did dylan say he just laid there with his head to the side she closed her eyes and demonstrated let her mouth grow slack and showed a half inch of pointed pink tongue pretending to be dead you know i said cut it out thats gross but he refused to talk or move and finally it got to me i rolled over to him and touched his head and he just flopped you know method acting i said puzzled stare its when you live a role completely michaela her eyes were somewhere else whatever how soon into the exercise did you tie him up second night it was all the second night he was okay before that then he started punking me i was letting him because i was scared the whole thingi was so so stupid she folded wings of golden hair forward masking her face i thought of a show spaniel in the ring handlers manipulating the ears over the nose to offer the judge a choice view of the skull dylan scared you he didnt move for a long time she said were you worried youd tied him too tight she released the hair but kept her gaze low honestly i cant tell you even now what his motivation was maybe he really was unconscious maybe he was punking me a hundred percent hesit was really his idea doctor i promise dylan thought the whole thing up everything like getting rope and where to go howd he pick latigo canyon he said he hiked there he likes to hike by himself it helps him get in character the tongue tip glided across her lower lip left behind a snailtrail of moisture he also says one day hes going to have a place there latigo canyon malibu but on the beach like the colony hes crazy intense about his career there are some people who put everything into a scene you know but later they know when to stop dylan can be cool when hes just being himself but hes got these ambitions cover of people take the place of johnny depp what are your ambitions michaela me i just want to work tv big screen episodic commercials whatever dylan wouldnt be happy with that dylan wants to be number one on the sexiest man list have you talked to him since the exercise no whose decision was that lauritz told me to stay away were you and dylan pretty close before i guess dylan said we had natural chemistry thats probably why i gotswept along the whole thing was his idea but he freaked me out up there im talking to him and shaking him and he looks reallyyou know dead not that ive ever seen anyone really dead but when i was young i liked to watch splatter flicks not now though i get grossed out easily whatd you do when you thought dylan looked dead i went crazy and started untying the neck rope and he still wasnt moving and he held his mouth open and was looking really she shook her head the atmosphere up there i was getting freaked out i started slapping his face and yelling at him to stop it his head just kept flopping back and forth like one of those loosening exercises nora has us do before a big scene scary i said scaryterrifying im dyslexic not intense dyslexic like illiterate or illegible i can read okay but it takes me a long time to memorize words i cant sound anything out i mean i can memorize my lines but i really work hard being dyslexic made it scarier to see dylan like that because my head felt all scrambled up and i couldnt think straight and then being scared blurred it like my thoughts werent making sense like being in another language you know disoriented i mean look what i did she said untied myself and climbed up that hill and ran out to the road without even putting my clothes on i had to be disoriented if i was thinking normal would i do that then after that old guy the one on the road who her frown made it as far as the left side of her mouth before retracting the old man who i was going to say the old guy saved me but i wasnt in real danger still i was pretty terrified because i still didnt know if dylan was okay by the time the old guy called the rescue squad and they got there dylan was out of the ropes and standing there when no one was looking he gave a little smile like haha good joke you feel dylan manipulated you thats the saddest thing losing trust the whole thing was supposed to be about trust noras always teaching us about the artists life as constant danger youre always working without a net dylan was my partner and i trusted him thats why i went along with it in the first place did it take him a while to talk you into it she frowned he made it like an adventure buying all that stuff he made me feel like a kid having fun planning was fun i said exactly buying the rope and the food uhhuh careful plan her shoulders tightened what do you mean you guys paid cash and used several different stores in different neighborhoods that was all dylan she said did he explain why hed planned it that way we really didnt talk about it it was likewe did so many exercises before this was just another one i felt i had to use my right side of my brain nora taught us to concentrate on using the right side of the brain just kind of slip into rightbrain stuff the creative side i said exactly dont think too much just throw yourself in nora keeps coming up silence how do you think she feels about what happened michaela i know how she feels shes pissed after the police took me in i called her she said getting caught was amateurish and stupid dont come back then she hung up getting caught i said she wasnt angry at the scheme itself thats what she told me it was stupid to get caught her eyes moistened hearing that from her mustve been tough i said shes in a power role visàvis me you try talking to her again she wont return my calls so now i cant go to the playhouse not that it matters i guess time to move on tears ran down her face i cant afford to study cause im broke gonna have to put my name in with one of those agencies be a personal assistant or a nanny or flip burgers or something those are your only choices whos gonna hire me for a good job when i need to go out on auditions and also until this is over i handed her another tissue i sure wasnt out to hurt anyone believe me doctor i know i shouldve thought more and felt less but dylan she drew up her legs again negligible body fat allowed her to fold like paper with that lack of insulation two nights up in the hills mustve chilled her even if she was lying about her fear the experience hadnt been pleasant the final police report had cited fresh human excrement under a nearby tree leaves and candy wrappers used for toilet paper now she said everyone will think im a dumb blonde some people say theres no such thing as bad publicity they do she said you think so i think people can turn themselves around she fixed her eyes on mine i was stupid and im so so sorry i said whatever you guys intended it ended up being a rough couple of nights what do you mean being out there in the cold no bathroom that was gross she said it was freezing and i felt like creepycrawlies were all over me just eating me up afterward my arms and legs and my neck hurt because i tied myself too tight she grimaced i wanted to be authentic to show dylan show him what that i was a serious actor were you out to please anyone else michaela what do you mean you had to figure the story would get exposure did you consider how other people would react like who lets start with nora i honestly felt shed respect us for having integrity instead shes pissed what about your mother she waved that off you didnt think about your mother i dont talk to her shes not in my life does she know about what happened she doesnt read the papers but i guess if its in the phoenix sun and somebody shows it to her you havent called her she cant do anything to help me she mumbled whys that michaela shes sick lung disease my whole childhood she was sick with something even when i fell on my head it was a neighbor took me to the doctor mom wasnt there for you she glanced to the side when she was stoned shed hit me mom was into drugs mostly weed sometimes shed take pills for her moods mostly she liked to smoke weed and tobacco and courvoisier her lungs are seriously burned away she breathes with a tank tough childhood she mumbled again i said i missed that my childhood i dont like talking about it but im being totally honest with you no illusions no emotional curtain you know its like a mantra i kept telling myself honesty honesty honesty lauritz told me to keep that here right in front a tapered finger touched a smooth bronze brow what did you figure would happen when the story got out silence michaela maybe tv getting on tv reality tv like a mixture of punkd and survivor and fear factor but with no one knowing whats real and what isnt its not like we were trying to be mean we were just trying to get a breakthrough what kind of breakthrough mentally what about as a career move what do you mean did you think it might get you a part on a reality show dylan thought it might she said you didnt i didnt think periodmaybe down deep unconsciously i thought it might help get through the wall what wall is that the success wall you go on auditions and they look at you like youre not there and even when they say they might call they dont youre just as talented as the girl who gets called theres no reason anything happens so why not get yourself noticed do something special or weird or terrific make yourself special for being special she got up circled the office kicked one shoe with the other and nearly lost balance maybe shed been telling the truth about being clumsy its a suck life she said being an actor being any kind of artist everyone loves artists but they also hate them grabbing her hair with both hands she yanked stretching her beautiful face into something reptilian do you have any idea how hard it is she said through elongated lips what she released the hair looked down on me as if i was thick to get anyone to pay attention chapter i saw michaela for three more sessions she spent most of the time drifting back to a childhood tainted by neglect and loneliness her mothers promiscuity and various pathologies enlarged with each appointment she recalled year after year of academic failure adolescent slights chronic isolation brought on by looking like a giraffe with zits psychometric testing revealed her to be of average intelligence with poor impulse control and a tendency to manipulate no sign of learning disability or attention deficit and her mmpi lie scale was elevated meaning that shed never stopped acting despite that she seemed a sad scared vulnerable young woman that didnt stop me from asking what needed to be asked michaela the doctor found some bruising around your vagina if you say so the doctor who examined you said so maybe he bruised me when he was checking me out was he rough he had rough fingers this asian guy i could tell he didnt like me why wouldnt he like you youd have to ask him she glanced at her watch i said is that the story you want to stick with she stretched blue jeans today riding low on her hips midriffbaring white lace vtop her nipples were faint gray dots do i need a story it could come up it could if you mention it it has nothing to do with me michaela its in the case file case file she said like i did some big crime i didnt answer she plucked at lace who cares about any of that why do you care id like to understand what happened up in latigo canyon what happened was dylan getting crazy she said crazy physically he got all passionate and bruised me what happened i said what usually happened meaning its what we did she wiggled the fingers of one hand touching each other the few times the few times you were intimate we were never intimate once in a while we got horny and touched each other of course he wanted more but i never let him she stuck out her tongue a few times i let him go down on me but mostly it was finger time because i didnt want to get close to him what happened in latigo canyon i dont see what that has to do withwhat happened your relationship with dylan is bound to fine fine she said in the canyon it was all fingers and he got too rough when i complained he said he was doing it on purpose for realism for when you were discovered i guess she said she looked away i waited she said it was the first night what else was there to do it was so boring just sitting up there getting talked out how soon did you get talked out i said real soon cause he was into this whole zen silence thing preparing for the second night he said we needed to cook images in our heads heat up our emotions by not crowding our heads with words her laughter was harsh big zen silence thing until he got horny then he had no trouble telling me what he wanted he thought being up there would make things different like id do him as if her eyes got hard i pretty much hate him now i took a day before writing an outline of my report her story boiled down to diminished capacity combined with that timehonored tactic the toddi defense the other dude did it wondering if lauritz montez was her new acting coach i phoned his office at the beverly hills court building im not going to make you happy actually it doesnt matter he said the case settled better sixtyday continuance thanks to my colleague whos representing meserve marjani coolidge know her nope shes scheduled on a roots trip to africa asked to put everything off once the sixty days are up well get another continuance and another the media scrutinys faded and the dockets jammed with serious felonies no problem keeping trivial crap at bay by the time we get to trial no one will give a shit its all pressure from the sheriffs and those guys have the attention span of gnats on smack im figuring the worst the two of them will get is teaching shakespeare to innercity kids shakespeares not her thing what is improvisation yeah well im sure shell figure it out thanks for your time no report necessary you can send one but i cant tell you itll ever get read which shouldnt bother you because turns out all i can get you paid for is straight session time at forty bucks per full hour no portaltoportal no writeup fees i kept silent hey he said budget cuts and all that sorry man dont be youre okay with it im not much for showbiz chapter two weeks after michaelas final session i spotted a paragraph at the back of the metro section abduction hoax couple sentenced a pair of wouldbe actors accused of faking their own kidnapping in order to garner attention for their careers has been sentenced to community service as part of a pleadeal arranged between the sheriffs department the district attorney and the public defenders office dylan roger meserve and michaela ally brand had been charged with a series of misdemeanors that could have led to jail time stemming from false claims of being carjacked in west los angeles and driven to latigo canyon in malibu by a masked gunman subsequent investigation revealed that the duo had set up the incident going so far as to tie themselves up and simulate two days of starvation this was the best resolution said deputy da heather bally in charge of prosecuting the duo she cited the couples youth and the absence of prior criminal record and emphasized the benefits meserve and brand could provide to the theater community citing two summer theater programs to which the pair might be assigned theaterkids in baldwin hills and the drama posse in east los angeles calls to the sheriffs office were not returned one continuance had done the trick i wondered if the two of them would bother to stay in town probably if visions of stardom still stuffed their heads id sent my invoice to lauritz montezs office still hadnt gotten paid i called him left a polite message with a machine and went about forgetting the case lieutenant detective milo sturgis had different ideas id spent new years alone and the ensuing weeks had been nothing to warble about the dog i shared with robin castagna turned ancient overnight spike a twentyfivepound french bulldog with firelog physique and the discerning eye of a practiced snob had scoffed at the notion of joint custody and gone to live with robin during his last few months of life his selfabsorbed worldview had faded pathetically as hed slipped into sleepy passivity when he started to go downhill robin let me know i began dropping by her house in venice sat on her saggy couch while she built and restored stringed instruments in her studio down the hall spike actually allowed me to hold him rested his cementblock head under my arm looking up from time to time with eyes turned filmy gray by cataracts each time i left robin and i smiled at each other for the briefest of moments never discussed what was imminent or anything else the last time i saw spike neither the taptap of robins mallet nor the whine of her power tools roused him and his muscle tone was bad offers of food treats dangled near his crusted nose evoked no response i watched the slow labored heave of his rib cage listened to the rasp of his breathing congestive heart failure the vet said he was tired but not in pain there was no reason to put him down unless we couldnt tolerate watching him go this way he fell asleep in my lap and when i lifted his paw it felt cold i rubbed it warmer sat for a while carried him to his bed placed him down gently and kissed his knobby forehead he smelled surprisingly good like a freshly showered athlete as i saw myself out robin kept working on an old gibson f mandolin sixfigure instrument heavy concentration required i stopped at the door and looked back spikes eyes were closed and his flat face was peaceful almost childlike the next morning he gasped three times and passed away in robins arms she phoned me and cried out the details i drove to venice wrapped the body called the cremation service stood by as a nice man carried the pathetically small bundle away robin was in her bedroom still weeping when the man left i went in there one thing led to another during the time robin and i were apart she hooked up with another man and i fell in and out of love with a smart beautiful psychologist named allison gwynn i still saw allison from time to time occasionally the physical pull wed both felt asserted itself as far as i knew she wasnt seeing anyone else i figured it was only a matter of time new years shed been in connecticut with her grandmother and a host of cousins shed sent me a necktie for christmas id reciprocated with a victorian garnet brooch i still wasnt sure what had gone wrong from time to time it bothered me that i couldnt seem to hold on to a relationship sometimes i wondered what id say if i was sitting in the other chair i told myself introspection could rot your brain better to concentrate on other peoples problems it was milo who ended up providing distraction at nine am on a cold dry monday morning one week after the hoax settlement that girl you evaluated mikki brand the one who faked her abduction they found her body last night strangled and stabbed didnt know her nickname was mikki the things you say when youre caught off guard thats what her mother calls her shed know i said i met him at the scene forty minutes later the murder had taken place sometime sunday night by now the area had been cleaned and scraped and analyzed yellow tape taken down the sole remnants of brutality were short pieces of the white rope the coroners drivers use to bind the body after they wrap it in heavyduty translucent plastic filmy gray plastic same hue i realized as cataractdimmed eyes michaela brand had been found in a grassy area fifty feet west of bagley avenue north of national boulevard where the streets cut under the freeway a faint oblong gloss caught sunlight where the body had compressed the weeds the overpass provided cold shade and relentless noise graffiti boasted and raged on concrete walls in some places the vegetation was waist high crabgrass vying for nutrition with ragweed and dandelions and low creeping things i couldnt identify this was city property part of the freeway easement sandwiched between the tailored affluent streets of beverlywood to the north and the workingclass apartment buildings of culver city to the south a few years back thered been some gang problems but i hadnt heard of anything lately still it wouldnt be a place where id walk at night and i wondered what had brought michaela here her apartment on holt was a couple of miles away in la thats a drive not a walk her fiveyearold honda hadnt been located and i wondered if shed been jacked for real this time too ironic milo said whatre you thinking i shrugged you look contemplative let it out man nothing to say he ran his hand over his big lumpy face squinted at me as if wed just been introduced he was dressed for messy work rustcolored nylon windbreaker washandwear white shirt with a curling collar skinny oxblood tie that resembled two lengths of beef jerky baggy brown trousers and tan desert boots with pink rubber soles his fresh haircut was the usual style meaning skinned at the sides which emphasized all the white thick and black on top a cockscomb of competing cowlicks his sideburns now drooped a half inch below fleshy earlobes suggesting the worst type of elvis impersonator his weight had stabilized my guess was two sixty on his seventyfourinch frame a lot of it abdomen when he stepped away from the overpass sunlight amplified his acne pits and gravitys cruel tendencies we were months apart in age he liked to tell me i was aging a lot more slowly than he was i usually replied that circumstances had a way of changing fast he makes a big deal about not caring how he looks but ive long suspected theres a selfimage buried down deep in his psyche gay but not what you expect rick silvermans long given up on buying him clothes that never get worn rick gets his hair trimmed every two weeks at a highpriced west hollywood salon milo drives every two months to la brea and washington where he hands his seven bucks plus tip to an eightynineyearold barber who claims to have cut eisenhowers hair during world war ii i visited the shop once with its gray linoleum floors creaky chairs yellowed brylcreem posters featuring smiling toothy white guys and similarly antique pitches for murrays straightening pomade aimed at the majority black clientele milo liked to brag about the ike connection probably a oneshot deal i said whys that so maurice could avoid a courtmartial that conversation wed been in an irish bar on fairfax near olympic drinking chivas and convincing ourselves we were lofty thinkers a man and a woman hed been pretending to look for had been nabbed at a traffic stop in montana and were fighting extradition theyd slain a vicious murderer a predator whod sorely needed killing the law had no use for moral subtlety and news of the capture led milo to deliver a cranky philosophical sermon downing a double he apologized for the lapse and changed the subject to barbering maurice isnt courant enough for you wait long enough and everything becomes courant maurice is an artist im sure george washington thought so dont be an ageist he can still handle those scissors such dexterity i said he shouldve gone to med school his green eyes grew bright with amusement and grain alcohol couple of weeks ago i was giving a talk to a neighborhood watch group in west hollywood park crime prevention basic stuff i got the feeling some of the young guys werent paying attention later one of them came up to me skinny tan oriental tats on the arm all that cut muscle said he dug the message but i was the stodgiest gay man hed ever met sounds like a comeon oh sure he tugged at a saggy jowl released skin took a swallow i told him i appreciated the compliment but he should be paying more attention to watching his back when he cruised he thought that was a double entendre and left cracking up west hollywoods the sheriff i said why you you know how it is sometimes im the unofficial spokesman for law enforcement when the audience is alternative captain pressured you that too he said i walked over to where michaela had been found milo remained several feet back reading the notes hed taken last night a flash of white stood out among the weeds another nub of coroners rope the drivers had trimmed the bindings because michaela had been a slim girl i knew what had happened at the scene her pockets emptied her nails cleaned of detritus hair combed out any product collected finally attendants had packaged her and lifted her onto a gurney and wheeled her up into a white coroners van by now shed be waiting along with dozens of other plastic bundles stacked neatly on a shelf in one of the large cool rooms that line the gray hallways of the basement crypt on mission road they treat the dead with respect at mission road but the backlog the sheer volume of bodies cant help but leach out the dignity i picked up the rope smooth substantial as it had to be how did it compare to the yellow binding michaela and dylan had purchased for their exercise where was dylan now i asked milo if he had any idea he said first thing i did was call the number on his arrest form disconnected havent located his landlord michaelas either she told me she was running out of money had a months grace before eviction if she did get evicted be good to know where shes been crashing think they couldve moved in together not if she was leveling with me i said she blamed the whole thing on him i scanned the dump site not much blood killed somewhere else looks that way who found the body woman walking her poodle dog sniffed it out pronto strangled and stabbed manual strangulation hard enough to crush the larynx the followup was five stab wounds to the chest and one to the neck nothing around the genitalia she was fully clothed nothing overtly sexual about the pose strangulation itself can be a sexual thing some lust killers describe it as the ultimate dominance it takes a long time to stare into the face of a struggling gasping human being and watch the life force seep out one monster i interviewed laughed about it time goes quickly when youre having fun doc i said anything under her nails nothing overly interesting lets see what the lab comes up with no hair fibers either not even from the dog apparently poodles dont shed much any of the wounds defensive no she was dead before the cutting started the neck wound was a little stick to the side but it got the jugular fives too many for impulse cuts but less than youd expect from an overkill frenzy any pattern with her clothes on it was hard to see much of anything except wrinkles and blood ill be at the autopsy let you know i stared at the glossy spot milo said so she blamed meserve for the hoax lots of love lost she said shed come to hate him hatreds a fine motive lets try to locate this movie star chapter dylan meserve had cleared out of his culver city apartment six weeks ago failing to give notice to the company that owned the place the firm represented by a pinchfeatured man named ralph jabber had been more lax than michaelas landlord dylan owed three months back rent we encountered jabber walking through the empty flat and jotting notes on a clipboard the unit was one of fiftyeight in a threestory complex the color of ripe cantaloupe the sevilles tripometer put it three miles from where michaelas body had been found that placed the murder scene roughly equidistant from the couples respective apartments and i said so to milo what the two of them reaching some kind of common ground im pointing out not interpreting he grunted and we walked through unguarded double glass doors into a mustysmelling lobby done up in copper foil wallpaper pumpkincolored industrial carpet and ubuild scandinavian furniture made of something yellow that yearned to be wood dylan meserves unit was on the far end of a dark narrow hallway from ten yards away i could see the open door hear the supercharged whine of an industrial vacuum cleaner milo said so much for trace evidence and walked faster ralph jabber motioned to the dark little woman pushing the vacuum she flipped a switch that quieted but didnt silence the machine what can i do for you milo flashed the badge and jabber lowered his clipboard i caught a glimpse of the checklist floors a normal wear b tenant liability walls jabber was sallow short and sunkenchested in a shiny black fourbutton suit over a white silk tshirt brown mesh loafers without socks he had nothing to offer about his former tenant other than the outstanding rent milo asked the woman what she knew and got an uncomprehending smile she was less than five feet tall sturdily built with a carvedteak face ralph jabber said she doesnt know the tenants the vacuum idled like a hot rod the woman pointed to the carpet jabber shook his head glanced at a rolex too huge and diamondencrusted to be genuine el otro apartmente the woman wheeled the machine out of the apartment dylan meserve had lived in a rectangular white room maybe three hundred square feet a single aluminum window set high on one of the long walls granted a view of gray stucco the carpeting was coarse and oatcolored the vestpocket kitchenette sported orange formica counters chipped white along various corners prefab white cabinets smudged gray near the handles a brown spacesaver refrigerator left open empty fridge bottles of windex and easyoff and a generic brand of disinfectant sat on the counter scuff marks bottomed some of the walls little square indentations compressed the carpet where furniture had sat from the number of dents not much furniture ralph jabbers clipboard lay flat against his thigh now i wondered how hed scored the scene three months back rent said milo you guys are pretty flexible its business said jabber without enthusiasm what is we dont like evictions prefer to keep the vacancy rate low so you let him ride yeah anyone talk to mr meserve about it i wouldnt know how long would mr meserve have had to go before you threw him out jabber frowned every situation is different mr meserve asked for an extension its possible like i said i dont know how come i dont handle the rents im the terminationtransition manager said jabber that sounded like a euphemism for mortician milo said meaning i fix the place up when its vacant get it ready for the new tenant got a new tenant for this one jabber shrugged it wont take long the place is highdemand milo looked around the small dismal room location location location you got it close to everything lieutenant the studios the freeways the beach beverly hills i know its not your area of expertise sir but im trying to trace mr meserves activities if he hadnt asked for an extension would there be some reason youd simply let him go for three months jabbers eyelids half closed milo moved closer used his height and bulk to advantage jabber stepped back off the record is it a sensitive topic mr jabber no no not thatto be honest this is a big building and weve got others even bigger sometimes things getoverlooked so maybe meserve got lucky and just sneaked by jabber shrugged but eventually said milo his failure to pay rent wouldve caught up with him of course yeah anyway we got at least his first month and damage deposit hes not getting nothing back cause he didnt give notice howd you find out he was gone phone and electricity got shut off for nonpayment we pay the gas but the utilities notify us when the other stuff goes kind of an early warning system jabber smiled uneasily not early enough when did the phone and electricity get shut off youd have to call the main office or you could jabber frowned pulled out a cell phone punched an autodial threedigit code samir there hey sammy ralph i am yeah the usualtell me when did the juice get squeezed off at overland d why cause the cops wanna know yeahwho knows sammy theyre here now want to talk to them yourselfokay then just tell me so i can get them outta so they can find out what they wanna know listen i got six more to deal with sammy including two in the valley and its already elevenyeah yeah ninety seconds passed phone tucked between his ear and his shoulder jabber walked into the kitchenette opened cabinets ran his finger inside drawers fine yeah okay yeah i will yeah he clicked off utilities went four weeks ago one of our inspectors said thered been no mail for six weeks four weeks ago and you just came by today jabber colored like i said its a big company you the owner i wish my fatherinlaw that him you were talking to jabber shook his head brotherinlaw family affair said milo by marriage said jabber his lips twisted into a tight pale blossom okay i gotta lock up whos the inspector my sisterinlaw samirs wife samir has her come around check things out shes not too bright never told anyone about the nomail you have any idea where mr meserve went i wouldnt know him if he walked in right now why all the questions whatd he do milo said would anyone at the company have information about him no way said jabber who rented to him he probably used one of the services rentsearch or one of them its online or you can call mostly people do it online hows it work applicant submits an application to the service service passes it along to us applicant qualifies he puts down the deposit and the first month and moves in once we get occupancy we pay a commission to the service meserve have a lease month to month we dont do leases leases dont keep the vacancy rate down you get a bum said jabber doesnt matter whats on paper what does it take to qualify as a tenant hey said jabber lots of homeless would kill for a place like this you ask for references sure who did meserve give like i said im just the call your brotherinlaw please three references a previous landlord in brooklyn the manager of the foot locker where dylan meserve had worked before getting arrested and nora dowd artistic director of the playhouse in west la where the young man had been listed as a creative consultant jabber examined what hed written down before passing it along to milo guys an actor he laughed you rent to a lot of actors actor means bum samirs stupid i followed milo to the west la station where he parked his unmarked in the staff lot and got into the seville meserve stopped his mail soon after he got busted he said probably planning to rabbit if things didnt work out in court he searched his notepad for the acting schools address what do you think of that creative consultant business maybe he apprenticed to earn extra money michaela blamed dylan for the hoax but obviously nora dowd didnt howd michaela feel about that she didnt talk about noras reaction to dylan she was surprised at noras angry reaction to her dowd boots her but keeps him on as consultant if its true meserve faked the reference meserves been known to embellish milo phoned brooklyn located the landlord dylan had cited as a reference guy said he knew dylans father because hes a parttime musician himself and they used to gig he has a vague memory of dylan as a kid but never rented him an apartment creative consultant i said lets talk to the consultee chapter the playhouse was an old onestory craftsman house on an oversized lot just north of venice boulevard in west la plank siding painted deep green with cream trim lowset bulk topped by sweeping eaves that created a small dim porch the garage to the left had oldfashioned barn doors but looked freshly painted the landscaping was from another age a couple of fourstory cocoa palms indifferently pruned bird of paradise grown ragged agapanthus and calla lilies surrounding a flat brown lawn the neighborhood was workingclass rental residential mostly boxy multiunits and boxy houses awaiting demolition nothing denoted the acting schools function the windows were dark milo said guess she doesnt need to advertise or keep daytime hours i said if most of the aspirants have day jobs its an evening business lets check it out anyway we walked up to the porch floored with green board thickly varnished the window in the paneled oak door was blocked with opaque lace a handhammered copper mailbox perched to the right milo flipped the lid and peered inside empty he pushed a button and chimes sounded no answer two doors down an old dodge dart backed out toward the street hispanic man around thirty at the wheel leaving a pale blue bungalow milo walked over rolled his arm no badge but people tend to obey him the man lowered his window morning sir know anything about your neighbor big shrug nervous smile no hablo ingles milo pointed the school la escuela another shrug no se milo looked into his eyes waved him away as the dart sped off we returned to the porch where milo jabbed the button several more times a chime sonata went unanswered okay ill try again tonight as we turned footsteps sounded from inside the playhouse lace wiggled in the window but didnt part then nothing milo swiveled and rapped the door hard scratches as a bolt turned the door swung open and a heavy man holding a broom and looking distracted said yeah before the word was out of his mouth his eyes tightened and distraction gave way to calculation this time milo had the badge out the heavy man barely glanced at it his second yeah was softer wary he had a splotchy pietin face a meaty offkilter nose brambles of curly graying hair that flew from his temples muttonchops that petered to a colorless grizzle the mustache atop parched lips was the sole bit of disciplined hair clipped precise a graybrown hyphen tight eyes the color of strong tea managed to be active without moving wrinkled gray work shirt and matching pants open sandals thick white socks dust and sweepings flecked white cotton toes the tattoos that embroidered his fleshy hands promised to snake up under his sleeves blueblack skin art crude and squareedged hard to decipher but i made out a tiny little grinning demons head more impish than satanic leering at a puckered knuckle milo said is nora dowd here nope what about dylan meserve nope you know mr meserve i know who he is low slurred voice slight delay before forming syllables his right hand gripped the broom handle the left had gathered shirt fabric and stretched it over his substantial belly what do you know about mr meserve said milo the same hesitation one of the students he doesnt work here never saw that we were told hes a creative consultant no answer whens the last time you saw him small yellow teeth made a play at a cracked upper lip a while days yeah weeks could be wheres ms dowd dunno no idea nossir shes your boss yessir want to guess where she might

peatys lower jaw jutted like a bulldogs rotated as if chewing gristle any reaction to that sir said milo terrible any idea whod want to do something like that peaty shook his head and ran his hand up and down the broom shaft yeah it is terrible said milo such a pretty girl peatys small eyes narrowed to pupilglint you think he did it who meserve any reason we should think that you asked about him milo waited peaty rolled the broom they did that thing together that thing it was on tv you think that might be connected to michaelas murder mr peaty maybe why would it be peaty licked his lips they didnt come here together no more for acting lessons yessir did they come separately just him meserve kept coming but not michaela yessir sounds like a lot of your days stretch into nights sometimes

whatd you think about that it was on tv what do you think of it peaty tried to chew on his mustache but the clipped hair was too short for a tooth hold he tugged at his right muttonchop i tried to think of the last time id seen a set that overgrown college days portrait of martin van buren peaty said it aint good to lie i agree with you there my job people are always lying to me and it really gets on my nerves peatys eyes dropped to the porch planks where were you last night mr peaty say between eight pm and two am home your place on guthrie yessir doing what eating said peaty chicken fingers takeout frozen i heat em up i had a beer what brand old milwaukee i had three then i watched tv then i went to sleep whatd you watch family feud what time did you pop off dunno the tv was goin when i woke up what time was that peaty curled a muttonchop maybe three one hour past the bracket milo had given him how do you know it was three you asked so i said something anything special about three sometimes when i get up i look at the clock and its three or three thirty even if i dont drink a lot i gotta get up peaty looked at the floor again to piss sometimes twice or three times lets hear it for middle age said milo peaty didnt answer how old are you mr peaty thirtyeight milo smiled youre a young guy no answer how well did you know michaela brand i didnt do it said peaty i didnt ask you that sir this other stuff youre asking where was i peaty shook his head i dont wanna talk no more just routine said milo no reason to get shaking his head peaty backed away toward the door milo said here we were having a nice conversation then i ask you how well you knew michaela brand and all of a sudden you dont want to talk thats only gonna make me wonder it aint said peaty groping for the door handle hed left the oak panel slightly ajar and the handle was inches out of reach aint what said milo right talking like i did something peaty edged back found the handle and shoved revealing oak floors and walls a glimmer of stained glass i had a beer and went to sleep three beers no answer listen said milo no offense intended but its my job to ask questions peaty shook his head i eat and watch tv that dont mean nothing he stepped into the house started to close the door milo checked it with his shoe peaty tensed but let go his grip on the broom handle swelled his knuckles he shook his head and stray hairs floated free landing on thick rounded shoulders mr peaty leave me alone more whimper than demand all were trying to do is get some basic facts so how about we come in and peatys hand grabbed the doors edge not allowed we cant come in no the rules whose rules ms dowds how about i call her whats her number dunno you work for her but dont dunno peaty danced backward and shoved the door hard milo let it slam we stood on the porch for a few moments cars drove up and down the street milo said for all i know hes got rope and a bloody knife in there but no damn way to find out i said nothing he said you could argue with me there is the fact that hes weird i said yeah yeah he said guy lives on guthrie off robertson you visualizing the same map i am blocks from michaela not much farther to the crime scene and hes weird he glanced back at the door rang the bell several times no response wonder what time he got to work this morning another bellpush we waited he put his pad away id love to check this place out but im not even gonna think about heading round back and giving some lawyer an illegal entry angle he grinned one day in and ive got trial fantasies okay lets see what we can do within the boundaries of the law we descended the porch and headed for the car its probably no big deal he said not getting inside even if peaty is the bad guy why would he bring evidence to work what do you think of him probabilitywise a definite maybe i said talking about michaela clearly made him nervous like he had a crush on her she was a beautiful girl and way out of his league he said working around all those starlet wannabes could be frustrating for a guy like that we got into the seville i said when peaty shook his head stray hairs fell out fellow that hirsute and unruly youd think hed have left some trace on the body or at least at the scene maybe he had time to clean up guess so there was some wind last night he said the body coulda been there a while before the poodle came by for all we know the damned dog licked up trace evidence the owner let it nose the body milo rubbed his face the owner claims she yanked it away the minute she saw what it was still i started up the car he said i need to be careful not to tunnel in on anyone too quickly makes sense sometimes i do that chapter a dmv check revealed no vehicles currently registered to reynold peaty no california drivers license ever hard to transport a body without wheels i said milo said wonder how he gets to work the bus or a stretch limo your attempt at humor is refreshing if he bears further watching ill check out the bus routes see if hes a regular he laughed i said what he comes across dumb and weird but think about it he sweeps up at an acting school he was playing us the worlds a stage he said sure be nice to have the script if he was performing why would he put on a weird act i said truelets head back i drove toward the west la station as he phoned the mta and learned which buses peaty wouldve taken from picorobertson to the playhouse transfers and the need to cover several blocks on foot stretched a halfhour car trip to at least a ninetyminute journey i said michaelas honda show up yet nopeyoure thinking peaty coulda jacked her the hoax mightve given him ideas life imitating art he punched numbers on his cell talked briefly hung up no sign of it yet but were not talking conspicuous a civic black no less if the plates are off or replaced it could take a long time to spot it if peaty is the bad guy i said maybe he decided to drive to work this morning and ditched it within walking distance of the playhouse that would be pretty damned stupid yes it would he chewed his cheek mind turning around we cruised the halfmile radius surrounding the acting school peering up and down streets and alleys driveways and parking lots taking more than an hour then expanding to another half mile and spending another hundred minutes spotting lots of civics three of them black all with plates that checked out on the way back to the station milo tried the coroners office and learned that michaelas autopsy was scheduled in four days maybe longer if the body count stayed high any way to prioritize yeah yeah i knowbut if theres anything you can do appreciate it this one could get complicated i sat in the spare chair of milos tiny windowless office as he tried to plug reynold peaty into the data banks his computer took a long time to sputter to life even longer for icons to fill the screen then they disappeared and the screen went black and he started all over again fourth pc in eight months yet another handmedown this one from a prep school in pacific palisades the last few donated machines had enjoyed the shelf life of raw milk in between clunkers two and three milo had paid for a highpriced laptop with his own money only to see some glitch in the stations electrical system fry his hard drive as the disk drives ground on he sprang up muttering about advanced middle age and plumbing and left for a few minutes returning with two cups of coffee he handed one to me drank his snatched a cheap cigarillo from his desk drawer unwrapped it and jammed the unlit cylinder between his incisors tapping his fingers as he stared at the screen he bit down too hard splintered the cigar wiped tobacco shreds from his lips tossing the nicaraguan pacifier he got himself another smokings prohibited anywhere in the building sometimes he lights up anyway today he was too antsy to enjoy the fruits of misdemeanor as the computer struggled to resuscitate he sorted through his messages and i reviewed the prelim on michaela brand studied the crime scene photos beautiful golden face turned a familiar greengray milo grimaced as the screen flashed and dimmed and flashed if you want to translate war and peace feel free to do so i tasted the coffee put it aside closed my eyes and tried to think of nothing sound came through the walls too murky to classify milos space is at the end of a hall on the second floor set well apart from the detectives room not an overcrowding issue hes set apart listed on the books as a lieutenant but hes got no administrative duties and continues to work cases its part of a deal he made with the former police chief a cozy bit of politics that allowed the chief to retire rich and unbothered by criminal charges and milo to remain in the department as long as his clearance rate stays high and he doesnt flaunt his sexual preferences no one bothers him but the new chiefs big on drastic change and milo keeps waiting for the memo that will disrupt his life meanwhile he works whirwhir burp clickclick he sat up okay here we go he typed no state record too badlets try ncic cmon baby give it to uncle miloyes he pushed a button and the old dotmatrix printer near his feet began scrolling paper yanking out the sheets he tore on the perforated line read handed them to me reynold peaty had accumulated four felony convictions in nevada burglary thirteen years ago in reno a peeping tom three years later in that same city pled down to public intoxicationdisturbing the peace two drunk driving violations in laughlin seven and eight years ago hes still drinking i said three beers he admits to a longstanding alcohol problem would account for no drivers license boozehound peeper you see those tattoos jailbird but no felonies on record since he crossed the border five years ago that impress you mightily nope what impresses me he said is the combination of burglary and voyeurism breaking in for the sexual thrill i said all those dna matches that end up turning burglars into rapists booze to lower inhibitions young sexy girls parading in and out its a lovely combination we drove to reynold peatys place on guthrie avenue clocking the route from the dump site along the way in moderate traffic only a sevenminute traverse of beverlywoods impeccable treelined streets after dark even shorter on the first block east of roberston the neighborhood was apartments and the maintenance was sketchier peatys secondfloor unit was one of ten in an ashcolored twostory box the livein manager was a woman in her seventies named ertha stadlbraun tall thin angular with skin the color of bittersweet chocolate and marcelled gray hair she said the crazy white fellow she invited us into her groundfloor flat for tea and sat us on a lemoncolored pressedvelvet camelback couch the living room was compulsively ordered with olive carpeting ceramic lamps bricabrac on open shelves a suite of what used to be called mediterranean furniture crowded the space an airbrushed portrait of martin luther king dominated the wall over the couch flanked by school photos of a dozen or so smiling children ertha stadlbraun had come to the door wearing a housecoat excusing herself she disappeared into a bedroom and came back wearing a blue shift patterned with clocks matching pumps with chunky heels her cologne evoked the cosmetics counter at some midsized department store from my midwest childhood what my mother used to call toilet water thanks for the tea maam said milo hot enough gentlemen perfect said milo sipping orange pekoe to demonstrate he eyed the school pictures grandchildren grandchildren and godchildren said ertha stadlbraun and two neighbor children i raised after their mother died young sure you dont want sugar or fruit or cookies no thanks mrs stadlbraun nice of you what is taking in a neighbors kids ertha stadlbraun waved away the praise and reached for the sugar bowl my glucose level i shouldnt do this but im going to anyway two heaping teaspoons of white powder snowed into her cup so what is it you want to know about the crazy fellow how crazy is he maam stadlbraun sat back smoothed the shift over her knees let me explain why i pointed out he was white its not because i resent him for that its because hes the only white person here is that unusual said milo are you familiar with this neighborhood milo nodded ertha stadlbraun said then you know some of the single houses are going white again but the rentals are mexican once in a while you get a hippie type with no credit rating wanting to rent mostly weve got the mexicans coming in waves of them our building is me and mrs lowery and mr and mrs johnson whore really old on the black side the rest are mexican except for him does that pose problems people think hes strange not because he raves and rants because hes too quiet you cant communicate with the man never talks at all person wont look another person in the eye said ertha stadlbraun makes everyone nervous antisocial i said someone walks your way you say hello because when you were a child you learned proper manners from your mama but this person didnt learn and doesnt have the courtesy to reply he lurks around thats the word for it lurk like that butler on that old tv show he reminds me of that fellow the addams family said milo lurch lurch lurk same difference the point is hes always got his head down staring at the ground like hes looking for some treasure she pushed her head forward turtlelike bent her neck sharply and gawked at her carpet just like this how he sees where hes going is a mystery to me he do anything else that makes you nervous maam these questions of yours are making me nervous routine maam does he do its not what he does hes just an odd one whyd you rent to him maam i didnt he was already here before i moved in how long is that i arrived shortly after my husband died which was four years ago i used to have my own house in crenshaw nice neighborhood then it got bad now its getting nice again after walter passed on i said who needs all this space a big yard to take care of a fasttalking real estate agent offered me what i thought was a good price so i sold big mistake at least ive got the money invested been thinking about getting another house maybe out in riverside where my daughter lives you get more for your money there she patted her hair meanwhile im here and what they pay me to manage covers my expenses and then some whos they the owners couple of brothers rich kids inherited the building from their parents along with a whole lot of other buildings does mr peaty pay his rent on time thats one thing he does do said stadlbraun first day of the month postal money order he go to work every day stadlbraun nodded where i have no idea does he ever entertain visitors him she laughed where would he entertain if i could show you his place youd see what i mean teenyweeny used to be a laundry room until the owners converted it to a single theres barely room for his bed and all hes got besides the bed is a hot plate and a little tv and a dresser when were you inside last mustve been a couple of years ago his toilet backed up and i called a rooter service to snake it i was ready to blame it on him you know overstuffing the commode like some fools do regret made her eyes droop turns out it was lint when they converted it no one had the sense to clean the traps and somehow the lint got wadded up and moved round and caused a godawful mess i remember thinking what a teeny little place how can anyone live like this milo said sounds like a cell thats exactly what it is stadlbraun squinted sat back folded her arms across her chest you shouldve told me from the beginning young man told you what maam like a cell hes an excon right whatd he do that sent him to prison more important whatd he do to bring you around now nothing maam we just need to ask a few questions come on now said ertha stadlbraun no shillyshallying at this point young man you are not asking me questions because that ones thinking of running for president whatd he do nothing that we know of thats the truth mrs stadlbraun you dont know anything for certain but you sure suspect something i really cant say more mrs stadlbraun this is not right sir your job is to protect citizens so you should say hes a crazy person and an excon living in the same building with normal folks maam hes done nothing this is part of a preliminary investigation and hes one of several people were talking to she folded her arms across her dress is he dangerous tell me yes or no theres no reason to think that thats a lawyer answer what if hes one of those ticking time bombs you hear about on the news real quiet until he explodes some of the mexicans have kids what if hes one of those perverts and you didnt tell me why would you think that maam he is said stadlbraun a pervert thats what this is about no maam and it would be a real bad idea its in the news every day all these perverts it wasnt like that in my day where did they all come from milo didnt answer ertha stadlbraun shook her head he gives me the willies and now youre telling me hes an excon child molester milo leaned in closer i am definitely not telling you that maam it would be a terrible idea to spread those kinds of rumors youre saying he could sue me im saying that mr peaty is not suspected of anything he may be a material witness and were not even sure of that this is what we call a background check we do it all the time to be thorough mostly it ends up going nowhere ertha stadlbraun considered that some job youve got milo suppressed a smile if you were in danger id tell you i promise maam another hair pat well ive got nothing more to tell you wouldnt want to be careless and spread rumors she stood milo said may i ask a few more questions such as when he comes home from work does he ever leave again her chest heaved hes an innocent lamb but you want to know about his scheduleoh never mind youre clearly not going to tell me the truth she turned her back on us does he ever leave once hes home said milo not that ive seen but i dont keep tabs what about last night she faced us again shot a disgusted look last night i was busy cooking three whole chickens green beans with onions yams coleslaw with bacon shreds four pies i freeze early in the week so i can relax on sunday when the kids come to visit that way i can defrost sunday morning before church get back and heat up and we have a real dinner not that greasy fast food so you didnt notice what time mr peaty came in i never notice she said never i might see him come in occasionally what time does he usually get here from work six seven and weekends far as i can tell weekends he stays inside all day but im not going to promise you he never leaves its not like hed stop by to say hello him with those eyes aiming down like hes counting ants on a hill i certainly cant tell you about last night while i cooked i had music on then i watched the news then i watched the essence awards then i did a crossword and went to sleep so if youre looking for me to alibi that nut forget it chapter much has been made of geographical profiling criminals remaining within a comfort zone like any theory sometimes it pans out sometimes it doesnt and you get killers prowling the interstate or venturing far from home so they can establish a comfort zone far from prying eyes with any alleged rules about human behavior youre lucky if you do better than chance but the fourminute drive from peatys apartment to michaela brands place on holt was hard to ignore her building was a mintgreen fifties dingbat the front was an open carport set behind oilspecked concrete six parking slots unoccupied but for a dusty brown dodge minivan the facade was spanned by two olivegreen diamonds speckles in the stucco caught afternoon light way too giddy a bank of keylock mailboxes set into the wall just south of the parking area bore no names only unit numbers no manager designation michaelas compartment was shut tight milo squinted through the slot lots of stuff inside her apartment was at the back louvre windows as old as the building were a burglars dream the glass slats were folded shut but green curtains had been left slightly parted dark inside but the outlines of furniture were clear milo began knocking on doors the only tenant at home was a woman in her twenties wearing a stiff brandycolored wig and a calflength denim jumper over a white longsleeved sweater the wig made me wonder about chemotherapy but she was buxom and her gray eyes were clear the same kind of lightly freckled complexion michaela brand had been blessed with open face tightened by surprise i saw the side curls and yarmulke on the squirming blond boy she was holding and got it some orthodox jewish women covered their natural hair out of modesty the badge made her press her son to her chest yes the boys arms and feet shot out simultaneously and she nearly lost her grip he looked to be three or so stocky and sturdy twisting and turning emitting little growly noises calm down gershie yoel the boy waved a fist hero hero yehudah fall the elephant he squirmed some more and she gave up and set him down he rocked on his feet and growled some more eyed us and said fall gershie yoel go in the kitchen and take a cookie but only one and dont wake up the babies herohero yehudah hamakawbee gonna spear you bad greek go now good boy or no cookie grr gershie yoel ran off past walls covered with bookshelves books on every table and the couch any remaining space was filled with playpens and toys and packages of disposable diapers the boys shouts diminished hes still celebrating the holidays said the young woman hanukkah said milo she smiled yes he thinks hes yehudah judah maccabee thats a big hero in the hannukah story the elephant is from a story about one of his brothers she stopped blushed what can i do for you were here about one of your neighbors mrs winograd shayndie winograd milo had her spell it and wrote it down she said you need my name just for the record maam which neighbors the punk rockers which punk rockers are those she pointed to an upstairs unit two doors down over there unit four three of them they think theyre musicians my husband tells me theyre punk rockers i dont know from such things she held her ears noise problem said milo there was before said shayndie winograd everyone complained to the owner and its been okayexcuse me a second i need to check on the babies please come in we cleared books from a brown corduroy couch leatherettebound volumes goldembossed with hebrew titles shayndie winograd returned still sleeping boruch thank god how many babies said milo twins she said seven months ago mazel tov said milo threes a lot to handle shayndie winograd smiled three would be easy ive got six five are schoolage gershie yoel should be in school but he was coughing this morning and i thought maybe he had a cold then wouldnt you know he got miraculously better milo said the lord works in mysterious ways her smile widened maybe i should have you talk to him about honestyso is the problem the punk rockers this is about ms brand the tenant in unit three the model said shayndie winograd she modeled i call her that because she looks like a model pretty very skinny whats the problem unfortunately maam she was murdered last night shayndie winograds hand flew to her mouth oh my god oh no she reached back for an armchair removed a toy truck and sat down who did it thats what were trying to find out mrs winograd maybe her boyfriend whos that another skinny one out of milos attaché came dylan meserves book shot from the hoax winograd glanced at the photo thats him he was arrested hes a criminal he and ms brand were involved in a situation it was in the papers we dont read the papers what kind of situation milo gave her a summary of the phony abduction she said why would they do such a thing it seems to have been a publicity stunt shayndie winograds stare was blank to help their acting careers said milo i dont understand its hard to understand maam they thought the attention might help them get noticed in hollywood so why would you think mr meserve would hurt ms brand sometimes they screamed at each other you heard it up here on the second floor it was loud what did they scream about shayndie winograd shook her head i didnt hear the words just the noise were these fights frequent is he a bad person dangerous youre not in any danger maam how often did he and ms brand scream at each other i dont know he didnt live here he just came over how often once in a while whens the last time you saw him she thought weeks whens the last time they had an argument even longerid say a month maybe more she shrugged im sorry i try not to notice things not wanting to pry said milo i dont want nahrish foolish things in my life so mr meserve hasnt been here for a few weeks at least said shayndie winograd and when did you last see ms brand herlet me thinknot recently but she used to come in late the only time i ever noticed her was when i was out late with my husband and thats not often the children the children get up early everyones always needing something dont know how you do it maam you concentrate on whats important milo nodded so you havent seen ms brand recently could you think back maybe come up with something more specific the young woman pushed back a lock of tightsprayed supplementary hair maybe two weeks three i really cant say more than that dont want to give you false testimony milo suppressed a smile the young woman shook her head i go out to work i just dont look at things that arent important with six kids you have time to work at the preschool i stay half a day what happened to her its terrible was it the way she lived what do you mean maam im not insulting her but we live one way they live another way they the outside world shayndie winograd reddened i shouldnt be talking like this my husband says each person should pay attention to their own actions not what other people do your husbands a rabbi he has smicha hes a rabbi but he doesnt work as a rabbi half a day he does bookkeeping the rest of the time he learns learns what shayndie winograd smiled again torah judaism he goes to a kollel its like a graduate school working on an advanced degree said milo he learns for the sake of learning ahanyway sounds like you guys have your hands fullso tell me about michaela brands way of life she was the normal way whats the american way now meaning tight clothes short skirts going out all the time going out with who the only one i saw was the one in the picture sometimes she went out alone shayndie winograd blinked a few times we said hello she said my children were cute once she offered chaim sholom my sixyearold a candy bar i took it because i didnt want to insult her but it wasnt kosher so i gave it to a mexican lady who works at the day careshe always smiled at the children seemed like a nice girl deep sigh so terrible for her family she ever talk about family no sir we never really had a conversation just to say hello and smile milo put his pad away he hadnt written anything down anything else you can tell me maam like what whatever comes to mind no thats it said shayndie winograd another deep blush she was beautiful but i felt sorry for her showing a lot ofherself but she was nice smiled at the babies one time i let her hold one because i was getting into the car and had lots of packages so you had no problems with her no no not at all she was nice i felt sorry for her thats all why living by herself all the going out people think they can go out and do anything they want but the world is dangerous this proves it no squalls sounded from a bedroom uhoh we followed her into a tenbyten room taken up by two cribs the occupants were a pair of infants purple with indignation and from the aroma freshly soiled gershie yoel bounced like a slinky toy and tried to butt his mother as she changed diapers stop it these men are policemen and if you dont behave they can take you to the beis hasohar like yosef aveenu the little boy growled beis hasohar i mean it you good boy to us thats jail yosef joseph from the bible he ended up there seven years until pharaoh took him out whatd he do said milo nothing she said but he was accused by a woman she rolled up a filthy diaper wiped her hands bad things even then there were bad things milo left his card at the other apartments when we got to the ground floor the mail carrier was distributing envelopes afternoon said milo the postman was a grayhaired filipino short and slight his us postal service van was parked at the curb his right hand grasped one of several keys on a chain attached to his belt as the left pressed bound stacks of mail against his torso hlo he said milo identified himself whats the situation in box three what do you mean whens the last time she emptied it the carrier opened michaelas compartment looks like not for a while he let the keychain drop and used both hands to separate the stacks two for her today its not my regular routelucky this is all she got not much room left milo pointed to the two envelopes can i take a look at those the mailman said you know i cannot do that i dont wanna open them said milo she got murdered last night i just wanna see whos writing to her murdered thats right its not my regular route you already said that the carrier hesitated handed over the envelopes bulk solicitation to apply for a lowinterest home loan and a last chance pitch to resubscribe to instyle magazine milo handed them back how about the stuff inside thats private property said the mailman what happens when you come back in a few days and theres no more room we leave a notice where does the mail go stays in the station i can get a warrant and come by and open it all up if you say i say i just wanna look at the envelopes that are in there seeing as the box is already open privacy when she got killed she lost her privacy the carrier made a show of ignoring us as he went about delivering mail to the other tenants milo reached into box three removed a thick stack wedged so tightly he had to ease it out and thumbed through mostly junka few billsurgent one from the gas company meaning she was overduesame deal with the phone company he inspected the postmarks ten days worth looks like she was gone well before she died a vacations not likely i said she was broke he looked at me both of us thinking the same thing maybe someone had kept her for a while chapter we sat in the car in front of michaelas building i said dylan meserve cleared out of his place weeks ago the neighbor heard him and michaela arguing and michaela told me she hated him maybe he came and got her said milo took her on another adventure what about mr sex criminal peaty maybe he snatched both of them if peaty did abduct anyone he didnt take them to his place i said no way to keep that from mrs stadlbraun and the other tenants too small to entertain still hes the one with the record and hes weird so now ive got two highpriority bins as we drove away he said coffee would prop my eyelids i stopped at a place on santa monica near bundy scrawled the possibilities as i saw them on a napkin and slid it across the table as milo returned from making some calls dylan meserve abducts and murders michaela then flees reynold peaty abducts and murders michaela and dylan reynold peaty abducts and murders michaela and dylans disappearance is a coincidence none of the above its that last one i love milo waved for the waitress ordered pecan pie à la mode finishing most of the wedge in three gulps he nibbled the rest with excruciating care as if that proved selfrestraint i called michaelas mother again it was all about her big time woeisme too sick to come out to claim the body the way she was gasping i figure its probably true i summarized michaelas account of her childhood ugly duckling he said every gorgeous girl says thatwhat that jewish lady said the lifestyle issue maybe she had a point michaela got caught up in the hollywood thing you know what that does to the ninetyninepointnine percent who fall on their asses the question is did it snag her or was it just one of those badluck deals like running into peaty he ate the last bit of pie wiped his mouth put way too much money on the table and extricated himself from the booth back to the salt mine lots of boring stuff to do boring was his code word for i need to be alone i drove him to the station and went home that evening michaelas murder was the lead story on every local broadcast blowdried news readers half smiling as they intoned about the shocking crime and exhumed mocksolemn memories of michaela and dylans publicity stunt dylan was cited as a person of interest not a suspect the implication was clear as it always is when the police phrase it that way i knew milo hadnt given them the quote probably some public relations officer issuing yet another boilerplate release next mornings paper ran a pagethree story with five times the ink space the hoax had merited graced by two pictures of michaela a sultry airbrushed headshot taken by a photographer who churned them out for hollywood hopefuls and her lapd booking photo i wondered if either or both would resurface in the tabloids or on the internet one way to get famous is to die the wrong way i didnt hear from milo that day figured the tips would be pouring in and hed either learn a lot or nothing i filled my time polishing up reports thought about getting a dog took a new referral from an attorney named erica weiss weiss had filed suit against a santa monica psychologist named patrick hauser for molesting three female patients whod attended his encounter groups chances were it would settle and thered be no court appearance i negotiated a high hourly fee and felt pretty good about the deal i looked up hausers office address santa monica and seventh allison also practiced in santa monica a few miles away on montana i wondered if she knew hauser thought about calling her figured she might see it as an excuse to get in touch and decided against it at a quarter to six when she was likely to be between patients i changed my mind her private line was still on speed dial hi its me hi she said howve you been fine you finei was about to say howve you been handsome got to watch those little slips all compliments will be received with gratitude oh gorgeous one listen to this smarmy mutual admiration society if im lyin im flyin silence i said im actually calling on a professional matter ali do you know an esteemed colleague named patrick hauser ive seen him at a few meetings why i told her she said i guess im not surprised rumor has it he drinks an encounter group huh that does surprise me why he seems more the corporate consultant type how many patients are we talking about three thats pretty damning hauser claims its a group delusion theres no physical evidence so it boils down to a he saidthey said the state boards been sitting on it for months still hasnt handed down a disposition the women got impatient and contacted a lawyer all three have one lawyer theyre framing it as a miniclass action hoping others will hear about it and come forward howd they find out theyd had similar experiences with hauser they hung around after session went for drinks it came out not too smart of hauser to put them in the same room fondling patients is no act of genius so you think he did it im openminded but all three were seeing hauser for mild depression nothing delusional like i said hes known to imbibe thats all i can tell you thanksso hows it been life in general she said its been okay want to join me for dinner where had that come from she didnt answer i said sorry rewind the tape no she said im thinking about the offer when did you mean im open including tonight hmmill be free in an hour have to eat anyway where you name it how about that steak place she said the one where we met the first time i asked for a booth away from the mahogany bar with its lowpitched alkie chatter and sports on tv by the time allison showed up ten minutes later id finished my chivas was working on my second glass of water the restaurant was dim and she stood there for a few seconds letting her eyes adjust her long black hair swung free and her ivory face was serious i thought i saw tension around the shoulders she stepped forward revealed color an orange pantsuit hugged her trim little body tangerineorange with that hair of hers halloween costume couldve been a problem but she made it work she spotted me strode forward on high heels the usual adornments sparkled at earlobes wrists and neck gold and sapphire the stones brought out the deep blue of her eyes and played off the orange her makeup was perfect and her nails were frenchtipped the smile that parted her lips was hard to read a substantive woman but she takes a long time getting herself together the kiss on my cheek was quick and cool she slid into the booth just close enough to make conversation feasible but too distant for easy touching before we could talk the waiter had planted himself in front of us eduardo the feisty one eightyyearold argentinian immigrant who claimed he could cook seafood better than the chef he bowed before allison evening dr gwynn the usual no thanks she said its a little chilly outside so i think ill have an irish coffee make it decaf eduardo or ill be calling you up at three am to play cards his smile said that wasnt a dreaded outcome very good doctor another chivas sir please he marched off i said been coming here a lot no why he used your name i guess im here every three weeks or so alone or with another guy she said the tbone made a lasting impression on me eduardo returned with drinks and menus extra whipped cream for allisons irish coffee bowing again he left we touched glasses and drank allison licked foam from her upper lip her face was smooth and white as fresh cream shes thirtynine but when she eases up on the jewelry she can pass for ten years younger she pushed her drink away hows robin i worked at a casual shrug i guess shes okay havent seen her much not much sleeping with her i put my scotch down she said that means yes when in doubt revert to shrink tactics i kept quiet sorry that was totally inappropriate she smoothed hair away from her face i knew it and felt like asking anyway bending over her coffee she inhaled steam youre entitled to sleep with anyone you want i just yearned to be bitchy sometimes i wouldnt mind sleeping with you myself sometimes is better than never on the face of it why shouldnt we she said two healthy libidinous people we were great together faint smile except when we werentnot very profound is it we drank in silence the second chivas brought on a nice warm buzz maybe thats why i said so what the hell happened you tell me im asking you and im asking you back i shook my head she drank laughed not that anythings funny eduardo came over to take the food order saw the looks on our faces and turned heel allison said maybe nothing went wrong it was just evolution devolution alex when we started out there was this rush of feeling every time i saw you all i had to do was hear your voice and this sympathetic nervous system thing kicked in this incredible flood of emotion sometimes when the doorbell rang and i knew it was you thered be this heat like a hot flash i started to worry i was going through early menopause she looked into her irish coffee sometimes id get sopping wet that was something i touched her hand cool she said maybe we just had some kind of hormonal thing going on and it faded maybe every damn thing boils down to hormones and were in the wrong damn field she turned away grabbed for her purse fumbled for a tissue and poked at her eyes one drink and my filter goes byebye her mouth set in a way that thinned her lips ill probably regret saying this but what really bothered me when i felt things diminishing was that it wasnt that way with grant her dead husband wharton grad rich kid successful financial type hed succumbed young to a freakishly rare cancer even when allison loved me shed talked about him adoringly you had something great with him i said you werent a replacement alex i swear worse things to be dont be noble she said it makes me feel worse i said nothing she said i just lied big time it did fade with grant after i buried him he stopped being physical to me and turned into aawraith i felt still feel guilty about that i groped for a reply every option sounded like shrinky cant coming here had been a mistake suddenly allisons hip was touching mine and she was taking my face in her hands kissing me hard she retreated ended up even farther down the booth we sat there alex what i felt about you in the beginning was every bit as intense as with grant more intense on the physical level which also made me feel guilty i started to think about us in a longterm sense wondering what it would be like then we had that problem on the malley case and things just started to change i know that alone couldnt have done it there mustve beenoh listen to me i sound like every other talky broadits confusing the work stuff was part of what turned me on and then all of a sudden it repulsed me the malley case was the eightyearold child murder one of allisons patients a fragile young woman had been drawn in id deceived her all in the name of truth justice robin had never liked hearing about the work stuff allison had chased gory details with a vengeance i said things change they do dammit she looked away if i said your place or mine would you feel manipulated maybe for a nanosecond im not going to say it not tonight im feeling really unattractive theres a delusion for you inside im unattractive she said i wouldnt be good believe me i raised my glass to brutal honesty sorry want to forget about dinner dinner wasnt a ploy to get you in the sack what was it i dont knowmaybe a ploy to get you in the sack she smiled i smiled eduardo had positioned himself across the room spying on us while pretending to be above it all i said i could eat i could too she waved him over dinner with a former lover how civilized in that frenchmovie kind of way shifting closer she lifted my left hand traced the outline of my thumbnail still here what is that split in the crescent the little pacman growing out of your nail i always thought it was cute my body part id never noticed it she said its the same you chapter i spent the next day interviewing the three women whod filed suit against dr patrick hauser individually they came across vulnerable as a group they were calmly credible time for hausers insurance company to settle and cut its losses the following morning i got to work on my report was still in the thinking phase when milo called hows it going big guy its going nowhere at warp speed still havent gotten into michaelas place landlord doesnt like leaving la jolla if he doesnt get here soon im popping the lock i talked to the reno detective who nabbed reynold peaty for peeping the story was peaty was in an alley behind an apartment building drunk as a skunk looking through the drapes of a rear unit bedroom the objects of his affliction were three college girls some guy walking his dog saw peaty wagging his weenie and yelled peaty ran the guy gave chase knocked peaty to the ground called the cops brave citizen defensive tackle on the u nevada football team he said student neighborhood groundfloor rear unit i said just like michaelas the girls were a little younger than michaela but you could make a case for victim similarity what got peaty off light was that these three had a history of being less than careful about the drapes also the prosecutors never got word of peatys burglary conviction years before that was a daylight breakin cash and ladies undies voyeur meets up with exhibitionists and everyone goes home happy because the exhibitionists didnt want to testify the girls exuberance extended to getting creative with videotape their main concern was their parents finding out peatys a definite creep and ive promoted him to the penthouse of the highpriority bin time for a second interview i tried no sign of him or anyone else at the playhouse this morning ditto for his apartment mrs stadlbraun wanted to have tea again i drank enough to constipate a rhino and she talked about her grandkids and her godkids and the lamentable state of modern morality she said shed started watching peaty more closely but hes gone most of the day im gonna have binchy tail him any decent phone tips mostly the usual martians and maniacs and morons but there was one im following up on thats why i called wire service picked up the times story and some guy in new york phoned me yesterday couple of years ago his daughter went missing out here what got me interested was she was going to acting school too the playhouse father has no idea there seems to be lots he doesnt know an mp report was filed on this girl tori giacomo but it doesnt look like anyone pursued it no surprise given her age and no sign of foul play the guy insisted on flying out so i figure i can spare him some time were scheduled at three pm hope he likes indian food if youve got time i could use some supplementary intuition about what ruling his daughter out listen to him but dont tell me what i want to hear do i ever no he said thats why youre my pal pink madras curtains separate café moghuls interior from the traffic and light of santa monica boulevard the shadowy storefront is walking distance from the station and when milo needs to bolt the confines of his office he uses it as an alternative work site the owners are convinced the presence of a large menacinglooking detective serves the same purpose as a welltrained rottweiler once in a while milo obliges them by handling homeless schizophrenics who wander in and try to sample the allyoucaneat lunch buffet the buffets a recent introduction im not convinced it wasnt put in place for milo when i got there at three pm he was seated behind three plates heaped with vegetables rice curried lobster and some kind of tandoori meat a basket of onion naan was half full a pitcher of cloveflavored tea sat at his right elbow napkin tied around his neck only a few sauce specks offhour for lunch and he was the only diner the smiling bespectacled woman who runs the place said hes here sir and led me to his usual table at the rear he chewed and swallowed try the lamb a little early for me chai tea said the bespectacled woman i pointed to the pitcher just a glass very good last time id seen her shed been trying out contact lenses she said i had allergies to the cleaning solution my nephews an ophthalmologist he says lasiks safe milo tried to hide his wince but i caught it he lives with a surgeon but blanches at the thought of doctor visits good luck i said the woman said im still not sure and left to get my glass milo wiped his mouth and pulled a blue folder from his attaché copy of tori giacomos missing person file feel free to read but i can summarize in a minute go ahead she was living in north hollywood alone in a single working as a waitress at a seafood place in burbank she told her parents she was coming out to be a star but no ones aware of any parts she got and she had no agent when she disappeared the landlord stored her junk for thirty days then dumped it by the time mp got around to checking there was nothing left the parents werent notified when she skipped she was twentyseven didnt leave their number on her rental application who did she give as a reference file doesnt say were talking two years ago he consulted his timex her father phoned from the airport an hour ago unless there was some disaster on the freeway he shoulda been here already he squinted at numbers hed scrawled on the cover of the folder punched his cell phone mr giacomo lieutenant sturgis im ready for youwhere whats the cross street no sir thats little santa monica its a short street that starts in beverly hills which is where you arethree miles east of hereyes there are two of them little and bigi agree it doesnt makeyeah la can be a little strangejust turn around and go north to big santa monicatheres some construction but you can get throughsee you sir he hung up poor guy thinks hes confused now twenty minutes later a compact darkhaired man in his fifties pushed the restaurant door open sniffed the air and walked straight toward us as if he had a score to settle short legs but big strides racewalking to what he wore a brown tweed sportcoat that fit around the shoulders but was too roomy everywhere else a faded blue plaid shirt navy chinos bubbletoed work shoes the dark hair was flatblack with reddish tints that betrayed the use of dye dense at the sides but sparse on top just a few strands over a shiny dome his chin was oversized and cleft his nose fleshy and flattened brooding eyes looked us over as he approached no taller than five nine but his hands were huge sausagefingered furred at the knuckles with more black hair in one hand was a cheap red suitcase the other shot out lou giacomo choosing me first i introduced myself minus the doctorate and he shifted quickly to milo lieutenant going for rank military experience or plain old logic good to meet you mr giacomo hungry giacomos nose wrinkled they got beer all kinds milo summoned the bespectacled woman lou giacomo told her bud regular not light removing his jacket he draped it over the back of his seat tweaked the arms and the shoulders and the lapel until it hung straight the plaid shirt was shortsleeved his forearms were muscled hirsute cudgels producing a billfold he withdrew a pale blue business card and handed it to milo milo passed it over louis a giacomo jr appliance and small engine repair you smash em we patch em red wrench logo in the center address and phone number in bayside queens giacomos beer arrived in a tall chilled glass he looked at it but didnt drink when the bespectacled woman left he wiped the rim of the glass with his napkin squinted swabbed some more appreciate you meeting with me lieutenant learn anything about tori not yet sir why dont you fill me in giacomos hands clenched he bared teeth too even and white to be anything but porcelain first thing you gotta know no one looked for tori i called your department a bunch of times talked to all these different people finally i reached some detective some guy named mortensen he told me nothing but i kept calling he got sick of hearing from me made it real clear tori wasnt highpriority it was missing kids he was into then he stopped answering my calls so i flew out but by that time hed retired and moved to oregon or somewhere i lost my patience said something to the detective they transferred me to to the effect of whats wrong with you you care more about traffic tickets than people he had nothing to say giacomo frowned into his beer sometimes i lose my patience not that it woulda made a difference i coulda been the nicest guy in the world no one was gonna do anything to find tori so i have to go back and tell my wife i got nothing and she goes and has a nervous breakdown on me he pinged a thumbnail on the side of his glass milo said sorry she got over it said giacomo doctors gave her antidepressants counseling whatever plus she had five other kids to deal with the babys thirteen still in the house keeping busy thats the best thing helps her not think about tori milo nodded and drank tea giacomo finally lifted his glass and drank tastes like bud he said what is this place pakistani indian we got those where i come from indians them and their restaurants i never been bayside said milo grew up there stayed there hasnt changed that bad except now on top of your italians and your jews you get chinese and other orientals and indians i fixed a coupla their washing machines ever been to bayside milo shook his head giacomo looked at me i said been to manhattan thats it thats the city the citys for the filthy rich people and homeless poor people you got no room for the normal people in between he took a generous swallow of beer definitely bud rolling a fist on the table he flexed his forearms tendons jumped the big white teeth again eager to bite something tori wanted to be noticed since she was a little girl my wife told her she was special taking her to these baby beauty contests sometime she won a ribbon it made the wife happy dancing and singing lessons all these school plays problem was toris grades werent so great one semester they threatened her shed have to drop out of theater arts unless she passed math she passed with a d but thats what it took threats i said acting was her main thing her mother was always telling her she could be this big movie star encouraging her for the whatchmacallit the selfesteem sounds good but it also put ideas in toris head ambitions i said giacomo pushed his glass away tori shoulda never come out here what did she know about being on her own it was the first time she was ever on a plane this is a crazy place right you guys tell me if im wrong milo said it can be rough crazy giacomo repeated tori never worked a day in her life before she came out here until the baby came along she was the only girl its not like shes gonna work with me right did she live at home before she came out here always with her mother doing everything for her she never made her own bed thats why it was crazy picking up out of the blue was it a sudden decision i said giacomo frowned her mother was putting it in her head for years but yeah when she announced it it was sudden tori was nine years outta high school but she done nothing except for getting married and that didnt last whend she get married said milo when she was nineteen a kid she dated in high school not a bad guy but not too bright giacomo tapped his head at first mikey worked for me i was trying to help out kid couldnt figure out how to use a frickin allen wrench so he went to work with his uncle instead doing what sanitation department like the rest of his family good pay and benefits you get in the union its all about who you know used to do it myself but you come home stinkin and i got tired of that tori said mikey stunk when he came home it wouldnt wash off maybe thats why she got it annulled i dunno how long did the marriage last said milo three years then shes back at home sitting around doing nothing for five years except going out on auditions for commercials modeling whatever she ever get anything giacomo shook his head bending he unzipped a compartment of the red suitcase and drew out two headshots tori giacomos face was millimeters longer than the perfect oval huge dark eyes were topped by feathery fake lashes toodark eye shadow from another era same cleft chin as her father pretty maybe borderline beautiful it had taken me a few seconds to come to that conclusion and in a world of flash impressions that wouldnt be enough in one photo her hair was long dark and wavy in the other shed switched to a shoulderlength feathery platinum cut shes always been a gorgeous kid said lou giacomo but that aint enough right you gotta do immoral stuff to get ahead toris a good girl never missed mass on sunday and thats not cause we forced her my oldest sister became a nun and tori was always close to mary agnes mary agnes pulled strings with the monsignor to get the annulment through tori had a spiritual side i said very very spiritual when i was out here i found out where the churches were near her apartment and went to all of them giacomos eyes narrowed no one knew her not the priests the secretaries no one so right away i knew something was wrong his expression said he meant that on more than one level i said torid stopped going to church giacomo sat up straighter some of those churches they werent much to look at not like st robert bellarmine where my wife goes thats a church so maybe tori wanted a nice church like she was used to i dunno i went to the biggest one you guys got downtown talked to an assistant to the assistant to the cardinal or whatever thinking maybe they had some records no one knew a damn thing there either he sat back thats it ask me whatever you want milo began with the usual questions starting with toris exhusband the nottoobright odiferous mikey lou giacomo said mortensen wanted to know the same thing so ill tell you what i told him no way first off i know the family and theyre good people second mikeys a good kid the soft type you know third he and tori stayed friendly there was no problem they were just too young fourth he never been out of new york he huffed glanced over his shoulder not much business in this place the food got a problem how often did tori call home coupla times a week she talked to her mother she knew i wasnt real happy about her picking up and leaving she thought i didnt understand nothing whatd she tell her mother that she was making a living on tips and learning how to act learning where giacomo frowned she never said i doublechecked with the wife after i talked to you you can call her and ask any questions you like but all shes gonna do is cry believe me give me mikeys last name said milo for the record michael caravanza works at the forest hills branch he and tori looked happier split up than at the wedding like both of them were free or something he snorted like you can ever be free go ahead ask me more ten more minutes of questioning revealed a sad truth louis giacomo junior knew precious little about his daughters life since shed come out to la milo said the article on michaela brand caught your attention the acting thing you know giacomos shoulders dropped i read it got sick in the stomach i dont wanna think the worst but its been two years no matter what her mother says tori woulda called what does her mother say arlene gets crazy theories in her head tori met some billionaire and shes off on some yacht stupid stuff like that the whites of giacomos eyes had pinkened around the edges he choked back a surge of emotion with a furious growl so what do you think he demanded of milo this dead girl have something to do with tori i dont know enough to think anything yet sir but you figure toris dead right i couldnt say that either mr giacomo you couldnt say but you know it and i know it two years no way she wouldnt call her mother milo didnt answer the other girl said giacomo who killed her the investigation just opened you get a lot of those girls wanna be movie stars getting into big trouble it happens bet it happens plenty whats the name of the acting school the other girl went to milo rubbed his face sir it really wouldnt be a good idea for you to go over there why not like i said its a new investigation all i wanna do is ask if they knew tori ill ask for you sir if i learn something ill call you thats a promise promises promises said giacomo its a free country nothing illegal about going over there interfering with an investigations illegal sir please dont complicate your life that a kinda threat its a request not to interfere if i learn anything about tori ill tell you milo put money on the table and stood lou giacomo got up too picked up his red suitcase and fished in a rear pants pocket ill pay for my own beer dont worry about it i dont worry worryings a waste of time ill pay for my own beer giacomo pulled out a wallet stuffed so thick it was nearly round taking out a five he tossed it near milos cash if i call your medical examiners ask about unclaimed bodies whatre they gonna tell me what makes you think that happened to tori mr giacomo i was watching this show on cable forensics detectives something like that they said bodies dont get claimed sometimes you do a dna solve an old case so what would they tell me if i asked if a decedent is identified and someone offers proof of family relationship theyre given forms to fill out and the body can be released is it one of those long painintheass redtape things it can usually be done in two three days how long do they keep em around said giacomo unclaimed bodies milo didnt answer how long lieutenant legally the maximums a year but its usually sooner how much sooner it can be thirty to ninety days whoa in and out huh said giacomo what you got a dead body traffic jam milo was impassive even if its a murder pressed giacomo for a murder they got to keep it around right no sir dont they need to hold on to it for all that forensic stuff evidence is collected and stored whats notnecessary isnt kept what some union flunkys getting paid off to ditch bodies said giacomo theres a space issue same deal even with murder same deal said milo okay then what where does the body go if nobody claims it sir just tell me giacomo buttoned his jacket im one of those people meets crap facetoface dont do no running away i never fought in no wars but the marines trained me to deal whats the next step the county crematorium they burn itokay what happens to the ashes theyre placed in an urn and kept for two years if a verified relative steps forward and pays to cover transportation costs they get the urn if no one claims the urn the ashes are scattered in a mass grave at the evergreen memorial cemetery in boyle heights thats east la near the coroners office the graves are marked with numbers its a group scattering no individual identification is possible not all the unclaimed bodies are kept at the main crypt some are out in sylmar which is a suburb north of la and others are even farther out in lancaster which is a city in the antelope valley the high desert maybe seventy miles east rattling off the facts in the low emotionless voice of a reluctant penitent giacomo took it without flinching seemed almost to revel in the details i thought about the cheap plastic urns the county used bundles stacked in room after room of the coldstorage basement on mission road bound by sturdy white rope the inevitable rot that sets in because refrigeration slows decomposition but doesnt stop it during my first visit to the crypt i hadnt thought that through and expressed surprise to milo at the greenish patches mottling a corpse lying on a gurney in the basement hallway middleaged man with a john doe designation awaiting transfer to the crematorium paperwork laid across his decaying torso listing the meager details known milos answer had been painfully glib what happens to steak when you leave it in the fridge too long alex now he told lou giacomo im really sorry for your situation sir if theres anything else you want to tell us about tori id like to hear it like what anything that would help find her the restaurant she worked her mother thinks it had something with lobster in it the lobster pot said milo riverside drive in burbank it went out of business eighteen months ago you checked it out said giacomo surprised youre looking for tori because you do think it had something to do with the other girl im exploring all the possibilities sir giacomo stared at him you got something youre not telling me no sir when are you going back home who knows where are you staying same answer said giacomo ill find something theres a holiday inn on pico past sepulveda said milo not far from here why would i wanna be close to here said giacomo no reason what you wanna keep tabs on me no sir got plenty to do milo motioned to me the two of us headed for the door the bespectacled woman said was everything tasty lieutenant milo said great lou giacomo said yeah everythings fantastic chapter giacomos rental escort was parked in a loading zone ten yards from café moghul the predictable ticket secured by a wiper blade milo and i watched him snatch the citation and rip it into confetti paper snow floated to the curb he shot milo a defiant look milo pretended not to notice giacomo stooped picked up the shreds put them in his pocket rolling his shoulders he got in the escort and drove off milo said every time i start off in one of those situations i tell myself to be sensitive somehow it gets messed up you did fine he laughed i said with all his frustration and grief it couldnt have gone any differently thats exactly what you were supposed to say at least something in lifes predictable we walked east on santa monica passed an asian import shop where milo stopped and pretended to be fascinated by bamboo when we resumed walking i said think giacomos right about tori being dead its a distinct possibility but maybe her mothers right and shes off partying in capri or dubai what do you think of the actingschool angle lots of those in la i said lots of young waitpersons aiming for bigger and better be interesting if tori took classes at the playhouse but short of that you see any stunning parallels a few similarities but more differences michaelas body was left out in the open if tori was murdered the killer sure didnt want her discovered we turned right and walked south on butler what if were looking at an escalation thing alex our bad boy started off hiding his handiwork but acquired confidence and decided to advertise someone like peaty moving from peeping to assault i said getting progressively more violent and brazen that does come to mind a sexual aspect to michaelas killing would support it there was no positioning and she was left fully clothed but maybe she was played with at the killspot tidied up before being transported autopsys due soon right it just got kicked up another day or two or four busy time at the crypt always are they really moving the bodies out that fast if only the freeways worked as well wonder how many jane does are in storage i said if tori ever was there shes long gone as her daddy will learn soon enough what are the odds hes calling them right now if she was my daughter thats what id be doing he sniffed cleared his throat scratched the side of his nose raised a pink wormy welt that faded as quickly as it had materialized got a cold i said nah airs been itching me probably some crap blown in by the santa susannasyeah id be hounding them too back at his office he tried the coroners office again and asked for a rundown on young caucasian jane does in the crypt the attendant said the computer was down they were shortstaffed a hand search of the records would take a long time any calls from a guy named louis giacomo father of a missing girlwell he probably will hes having a hard time go easyyeah thanks turo let me ask you something else whats the average transfer time to cremation nowadays just an estimate im not gonna use it in court thats what i thoughtwhen you do check the inventory go back a couple of years okay twenties caucasian five five a hundred twenty giacomo first name tori he spelled it she could be a blonde or brunette or anything in between thanks man he hung up swiveled in his chair sixty seventy days and its off to the furnace spinning back to his phone he called the playhouse again listened for a few seconds slammed the receiver down last time it just rang this time i got sultry female voice on tape the next class something called spontaneous ingathering is tomorrow night at nine nocturnal schedule like we guessed i said sultry huh think lauren bacall getting over the flu maybe its ms dowd if shes an actor herself velvety pipes wouldnt hurt voiceovers are a mainstay for unemployed actors i said so are coaching gigs for that matter those who cant do teach entire universities operate on that premise he laughed okay lets see what dmv has to say about the goldenthroated ms dowd nora dowds dob made her thirtysix five two a hundred and ten pounds brown and brown one registered vehicle a sixmonthold silver range rover mk iii home address on mccadden place in hancock park nice neighborhood he said bit of a drive to the school hollywoods just across melrose from hancock park youd think a hollywood address would attract screenhopefuls maybe dowd got a break on the rent or she owns the place mccadden and her wheels says shes got bucks a wealthy dilettante who does it for fun i said hardly a rare bird he said lets see if this one sings wilshire boulevard near museum mile was disrupted by filming and we sat with the engine idling an audience for nothing half a dozen triplesized trailers filled an entire block a fleet of carelessly parked smaller vehicles choked an eastbound lane a squadron of cameramen sound techs gaffers gofers retired cops and unionized hangerson laughed and loafed and stalked the catered buffet two large men walked past each carrying a lightweight folding directors chair stenciled names on the canvas backs that i didnt recognize public space commandeered with the usual insouciance the motoring public on wilshire wasnt happy and tempers flared in the single open lane i managed to escape onto detroit street hooked a right on sixth street cruised across la brea a few blocks later highland the western border of hancock park the next block was mccadden wide and peaceful and sunny a vintage mercedes rolled out of a driveway a nanny walked a baby in a navy blue chromeplated stroller birds swooped and settled and chirped gratitude cold winds had been whipping the city for a couple of days but the sun had broken through nora dowds address put her half a block south of beverly most of the neighboring residences were beautifully maintained tudors and spanish revivals set behind brilliant emerald lawns dowds was a twostory craftsman cream with dark green trim inverse color scheme of her acting school and like the playhouse girded by a covered porch and shadowed by generous eaves a low rock wall at the curb was centered by an open gate of weathered iron grillwork splitting the lawn was a wide flagstone walkway similar oldschool landscaping birds of paradise camellias azaleas fifteenfoot eugenia hedges on both sides of the property a monumental deodor cedar fringing the double garage barn doors on this garage too nora dowds house was twice the size of her school but anyone scoring above nine on the glasgow coma scale could see the parallels consistent in her taste i said an oasis of stability in this hazy crazy town mr hollywood he said you should write for variety if i wanted to lie for a living id have gone into politics this porch was nicely lacquered decorated with green wicker furniture and potted ferns the pots were handpainted mexican ceramics and looked antique the double doors were quartersawn oak stained dark brown milky white leaded panes comprised the door window milo used his knuckles on the oak the doors were hefty and his hard raps diminished to feeble clicks he tried the bell dead he muttered so what else is new and stuck his business card in the split between the doors as we returned to the seville he yanked his phone from his pocket as if it were a saddle burr nothing to report on michaelas honda or dylan meserves toyota we returned to the car as i opened the drivers door a sound from the house turned our heads female voice low affectionate talking to something white and fluffy cradled to her chest she stepped out to the porch saw us placed the object of her affection on the floor looked at us some more and walked toward the sidewalk the physical dimensions fit nora dowds dmv stats but her hair was a bluegray pageboy the back cut high on the neck she wore an oversized plum sweater over gray leggings and bright white running shoes bouncy step but she faltered a couple of times she gave us a wide berth started to walk south milo said ms dowd she stopped yes one single syllable didnt justify a diagnosis of sultry but her voice was low and throaty milo produced another card nora dowd read it handed it back this is about poor michaela yes maam under the shiny gray cap of hair nora dowds face was round and rosy her eyes were big and slightly unfocused bloodshot not the pink of lou giacomos orbs these were almost scarlet at the rims elfin ears protruded past fine gray strands her nose was a pert button middleaged woman trying to hold on to a bit of little girl she seemed well past thirtysix turning her head she caught some light and a corona of peach fuzz softened her chin lines tugged at her eyes puckers cinched both lips the ring around her neck was conclusive the age on her drivers license was a fantasy standard operating procedure in a company town where the product was false promises the white thing sat still too still for any kind of dog i knew maybe a fur hat then why had she talked to it milo said could we speak to you about michaela maam nora dowd blinked you sound a little like joe friday but he was a sergeant you outrank him she cocked a firm hip i met jack webb once even when he wasnt working he liked those skinny black ties jack was a prince helped finance the police academy about michae lets walk i need my exercise she surged ahead of us swung her arms exuberantly michaela was all right if you gave her enough structure her improv skills left something to be desired frustrated always frustrated about what not being a star she have any talent nora dowds smile was hard to read milo said the one big improv she tried didnt work out so well pardon the hoax she and meserve pulled yes that flat expression whatd you think of that ms dowd dowd walked faster exposure to sunlight had irritated her bloodshot eyes and she blinked several times seemed to lose balance for a second caught herself milo said the hoax what do i think i think it was shoddy shoddy how poorly structured in terms of theater im still not lack of imagination she said the goal of any true performance is openness revealing the self what michaela did insulted all that michaela and dylan nora dowd again surged forward several steps later she nodded i said michaela thought youd appreciate the creativity who told you that a psychologist she talked to michaela was in therapy that surprises you i dont encourage therapy said dowd it closes as many channels as it opens the psychologist evaluated her as part of her court case how silly what about meserve said milo he didnt fail you no one failed me michaela failed herself yes dylan should have known better but he got swept along and he comes from a different place how so the gifted are allowed more leeway was the hoax his idea or michaelas five more steps no sense speaking ill of the dead a beat poor thing dowds mouth turned down if she was trying to project empathy her chops were rusty milo said how long did michaela take classes with you i dont give classes what are they theyre performance experiences how long was michaela involved in the experiences im not sure maybe a year give or take any way to fix that more precisely preeciselee hmmno i dont think so could you check your records i dont do records not at all nothing tall dowd sang she rotated her arms breathed in deeply said ahh i like the air today how do you run a business without records maam nora dowd smiled its not a business i dont take money you teach present experiences for free i avail myself provide a time and place and a selectively judgmental atmosphere for those with courage what kind of courage the kind that enables one to accept selective judgment the balls to dig deep inside here she cupped her left breast with her right hand its all about selfrevelation acting performing acting is an artificial word as if life is here cocking her head to the left and performance is out here on another galaxy everythings part of the same gestalt thats a german word for the whole being bigger than the sum of the parts im blessed milo said with teaching availing talent with an uncluttered consciousness and freedom from worry freedom from recordkeepings pretty good too dowd smiled that as well does not charging mean freedom from financial worry moneys an attitude said nora dowd brightly milo pulled out the photo of tori giacomo and held it in front of her face her pace didnt falter and he had to speed up to keep it in her line of vision not bad looking in a saturday night fever kind of way dowd fended off the photo and milo dropped his arm you dont know her i really cant say why her name is tori giacomo she came to la to be an actress took lessons disappeared nora dowd said disappeared as in poof did she ever avail herself at the playhouse tori giacomothe name doesnt ring a bell but i cant give you a yes or no because we dont take attendance you dont recognize her but you cant say no all sorts of people show up especially on nights when we do group exercises the rooms dark and i certainly cant be expected to remember every face there is a sameness you know young and eager young and ohso hungry could you take another look maam dowd sighed grabbed the photo stared for a second i simply cant say yes or no milo said big crowds show up but you did know michaela michaela was a regular made sure to introduce herself to me ambitious high level of hunger ill give her that without serious want theres no chance of reaching the bottom of the funnel what funnel is that dowd stopped faltered again regained her balance and shaped a cone with her hands at the top are all the strivers most of them give up right away which allows those who remain to sink down a little more her hands dropped but there are still far too many and they bump against each other collide everyone hungry for the spout some tumble out others get crushed milo said more room in the funnel for those with balls dowd looked up at him youve got a charles laughton thing going on ever think of performing he smiled so who gets to the bottom of the funnel those who are karmically destined for celebrity thats not a disease lieutenant or should i call you charles whats not celebrity said dowd anyone who makes it is a gifted winner even if it doesnt last long the funnels always shifting like a star on its axis stars didnt have axes i kept that nugget to myself milo said did michaela have the potential to make it all the way to the spout as i said i dont want to diss the dead did you get along with her ms dowd dowd squinted her eyes looked raw and inflamed thats a strange question maybe im missing something maam but you dont seem too shaken up by her murder dowd exhaled of course im sad i see no reason to reveal myself to you now if youll let me complete my in a sec maam whens the last time you saw dylan meserve saw him at the playhouse said milo or anywhere else hmm said dowd hmm the last timea week or so ten days he helps out from time to time helps how arranging chairs that sort of thing now i need to get some cleansing exercise charles all this talk has polluted the good air she jogged away from us moving fast but with a choppy knockkneed stride the quicker she ran the more pronounced was her clumsiness when she was half a block away she began shadowboxing swung her head from side to side clumsy but loose oblivious to any notion of imperfection chapter milo said dont need you for a diagnosis shes loony even without the dope what dope you didnt smell it on her she stinks of devil weed dude those eyes red rims lack of coordination answers that seemed just a bit offtime i must be slipping you didnt get close enough to smell it when i handed her my business card she reeked mustve just finished toking probably why she didnt answer the door he gazed down the block the speck that was nora dowd had vanished nuts and stoned and doesnt keep records wonder if she married money or inherited it or maybe she had her time at the bottom of the funnel and invested well never heard of her like she said the axis shifts planets have axes stars dont whatever not very sympathetic to michaela was she not even faking it when dylan meserve came up she bolted maybe because he avails himself in all sorts of ways creative consultant he said yeah theyre doing the nasty situation like that i said a gorgeous young woman could be a threat to a woman of her age couple of goodlooking kids up in the hills nakeddowds gotta be what fortyfive fifty that would be my guess rich lady gets her strokes playing guru to the lean and hungry and prettyshe picks dylan out of the fold he goes and fools with michaela yeah its a motive aint it maybe she told dylan to clean things up for all we know hes right there holed up in that big house of hers got his wheels stashed in her garage i glanced back at the big cream house it would also be a nice quiet place to keep michaela while they figured out what to do with her load her in the range rover and dump her near her apartment to distance themselves he crammed his hands in his pockets wouldnt that be uggerly okay lets see what the neighbors have to say about ms stoner three bell rings brought three cleaning ladies to the door each one intoning senora no esta en la casa at the wellkept brick tudor three doors north of nora dowds house an elderly man wearing a bright green cardigan a red wool shirt gray plaid pants and burgundy house slippers studied us over the rim of his oldfashioned the toes of his slippers were embroidered with black wolves heads the dim marble entry behind him gave off a whiff of eau de codger he took a long time to examine milos business card reacted to milos inquiry about nora dowd with that one why a voice like gravel under heavy footsteps routine questions sir dont give me that malarkey tall but bent he had foxedpaper skin coarse white hair and clouded blue eyes stiff fingers bent the card in half and palmed it a fleshy openpored nose dipped toward a lopsided twig of an upper lip albert beamish formerly of martin crutch and melvyn and ninetythree other partners until the mandatory outtopasture clause kicked in and they sentenced me to emeritus that was eighteen years ago so do the arithmetic and choose your words efficiently i could drop dead right in front of you and youd have to lie to someone else till a hundred and twenty sir albert beamish said get on with it kiddo whatd that one do one of her students was murdered and were getting background information from people who knew the victim and you spoke to her and you saw what a lunatic she is milo chuckled albert beamish said students they let her teach when did that start she runs her own acting school beamishs laughter was jagged it took a while for his cocktail to reach his lips acting thats just more of the same the same what being the indolent spoiled brat shes always been milo said youve known her for a while she grew up in that overgrown log cabin her grandfather built it back in the twenties a blight on the neighborhood then just as it is now doesnt fit should be in pasadena or some place where they like that kind of thing beamishs filmy irises aimed across the street you see any others like it around here no sir theres a reason for that kiddo doesnt fit try telling that to bill dowd senior the grandfather no sophistication came from oklahoma made money in groceries dry goods something of that sort his wife was lowclass uneducated thought she could buy her way in spending money same with the daughterinlaw that ones mother blond tramp always throwing ostentatious parties beamish drank some more damned elephant milo said sir one time they brought in a damned elephant for one of their birthdays dont remember which one filthied up the street the stench lasted for days his nostrils quivered bill junior never worked a day in his life fooled around on his daddys money married late woman just like his mother no class now youre telling me that one teaches acting where does this travesty take place west la said milo the playhouse i never venture that far from civilization said beamish a play house sounds damned frivolous its a craftsman building same as the house i said does it fit in over there the neighorhoods pretty hetero piles of logs all that gloomy wood and stained glass belongs in a church where the intent is to simultaneously impress and depress bill dowd senior made his fortune with canned peas whatever nailed up that heap of timber probably got the idea when he was buying up properties in pasadena south pasadena altadena lord knows what other denas thats what theyve all been living off she and her brothers none of them worked a day in their lives how many brothers i said two bill the third and bradley ones a fool and the others shifty the shifty one sneaked into my yard and stole my persimmons pinpoints of anger livened the milky blue eyes stripped the damn tree bare he denied it but everyone knew milo said how long ago was this sir thanksgiving of delinquent never owned up to it but my wife and i knew it was him whys that said milo because hed done it before stole from you from others dont ask me the who and what never heard the details just general womans talk they must have believed it too they boarded him out some sort of military academy because of the persimmons no said beamish exasperated we never told them about the persimmons no sense being obtrusive what about nora dowd said milo any problems with her shes the youngest and the most spoiled always had those ideas what ideas sir being an actress beamishs lips curled running around trying to get parts in movies i always thought her mother was the one behind all that she ever get any parts not that i heard do fools actually pay to hear what she has to say at her play house seems to be that way said milo did she ever marry negative does she live with anyone shes got that heap of sticks all to herself milo showed him the snap of dylan meserve beamish said whos that one of her students looks like a delinquent himself are they fornicating milo said what about visitors beamish snatched the picture from between milo s fingers numbers around his neck hes a damned felon misdemeanor arrest beamish said nowadays that could include homicide you dont like ms dowd dont have use for any of them said beamish those persimmons im talking the japanese variety tart firm nothing like those gelatinous abominations you get in the market when my wife was alive she loved making compote for thanksgiving she was looking forward to thanksgiving that wastrel filched every one stripped the tree naked he returned the photo never seen him but ill keep an eye out thanks sir whatd you think of that pet of hers what pet sir albert beamish laughed so hard he began coughing milo said you okay sir beamish slammed the door chapter the white fluffy thing nora dowd had left on her porch was a stuffed toy some sort of bichon or maltese flat brown eyes milo picked it up had a close look said oh man and handed it over not a toy a real dog stuffed and preserved the pink ribbon around its neck supported a heartshaped silver pendant stan birth and death dates stan had lived thirteen years blank look on the white fluffy face maybe it was the glass eyes or the limits of taxidermy i said could be stan as in stanislavsky she probably talks to it and takes it with her on walks saw us and thought better of it what does that mean eccentric rather than psychotic im so impressed he took the dog and put it back on the floor stanislavsky eh lets method act the hell out of here as we drove past albert beamishs tudor the drapes across the living room window fluttered milo said neighborhood crank love it too bad he didnt recognize meserve but with his vision that means nothing he sure hates the dowds i said nora has two brothers who own a lot of property ertha stadlbraun said peatys landlords are a pair of brothers so she did by the time we reached sixth street and la cienega hed confirmed it william dowd iii nora dowd and bradley dowd doing business as bnb properties owned the apartment building on guthrie it took several other calls to get an idea of their holdings at least fortythree properties registered in la county multiple residences and office buildings and the converted house on the westside where nora availed herself to wouldbe stars the schools probably a concession to crazy sister he said keeps her out of their hair and far from their other properties i said something else all those buildings mean lots of janitorial work reynold peaty looking in all kinds of windowsif hes moved from peeping to violence lots of potential victims yeah lets check it out corporate headquarters for bnb properties was on ocean park boulevard near the santa monica airport not one of the dowd sibs properties this one was owned by a national real estate syndicate that owned half of downtown wonder why said milo maybe some sort of tax dodge i said or they held on to what their father left them didnt add more lazy rich kids yeah makes sense it was four fortyfive and the drive at this hour would be brutal milo called the listed number hung up quickly youve reached the office blah blah blah if its a plumbing emergency press electrical press lazy rich kids are probably drinking at the country club you up for a try anyway sure i said olympic boulevard seemed the optimal route the lights are timed and parking restrictions keep all six lanes open during la s everexpanding rush hour the boulevard was designed back in the forties as a quick way to get from downtown to the beach people old enough to remember when that promise was kept get tearyeyed this afternoon traffic was moving at twenty miles per when i stopped at doheny milo said the lovetriangle angle fits given noras narcissism and nuttiness this woman thinks her dogs precious enough to be turned into a damned mummy michaela insisted she and dylan werent lovers shed want to keep that from nora maybe from you too if so the hoax was really stupid two naked kids he said the publicity wouldnt have thrilled dowd especially i said if she really doesnt feel that blessed never made it to the bottom of the funnel never made it lives alone in a big house no stable relationships needs to smoke up before greeting the world maybe clinging to a stuffed dog is just massive insecurity playing a role he said availing herself okay lets see if we can têteàtête with the rest of this glorious family the site was a twostory strip mall on the northeast corner of ocean park and twentyeighth directly opposite the lush industrial park that fronted santa monica s private airport bnb properties was a door and window on the second floor cheaply built mall lemonyellow sprayedstucco walls stained by rust around the gutters brown iron railings rimming an open balcony plastic tile roof pretending to evoke colonial spain the ground floor was a takeout pizza joint a thai café and its mexican counterpart and a coinop laundry bnbs upstairs neighbors were a chiropractor touting treatment for workplace injuries zip technical assistance and sunny sky travel windows festooned by posters in bright comeon colors as we climbed pebblegrained steps a sleek white corporate jet shot into the sky aspen or vail or telluride said milo someones having fun maybe its a business trip and theyre going to podunk that tax bracket everythings fun wonder if the dowd brothers are in that league if they are theyre skimping on ambience he pointed at bnbs plain brown door chipped and gouged and cracking toward the bottom the corporate signage consisted of six ustick silver foil parallelograms aligned carelessly bnb inc a single aluminumframed window was blocked by cheap white miniblinds the slats tilted to the left left a triangle of peepspace milo took advantage shading his eyes with his hands and peering in looks like one roomand a bathroom with the light on he straightened some guys in there peeing lets give him time to zip up another plane took off that ones aspen for sure he said how can you tell happy sound from the engines he knocked and opened the door a man stood by a cheap wooden desk staring at us hed forgotten to zip the fly of his khaki dockers and a corner of blue shirt peeked out the shirt was silk oversized and baggy a stonewashed texture that had been fashionable a decade ago the khakis sagged on his skinny frame no belt scuffed brown penny loafers white socks he was short five five or six looked to be around fifty with downslanted medium brown eyes and curly gray hair cut in a tight caesar cap white fuzz on the back of his neck said it was time for a trim same for a twoday growth of saltandpepper beard hollow cheeks angular features except for his nose shiny little button that gave his face an elfin cast either hed used the same surgeon as his sister or stingy nasal endowment was a dominant dowd trait milo said mr dowd shy smile im billy the badge made him blink his hand brushed the corner of shirttail and he stiffened zipped his fly oops billy dowd breathed into his hand need my altoidswhere did i put them turning four pockets inside out he produced nothing but lint that landed on thin gray carpet a check of his shirt pocket finally located the mints popping one in his mouth and chewing he held out the tin want some no thanks sir billy dowd perched on the edge of his desk across the room was a larger more substantial work station carved oak replica of a rolltop flatscreen computer monitor the rest of the components tucked out of view brown walls the only thing hanging a humane society calendar trio of tabby kittens staking a claim on ultimate cute billy dowd chewed another mint sowhats happening you dont seem surprised were here mr dowd billy blinked some more its not the only time that youve spoken to police yup when were the others billys brow creased the second id have to say was last year one of the tenants weve got a lot of tenants my brother and sister and me and last year one of them was stealing computer stuff a policeman from pasadena came over and talked to us we said okay arrest him he pays late anyway did they uhuh he ran away and escaped took the lightbulbs messed the place up brad was not happy but then we got another tenant pretty soon and he got happy real nice people insurance agents mr and mrs rose they pay on time what was the name of the dishonest tenant id have to say slowly spreading smile id have to say i dont know you can ask my brother hell be here soon what was the other time the police visited said milo pardon me you said the second was last year when was the first oh right the first was long ago id have to say five years could be even six he waited for confirmation i said what happened a long time ago that was different he said someone hit someone else in the hallway so they called the police not tenants two visitors they got into a fight or something so what happened this time a student of your sisters was murdered and were looking into people who knew her the word murdered drew billy dowds hand to his mouth he held it there and his fingers muffled his voice thats awful the hand dropped to his chin clawed the stubbly surface nails gnawed short my sister shes okay shes fine said milo youre sure absolutely sir the murder didnt take place at the playhouse phew billy drew a hand across his brow you scared me i nearly pissed my pants he laughed nervously looked down at his crotch verifying continence a voice from the doorway said whats going on billy dowd said hey brad its the police again the man who walked in was half a foot taller than billy and solidly built he wore a wellcut navy suit and a yellow shirt with a stiff spread collar soft brown calfskin loafers mid forties but his hair was snowwhite dense and straight and clipped short crinkly dark eyes full lips square chin beak nose nora and billy dowd had been modeled from soft clay their brother was hewn from stone bradley dowd stood next to his brother and buttoned his jacket again you remember said billy that guy the one who stole computers and took all the lights what was his name brad was he italian polish said brad dowd he looked at us edgar grabowskis back in town its not about him brad said billy i was just explaining why i was surprised but not totally surprised when they came in here because it wasnt the first got it said brad patting his brothers shoulder whats up gentlemen milo said theres been a murderone of your sisters students my god thats horrible noras okay same protective reflex as billy i already asked him that brad noras good brad mustve put some weight on billys shoulder because the smaller man sagged where did this happen and who exactly did it happen to west la the victims a young woman named michaela brand the one who faked being kidnapped said brad his brother stared up at him you never told me about that bra it was in the news bill to us did her murder have something to do with that any reason it would said milo im not saying it did said brad dowd im just asking its a natural question dont you think someone garners publicity it has the potential to bring out the weirdos did nora talk about the hoax brad shook his head murderedterrible he frowned it mustve hit nora hard id better call her shes okay said milo we just talked to her youre sure your sisters fine were here sir because we need to talk to anyone who mightve had contact with ms brand of course said brad dowd he smiled at his brother billy would you do me a favor and go down and get a sandwich from digiorgios you know how i like it billy dowd got off the desk and looked up at his brother peppers egg eggplant and tomato a lot of pesto or just a medium amount a lot bro you got it bro nice to meet you guys billy hurried off when the door closed brad dowd said he doesnt need to hear about this kind of thing what else can i help you with your janitor reynold peaty anything to say about him youre asking because of his arrests milo nodded well said brad he was upfront about them when he applied for a job i gave him points for honesty and hes been a good worker why just routine sir howd you find him agency they werent upfront about his past so we dropped them how longs he been working for you five years not that long after his last arrest in nevada he said hed had a drinking problem and had gotten clean and sober he doesnt drive so any dui problems arent going to happen milo said are you aware of his arrest for peeping through a window he told me about everything said brad claimed that was also the drinking and the only time hed done something like that he flexed his shoulders many of our tenants are women and families with children im not naive keep my eyes out on all the employees now that the megans law database is up and operating i check it regularly i assume you do too so you know reynold isnt on there is there some reason youre asking about him other than routine no sir brad dowd inspected his fingertips unlike his brothers beautifully manicured please be upfront detective do you have the slightest bit of evidence implicating reynold because he circulates among lots of our buildings and as much as id like to trust him id hate to incur any liability not to mention the human cost no evidence said milo youre sure thats the way it looks so far so far said brad dowd not exactly encouraging theres no reason to suspect him sir if i hear otherwise ill let you know dowd fiddled with a handstitched lapel theres no subtext here is there detective youre not suggesting i fire him id prefer that you dont whys that no sense stirring things up mr dowd if peatys turned his life around more power to him thats how i feelthat poor girl how was she killed strangled and stabbed dowd winced any idea by who no sir heres another routine question do you know dylan meserve im aware of who he is is there any sense asking why hes part of your routine he hasnt been seen for a while and when we tried to talk to your sister about him she ended the conversation nora said brad wearily his eyes shot to the doorway hey bro smells good thanks billy dowd toted an open cardboard carton using both hands as if his cargo was precious inside was a herosized sandwich wrapped in orange paper aromas of tomato paste oregano and basil filled the office brad turned so his brother couldnt see and slipped milo a yellow business card perfect match to his shirt anything i can do to help detective feel free to call me if you have any further questions that smells fantastic billy youre the man youre the man said billy gravely you too bill billy dowds mouth screwed up brad said hey we can both be the man he took the sandwich and cuffed his brothers shoulder lightly right billy considered that okay chapter by the time we made it to the door brad dowd had his dinner unwrapped and was saying this hits the spot bill as we climbed down to the strip malls first level milo said that sandwich smelled good we parked near the far west end of the airport the coffee from café digiorgio was dark and strong milo pushed the seat back as far as it would go and got to work on his meatball and pepper sandwich after four ferocious bites he stopped to breathe looks like ol bradley watches out for his sibs looks like they both bear watching whats your diagnosis on billy the best words probably simple and noras a spacey doper youre ready to take the state boards i said he scanned blue sky no sleek white jets to feed his fantasies he fished out brad dowds yellow business card and handed it over crisp substantial paper bradley dowds name embossed in chocolate italics above a phone number with an prefix gentlemans calling card i said you dont see that too often once a rich kid always a rich kid ill call him tonight find out what he didnt want to talk about in front of his brother i got home at six cleared a tapeful of junk messages listened to one from robin that had come in ten minutes ago i could tell you this is about shared grief for our late pooch but its reallya booty call i guess hopefully youre the only one listening to this please erase it bye i called her back i erased it im lonely she said me too should we do something about it i think so thats not exactly rabid desire but ill take what i can get i was at her house in venice by seven we spent the next hour in bed the rest of the evening reading the paper and watching the last third of humoresque on the movie channel when the film was over she got up without a word and left for her studio i tried to sleep didnt have much success until she returned to bed i was up just after seven when western light streaming through her curtains couldnt be denied she stood naked by the window holding a cup of tea shed always been a coffee drinker i croaked something that approximated morning you dreamed a lot i was noisy active ill get you some coffee come back to bed ill get it no relax she padded out and returned with a mug stood by the bed i drank and cleared my throat thanks youre into tea now sometimes how long have you been awake couple of hours my activity no ive turned into an early riser cows to milk eggs to collect she smiled put on a robe sat on the bed i said come back in no once im up im up she forced a smile i could smell the effort want me to leave of course not she said too quickly stay as long as you like i dont have much for breakfast not hungry i said youve got work to do eventually she kissed my forehead got up and moved to her closet and began getting dressed i went to shower by the time i was out and dried and dressed her band saw was humming i had breakfast at john ogroats on pico going out of my way because i was in the mood for irish oatmeal and the company of strangers seemed like a good idea i sat at the counter and read the paper nothing on michaela no reason for there to be back home i did some paperwork and thought about nora dowds flat responses to milos questions not bothering to fake sympathy or interest in michaelas murder the same for tori giacomos disappearance but dylan meserves name had pulled out some emotion and brother brad didnt want to talk about dylan in front of the most vulnerable dowd sib i got on the computer noras name pulled up a single citation inclusion in a list of acting workshops listed by city that appeared on a site called starhopefulscom i printed the list called all the west coast programs fabricated a castingdirector cover story and asked if tori giacomo had ever been a student mostly i got confusion a few times i got hangups meaning i could use some acting lessons myself by noon i had nothing better to stick with what i was getting paid to do i finished the report on dr patrick hauser and took a run down to the nearest mailbox i was back at my desk clearing paper when milo rang the doorbell i called first he said out jogging i envy your knees believe me dont whats up michaelas landlord promises to be there tomorrow morning i got subpoenas for her phone records but my contact at the phone company says im wasting my time account was shut off for nonpayment weeks before she died if she had a cell account i cant find it on the positive side god bless the angels at the coroners he stomped in your knees really hurt sometimes if you werent my buddy id gloat i followed him into the kitchen instead of raiding the fridge he sat down and loosened his tie michaelas autopsy was prioritized i said nope more interesting my buddies at the crypt looked through the doe files found some possibles and traced one of em to a bone analyst doing research on identification forensic anthropologist on a grant what she does is collect samples from various cases and try to classify them ethnically in her trove was an intact skull with most of the teeth still embedded young caucasian female homicide victim found nineteen months ago the rest of the body was incinerated six months after discovery their forensic odontologist said the dentition was distinctive lots of cosmetic bridgework unusual for someone that young someone trying to look their best like an aspiring actress i got the name of tori giacomos dentist in bayside and thanks to the magic of digital photography and email we had a positive id within the hour hows her dad taking it dont know he said i had no way to reach him here in la so i called his wife contrary to what giacomo told us she comes across like a sensible stable lady has been expecting the worst for a while he slumped prince that i am i didnt disappoint her he got up filled a glass with water from the tap got any lemon i sliced one dropped a wedge into his glass rick says i should keep my kidneys hydrated but plain water tastes like plain wateranyway tori is no longer jane doe wish i had the rest of the body but she was listed as an unsolved hollywood homicide and the ds report spelled things out pretty clearly he drank some more put the glass in the sink she was found four months after she disappeared dumped in some brush on the la side of griffith park all that was left were scattered bones coroner thought he spotted damage to some of the cervical vertebrae and there are definitely some relatively superficial knife cuts in her sternum and a couple in the thoracic ribs tentative cause of death is strangulationstabbing i said two young female acting students similar wounds and nora dowd didnt rule out tori attending her classes no answer at noras home or the school ill be at the playhouse tonight mingling with the beautiful people after i meet with brad dowd he called apologized for cutting off the conversation invited me to his house eager to talk about dylan i said where does he live santa monica canyon care to join me ill drive bradley dowd lived on gumtree lane a mile north of channel road just east of where channel descends steeply to pacific coast highway a darkening sky and a tree canopy brought early night the air was still and unseasonably warm and no ocean aroma brined the canyon usually its ten degrees cooler near the coast maybe its me but patterns seem to be shaking up more often the house was a onestory redwood and glass box set in a low spot along the leafy road well back from the street the wealth of vegetation made it hard to make out where the property began and ended highend box with polishedcopper trim and a porch supported by carved beams carefully placed spots illuminated flower beds and luxuriant ferns the wooden address plate imbedded in the fieldstone gatepost was handpainted a gray or beige porsche sat in the front of the gravel driveway hanging succulents graced the porch which was set up with adirondack chairs brad dowd stood near one of the chairs one leg bent so that his shoulders sloped to the right he wore a tshirt and cutoffs held a longnecked bottle in one hand park right behind me detective when we got to the porch he hoisted the bottle corona the tshirt said hobiecat his feet were bare muscular legs knobby misshapen knees join me no thanks dowd sat gave another wave we repositioned two chairs and faced him any problem finding me none said milo thanks for calling dowd nodded and drank crickets chirped a hint of gardenia blew by and dissipated pretty out here sir love it said brad nothing like peace and quiet after a day dealing with leaks short circuits and various other minor disasters trials and tribulations of being a landlord are you one too detective god forbid brad laughed it beats honest labor the key is to keep things organized hed left the front door cracked six inches serape throws on chairs a kilim ottoman lots of leather propped in a corner was a white surfboard longboard the type you dont see much anymore the knobs on dowds knees made sense surfers knots milo said there was something about dylan meserve you wanted to tell us thanks for waiting i didnt want billy to hear protecting billy i said dowd turned to me billy needs protection sometimes its hard for him to put things in perspective something about meserve bother him said milo brad dowds brow creased no i just like to keep him away from what he doesnt need to knowsure i cant get you guys one of these were fine said milo you take care of billy he doesnt need special care hes not retarded or anything like that when he was born there was an oxygen problem we used to live together then a couple of years ago i realized he needed his independence so i got him his own place a nice lady lives upstairs billy thinks theyre just neighbors but she gets paid to be there for him anyway about meserve its no big deal my sister had a thing for him and i consider him a firstclass sleazeball a mutual thing dowd stretched his legs pointed his toes massaged a knot maybe calcium explained the wince in some ways nora can be a bit of an adolescent all the time she spends with young people doesnt help i said dylan wasnt her first thing i didnt say that i smiled brad dowd drank beer no sense bullshitting you know how it is a woman gets to a certain age the whole youth culture thing noras entitled to her fun but with meserve it was getting a little out of hand so i talked to her and she realized i was right you didnt want billy to hear this because brad dowds mouth got tight it was a bit of a hassle convincing nora shed have been a lot more upset if billy got involved if he tried to comfort her or something like that whys that said milo nora and billy arent closethe truth is when we were kids billy was a source of embarrassment to nora but billy thinks theyre close he stopped this is family stuff you dont need to know milo said so nora broke up with meserve it didnt require a formal declaration because the two of them were never officially he smiled i almost said going steady howd nora end it with meserve by keeping her distance ignoring him eventually he got the point how was their relationship getting out of hand i said brad frowned is this really relevant to that poor girls murder probably not sir we ask all sorts of questions and hope for the best is meserve a suspect no but close friends of the victim are considered individuals of interest and we havent been able to locate meserve to talk to him i understand detective but i still dont see why my sisters private life needs to be aired i said was there something about meserve that bothered you more than her other things dowd sighed in the past noras relationships were shortlived mostly because the men who interest nora arent the type with longterm plans meserve seemed different to me manipulative as if he was planning something that hoax he pulled proves it right milo said planning what isnt it obvious you suspected he was out for noras money i started to get concerned when nora gave him a paid job at the playhouse creative consultant dowd snorted you need to understand nora doesnt charge a penny for her classes thats a crucial point taxwise because the playhouse the building the upkeep any supplies is funded by a foundation we set up you and your sibs basically i did it for nora because actings her passion were not talking some huge financial undertaking theres just enough endowment to keep the classes going the buildings one of many we inherited from our parents and the rent we forego is a nice deduction against the profit from some other rentals in our portfolio im the nominal head of the foundation so i approve expenditures which is why when nora came to me wanting salary for meserve i knew it was time to talk there was simply nothing in the budget to accommodate that and it confirmed my suspicions that meserve was out for something how much did she want to pay him eight hundred a week very creative consultant said milo no kidding said dowd thats my point nora has no concept of finances like a lot of artistic folk how long ago did she ask for the money after she offered him the job a week or so before meserve and the girl pulled that stunt maybe thats why he did it what do you mean trying to win noras affections with a creative performance if that was the idea it backfired nora wasnt pleased id say not was she upset at the hoax or something else such as meserve being with another woman jealous i seriously doubt it by that time nora was finished with him she gets over things quickly nothing to get over said brad dowd she saw my point stopped paying attention to him and he stopped hanging around what bothered nora about the hoax the exposure most actresses like publicity brad placed his beer on the porch deck detective the extent of noras acting career was a single walkon part on a sitcom thirtyfive years ago when she was ten she got the part because a friend of our mothers was connected after that nora went on audition after audition when she decided to channel her efforts into teaching it was a healthy move adapting said milo thats what its all about detective my sister has talent but so do a hundred thousand other people i said so she prefers to stay out of the public eye were a private bunch dowd took a long swallow and finished his beer is there anything else guys did nora ever talk about michaela brand not to me no way she was jealous gorgeous young people stream in and out of noras world now i really think i should stop talking about her personal life fair enough said milo lets concentrate on meserve like i said a gold digger said dowd i meddled but sometimes meddling is called for in the end my sister was grateful not to get involved with someone like that maybe you should be looking at him for the girls murder whys that sir his view of women he had a relationship with the victim and you just said hes missing doesnt running away imply guilt what view of women are we talking about said milo you know the type easy smile cruising on looks he flirted with my sister shamelessly ill be blunt he kissed up and nora bought it because noras impressionable unfortunately any time id drop by the playhouse hed be there alone with nora following her around flattering her sitting at her feet shooting her adoring glances then he began giving her cheap little gifts doodads tacky tourist junk a snow globe do you believe that hollywood and vine for gods sake whens the last time there was snow in hollywood dowd laughed id love to think it was noras soul and inner beauty that attracted him but lets get real shes naive menopausal and financially independent i said howd you convince her meserves intentions werent pure i was calm and persistent he stood i hope you catch whoever killed that girl but please dont involve my brother and sister in it you couldnt find two more harmless people on the face of the earth in terms of reynold peaty ive been asking tenants and the only complaints ive received are along the lines of not emptying garbage in a timely manner he shows up diligently minds his own business has been a firstclass worker ill keep my eyes open though he cocked his head toward the open door coffee or a soft drink for the road were good said milo getting up then im hitting the sack buenas noches early to bed busy day ahead beats honest labor milo said brad dowd laughed chapter milo took channel road down toward the coastline theres time till the class at the playhouse how about we grab a couple of beers at a place i know coronas good brand as long as brad dowds not offering never fraternize with the citizenry whatd you think of our grownup surfer dude you saw the knots too and the board hes the family guardian takes well to the job he reached pch stopped at the long red light that can keep you there for what seems to be hours the oceans always changing tonight the water was flat and gray and infinite slow easy tide steady and metallic as a drum machine maybe im making too big a deal out of this alex but brads parting words seemed off asking me to keep both nora and billy out of the investigation wed been focused on nora why bring in billy could be force of habit i said he lumps the two of them together because they both need protection maybe thats it billy interests you adult male with immature social skills who needs to be supervised covertly as we waited he ran a dmv check on william dowd iii hung up before the light changed wanna guess how many vehicles are registered to billy none and just like peaty never had a license tagging along with brother brad i said when brad drops in at the playhouse billys right there with him all those goodlooking starletsintraining getting an eyeful of girls like michaela and tori giacomo could be overstimulating billy seemed gentle i said but crank up the id and who knows what if the real reason brad didnt want to talk to us in front of billy was because he was afraid billy would give something away and heres something else billy lives in an apartment in beverly hills reeves drive just off olympic couple of miles from michaelas place a guy with no wheels could walk it same problem as peaty i said how to transport a body and i dont see billy getting away with an unregistered ride not with brad that protective that turned him silent until we reached santa monicas gold coast beachside mansions once private enclaves were now exposed to the clamor and the reality of the public sand that fronted them the clapboard monster william hearst had built for marion davies was ready to crumble after years of santa monica city council dithering a moment later the exoskeleton of the pier came into view lit up like christmas the ferris wheel rotated slow as bureaucracy milo drove the ramp up to ocean front continued onto pacific avenue crossed into venice so now ive got two strange guys with access to the playhouse i thought about that billy stopped living with brad two years ago right before toris disappearance why would brad get billy out of his house at this point in their lives these guys are middleaged all of a sudden its time for a change brad wanted to keep his distance from billy but if he suspected something hed tighten the leash so whats the answer dont know for all we know he said brad did try to clamp down and billys a lot more difficult than he seems hell maybe billy insisted on breaking away brad pays some nice lady to look after him because he knows billy bears watching meanwhile if something does happen hes across town in santa monica canyon less liability i said he thinks in those terms foundations tax breaks keeping things organized that rung of the social ladder its a whole different world he looked at his watch lets see how nora reacts when i push her a bit how long it takes for her to cry to brother brad over the years ive accompanied milo to lots of taverns and beer joints and cocktail lounges a couple of gay bars as well its an illuminating experience watching him function in that sphere this was a new dive a narrow dark tunnel of a place called jody zs at the southern edge of pacific just above the marina arena rock on the jukebox silent football rerun on tv tired men at the urethane bar rough paneling and fishnets and glass globes plastic sawdust on the floor what was the point of that a short drive to robins house on rennie in another time and place milo might have mentioned that the set of his jaw said the only things on his mind were the murders of two young women once wed finished a couple of beers and rehashed what we knew there was little to talk about and he started to blend in with the dispirited clientele phoning michaelas landlord in la jolla he confirmed the appointment tomorrow morning ground his teeth bastards doing me a big freaking favor he looked over at the blackboard three specials including the promise of fresh clam chowder he chanced it not too bad he said spooning not too bad and seafood shouldnt be uttered in the same sentence i said if i die you get the first eulogy i wonder if nora really gave in when brad asked her to cool it with meserve brad did raise one good point meserves nowhere to be found he seemed eager to steer you to meserve as a suspect i said thats in his best interest if hes covering for billy but it doesnt mean hes wrong michaela told me she hated meserve and mrs winograd heard them fighting more than once any theory about dylans motive for michaela and tori maybe hes just a bad guy who picks off girls at acting class he played death games with michaela up in latigo and if michaela was being at all truthful he planned a calculated hoax toss in brads suspicions about gold digging and it doesnt add up to a character reference michaela tell you why she went from being naked in the hills with him to seeing him as the enemy at the time i assumed she was dumping the blame on him as trial strategy lawyer games guess who her lawyer was lauritz montez that guy from the malley case thought you two had friction we did but im the biggest baddest smartest shrink in the whole wild world gee willikers he schmeared you and you bought it the case interested me thats a good reason as good as any mind talking to montez again see if michaela had more to say about her partner in crime dont mind at all i said id been thinking of doing it anyway he pushed aside a half bowl of chowder waved for another beer then altered it to a coke the sixtyfiveyearold barmaid laughed when did you ever have selfcontrol milo said dont be cruel and she laughed some more and left i realized all the patrons were men wondered about that as milo ticked an index finger meserve peaty brother billy investigation teaches you to narrow the suspect pool i seem to be doing just the opposite the search for truth i said ah the agony chapter by eight fiftythree pm we were parked four blocks west of the playhouse as we headed to the school on foot milos bulk slanted forward as if marching into a blizzard scoping out streets and driveways and alleys for michaela brands little black honda the alert for the car had been expanded statewide milo and i had cruised these same streets just a few days ago no reason to look now the ability to put logic aside sometimes makes for a great detective we got to the building at five after nine found people milling dim porch light allowed me to count as we neared the front steps eight females five males each one slim young gorgeous milo muttered mutants as he bounded up the stairs thirteen pairs of eyes turned to watch a few of the women shrank back the men occupied a narrow height range six to six two broad square shoulders narrow hips angular faces that seemed curiously static the women varied more in stature but their body shape was uniform long legs flat bellies wasp waists hightucked butts high puffy bosoms manicured hands gripped plastic bottles of water and cell phones wide hungry eyes questioned our presence milo stepped into the middle of the porch and the acting students cleared space the light played up every crease pit and pucker and pore he looked heavier and older than ever evening folks dubious stares general confusion smirks and side glances of the kind you see in middleschool cafeterias one of the young men said whats up with practiced slur brando in on the waterfront or was that ancient history crimes up friend milo moved the badge so that it caught light someone said whoa snickers petered to silence milo checked his timex wasnt class supposed to start ten minutes ago coach not here said another adonis he jiggled the front door handle waiting for nora said milo better than godot hopefully unlike him shell show up milos wolfgrin caused a reflexive toothbare from the young man the guy threw back his head and a sheet of dark hair billowed then flapped back in place nora late a lot shrug sometimes said a young woman with curly yellow hair and lips so bulbous they resembled tiny buttocks that and blue saucer eyes gave her a stunned mien inflatable doll barely come to life well said milo this gives us time to chat swigs from water bottles flips of cell phone covers nursed forth a series of electronic mousesqueaks milo said i assume you guys heard about michaela brand silence a nod then two then ten anybody has something to say it would be much appreciated a car drove west several of the acting students followed its diminishing taillights grateful for distraction anything people slow head shakes nothing at all everyones freaked out said a dark pointychinned girl with coyote eyes deep sigh her breasts rose and fell as a unit i saw her a couple of times but didnt know her said a man with a shaved head and bone structure so pronounced he seemed carved out of ivory thats cause you just started juaquin said the pillowlylipped curlyhaired girl thats what im saying brandy briana whatever you knew her briana said milo just from here we didnt hang out any of you know michaela outside of here said milo head shakes she was like quiet said a redheaded woman what about dylan meserve silence notable edginess none of you knew dylan they were friends said the redhead her and him any of you see dylan recently the redhaired girl pulled a watch out of her purse and squinted at it nine sixteen said milo nora generally this late sometimes said curly blonde someone else said noras nora silence milo said whats on the agenda tonight there is no agenda said the hairflipper he wore a plaid flannel shirt tailored tight to his vframe faded jeans clean crisp hiking boots that had never encountered mud nothings planned said milo its freeform improv impish smile from plaid something like that officer how often you guys come here no answer once a week for me said briana pillowlips for other people its more same here said plaid once a week more when i have time like i said its free form and free i said no rules no constrictions milo said there are no constrictions helping the police either an oliveskinned guy with a face that managed to be reptilian and handsome said no one knows anything milo handed out business cards a few of the beautiful people bothered to read them we left them waiting on the porch walked halfway down the block until darkness concealed us and watched the building milo said its like theyre extruded from machines we waited in silence by nine twentythree nora dowd still hadnt showed and her students began to drift away when the young woman named briana headed toward us milo said karma we stepped out of the shadows well in time for her to see us despite that she jumped gripped her purse held on to her balance you scared me sorry have a minute inflated lips parted how much collagen had it taken for them to get that way she hadnt reached thirty but tuck lines around her ears said she wasnt relying on youth i have nothing to say and you really scared me she walked past us to a battered white nissan headed for the drivers door groped for her keys milo followed her we really are sorry its just that we havent learned much about michaelas murder and you seemed to know her best all i said was i knew who she was your fellow students didnt know her at all thats because theyre new freshmen curls shook its not like college i know freeform said milo whats the problem helping us briana theres no problem i just dont know anything she unlocked the drivers door is there some reason you dont want to help she looked at him like what someone told you not to help of course not who would do that milo shrugged no way she said i just dont know anything and i dont want any hassle no hassle involved im just trying to solve a murder pretty nasty one at that big lips trembled im really sorry but we werent tight like i said before she kept to herself she and dylan right and now shes dead and hes gone any idea where he might be definitely not definitely not i definitely dont know he could be anywhere milo edged closer pressed his hip against the hinges of the drivers door what surprises me is the lack of curiosity all you guys someone you know gets killed youd think thered be some interest he sliced air horizontally zippo no one cares is it something about actors she frowned just the opposite you need to be curious to act to learn about our feelings nora tells you that anyone who knows anything tells you that let me get this said milo youre curious about playing parts but not about real life look said the girl sure id like to know it scares me the whole murder thing just talking about it i mean come on come on if it happened to michaela it could happen to anyone i said you see it as a random crime she turned to me what do you mean as opposed to something that had to do with michaela i she was i dont know maybe milo said was there something about michaela that made her a likely victim that thing she they did her and dylan lying why would that put her in danger maybe they ticked someone off are you aware of someone that angry nope too quickly no one briana no one i got to go in a sec said milo whats your last name she looked ready to cry do i have to say milo tried for a soft smile its routine briana address and phone number too briana szemencic she spelled it can this be off the record dont worry about that live around here briana reseda bit of a drive i work in santa monica with the traffic its easier to stay in the city and go back later what kind of work do you do briana shitty work rueful smile im an assistant at an insurance agency i file i get coffee i gofer beaucoup excitement hey said milo pays the bills barely she touched her lips so who was pissed off about the hoax briana long pause no one that much but nora was a little frosted how could you tell when someone asked her about it she got this real tight look and changed the subject can you blame her it sucked using the playhouse like that noras a private person when michaela never came back i figured nora gave her the boot dylan came back yeah she said that was the funny thing she wasnt mad at dylan kept treating him nice milo said even though the hoax was mostly his idea thats not what he said dylan blamed it on michaela totally he said she really worked on him nora mustve believed him because shelike you said he came back does nora like dylan more than the other guys fragile shoulders rose and fell briana szemencic gazed up the block i dont think i should go there touchy business not my business said briana anyway nora would never hurt anyone if youre thinking that youre totally wrong why would we be thinking that youre asking was she mad she was but not that type of mad not the jealous type of mad briana didnt answer milo said nora and dylan dylan and michaela but no jealousy nora had the hots for dylan okay its no crime shes a woman had or has i dont know same question briana has okay howd nora feel about dylan and michaela hanging out briana shook her head she never said anything its not like we were tight can i go now please nora didnt like dylan and michaela hanging but she wasnt really pissed off about it shed never hurt michaela never ever you need to understand nora shesshes kind of really like shes not you knowshes here tapping her pretty forehead intellectual tush lips struggled to form words finally she said thats not what i mean im talking more like you know shes intensely right brain intuitionalistic thats the point of the workshops she shows us how to tap into ourselves free the inner pillow lips wriggled as she struggled for vocabulary noras all about scenes shes always telling us to break everything into scenes that way its not so huge you can deal with it until you get the whole gestalt that means the big picture i think she kind of lives that way herself scene by scene said milo shes not paying attention to down here pointing to the asphalt reality the word seemed to bother briana szemencic all the crap below the right brain whatever you want to call it nora would never hurt anyone you like her shes helped me a lot as an actor as a person sharp little lower teeth got hold of gluteal lip and held on i said noras supportive not its not that i was real shy okay she helped me step out of myself sometimes it wasnt fun but it helped can i go now milo nodded reseda huh valley girl nebraska flatlands said milo you know nebraska been to omaha im from lincoln but same difference said briana szemencic you stare at forever and theres nothing at the end can i go now im really tired milo stepped back thanks for stepping out of that silent thing your friends were into theyre not my friends no no ones anyones friend over there she glanced back at the playhouse the empty porch looked gloomy staged for gloomy like a movie set not a friendly atmosphere said milo were supposed to concentrate on the work so when dylan and michaela started hanging out they broke a rule there are no rules michaela was being stupid how so hooking up with dylan because nora liked him because hes totally shallow you dont share noras enthusiasm a beat not really how come hes hanging with michaela but hes also been getting into nora gimme a break but no jealousy on noras part yellow curls shook violently she reached for the nissans door handle milo said what about reynold peaty who the janitor the fat guy her arm dropped what about him he ever bother you like pervebother no but he stares its creepy hes sweeping mopping whatever and out of the corner of your eye you can see him staring if you look at him he turns away fast like he knows he shouldnt be doing it she shuddered is he like seriouscreepy like americas most wanted creepy i couldnt say that briana szemencics slender frame stiffened but you couldnt say no i have no evidence hes ever done something violent briana if hes not a perve how come you asked about him my job is asking questions briana most of them turn out to be useless but i cant take chances guess its kinda like acting what do you mean a little improv a lot of hard work does peaty hang out at the playhouse a lot when hes cleaning days as well as nights im only there nights anyone else drop by just people applying for workshops mostly nora turns them away but there can still be crowds no talent another lip bite yeah any other reason she turns them away youd have to ask her milo said well thanks again its a cool thing nora giving away her skills for free very cool guess she can do that because her brothers fund the playhouse her brothers and her said briana szemencic its like a whole family thing theyre filthy rich but theyre artistic and generous the brothers ever drop by to see how its spent ive seen them a few times sitting in more like walking around dropping by to visit nora she gripped her purse with both hands tell me the truth about that fat guy i already have briana hes not a perve you can guarantee me that he really scares you like i said hes staring all the time i told you the truth briana but you were punking me about the other stuff what other stuff what you said about cop stuff being like acting that was bs right you know a girl named tori giacomo said milo whos that maybe a student here once ive only been here a year you didnt answer my question that was total bullshit right nope i meant it said milo there are all kinds of similarities between cop work and acting like frustration its a big part of my job just like it is for you big blue eyes filmed with confusion i start off with a new case briana all i can do is ask my questions see if something takes shape its just like reading a brandnew script whatever she opened her car door we both know one thing briana its all about the work you do your best try to make it to the bottom of the funnel but no guarantees i guess milo smiled thanks for talking to us drive safely as we began to walk away a high tight voice from the nissan said whats the funnel a kitchen implement she drove away he pulled out his pad and jotted i said off the record huh she mustve confused me for a reporterguess nora didnt share the funnel analogy with her flock i said too anxietyprovoking one thing nora didnt keep to herself was her attraction to meserve past and present looks like brad overestimated his control nora and dylan still being together means when dylan blamed the hoax on michaela nora wouldve believed it the question is does that have anything to do with michaela ending up in a pile of weeds no matter what that little genius just said i think the jealousy things worth looking into it does but other scenarios come to mind if nora resented michaela dylan might have taken it upon himself to keep nora happy or michaela became a threat to dylan by threatening to go to brad and telling him bad stuff about dylan or to nora herself spinning some erotic details of her nights up in latigo with dylan spin the two of them were naked up there for two nights michaela told me they never had intercourse youre a trusting soul either way why would michaela threaten dylan like that maybe more trial strategy i said pressuring him to shoulder all the blame for the hoax in the end the case settled but if he stayed angry he mightve acted out and the motive for doing tori is his just being a nasty guy that or he and tori also had something going and it went bad he does her finds it easier the second time aroundhe is gone as hell and nora knows where or shes hiding him that would explain her getting squirrely when we brought him up okay enough theory for one night we walked to the car he said theres still peaty stare at the girls and make them cry got him in trouble before lets see if seans surveillance pulled up anything he drove with one hand phoned binchy with the other the young detective was still parked a few feet up from reynold peatys apartment the janitor had come home at seven and had stayed inside three hours watching a building said milo hanging up id be out of my mind seans as happy as if hes playing his bass sean binchy was a former ska punk whod embraced religion and law enforcement simultaneously how is he at working his own cases i said hes great at the routine but its hard to get him to think independently send him to nora get him to open up his right side yeah he said meanwhile my brain hurts gonna check for messages and call it a night two messages no respite the expected call from lou giacomo and a request to phone mister albert beamish maybe he wants compensation for his persimmons he punched the number waited clicked off no answer he sighed okay now for the fun lou giacomo was staying at the holiday inn milo had suggested milo was hoping for a brief condolence chat but giacomo wanted to meet and milo lacked the will to refuse him giacomo was standing outside the hotel wearing the same clothes hed had on yesterday when we pulled up he said can we go somewhere maybe get a drink this place is driving me up the wall the hotel said milo your frickin city chapter our second drinking hole tonight this one a dank wouldbe irish tavern on pico lou giacomo took in the décor this could be queens the three of us settled in a stiffbacked booth with naugahyde cushions milo asked for a diet coke and i had coffee giacomo said bud not light regular this barmaid was young with a lippierce id never take you for a light guy giacomo ignored her she shot him a sharp look and left he said you guys reformed drunks or something milo spread his shoulders and took up more space in the booth giacomo massaged a thick wrist no offense intended im not at my best okay sorry about tori said milo i mean that like i told you the first time i already knew now the wife claims she knew too hows she doing she wants me home asap probably gonna greet me with another nervous breakdown i aint going back until im sure tori gets a proper burial his eyes watered what a stupid thing to say its a fuckin skull how the fuck can it get a proper burial i went over there to your coroner they didnt wanna show it to me gave me all this bullshit it aint like tv you dont have to see it i made em show it to me spadeshaped hands shaped a shaky oval in the air fuckin thing only reason they even had it was some lady was working with it some fuckin science project shes putting holes in it digging out the his loss of composure was sudden as a stroke pale and sweating he pressed himself against the seat gasping as if hed been sucker punched milo said mr giacomo giacomo clenched his eyes shut and waved him off when the young barmaid brought the drinks he was still sobbing and she was mature enough to look the other way sorry about that faggy shit dont be said milo well i fuckin am giacomo rubbed his eyes ran his jacket sleeve over the lids the tweed left red trails across his cheeks what they told me is i gotta fill out forms so i can take it with me after that im outta here he gazed at his beer as if it were a urine sample drank anyway i got this to tell you the few times tori called her mother bugged her getting any parts sleeping enough dating anyone i try to tell arlene dont bug her she says i do it cause i care meaning i dont giacomo swallowed more beer now all of a sudden shes telling me tori was maybe dating someone how does she know tori didnt say so but she didnt deny it any details giacomos lip curled mothers intuition he rotated his mug that place stinks your coroners smells like garbage left out for a month any way you can use what i just told you not without some kind of evidence figures im not trying to bust your balls but what i got to look forward to when i get home aint no picnic dealing with the church who knows what the popes position is on burying my sisters gonna talk to the monsignor well see milo sipped his diet coke lou giacomo said i keep telling myself toris in a better place if i cant convince myself of that i might as well milo said if i call your wife is it possible she can tell me more giacomo shook his head but suit yourself she was always bugging tori are you eating are you exercising howre your teeth what she never got was tori finally wanted to grow up so what do you think is tori connected to that other girl milos lie was smooth i cant say that mr giacomo but youre not not saying it everythings an open issue at this point meaning you dont know shit thats a pretty accurate appraisal giacomos smile was queasy youre probably gonna get pissed but i did something whats that i went over there to toris apartment knocked on all the doors and asked if they remembered tori or seen any guy hanging around what a dump mostly you got mexicans living there im gettin all these confused looks no speaky english you could get hold of the landlords and ask em to pull their rental records seeing as you already tried and they said no hey milo said dont worry about it just tell me what they said they said diddly giacomo handed over a scrap of paper holiday inn stationery a name and a number milo said homerite management giacomo said bunch of chinese i talked to some woman with an accent she claimed they didnt own the building two years ago i try to explain to her this is important but i got nowhere he ran his hands along the sides of his head stupid bitch its like my brains gonna explode im bringing tori back home in a fuckin carryon we drove him back to the holiday inn let the engine idle and walked him to the hotels glass doors im sorry about that alkie crack okay that other time that indian place you guys had tea i was just he shrugged out of line none of my business milo placed a hand on his shoulder no apologies necessary what youve gone through i couldnt hope to understand giacomo didnt repel the contact be straight with me would you consider this a bad one compared to most of them that you get theyre all bad yeah of course sure like someone elses kid aint as important as mine but my kids what im thinking about think ill ever be able to not think about it milo said people tell me it gets easier hope so you find anything youll let me know of course giacomo nodded and shook milos hand you guys are all right we watched him enter the hotel lobby pass the desk without word and stand fidgeting in front of the elevator without touching the button thirty seconds later he slapped his temple and pushed turned around saw us and mouthed the word stooopid milo smiled we got back in the car and drove off people tell me it gets easier said milo pretty therapeutic huh speaking of lies i need to get to the office chart all that stuff little brie thought was off the record dont wanna bore you want me to meet you at michaelas apartment tomorrow morning nah that could be boring too but how about you phone toris mom see if a phd helps the exhusband too heres the numbers i made the calls the following morning arlene giacomo was a thoughtful sane woman she said lou drive you nuts not yet he needs me she said i want him home i let her talk for a while eulogizing tori but providing nothing new when i brought up the dating issue she said a mother can tell believe me but ive got no details tori was really into being free no more girl talk with mama that was something her father couldnt grasp he always bugged her i thanked her and punched in michael caravanzas number a woman answered hold on miikeee moments later a slurred yeah i explained why i was calling he said hold on one second babe this is about tori you found her her remains were identified yesterday remains oh shit i dont wanna tell sandy she knew tori did she know her well nah said caravanza just from church what happened thats what were trying to figure out did you have contact with her after she moved to la we were divorced but we were getting along you know like they say amicable she called me a coupla times maybe the first month then it stopped no more loneliness i figured she hooked up with someone she say that nah but i know knew tori when she had that voice it meant she was excited about something and it sure wasnt her acting career she wasnt getting shit that she told me no idea who she was seeing you think he did it to her any lead would be helpful well said michael caravanza if she did what she said she was gonna do she hooked up with some movie star that was the plan go to hollywood the right clubs whatever meet some movie star and show him she could be a star too ambitious ambitious is what split us up im a working guy tori thought her shit was she thought she was gonna be angelina jolie or something whats that hold on babe just a sec sorry sandys my fiancée congratulations i said yeah im gonna try the marriage thing again sandys nice and she wants kids no big church deal this time were just gonna do it with some judge then go off to aruba or something sounds nice hope so dont get me wrong tori was a nice girl she just thought she could be someone else the few times she did call i said did she say anything that could help us let me think said caravanza it was only three times four whateverwhat did she saymostly she said she was lonely that was basically it lonely in some shitty little apartment she didnt miss me or want to get back together nothing like that she just wanted to tell me she was feeling shitty what did you say nothing i listened mostly thats what i did when i was married she talked i listened i reached milos cell and reported both conversations hooking up with a movie star huh maybe she settled for someone who looked like one meserve or another playhouse adonis with her level of naiveté someone whod been around just a bit longer couldve seemed impressive wonder how long meserves been getting insight from nora dowd longer than two years i said he was there before michaela arrived and when tori showed up so where the hell is heokay thanks let me toss this around while i wait for michaelas landlord the day floated by with all the importance of a cork in the ocean i considered calling allison then robin then allison again settled for neither and filled saturday by running and sleeping doing scutwork around the house sundays balm and glorious blue skies made matters worse this was a day to be with someone i drove to the beach the sun had brought people and cars to the coastline goldenhaired girls promenaded in bikini tops and sarongs surfer dudes peeled in and out of wetsuits tourists gawked at natural wonders of all types on pch a conspicuously crawling highway patrol car lowered the pace to racewalk from carbon beach to malibu road the southern entry to latigo canyon was closer but that meant more miles of winding road i kept going to kanan dume and turned off alone i tooled up the canyon both hands on the wheel as the twists tested the sevilles mushy suspension despite being up here years ago the sharpness of the curves and the dead drops if you steered wrong surprised me not a spot for a leisurely cruise and after dark the route would be treacherous unless you knew it well dylan meserve had hiked up here and returned to play out a fraudulent kidnapping maybe because of the isolation i had yet to encounter another vehicle challenging the mountains i drove another few miles managed to turn around on a skinny ribbon of asphalt hooked right on kanan and drove into the valley tori giacomos last known address was a dingy white multiplex old cars and trucks filled the street true to her fathers description the people i saw were mostly brownskinned some were dressed for church others looked as if faith was the last thing on their minds laurel canyon south led me back into the city and beverly boulevard east took me to hancock park no range rover in nora dowds driveway and when i walked up to the door and knocked no response go west aimless man the weeds where michaela had been dumped had fluffed obscuring any history of violence i stared at plants and dirt got back in the car on holt avenue i spotted shayndie winograd and a young sparsely bearded man in a black suit and a broadbrimmed hat walking four small children and steering a double stroller north toward pico the allegedly ailing gershie yoel was the picture of health as he tried to shinny up his fathers trousers rabbi winograd fended him off finally lifted the boy and slung him over his shoulder like a sack of flour the kid loved it a short drive away on reynold peatys block of guthrie i looked for sean binchy but couldnt find him was the guy that good or had bornagain obligations prevailed on sunday as i coasted past peatys building a young hispanic family came down the stairs and headed for a dented blue van definite church garb including three chubby kids under five these parents looked even younger than the winograds barely out of their teens the fathers shaved head and stonefaced swagger were at odds with his stiff gray suit he and his wife were heavy she had tired eyes and blondstreaked hair back in my intern days the psych staff had favored a smug knowing line kids having kids the unspoken tsktsk here i was driving around by myself who was to say id stopped without meaning to in front of peatys building one of the little kids waved at me and i waved back and both parents turned shavedhead dad glared i sped off no action at the playhouse same for the big cantaloupepainted complex on overland that dylan meserve had left without notice shabby place rust streaks beneath the gutters i hadnt noticed the first time front grid of stingy little windows no hint anyone lived behind them that exhumed memories of my student days living on overland alone and faceless and so full of selfdoubt that entire weeks could slog by in a narcotic haze i pictured tori giacomo mustering the courage for a crosscountry move and ending up in a small sad room on a street full of strangers fueled by ambition or delusions was there a difference lonely everyone lonely i recalled a line id used on girls back then no i dont do drugs more into the natural low mr sardonic every so often it had worked monday morning at eleven milo phoned from his car damn landlord stood me up saturday too much traffic from la jolla finally he tells me i can get a key from his sister who lives in westwood asshole i waited for the techies just finished doing my own toss learn anything she wasnt living large no food in the fridge granola bars and canned diet shakes in the pantry mydol advil motrin peptobismol tums a little marijuana in her nightstand no birth control not much of a reader the extent of her library was back issues of us and people and glamour tv but no cable hookup and the phone was dead my subpoena for her calls is paying off in a few days but like i said her land line was disconnected for nonpayment and i cant find any cell account one thing she did have was nice clothes not a lot but nice she probably spent all her dough on duds manager of the restaurant she worked at said she was fine no problems didnt make much of an impression no guys he remembers seeing her with meserves shoestore boss said meserve was unreliable and could be snotty to customers anyway well see if any interesting prints come up no signs of violence or struggle doesnt look as if she was killed there how was your weekend quiet sounds nice i told him about driving up to latigo left out the rest of my motor tour and the memories it had evoked he said no kidding i was up there myself early in the morning pretty no and out of the way i talked to a few neighbors including the old guy michaela scared when she jumped out naked no one had ever seen her or meserve there before also i got mr albert beamish on the phone this morning saturday and sunday he spends at his place in palm desert sunshine did nothing for his disposition what he was itching to tell me was he spotted noras range rover leaving her house friday around nine right after our meeting at brads house maybe brad advised her to take a vacation or she just felt like some down time and didnt bother to tell her students because shes an indolent rich girl i asked beamish to keep an eye out thanked him for being observant he barks back at me show your gratitude by doing your job with minimal competence i laughed did his powers of observation lead to checking the rovers occupants if only meserves car still hasnt shown up but if hes with nora the two of them could be using hers and stashing his as in noras garage or the one at the playhouse maybe i can pry a door and take a peek on a whole other tack reynold peaty is being true to his loserloner self stayed in his apartment all weekend i gave sean sunday off because hes religious so its possible we missed something but i did watch the place in the afternoon around four missing me by a couple of hours again last and possibly least he said tori giacomos building has changed ownership twice since she lived there the original owners were a couple of nonagenarian sisters who passed on naturally the property went to probate a speculator from vegas picked it up cheap then resold to a consortium of businessmen from koreatown no records of any old tenants the aroma of futility fills the air when are you heading over to noras pulling up as we speak a car door slammed i am now heading for her door knock knock he raised his voice to an androgynous alto whos there lieutenant sturgis lieutenant sturgis whohear that alex hear what exactly okay now im at the garageno give lockedwheres a battering ram when you need it thathathats all folks this has been a presentation of the useless travel channel chapter tuesday morning i called robin got her machine hung up in my office a dusty stack of psych journals beckoned a twentypage treatise on the eyeblink reflex in schizophrenic hooded rats lowered my eyelids i went down to the pond and fed the koi for fish theyre smart have learned to swarm the moment i come down the stairs its nice to be wanted warm air and sloshing water put me under again the next thing i saw was milos big face crowding my visual field smile as wide as a continent scariest clown in the known world i mumbled some kind of greeting whats with you he said snoozing midday like a codger what time is it he told me an hour had vanished whats next white shoes and dinner at four robin naps robin has a real job i got to my feet and yawned the fish sped toward me milo hummed the theme from jaws in his hand was a folder unmistakable shade of blue a new one i said instead of answering he climbed back up to the house i cleared my head and followed he sat himself at the kitchen table napkin tucked into his collar dishes and utensils set for one half a dozen slices of toast runny vesuvius of scrambled eggs sixteenounce glass of orange juice half emptied he wiped pulp from his lips love this place breakfast served any time how long have you been here long enough to rob you blind if such were my intention why cant i convince you to lock your door no one drops in but you this isnt a visit its business he stabbed the egg mound slid the blue folder across the table a second file separated from the first read em and wake a pair of missing persons cases gaidelas a gaidelas c consecutive case numbers two more girls i said sisters read andrew and catherine gaidelas fortyeight and fortyfive respectively had disappeared two months after tori giacomo the couple married twenty years with no children were owners of a beauty parlor in toledo ohio called locks of luck in la for a spring vacation theyd been staying in sherman oaks with cathys sister and brotherinlaw dr and mrs barry palmer on a clear crisp tuesday in april the palmers went to work and the gaidelases left to go hiking in the malibu mountains they hadnt been seen since identical report in both files i read catherines doesnt say where in malibu doesnt say a lot of things keep going the facts were sketchy with no apparent links to michaela or tori was i missing something then i came to the final paragraph subject c gaidelass sister susan palmer reports cathy and andy said they were coming out to calif for vacation but after they got there talked about staying for a while so they could break into acting s palmer reports her sister did some modeling and theater after high school and used to talk about becoming an actress a gaidelas didnt have acting experience but everyone back home thought he was a handsome guy who looked like dennis quaid s palmer reports andy and cathy were tired of running a beauty parlor and didnt like the cold weather in ohio cathy said she thought they could get some commercials because they looked allamerican she also talked about getting serious and taking acting lessons and s palmer thinks cathy contacted some acting schools but doesnt know which ones at the rear were two color headshots cathy and andy gaidelas were both fairhaired and blueeyed with disarming smiles cathy had posed in a sleeveless black dress trimmed with rhinestones and matching pendant earrings fullfaced with plump shoulders she had teased platinum hair a strong chin a thin straight nose her husband was a tousled grayblond longfaced and craggy in a white buttondown shirt that exposed curls of pale chest hair i supposed his offkilter grin had a dennis quaid charm any other similarities to the actor eluded me allamerican couple well into middle age they might qualify for mom and dad parts on commercials pitches for dog food tv dinners garbage bags i shut the file milo said wannabe stars and now theyre gone am i reaching howd you come across it checking out other mp cases with either an acting connection or a malibu link as usual the computer flagged nothing but a sheriffs detective remembered the gaidelases as wouldbe thespians in his mind no homicide two adults rabbiting i reached the brotherinlaw plastic surgeon the gaidelases are still missing family got fed up with the sheriffs tried the pi route went through three investigators the first two gave them zilch the third turned up the fact that the gaidelases rental car had showed up five weeks after the disappearance sent them a big bill and said thats all she could do the sheriffs never thought to tell the family about the car ventura police autorecovery case sheriffs werent even aware of it where was it found camarillo one of the parking lots at that big discount shopping outlet theyve got there huge place i said you shop there twice with allison waiting as she tried on outfits at ralph lauren and versace five weeks and no one noticed the car he said for all we know it was stashed somewhere and moved the gaidelases rental contract was for two weeks and when they didnt return it the company started phoning the number on the form got no answer when the company tried to bill for late charges they found out the gaidelases credit card and cell phone had been canceled the day after they disappeared company kept tacking on fees at a usurious rate of interest the bill compounded seriously and after thirty days the debt got assigned to a collection agency the agency found out the gaidelases number in ohio got another disconnect whats it sound like to you a skip ten points anyway a lien got put on the gaidelases assets screwed up their credit rating private sleuth number three pulled a credit check and back traced the palmers say no way the gaidelases skipped the two of them were hyped up about making it as actors loved california did the car get checked for evidence he shook his head no reason to check a recovered rental by now no one knows where it is probably put up for auction and shipped to mexico the camarillo outlets miles up the coast from malibu i said the gaidelases couldve gone hiking and followed up with a shopping trip duds for auditions or they never got out of the hills shoppings unlikely alex the last credit card purchase they made before the account was canceled was lunch at an italian place in pacific palisades the day before my votes for a nature walk turned nasty couple of tourists digging the view never figuring on a predator he pushed eggs around his plate never liked nature think its worth pursuing malibu and a possible acting school link say it needs to be dr palmer said hed ask his wife if she was willing to talk two minutes later dr susan palmers secretary phones says the sooner the better susans got a dental practice in brentwood im meeting her for coffee in forty minutes let me finish my breakfast am i expected to wash my own dishes dr susan palmer was a thinner plainer version of her sister more subdued shade of blond in her short layered hair trueblue eyes a frame that looked too meager for her wide face she wore a ribbed white silk turtleneck navy slacks blue suede loafers with golden buckles worry lines framed the eyes and tugged at her mouth we were in a mocha merchant on san vicente in the heart of brentwood sleek people ordered complex sixdollar lattes and pastries the size of an infants head reproductions of antique coffee grinders hung from cedarpaneled walls smooth jazz alternated with peruvian flute on tapeloop the scorched smell of overdone beans bittered the air susan palmer had ordered a halfcaf iced sumatran vanilla blendinesse part soy part whole milk make sure its whole not lowfat my request for a medium coffee had confused the kid behind the counter i scanned the menu board brew of the day extrahot medio milo said the same the kid looked as if hed been cheated out of something we brought our drinks to the pine table susan palmer had selected at the front of the coffeehouse milo said thanks for meeting with us doctor palmer looked down at her iced drink and stirred i should thank you finally someones interested her smile was abrupt and obligatory her hands looked strong scrubbed pink the nails trimmed close and smooth dentists hands happy to listen maam lieutenant ive come to accept that cathy and andy are dead maybe that sounds terrible but after all this time theres no other logical explanation i know about the credit card cancellation and the utilities back in toledo but you have to believe me cathy and andy did not run away to start a new life no way would they do that its not in either of their characters she sighed cathy would have no idea where to run whys that doctor my sister was the sweetest person but unsophisticated escape isnt always sophisticated dr palmer escape would be beyond cathy and andy more stirring the beige concoction foamed unpleasantly let me give you some family background our parents are retired professors dad taught anatomy at the medical college of ohio and mom taught english at the university of toledo my brother eric is an mdphd doing bioengineering research at rockefeller u and im a cosmetic orthodontist another sigh cathy barely made it out of high school not a student i said cathy had what i now realize were learning disabilities and with that came all the selfesteem issues youd expect back then we just thought she wasnot as sharp as the rest of us we didnt mistreat her just the opposite we coddled her she and i had a great relationship we never fought shes two years older but i always felt like the big sister everyone in the family was loving and kind but there was thiscathy had to feel it way too much sympathy when she announced her plans to learn to be a cosmetologist our parents made such a big deal youd think shed gotten into harvard she tasted her drink nudged the cup a few inches away mom and dad are not ebullient people when my brother did get into harvard their reaction was lowkey cathy had to know she was being patronized milo said she and her husband ran a business in terms of her ability to plan susan palmer moved her head rapidly more quiver than shake in any other family cathy wouldve been able to think of herself as successful but in oursthe business came about after a longhow can i say thiscathy got into difficulties when she was younger teenage difficulties said milo cathy had an extended adolescence drugs drinking hanging with the wrong crowd eight years after high school she still lived at home and did nothing but sleep late and party a couple of times she ended up in the er thats why my parents were thrilled when she went to beauty school thats where she met andy perfect match andy wasnt a student either said milo andy also struggled through high school said susan palmer hes nice enough nice to cathy thats whats important they both got jobs as stylists at local salons but their incomes never progressed much and after ten years they were still living in a cruddy little apartment so we set them up barry and i my brother and his wife mom and dad we found an old commercial building renovated it bought beauty equipment officially it was a loan but no ones ever discussed repayment locks of luck i said corny no that was andys inspiration they make money said milo the last few years they were turning a small profit mom and dad still helping out mom and dad are in toledo geographically in toledo psychologically in denial they think cathy and andy are alive im sure sometimes they even believe it said susan palmer other timeslets just say its been tough moms health has deteriorated and dads aged terribly if you could learn anything youd be helping some really nice people milo said do you have any theories about what happened the only one that makes sense is that cathy and andy went hiking and met some psycho susan palmer shut and opened her eyes i can only imagine i dont want to imagine the morning they went hiking did anything unusual occur no it was just a regular morning barry and i both had a full day of patients we were really rushed cathy and andy were just waking up when we were about to leave all excited about exploring nature barry and i were so hurried we didnt pay much attention her eyes misted how could i know it would be the last time id see my sister she tasted her drink i specifically said whole milk this is lowfat idiots milo said ill get you another forget it she snapped on the brink of tears her face softened no thanks lieutenant what else can i tell you did cathy and andy mention where in malibu they were headed barry and i thought theyd enjoy the ocean but they had a triplea book and wanted to hike somewhere at the top of kanan dume road where atop kanan dume i couldnt tell you said susan palmer i just remember them showing us a map in the book it looked pretty curvy but thats what they wanted we told the sheriffs all this and they said they drove up and checked the area frankly i dont trust them they never took us seriously barry and i have spent hours driving all over landside malibu she exhaled so much space i said their car was found around twentyfive miles north of kanan dume which is why ive come to believe whatever happened was up in the hills it had to be that way right why else would someone cancel cathy and andys credit card if they werent trying to cover up something terrible same for ditching the car it was to throw us off the trail were cathy and andy aware of the discount outlets we never told them about it but maybe from the triplea book she placed both elbows on the table my sister and brotherinlaw were simple direct people if they said they were going hiking up in malibu they went hiking up in malibu no way would they just disappear and go off on some crazy adventure they did have one fantasy i said what do you mean acting that she said during those eight years after high school cathy managed to convince herself she was going to be an actress or a model depending on what day it was not that she ever did anything to pursue those goals beyond reading fan magazines my mother knew the owner of dillmans department store and they gave cathy a runway job modeling spring fashions cathys pretty when she was young she was gorgeous but by that time a few years older and not exactly anorexic she sniffed and held her breath for several seconds i flew out to attend the show mom and i sat in the front row and we both bought clothing we didnt need the following spring dillmans didnt ask cathy back howd she react i said she didnt which was cathys way shed just take every bit of indignity as if she deserved to be disappointed we all hated when cathy got disappointed thats why mom encouraged her to take some acting lessons adult ed at the community center musical revivals that kind of thing mom wanted cathy engaged in something and cathy finally agreed she seemed to be having a good time then she stopped and announced she was going to become a cosmetologist thats why barry and i were shocked when she and andy got here and announced theyd come to pursue acting was it andys dream as well it was cathys dream but andy got with the program like he always did milo said that can make for a good marriage andy and cathy were best friends it was almosti dont want to say platonic but the truth is ive always wondered and so did my husband and my brother and anyone whos met andy wondered about what his being gay because hes a hairdresser said milo its more than that andy has a definite feminine side to him hes really good at clothes and decorating and cooking and that sounds prejudiced but if you met him youd understand she blinked maybe he was one of those effeminate straight men it doesnt matter does it he loved my sister they adored each other milo said the missing persons file mentioned something about acting schools it did youre surprised doctor i told the sheriff that but i had no idea he actually wrote it down is it important anything that fills in cathy and andys activities during their trip to la could be important they mention specific schools no the only thing they talked about was tourist stuff disneyland universal city walk hollywood and vine they went to the hollywood museum on vine the old max factor building that they loved because of the emphasis on hair and makeup andy kept talking about the blonde room the brunette room she brightened maybe they found an acting school in hollywood theres bound to be some there right more than a few id be willing to check lieutenant ill call every single one ill do it dr palmer she eyed him warily cross my heart sorry its justi need to relax and trust someone i get a good feeling about you lieutenant milos turn to blush i hope im right said susan palmer chapter milo talked to susan palmer for another ten minutes easing into openended questions putting pauses and silences to work good technique but it didnt produce she talked about how much she missed her sister lapsed into exclusive past tense when she shot to her feet her eyes looked bruised got an office full of malocclusions please stay in touch we watched her cross the parking lot and get into a silver bmw the license plate read i str milo said her office is two blocks away but she drove california girl i said something her sister wanted to be acting lessons and a hike above kanan dume cant be coincidence the question is how do the gaidelases figure in with a couple of prettyface female victims that girl we spoke to briana said nora rejected applicants for reasons other than talent wanting em young and pretty he said cathy and andy were both too old and cathy was too fat so what they got turned away from the playhouse and killed talk about flunking an audition maybe their obvious vulnerability got a predator sniffing someone at the school spots em and stalks em he gazed out the window and back at me i said could be the same way tori giacomo was spotted if her ex is right about her dating someone youd think that person wouldve surfaced when she went missing unless he had something to do with her death a goodlooking predator as in meserve what he proposed a threeway to the gaidelases and the party went bad or he just offered to help them with their careers yeah he said that would work on the other hand i said reynold peaty had plenty of opportunity to check out the flock at the playhouse himlets see if seans seen anything he tried binchys number scowled clicked off no connection maybe the cell waves are upset by environmentally conscious mochalicious fumes i said noras attachment to youth is interesting why that just makes her like everyone else in showbiz but she has no profit motive the schools a makework project so why get picky unless what she really wanted was a personal dating pool sample the studs he said and when they get too close brother brad chases them off or thinks he does okay shes a middleaged horndog how do the gaidelases figure in with that i dont know but when susan palmer was describing her family situation i was struck by parallels between cathy and nora both floundered well into adulthood family connections got cathy a runway gig that she couldnt hold on to noras got her a single sitcom walkon that went nowhere cathy had longstanding drug problems nora smokes dope to get her day going eventually both women were set up in business cathys salon had been making a profit recently meaning it lost money for years the dowd family fortune has relieved nora from any financial pressure but bottom line weve got a couple of prodigal daughters maybe cathy showing up at the playhouse evoked something in nora that nora didnt want to see cathys too much like her so she kills her thats a little abstract alex why would nora even know about cathys history if she turned her away what if cathy did have a chance to audition i said noras a big one for opening the soul cathy emoted and it made nora squirm fine but i dont see flashpoint epiphany as a motive for murder all nora has to do is send her and andy away and move on to the next stud and if uncomfortable memories are the issue how does michaela fit in or tori giacomo who disappeared before the gaidelases this feels more like a sexual thing alex just what you said some psychopath scopes out the herd and picks off the weak ones cathy may have been over the hill for a starlet but she wasnt a badlooking woman to a guy like peaty she coulda looked downright sexy no peaty was caught peeping at college girls michaela and tori would fit but cathy wouldnt so maybe hes not as limited as that oafish demeanor suggests or cathy set something off fond memories of a barroom floozy who rejected him back in reno hell maybe cathy reminded him of his mother and he snapped you guys still believe in the oedipal thing it has its place no telling what goes on in the old cranio right he got up and paced if its a sexual thing there could be more victims out there but lets concentrate on the victims we know about what they have in common is acting school andor the malibu hills one person with links to both is meserve i said he picked latigo for his hoax allegedly because hed hiked up there nora was angry at the hoax but instead of kicking him out she promoted him maybe she wasnt clueless after all dylan and nora planned the hoax together why the real performance game two failed actors writing a script discarding the bit players that sounds like hollywood nora choreographs meserve acts it out nora directs its what everyone in the industry aims for the coffeehouse got warmer and noisier as every table filled sleek people began milling at the entrance lots of peeved glances aimed our way milo hooked his finger and we left a woman muttered finally we drove to the station and ran into sean binchy exiting milo s office binchys doc martens gleamed as shiny as his rusty gelled hair hey loot i just took a call for you i tried to call you said milo anything new on peaty binchy beamed we can arrest him if you want driving without a license he has a car red datsun minivan old and messedup looking he parks it on the street three blocks from his apartment which shows intent to conceal right the plates are inactive originally came from a chrysler sedan that was supposed to be junked ten years ago your basic little old lady from pasadena literally loot and guess what thats exactly where peaty drove this morning ten east to the north off at arroyo parkway and then he took surface streets where apartment building on the east side of town he pulled mops and cleaning stuff out of the van and went in there to work i tried to call you but your cell wasnt receiving designer coffee messed up the air said milo pardon go back to peatys tonight sean see if you can get a vin number from the van and trace it sure said binchy did i do wrong by terminating the surveillance loot there were a few things i needed to do back here like what said milo sean shifted his weight captain called me in yesterday ive been wanting to tell you he wants me to work a new case with hal prinski liquor store robbery and pistolwhipping on sepulveda robberies arent my thing but captain says i need breadth of experience im not sure what detective prinski will want from me all i can say is ill do my best to get back to peaty appreciate it sean im really sorry loot if it was up to me id be doing nothing but your stuff your stuffs interesting he shrugged that illegal car buttresses peaty being lowlife buttresses said milo binchys freckles receded as the skin behind them deepened new word a day tashas idea she read somewhere the brain starts deteriorating after puberty like were all rotting you know shes into crosswords word games to stay mentally challenged to me reading the bibles plenty challenging milo said the van buttresses sean if you cant spend any more time on peaty dont sweat it but let me know right away for sure about that call the one that just came in its related to peaty too individual named bradley dowd names in the michaela brand file hes peatys boss whatd he want wouldnt say just that it might be important he sounded real rushed wouldnt talk to me only you the number he lefts a cell not in the file where is it next to your computer which i noticed was turned off so well said binchy i dont want to tell you how to operate but sometimes its better to just leave it on all the time especially with an outmoded machine cause booting up by itself can cause power surges and milo edged past him slammed his door drain energy binchy smiled at me i said hes had a busy day he usually does dr delaware shooting a french cuff binchy examined a bright orange swatch watch whoa noon already all of a sudden i got a burrito jones hello vending machine have a nice day doc i opened milo s door nearly collided with him as he stormed out he kept walking and i hurried to keep pace where to the playhouse just got a call from brad dowd hes got something to show us talking fast but he didnt sound rushed to me more like scared he say why something about nora i asked if she was hurt and he said no then he hung up i figured id wait till we were facetoface before applying my powers of detection chapter the gate to the playhouse property was open a sky heavy with marine fog browned the grass and deepened the houses green siding to mustard bradley dowd stood in front of the garage one of the barn doors was ajar dowd wore a black cashmere crewneck over fawn slacks and black sandals the fog turned his white hair sooty no sign of his porsche on the street a red splitwindowed sixties corvette was parked up a bit all the other vehicles in sight were as glamorous as oatmeal dowd waved as we pulled to the curb something metallic glinted in his hand when we reached the garage he flung the door open the structures aged exterior was deceiving inside were black cement floors polished to a gloss and cedarplank walls adorned with racing posters halogen lights glinted from the ceiling rafters triple garage all three spaces occupied to the left was an impeccably restored green austin healy lowslung waspishly aggressive next to that another vette white happily chromed softer body style than the one on the street nipple taillights one of my grad school profs had tooled around in a car like that hed bragged about it being a a dust filter hummed between the two sports cars it hadnt done much for the dented brown toyota corolla in the righthand slot brad dowd said i got here an hour ago bringing my sting ray back from valve work the shiny thing in his grip was a combination padlock this piece of crap was sitting where the stingers supposed to go the doors were unlocked so i checked the reg its meserves theres something on the front seat that spooks me a little milo walked past him circled the corolla squinted inside the car returned see it said brad dowd snow globe its the one i told you about when nora broke off with him she mustve given it back dont you think its a little weird that he kept it in his damned heap and parked the heap in my space dowds jaw trembled i called nora yesterday no answer same thing today she doesnt have to inform me of her comings and goings but usually she returns calls im going over to her house but first i wanted you to see this albert beamish had spied nora driving away four days ago milo said nothing about that meserve ever leave his car here before mr dowd hell no nora uses the main building for the school but the garage is mine im always in a space crunch lots of cars a few sometimes i set aside slots in my buildings but its not always enough i used to keep a hangar at the airport which was perfect because its right near the office then all the demand from the jet owners drove the rentals up he jiggled the padlock what bothers me is that only nora and i know the combination i wanted her to have it in case of fire or some other disaster she wouldnt give it out to him youre sure of that said milo what do you mean noras an adult sir maybe she chose to disregard your advice about meserve no way nora agreed with me about that lowlife brad lowered his hand and swung the padlock what if he forced her to open up why would he do that sir to hide that thing said dowd he eyed the toyota leaving that stupid globe theretheres something off about it what are you going to do about it any idea how long the cars been here no more than two weeks because thats when i took the stinger in for valve work milo circled the car again doesnt seem to be much in here other than the globe there isnt said dowd wringing his hands the padlock clicked he hung it on the door hasp and returned shaking his head i warned her about him milo said all weve got is his car i know i know think im overreacting its normal to worry about your sister but lets not jump to conclusions what do i do with the heap well have the heap towed to the police impound lot when ill phone right now thanks brad dowd tapped his foot as milo made the call within half an hour mr dowd fine fine you know what else is bothering me that girl the brand girl she got mixed up with meserve and look what happened to her noras too damned trusting lieutenant what if he showed up and she let him in and he got violent well check the car for signs of violence are you sure your sister and yourself are the only ones with the combination damned sure no way nora couldve given it to meserve back when she was still interested in him she was never interested in him were talking a brief flirtation dowd chewed his lip shed never give him the combination i explicitly forbade her to give it out its not logical anyway if she wanted to open the garage she could do it herself which she wouldnt because she knew the stinger would be coming back did she know when thats what i was calling her about yesterday to tell her id be driving it back she didnt answer so she didnt know said milo let me try her house again he produced a shiny black cell phone punched a twodigit speeddial code still no answer could reynold peaty have learned the combination sir from working here dowds eyes widened reynold why would he want it is there something you havent told me about him turns out he does drive has an unregistered vehicle what why the hell would he do that i pay for a van pool to pick him up and take him to work he drove himself to a job in pasadena today milo read off the address from his pad yeah thats one of mine oh jesus youre sure of course you are youve obviously been watching him dowd ran a thumb through his white hair his other hand clenched i asked you the first time if i should worry about him now youre telling me i should brad shaded his eyes with a shaky hand hes been alone with my sister this is a nightmare i cant tell billy where is billy waiting for me at the office the key is to find nora what the hell are you going to do about that lieutenant milo eyed the playhouse have you checked in there there no oh man brad dowd bolted toward the building running around the porch rails with long smooth strides fumbling in his pockets as he vaulted steps two at a time milo went after him and when dowd turned the key milo stilled his hand me first sir dowd stiffened then backed away fine go hurry he positioned himself on the east end of the porch where he leaned on the rail and stared at the garage sun peeked out from under the marine layer foliage was green again dowds red corvette took on an orange sheen six silent minutes passed before the door opened milo said doesnt appear to be any crime scene but ill call the techs and have them take a look if youd like what would that entail would they tear the place up thered be fingerprint dust but no structural damage unless something came up like what signs of violence but you dont see any no sir you need my permission to bring in your people with no probable cause i do then i dont see the point let me go in ill tell you right away if anythings off polished oak everywhere paneled walls broadplank flooring beamed ceilings window casements vigorously grained quartersawn wood milled a century ago mellowed the color of old bourbon and held together by mortise and tenon joints darker wood black walnut had been used for the pegs fringed brown velvet drapes covered some of the windows others had been left clear revealing stained glass insets flowers and fruit and greenery highquality work maybe tiffany not much natural light flowed in the house was dim silent smaller than it appeared from the street with a modest entry hall centering two front rooms what had once been the dining room was set up with old overstuffed thriftshop chairs vinyl beanbags rolled up futons rubber exercise pads an open doorway offered a glimpse of a white kitchen a stage had been constructed at the rear of the former parlor ragged plywood affair on raw fir joists made even cruder by its contrast to the precision joinery and gleaming surfaces everywhere else three rows of folding chairs for the audience photos taped to the outer wall many of them blackandwhite what looked to be stills from old movies brad dowd said everything looks normal his eyes shifted to an open door stage right did you check in back milo nodded yup but feel free dowd went in there and i followed a short dark hallway led to two small rooms with an old lav between them onceuponatime bedrooms paneled with bead board below the chair rail painted pea green above one chamber was vacant the other stored additional folding chairs and was decorated with more movie stills both closets were empty brad dowd moved in and out quickly the agingsurfer insouciance id seen at his house had given way to gamecock jumpiness nothing like family to shake you up he left i lingered and glanced at the photos mae west harold lloyd john barrymore doris day and james cagney in love me or leave me veronica lake and alan ladd in the blue dahlia voight and hoffman in midnight cowboy blackandwhite faces i didnt recognize a section devoted to youth acts the lennon sisters the brady bunch the partridge family the cowsills a quartet of grinning kids in bellbottoms called the kolor krew i returned to the front room milo and brad dowd sat at the edge of the stage dowds head was down milo was saying you can help by trying to remember where your sister goes when she travels she wouldnt let that thing in the garage and just go off somewhere covering bases mr dowd travelingokay she flies to paris every year later in the year midapril she stays at the crillon costs a fortune sometimes she goes on to the south rents a little chateau the longest shes been away is a month anywhere else she used to go everywhere england italy germany but france is the only place she really likes she speaks high school french never had any of those problems you hear about what about here in the states shes been to a health spa in mexico a few times said dowd down in tecate i think she also goes to a place in ojai or santa barbara somewhere in that vicinity she likes the whole spa thing you think that could be it she just wanted to be pampered and im worrying about nothing hell maybe meserve did learn the combination and stashed that piece of shit and nora knows nothing about it and is getting a mud pack or whatever his fingers drummed his knees ill get on the horn call every damn spa in the state well do that sir i want to do something help me by thinking back said milo did nora mention anything about traveling recently definitely not brad bounded up im going to check on billy then its over to noras house lieutenant she doesnt like me using my key but what if she fell and needs help milo said whens the last time you remember seeing her with meserve after meserve pulled that stunt and she assured me it was over milo said nothing dowds laugh was bitter so whats his damn car doing here right you think im clueless your sisters an adult so to speak said brad dowd softly its tough being in charge i said yeah its a day at the beach milo said so you have a key to noras house in my safe at the office but ive never used it she gave it to me years ago same reason i gave her the combination to the garage if shes not home maybe ill look around just a little see if i can find her passport im not sure where she keeps it but i can try though i guess you could find out faster just call the airlines after nineeleven its a little complicated said milo bureaucratic bullshit yes sir i cant even go into your sisters house with you unless she explicitly gave you permission to bring in guests guests said brad dowd like were having a goddamn party no she never did that truth is ive never gone in there myself without nora never thought id need to he brushed invisible dust from his sweater im firing reynold please dont said milo but theres no evidence against him mr dowd and i dont want to alert him hes a goddamn pervert said brad dowd what if he does something on the job who gets sued for liability what else havent you told me nothing sir dowd stared at milo lieutenant im sorry if it messes up your case but i am going to fire him once ive talked to my lawyer and my accountant make sure everythings by the book its my prerogative to handle my business any were watching peaty said milo so the likelihood of his stepping out of line is next to nil id strongly prefer you to hold off youd prefer said dowd id prefer not having to deal with everyone elses shit he left us passed the rows of folding chairs kicked a metal leg cursed under his breath milo remained on the stage chin in hand oneman show the sad detective brad dowd made it to the entry hall and looked back you planning on sleeping here cmon i need to lock up chapter milo toed the curb and watched as the corvette sped off i said you wanted brad to take peaty more seriously he reached behind and slapped his rear cya time if it turns out something bad happened to nora hell be looking for someone to blame you didnt tell him nora left friday night there are limits to my honesty first of all beamish never saw who was in the car second theres no law keeping her inside her house she coulda been going out for drinks or she did have travel plans or she got abducted by aliens if meserve snatched her why would he leave his wheels at her school and broadcast the fact and if the snow globes some kind of trophy hed take it with him if he said what else could it be maybe a defiant message to brad from dylan and nora were still together that also fits with planting the toyota in one of brothers treasured spaces is there some reason you dont trust brad because i didnt tell him everything no i just dont know enough to be sharing why does he bug you no but i think his value as a source of data is limited he clearly overestimates his authority with nora not so takecharge sib he assumed the caretaker role because billy and nora arent competent that allowed them to remain adult children noras more of a perpetual adolescent selfcentered casually sexual smokes up and what do rebellious teens do when theyre cornered they resist passively or fight back when brad insisted she break off with meserve nora chose passive tooling off in her range rover and leaving lover boys heap behind so they can travel in style yeah could be so what do we have just a road trip bonnie and clyde in fancy wheels cutting town because theyve been doing bad things dont know i said people who attend noras school keep disappearing but now that we know peatys got wheels hes got to remain center focus a van your basic psycho meat wagon and soon hes gonna be unemployed if seans yanked off surveillance and that bastard sneaks away im further back than when i started he folded his arms across his chest i screwed up by telling brad about peatys van peaty cleans lots of buildings i said it was the right thing to do morally werent you listening i was covering my own ass sorry cant hear you while we waited for the lapd tow truck to arrive milo tried phoning binchy again no connection he said something about the hightech big lie and paced up and down the block the truck appeared moving slowly as the driver searched for the address milo s wave went unheeded finally the rig pulled up and a sleepylooking driver around nineteen got out in there the toyota milo told him consider it a crime scene and take it directly to the forensics garage the driver rubbed his eyes and shuffled paper them wasnt my orders them is now milo handed him gloves the driver slipped them on and slouched toward the little cars drivers door milo said theres a snow globe on the seat its evidence a wha one of those doohickeys that snows when you turn it upside down the driver looked baffled opened the door and drew out the globe upending the toy he watched plastic flakes flutter peered at the writing at the base and wrinkled his brow milo gloved up snatched it away and dropped it in an evidence bag his face was flushed the driver said im supposed to take that in no professor i keep it snow said the driver hollywood and vine never seen no snow there as i drove back to the station milo said do me a favor and contact that lawyer montez soon as you can find out if michaela told him anything about meserve and nora that she didnt tell you any idea who meserves pd was marjani coolidge dont know her me neither but i can try try is great the second call to binchy connected milo told him check out your phone sean you still on him nah dont worry about it hes probably working ill figure something out for nights what you can do for me is start calling health spas from santa barbara county down to midbaja and see if nora dowd or dylan meserve have checked inspas like in massages and health food whatno its fine sean he jammed the phone in his pocket stuck on robbery detail i said seems to be he beat a fast chacha rhythm on the dashboard i could feel the vibrations through the steering wheel better get over to peatys place myself tonight the unregistered vans grounds to arrest him maybe we can chat in his apartment so i get a look at the dump meanwhile i make those spa calls myself hello ear cancer i can do that leave the bigstrongguy detective work to you such as finding out if nora used her passport is it really tougher post nineeleven id think thered be more interagency communication what a sage he said yeah i fibbed to bradley figuring hed be motivated to get into noras house let me know if anythings off technically nothings changed you still need a search warrant to access passenger lists and the airlines being busy figuring out ways to torment their passengers still take their sweet time complying but there is more buddybuddy stuff remember that granny shooting i closed last year sweet old lady subbing for her son at the liquor store alma napier eightytwo years old perfect health some methaddled dungball unloads a shotgun on her the search of said dungballs dump turns up a carton of video cameras from indonesia hollowed out inside with pistolshaped compartments i thought the federal air marshals might want to hear about that got to know one of the supervisors there he retrieved the phone asked for commander budowski bud milo sturgisfine you terrific listen i need a favor fifteen minutes after we got to his office a civilian clerk brought in the fax wed split the task of locating and phoning spas were coming up empty milo read budowskis report handed it to me got back on the phone nora dowd hadnt used her passport for foreign travel since the previous april threeweek trip to france just as brad had said dylan meserve had never applied for a passport neither nora nor dylans name appeared on any domestic flights out of lax long beach burbank john wayne lindbergh or santa barbara budowski had left a handwritten note at the bottom if nora had sprung for a private jet that fact might never emerge some aircharter companies were less than meticulous checking ids milo said theres everyone then theres the rich he made a few more calls to resorts broke for coffee at two pm instead of continuing he leafed through his notepad found a number and phoned mrs stadlbraun detective sturgis i was by last week to talk abouthe is how so i see no thats not very politeyes it is has there been anything beyond thatno theres nothing new but i was figuring to stop by and talk to him if you could call me when he gets in id appreciate it still have my card ill holdyes thats perfect maam either of those numbers thanksno maam theres nothing to worry about just routine followup he clicked off rotated the phone receiver twisting the cord and letting it recoil ol ertha says peatys been acting even weirder he used to just keep his head down pretended not to hear now he looks her in the eye with what she claims is nastiness what do you make of that maybe he spotted sean watching him and is getting nervous i said i suppose but one thing seans an ace at is not getting made he wheeled his chair the few inches the cramped space permitted would nervous make peaty more dangerous it could think i should caution stadlbraun i dont know what you could say that wouldnt cause panic no doubt brad will evict peaty in addition to firing him so weve got ourselves a homeless jobless angry guy with illegal wheels time to grovel and ask the captain for help with surveillance he disappeared came back shaking his head at a meeting downtown i was on the line with the wellness inn of big sur enduring a voice mail message about seaweed wrap and ayurvedic massage and waiting for a human voice by three thirty we were both finished nora dowd hadnt checked into any posh retreat we could find under her name or dylan meserves i tried lauritz montez at the beverly hills public defenders office in court expected back in half an hour too much sitting around i got up and told milo where i was going his reply was a finger wave i didnt bother to reciprocate i reached the beverly hills court building by five to four closing time for most sessions the hallways were filled with attorneys cops defendants and witnesses montez was in the middle of it pushing a black leather case on wheels thin and sallow as ever gray hair drawn back in a ponytail giant drooping mustache and wispy chinbeard whitening around the edges the lenses of his glasses were hexagonal and cobalt blue walking alongside him was a pallid young woman in a filmy pink granny dress long black hair beautiful face old womans stoop she kept talking to montez if he cared about what she had to say he wasnt showing it i blended with the crowd managed to get behind the two of them every time id seen montez hed gone for foppery todays costume was a fitted black velvet suit with an edwardian cut wide peaked lapels trimmed with satin the pink of his shirt brought painful memories of childhood sunburns his peacockblue bowtie was glossy silk the pallid girl said something that made him stop the two of them veered to the right and stepped behind an open courtroom door i edged closer to the other side and pretended to study a wall directory the crowd had thinned and i could make out their conversation through the jamb what the continuance means jessica is i bought some time for you to get clean and stay clean you can also find yourself a job and try to con the judge into thinking you want to be a solid citizen what kinda job anything jessica flip burgers at mcdonalds what about johnny rockets its like close by if you can get a job at johnny rockets that would be great i never flipped burgers what have you done i danced ballet topless im sure you were great on the pole jessica but thats not going to help you he walked away the girl didnt i moved from behind the door and said afternoon montez turned the girl had her back to the wall as if pressed there by an unseen hand go look for a job jessica she flinched and left i said did michaela say anything about dylan and nora dowd having a relationship you stalking me doc or is this happy coincidence we need to talk i need to go home and forget about work that includes you he took hold of his luggage rack meserves missing i said given the fact that your client was murdered last week you might reconsider being a glib wiseass his jaw tightened it sucks okay now leave me alone meserve could be in danger or he could be a bad guy did michaela tell you anything that would clarify the situation she blamed him for the hoax i waited yeah he was fucking dowd okay howd michaela feel about that she thought meserve had lost it said montez going for a senior citizen i believe her precise phrase was tired meat jealous no she had no feelings for meserve just thought it was gross was there any indication nora was in on the hoax michaela never said so but i wondered because she was fucking meserve and he didnt get kicked out of her school you think he killed michaela i dont know i said would you look at that he said finally i get a shrink to be direct is marjani coolidge back from her trip to africa shes right there pointing down the hall to a short thin black woman in a powderblue suit two tall grayhaired men were listening to what she had to say thanks i turned to leave montez said just to show you im not the asshole you think i am heres another tidbit dowd called me right after i got the case offered to pay any bills the county wasnt covering i told her the county could handle it asked her why the generosity she said meserve was a gifted artist she wanted to help him and if that meant clearing michaela shed do it i could smell the hormones through the phone she goodlooking not bad for her age something like that i said he laughed and wheeled his cart away and i walked toward marjani coolidge the two men had left and she was examining the contents of her own lawyerluggage doublecase scuffed brown leather stuffed so tight the stitching was unraveling i introduced myself told her about michaelas murder she said i heard about that the poor kid then interrogated me about my association with lapd appraising my words and my body language with huge brown eyes her hair was elaborately braided her skin smooth and taut i said did meserve tell you anything that could shed light on the murder youre serious something nonincriminating i said anything that could help locate him is he a suspect he could turn out to be a victim of the same person who killed brand maybe she smoothed her skirt nonincriminating last i heard that animal was extinct how about this i said without divulging content can you tell me if meserves someone to be scared of was i scared of him not in the least not the brightest star in the constellation but he did what he was told that girlfriend of his on the other hand which girlfriend is that the acting teacher dowd she caused problems battleax said coolidge phoned me right at the outset said shed hire a private attorney if i didnt give pretty boy high priority i felt like saying is that a threat or a promise what did you tell her do what you want madame then i hung up never heard from her again i represented meserve the way i do any other client turned out just fine wouldnt you say meserves codefendants dead and hes missing irrelevant she said we settled my obligations are over just like that i said you better believe it my job you learn to stay in your own orbit orbit constellation you have an interest in astronomy majored in it at cornell then i moved here for law school and found out you cant see anything because of all the light pollution she smiled civilization i think you call it chapter i exited the courthouse parking lot and took rexford drive through the beverly hills municipal complex the light at santa monica was long enough for me to leave a message on milo s cell driving home i wondered about the affair between meserve and nora partners in the worst kind of crime or just another maydecember romance wouldnt it be nice if reynold peaty got caught doing something nasty confessed to multiple murder and we could all move on i realized i was driving too fast and slowed down switching on a cd i listened to mindy smiths clear sweet soprano waiting for her man to arrive on the next train the only thing waiting for me was mail and an unread newspaper maybe it was time to get another dog as i turned off sunset a brown audi quattro parked on the east side of beverly glen pulled behind me and stayed close i sped up and so did the audi as it rode my tail close enough for a rearview of bird dirt on the fourring grille a tinted windshield prevented further clarity i swung to the right instead of passing the audi downshifted drove alongside to my left for a second then sped off in nasal acceleration i made out a driver no passengers a rear bumper sticker sported red letters on a white background too brief for me to read the whole message but i thought id seen the word therapy when i reached the bridle path that leads to my street i looked for the car nowhere just another friendly day on the roads of la id been an obstruction and hed felt compelled to tell me the phone was ringing as i walked into the house robin said sorry i missed your call that threw me for a second then i remembered id called her this morning hadnt left a message she understood the pause said caller id whats up i was just saying hi want to get together just to talk sure how about talk and eat she said nothing too intense name the place long time since shed been in the house that shed designed i said i could make something here if you dont mind id rather go out when should i pick you up how about seven seven thirty ill wait outside meaning dont come in or did she crave fresh air after hours of sawdust and varnish did it matter rose avenue sported a few more boutiques and cute cafés tucked among the laundromats and fast food stands the ocean air that blew through windows was sour but not unpleasant for that the night sky was a swirl of gray and indigo textured like pigments mixed haphazardly on a palette soon the the cute cafés would be overflowing pretty people fortified by margaritas and possibilities spilling out to the curb robin lived minutes from that scene did she ever participate did that matter her block on rennie was quiet and inconsistently lit lined with neatly tended little houses and sidebyside duplexes i spotted the flower beds shed planted out front before i saw her step out of the shadows her hair bounced as she beelined to the car nighttime turned auburn rosy her curls reminded me as they always did of grapes on the vine she wore a secondskin top in some dark shade formfitted light jeans boots with nasty looking heels that clumpclumped as she opened the door the dome light told all chocolate brown tank top textured silk one shade lighter than her almond eyes the jeans were cream the boots mocha silvery pink gloss ripened her lips blush on her cheekbones created something feline those curves she flashed a wide ambiguous smile and put on her seat belt the strap cut diagonally between her breasts where to she said id taken her at her word about nothing intense haute cuisine meant ritual and high expectations and we could do with neither allison liked haute loved rolling the stem of a wineglass between manicured fingers as she engaged in earnest discussion of an elegant menu with snooty waiters her toes trailing up my trousers i mentioned a seafood joint in the marina that robin and i had patronized back before the ice age spacious dockside nosweat parking nice view of a harbor full of big white boats most of which seemed never to go anywhere she said that place sure we got a table outdoors near the glass wall that keeps the wind out the night had turned cool and butane heaters were switched on the sports bar up front was packed but it was still early for the marina dinner crowd and more than half the tables were empty a chirpy waitress who looked around twelve took our drink order and brought robins wine and my chivas before we had a chance to get awkward drinking and gazing at the yachts postponed that a while longer robin put her glass down you look fit you look gorgeous she studied the water black and sleek and still under a sky streaked with amethyst mustve been a great sunset we had a few of those i said that summer we lived at the beach the year wed rebuilt the house robin had served as the contractor did she miss the place she said we had some spectacular ones at big sur that crazy zen place that was supposed to be luxurious then they stuck us with chemical toilets and that terrible smell rustic living i wondered if the place had been on the resort list milo and i had just run down what was it called the great mandala lodge closed down last year she looked away and i knew why shed gone back with him she drank wine and said even with the smell and the mosquitoes and that splinter in my toe from that stupid pinecone it was fun who knew a pinecone could be lethal youre forgetting my splinters i said oversized incisors flashed i didnt forget i chose not to remind you her hand made circular motions in the air rubbing that ointment into your cute butt how could we know that other couple would be watching all that other stuff they could see from their cabin shouldve charged them tuition i said crash course in sex ed for the honeymooners they did seem pretty inept all that tension at breakfast think the marriage lasted i shrugged robins eyes turned down a bit the place deserved to tank charge that kind of money and smell like a cesspool more alcohol for both of us i said nice to be with you just before you called this morning i was thinking brief smile always a risky thing no thinking about what the challenge of relationships not you and me me and him my gut twinged i drained my scotch looked around for the babyfaced waitress robin said me and him as in what was i thinking thats rarely useful you dont engage in selfdoubt sure i do i find it good for the soul she said that old catholic girl resurfacing all i could come up with was he convinced himself that he loved me and his intensity half convinced me i was the one who broke it off you know he took it really hard but thats not your problem sorry for bringing it up hes not a bad guy you never liked him couldnt stand him where is he you care id like him to be far then you got your wish london teaching voice at the royal academy of drama his daughters living with him shes twelve wanted the switch she tugged at her curls it was rude bringing him up hes a twit i said but the problem wasnt you and him it was you and not me i dont know what it was she said all this time and i still cant figure it out just like the first time breakup number one years ago neither of us had wasted time finding new bed partners i said maybe thats the way it has to be with us what do you mean eons together centuries apart somewhere out in the open water a ships horn sounded she said it was mutual but for some reason i feel i should ask your forgiveness you shouldnt hows allison doing her thing soft voice you two are really kaput that would be my bet youre making it sound like you have no control she said in my limited experience i said its rarely been necessary to make a formal announcement sorry she said i drank you really see it as mutual alex and not my fault i do and i dont understand it any more than you do ditto for the break with allison maybe with any other woman id find you know i was never untrue to you didnt touch him until you and i were living apart you dont owe me any explanation everything weve been through she said i cant figure out what i owe you footsteps approaching the table rescued me from having to answer i looked up expecting ms chirpy more than ready for another drink a man loomed over us bigbellied ruddy balding fifty or so blackframed eyeglasses slightly askew sweaty forehead he wore a maroon vneck over a white polo shirt gray slacks brown loafers florid jowls settled over the shirts soft collar swaying he placed broad hairless hands on our table sausage digits some kind of class ring on his left index ring finger he leaned down and his weight made the table rock bleary eyes behind the specs stared down at us he gave off a beery odor some joker whod wandered over from the sports bar keep it friendly my smile was wary he tried to straighten up lost balance and slapped a hand back on the table hard enough to slosh water out of our glasses robins arm shot out before her wine toppled the drunk looked at her and sneered i said hey friend i am not your friend hoarse voice i looked around for ms perky anyone spotted a busboy up a ways wiping tables i arched my eyebrows he continued wiping the nearest couple two tables down was engaged in an eyetango i told the drunk the bars back in there he leaned in closer you dont know who i am i shook my head robin had room to back away i motioned her to leave when she started to get up the drunk roared sit slut my brain fired conflicting messages from the prefrontal cortex rowdy young guys shouting were pumped dude pound him to shit a reedy old mans voice whispering careful the consequences robin sank back i wondered how much karate i remembered the drunk demanded who am i i dont know my tone said the old man was losing out to the prefrontal bad boys robin gave me a tiny head shake the drunk said what did you say i dont know who you are and id appreciate i am doctor hauser doctor hauser and you are a fucking liar the old man whispered selfcontrol its all about control hauser drew back his fist the old man whispered scratch all that i caught him by the wrist twisted hard and followed up with a heeljab under his nose hard enough to stun him well short of driving bone into his brain as he tumbled back i sprang up and took hold of his shirt breaking his fall to give him a soft landing my reward was a face full of beery spittle i let go just before his ass hit the deck tomorrow his tailbone would hurt like hell he sat up for a moment frothing at the mouth and rubbing his nose the spot where id hit him was pink and just a little bit swollen he worked his mouth to gather more spit closed his eyes and flopped down and rolled over and started to snore a perky voice said wow what happened a nasal voice said that dude tried to hit the other dude and the other dude protected his lady the busboy standing next to the waitress i caught his eye and he smiled uneasily hed been watching all along you were righteous man i gonna tell the cops the cops showed up eleven long minutes later chapter patrol officer j hendricks stocky cleancut black as polished ebony patrol officer m minette curvy cleancut beige hair ponytailed hendricks eyed the spot where patrick hauser had fallen so both of you are doctors he stood just out of arms reach notepad in hand my back was to the glass wall the diners whod remained in the restaurant pretended not to stare an ambulance had come for hauser hed greeted the emts by cursing and spitting and theyd restrained him on the gurney change had fallen out of his pocket two quarters and a penny remained on the deck were both psychologists i said but as i said ive never seen him before a total stranger assaulted you he was drunk a brown audi quattro followed me home this afternoon if you find one in the parking lot he stalked me too all cause of this hendricks consulted his notes this report you wrote him up on i retold the story kept my sentences short and clear dropped milo s name again hendricks said so youre saying you hit him once under the nose with your bare fist heel of my hand thats kind of a martial arts move it seemed the best way to handle it without inflicting serious damage that kind of blow couldve inflicted real serious damage i was careful you a martial arts guy not hardly a martial arts guys hands are like deadly weapons doctor im a psychologist sounds like you moved pretty good it happened fast i said scribble scribble i looked over at officer minette listening to the busboy and writing as well shed interviewed robin first then the waitress i was hendrickss assignment no handcuffs that was a good sign minette let the busboy go and came over everyone seems to be telling the same story the narrative she recited matched what id told hendricks he relaxed okay doctor im going to make a call and verify your address with dmv that checks out youre free to go you might check if hausers got a quattro hendricks looked at me i might do that sir i searched for robin minette said your lady friend went to the little girls room she said the victim called her a slut he did that mustve been irritating he was drunk i said i didnt take him seriously still she said thats pretty annoying it wasnt until he tried to hit me that i was forced to act loser insults your date like that some guys would have reacted stronger im a man of discretion she smiled her partner didnt join in she said i think were finished here john as robin and i walked through the restaurant someone whispered thats the guy once we got outside i exhaled my ribs hurt hauser hadnt touched me id been holding in air for a long time what a disaster robin slipped her arm around my waist you need to know i said that this was a civil case nothing to do with police work i told her about the harassment charges against hauser my interview of his victims the report id written why do i need to know she said the way you feel about the ugly stuff this was out of the blue robin we headed for the seville and i scanned the lot for the brown audi there it was parked six slots south the red letters on the bumper sticker said get therapy i wanted to laugh but couldnt wasnt surprised when we reached the seville and both of my rear tires were flat no slash marks the valves had been opened robin said thats pathetic ive got a pump in the trunk part of the emergency kit milo and rick had gotten me last christmas tire changing kit flares orange dayglo road markers blankets bottled water rick taking me aside and confiding id have picked a nice sweater but an ahem cooler head prevailed milos voice bellowing from the corner of their living room haberdashery dont cut it when youre stranded out on some isolated road with no lights and wolves and god knows what other toothy carnivores are aiming their beady little predator eyes at your anatomy just waiting to then why didnt we get him a gun milo next year some day youll thank me alex youre welcome in advance i hooked up the pump and got to work when i was finished robin said the way you handled it just enough to defuse the situation and no one got hurt classy she took my face in her hands and kissed me hard we found a deli on washington boulevard bought more takeout than we needed drove back to beverly glen robin walked into the house as if she lived there entered the kitchen and set the table we made it halfway through the food when she got out of bed the movement woke me sweaty nap but my eyes were dry through halfclosed lids i watched her slip on my ratty yellow robe and pad around the bedroom touching the tops of chairs and tables pausing by the dresser righting a framed print at the window she drew back one side of the silk curtains shed designed she put her face against the glass peered out at the foothills i said pretty night the view she said without turning still unobstructed looks like its going to stay that way bob had his lower acre surveyed and its definitely unfit for construction bob the neighbor she said hows he doing when hes in town he seems well second home in tahiti she said main home in tahiti nothing like inherited wealth thats good news about the view i was hoping for that when i oriented the room that way she let the curtain drop smoothed the pleats i did a decent job with this place like living here not as much as i used to she cinched the robe tighter half faced me her hair was wild her lips slightly swollen faraway eyes i thought it might be strange she said coming back its less strange than i wouldve predicted its your place too i said she didnt answer i mean it she babystepped over to the far end of the bed played with the edges of the comforter you havent thought that through i hadnt sure i have many a long night she shrugged the place echoes robin it always did we were aiming for great acoustics it can be musical i said or not she pulled at the comforter squared the seam with the edge of the mattress you do all right by yourself says who youve always been selfcontained like hell my voice was harsh she looked up at me i said come back keep the studio if you need privacy but live here she tugged at the comforter some more her mouth twisted into a shape i couldnt read loosening the robe she let it fall to the floor reconsidered picked it up folded it neatly over a chair the organized mind of someone who works with power tools fluffing her hair she got back in bed no pressure just think about it i said its a lot to digest youre a tough kid like hell pressing her flank to mine she laced her fingers and placed them over her belly i drew the covers over us thats better thanks she said neither of us moved chapter once im roused im restless for hours as robin slept i prowled the house ended up in my office and composed a mental list switched to a written list first thing tomorrow id contact erica weiss and tell her about hauser more ammunition for her civil suit if hausers control was that loose mounting legal problems might not stop him from harassing me or getting litigious himself this whole mess could cost me i tried to convince myself it was the price of doing business must be nice to be that serene replaying the scene at the restaurant i wondered how hauser had lasted this long as a therapist maybe the smart thing would be filing a preemptive suit against him officers hendricks and minette had appeared to see things my way so a police report would help but you never knew milo would know what to do but he had other things on his mind so did i my offer to robin spilling out like pentothal chatter if she said yes would that constitute a happy ending so many whatifs milo said i was just about to call you kismet you dont want this type of kismet he told me why i said ill be right over the note i left on the nightstand read dear r had to go out a bit of the ugly stuff stay as long as youd like if you have to go lets talk tomorrow i dressed quietly tiptoed to the bed and kissed her cheek she stirred reached up with one arm let it drop as she rolled over girl fragrance mixed with the smell of sex i took one last look at her and left reynold peatys corpse had been wrapped in translucent plastic tied with stout twine and loaded onto the righthand stretcher in the white coroners van the vehicle remained parked in front of peatys apartment building rear doors open bolted metal racks secured the body and the empty stretcher to its left busy nights in la double occupancy transport was a good idea flanking the coroners van were four blackandwhites roof lights pulsing terse recitations from dispatch operators sparked the night but no one was listening lots of uniforms standing around trying to look official milo and sean binchy conferred near the farthest cop car milo talked and binchy listened for the first time since id known the young detective he looked upset over the phone milo told me the shooting had taken place an hour ago but the suspect was just being taken down the stairs of peatys building young hispanic guy heavily built broad skull helmeted by dark stubble escorted by two huge gymrat patrolmen who diminished him id seen him before when id driven past the building last sunday father of the young family heading for church wife and three chubby little kids stiff gray suit that looked out of place kids having kids hed aimed hard eyes my way as i stopped in front of the building no view of his eyes now his arms were cuffed behind him and his head hung low barefoot wearing a black xxxxl tshirt that nearly reached his knees saggy gray sweatpants that threatened to slip off his hips and a big gold fist on a chain that swung over the shirts snarling pit bull baaadboyz logo someone had forgotten to remove the bling milo went over and rectified the situation and the ironpumper cops seemed abashed the suspect looked up as milo fiddled heavy lids tenting when milo got the chain off the kid smiled and said something milo smiled back he checked behind the kids ears waved the cops on and handed the necklace to an evidence tech who bagged it as the uniforms got the shooter into one of the idling cruisers and drove away mrs ertha stadlbraun stepped out of her groundfloor flat and walked to the sidewalk standing just right of the taped perimeter she shivered and hugged herself her dressing gown was custardyellow and quilted fuzzy white mules encased her feet and yellow rollers turned her hair into white tortellini shiny bright skin some kind of night cream she shivered again and tightened her arms tenants stared out of windows so did a few residents of the dingbat next door milo beckoned me over his face was sweaty sean binchy stayed behind not doing much of anything when i got there he said doctor and chewed his lip milo said hot town summer in the city in february thats why we live here i told him about seeing the suspect before described the kids demeanor he said that fits a coroners attendant slammed the vans doors shut got in drove away i said how close is his apartment to peatys two doors down his names armando vasquez hes got a sealed juvenile gang history claims to be a steadily working churchgoing married man for the past four years has a landscaping gig with a company that maintains some of the big bh properties north of sunset he used to just mow grass but this year he learned to trim trees hes pretty proud of that how old is he twentyone wifes nineteen three kids under five for the most part they stayed asleep while i tried to chat with their daddy one time the oldest toddled in i let vasquez kiss the kid kid smiled at me he sighed vasquez has no adult sheet so maybe hes telling the truth about finding god the neighbors ive spoken to so far say the kids can be noisy but the family doesnt cause problems no one liked peaty apparently everyone in the buildings been jabbering about him since we met with stadlbraun he glanced at the old woman still hugging herself staring out at the darkened street she seemed to be fighting for composure i said she spread the word peaty was dangerous milo nodded the ol gossip mill was chugging along before vasquez dummied up he told me peaty always rubbed him the wrong way prior conflict no fights just lots of tension vasquez didnt like peaty living so close the term he used was fuckin crazy dude after he said that he started moving his head back and forth and up and down i said whatre you doing armando he says crossing myself you got me cuffed so im doing it this way did peaty ever bother his wife he stared at her which is consistent with what everyone else says fuckin crazy stare unfortunately for vasquez its not justification for blowing peatys brains out sean binchy came over still looking uneasy need me for anything more loot no go home relax binchy flinched thanks hey doc bye milo said you did fine sean whatever when he left i said whats bothering him the lad has an overdeveloped sense of responsibility he worked a robbery case all day got off at eleven and decided on his own to watch peaty he started here didnt see peatys minivan went out for a burger at a twentyfourhour spot got back just after midnight and spotted the van a block up that way he pointed east he was looking for a watch spot in the alley when he heard the three shots peaty caught all of em fullfaced you wouldnt figure that physiog could get any uglier but seans feeling guilty about not being here about the burger about nothing no way he couldve prevented it did he arrest vasquez he called for backup then went up the stairs peatys body was out on the walkway between the apartments at that point sean waited for the blues and they went door to door when they got to vasquezs apartment vasquez was sitting on his couch watching tv the guns right next to him and so are the wife and the oldest kid vasquez puts up his hands and says i killed his ass do your thing the wife starts bawlin the kid stays real quiet howd it happen i said when i got to specifics vasquez got laryngitis my sense is hes been stewing on peaty for a while started bubbling over when ol ertha told him about my visit for some reason tonight he got tired of doing nothing saw peaty come home and went out to tell him to stay away from mrs vasquez as they say in the papers a confrontation ensued vasquez claims peaty made a move on him he needed to defend himself boom boom boom vasquez went out there armed there is that minor detail he said maybe some lawyer will try to twist it as evidence vasquez was scared of peaty alcohol or dope involved i said vasquez admits to four beers and that fits with the empties in his trash basket with his body weight that might or might not be relevant depends what the bloodwork turns up now lets see if the techies are through with peatys domicile a room and a half bath both tiny and putrid fetid mélange of old cheese charred tobacco body gas garlic oregano an empty greasestained pizza box sat open on the metalframe double bed crumbs dandruffed rumpled sheets the color of wet newsprint and green bedcovers printed with a repeating pattern of top hats and bowlers several large unpleasant stains on the sheets wads of dirty laundry filled most of the floor space a waisthigh stack of old milwaukee sixpacks and the bed filled what was left fingerprint dust everywhere that seemed unnecessary the body had fallen outside but you never knew about lawyers creativity milo kicked his way through the jumble and approached a wooden packing crate that served as a bed stand cluttering the top were oily takeout menus balledup tissues crushed empty beer cans i counted fourteen a gallon bottle of tyger fortified wine twothirds empty an economysized flask of peptobismol the only real furniture other than the bed was a ragged threedrawer dresser that supported a nineteeninch tv and a vcr large enough to be quaint rabbitear antenna i said no cable box and opened a dresser drawer his entertainment needs were simple inside were boxed videotapes stacked like books in a horizontal shelf loud colors lots of xs notso legal temptresses volumes through shower teen upskirt adventures xray journey voyeurs village the bottom two drawers held clothing that looked no fresher than the mess on the floor under a tangle of tshirts milo found an envelope with in cash and a small plastic box marked sewing kit filled with five tightly round joints the half bath was a cubicle in the corner my nose had accommodated to bedroom stench but this was a new challenge the shower was fiberglass barely big enough for a woman let alone a man of peatys bulk originally beige now brown with a blackishgreen crop of something flourishing at the drain a streaked spotted mirror was glued to the wall over the sink no medicine cabinet on the floor next to the cracked grimy toilet was a small wicker box inside was an assortment of antacids and otc analgesics a toothbrush that looked as if it hadnt been used in a while an amber pharmacy bottle containing two vicodin pills the original prescription had been for twentyone tabs prescribed by a doctor at a las vegas clinic seven years ago and filled at the clinics pharmacy saving it for the bad times i said or the good the occasional highball said milo trailerpark style he returned to the bedroom searched under the bed came up dusty and emptyhanded held his hands away from his slacks glanced at the bathroom im not sure using that sink would make me cleanerlets see if theres a hose outdoors before we descended the stairs he took me for a look at the killspot peaty had shed a lot of red the spot where hed fallen was demarcated by black tape a uniform stood outside the vasquez apartment milo saluted her and we found a hose near mrs stadlbrauns apartment she was back inside drapes drawn tight when he finished washing off he said any insights if peatys our bad guy he didnt keep trophies or anything else of interest i said but i was wrong in the rear of the rustspotted red minivan milo found boxes of cleaning supplies tarps brooms mops washcloths buried under the tarps was a brown doubledecker toolbox a keylock dangled from the hasp but it had been left unbolted milo gloved up and opened the box in the top foldaway rack were screwdrivers hammers wrenches pliers little plastic cylinders of screws and nails in the compartments below were a set of burglar picks two rolls of duct tape a box cutter a wire cutter a pushbutton stiletto a spool of thick white nylon rope four sets of womens panty hose a blue steel automatic pistol wrapped in a grubby pink washcloth loaded gun plenty of ammunition left in the box ofcaliber bullets wedged into a corner of the toolbox next to the bullets something else wrapped in terry round firm milo unwrapped it souvenir snow globe the pink plastic base read malibu calif surfs up he upended the sphere white flakes fluttered over a cobalt ocean he examined the underside of the base made in usa new hampshire that explains it sons of bitches wanted to think of us frozen just like them he returned the globe to the box walkietalkied one of the techs at the murder scene lucio drive up a ways theres more while the crime scene crew did their thing with the van milo located the vin number and did a search stolen four years ago in highland park and never recovered the registered owner wendell a chong chong had a home address in south pasadena that milo copied down i said peaty cleans lots of buildings on the east side probably spotted an opportunity a year after he arrived in california and never bothered to tell the boss brad dowds paying for vanpool pickup peaty used the service most of the time meanwhile he had an option equipped with a burglaryrape kit he frowned okay lets boogie it was twelve thirtyfour when i followed him to a cocos at pico and wooster he spent a long time in the mens room came out with hands scrubbed pink and damp hair didnt know they provide showers i said i prayed to the sink he ordered boston cream pie and coffee for both of us i said not hungry good this way i get two without looking like a pig so peatys an extremely bad guy what does the globe mean the globe dylan gave to nora couldve been part of a duo or a collection one got left in dylans car because peaty was bragging the other he kept for masturbatory memories meaning if youre prudential dont write a policy on nora and meserve any guesses where to start looking for their bodies i shook my head the van and the kit say peaty couldve traveled anywhere they also provide a scenario for michaela he targeted her at the playhouse followed her home found out she lived close to him after that it was easy for him to watch her from the van when the time was right he snagged her drove her somewhere secluded and strangled her maybe even in the van he frowned abduction and seclusion sounds like bringing dylan and michaelas hoax to life you think thats what stimulated peaty hed probably been watching michaela for a while but the hoax clinched it and michaela getting kicked out of class meant she spent more evenings at home alone wherever he did her alex he brought her back to the neighborhood whats that staying in his comfort zone or just the opposite i said whoever killed tori giacomo dumped her in griffith park and concealed her body quite efficiently the parks miles from toris apartment in the valley and even farther from peatys its also a brief freeway detour from the valley to pasadena get off the and take the for one exit do your thing get back on dropping her off on the way to work he said same way he stole the van but getting away with tori couldve made him more daring with michaela with everyone thinking he had no wheels he didnt worry about the body being traced back to him so he left her right out in the open the nowheels lie wasnt hard to uncover wanting to brag overrode his caution i said he was no criminal genius like most of them the pie arrived he ate his reached for mine maybe with michaela he was just being lazy seeing as she lived so close to him no reason to roam tori was in north hollywood no sense bringing her home so what about the gaidelases peatys video collection is consistent with his peeping tom arrest goodlooking young women i said its hard to square the gaidelases with that but like i said before he couldve had other kinks the car recovered in camarillo s a tougher fit if he left his van near the murder site and drove the gaidelases rental to the outlets howd he get back to malibu to me thats no problem he hitchhiked stole another set of wheels took a bus or he never drove the rental in the first place all he needed to do was leave it parked on kanan dume windows wide open keys in the ignition open invitation for some joyriding kid joyride to the outlets i said juvenile delinquents looking for bargains why not shoplift some cool nikes and hiphop sweats any way you look at it having mr peaty swept off this mortal coil is no loss true several bites later whats on your mind the scenarios weve constructed depend on planning and patience the way peaty died not backing off from an armed man showed a lack of control he was drunk or vasquez didnt give him a chance to back off vasquez just went out there and shot him it happens it does i said but think about this the gaidelases bodies have never been found and their credit cards were never used plus someone took the trouble to phone utilities in ohio and have their power shut off thats highlevel calculation and discretion peaty was nabbed by a bystander watching college girls while beating off he continued to stare openly at women and gave them the creeps that sound discreet even morons learn alex but lets put the gaidelases aside for a moment are you okay with michaela and tori as peatys handiwork i nodded good because stolen wheels duct tape rope a knife a loaded gun are the kind of evidence i can write up basic gear from your local psycho killer emporium he massaged a temple ate pie drank coffee pushed the empty plate back in front of me and called for a refill the waitress said boy you guys were hungry milo grinned she thought it was sincere and smiled back when she was gone his eyes clouded almost two years passed between tori and michaela the nasty old question resurfaces how many others in between i said peaty tags em at the playhouse no curriculum no attendance roster people drop in and out its a predators dream i thought maybe nora was being evasive when she told me that now with her looking more and more like a victim i believe her we found no additional trophies in peatys apartment or the van so maybe there are no other victims or hes got a storage bin somewhere could be id start with the buildings where peaty did janitorial work grabbing freebie storage he said maybe that explains stashing meserves toyota in brads garage it also fits bigtime hostility toward authority all those properties the dowds own peaty doing the scut be hard for brad to monitor every bit of spaceso what were you calling me about before i told you about peaty not important it was important enough to call i recounted the scene with hauser you and robin yup he worked hard at stoicism guys a shrink sounds like a nut at the very least hes an ugly drunk they arrest him dont know i said they took him away in an ambulance you clocked him good huh i used discretion he squinted turned his hands to blades chopped the air whispered heeyah i thought youd given up on all that black belt stuff never got past brown belt i said its like riding a bike hopefully the fool will wake up with a sore nose and realize the error of his ways want me to get the reports i was hoping any detectives show up just uniforms hendricks and minette heandshe team he phoned pacific division asked to speak to the watch commander explained the situation listened hung up smiling in the official police record you are treated as a victim hauser was booked for creating a disturbance in a public place and released what kind of car does he drive dont waste time cruising by a shrink lets seeim guessing volvo maybe some kind of volkswagen audi quattro right continent he said yeah ill cruise by youre welcome its unlikely hell persist milo when he sobers up hell realize another disturbance will mess him up in civil court if he doesnt his lawyer will educate him if he was that smart alex hed never have stalked you in the first place dont worry about it i said im okay and youve got a full plate interesting he said what is he loosened his belt and suppressed a belch your choice of gastronomic imagery chapter no sign of hausers audi when i got home at two am the bed was made up and robin was gone i called her six hours later i heard you leave she said went outside but you were driving away what kind of ugly are we talking about you dont want to know i do the new me the old you was fine the ostrichs head has been lifted what happened alex someone got shot an extremely bad guy you couldve stayed i got antsy she said its a big house dont i know it last night was good alex except for the chopsocky interlude are you worried hausers going to cause more trouble maybe hes smarter when hes sober the police wrote it up in my favor about what i asked you have a change of heart of course not it wasnt just the moment alex maybe it had been no couple of beats would you be upset if i said i needed some time to think its a big step i said it is which is kind of strange given how much of our lives weve shared i didnt answer she said i wont take too long i left a message with erica weisss secretary saying i wanted to talk about patrick hauser just as i hung up milo clicked in he sounded exhausted probably up all night on peaty maybe thats why he didnt bother with niceties wendell a chong the guy whose van peaty ripped off is a software consultant who used to rent office space in a building owned by the dowds the van was boosted from his reserved tenant slot at night while chong was working late chong collected insurance bought himself a new car has no interest in reclaiming it peaty watched and seized the opportunity i said chong have any impressions of peaty never saw him who he does remember is billy dowd hed always wondered if billy had something to do with the theft why because billy used to hang around aimlessly when brad came by to collect rent one time he drifted into chongs office and just stood there like he owned the place chong asked him what he wanted billy got a spacedout look in his eyes and left without a word chong followed billy out into the hall saw him walking up and down like he was patrolling a couple of women stepped out of an office and billy checked them out pretty intensely according to chong then brad showed up ushered billy away but he kept bringing billy along so chong started locking his door interesting huh billy and peaty i said weirdos finding common ground it happens right brad protects billy but he cant be everywhere and like you said he overestimates his power maybe he takes billy along with him when he checks out the garage at the playhouse or the playhouse itself i dont see billy getting laid on his own billy seemed gentle maybe he is he said except when hes not in any event i just got permission from vasquezs dpd to interview his client on my way over to the jail im betting on a quick plea maybe involuntary manslaughter kinda nice to have one that closes easy you could name peaty as the bad guy on michaela and close that i said yet i wonder aloud about billy he said why because im a selfdestructive fool no sleep in two days im vulnerable amigo tell me to forget about billy and i will two bad guys could explain how the gaidelases car ended up twentyfive miles from kanan dume billy doesnt seem streetsmart but peaty couldve helped him there still its hard to imagine him getting away for any length of time he and brad seem to be together most of the day and at night theres a neighbor watching him the nice lady wonder how hard she looks i was supposed to check that out but with all thats happeneddo you think its interesting that the bad stuff we know about started after billy got his own place if the bad stuff was the product of a sick relationship i said with peaty gone billy might not act out again theres comfort for you i can drop by and talk to the neighbor that would be great im tied up with vasquez all day he read off billys address on reeves drive any more problems from that asshole hauser not a one good im still wondering about something i said am i going to want to hear this dylan meserve picked latigo for the hoax because he hiked up there what led the gaidelases to the same spot aha he said already been there and back maybe peaty overheard dylan talking about hiking up there while the gaidelases were waiting for their audition they mentioned wanting to hike and peaty overheard again and gave them advice thats a lot of overhearing hes a watcher okay i said youre not buying it what we know about meserve suggests lack of conscience or at the least a weak one michaelas description of his behavior those nights bothers me mind games preoccupation with death rough sex i hate to add to your burden but its not my burden the gaidelases were never my case a casual acquaintance mightve bought that he said peaty for the girls meserve for the gaidelases what that damned school was a magnet for homicidal maniacs something went on there he laughed not a pleasant sound chapter erica weiss phoned back while i was in the shower i dried off and reached her at her office what an experience doctor you okay like many referrals she was just a phone voice to me fasttalking highenergy peppy as a cheerleader im fine any word on hauser havent checked yet what exactly transpired when i finished the retell she was peppier his malpractice carrier will be thrilled to learn the ante just got upped idiot just cooked his goose welldone when can i depose you everythings in the police report i said even so whens convenient for you never how about tomorrow i was thinking more like today its short notice those poor women could use their settlements doctor try me late in the afternoon youre a doll she said ill come to you with the court reporter just name the place lets talk later commitmentshy sure whatever works but please make it sooner rather than later billy dowds address was on the south side of beverly hills a short walk to roxbury park last year id witnessed a shootout at the park that had never made the papers this was beverly hills with its aura of safety and ninetysecond police response lots of spanishstyle duplexes from the twenties on the block billys was pink with leaded windows a redclay roof and exuberant plaster moldings an unfenced gateway led to a tileinlaid stairway that climbed to the second floor the overhang created a shaded entry nook for the groundfloor unit the wroughtiron mailbox inside the lefthand gatepost was unmarked i climbed to the upstairs unit and knocked on a heavy carved door the peepwindow was blocked by a wooden slat but it stayed closed as the door opened a brunette in a white nylon uniform dress looked at me while combing her hair coarse hair chopped boyish meant short brisk strokes she was fortyish with a dangerous tan a beakish nose and closeset black eyes santa monica hospital name tag above her left breast a holzer rn a strange man showing up unannounced didnt perturb her can i help you some kind of teutonic accent billy dowd lives downstairs yes but hes not here i showed her my police consultant id expired six months ago very few people are detailoriented a holzer barely glanced at it police about billy one of billy and his brothers employees was involved in some trouble oh you wish to speak to billy about that actually im here to see you me why you look after billy look after she laughed hes a grown man physically he is i said the hand around the hairbrush turned glossy i dont understand why you are asking these questions billy is all right hes fine these are routine questions sounds as if you like him of course i do billy is very nice she said listen i am very tired got off shift early this morning i would like to sleep eleventoseven shift your usual yes thats why i would like to sleep new smile frosty sounds like you deserve it what unit do you work on cardiac care eight hours of ccu care then all the time you spend with billy its not billy doesnt require why is this important she placed a hand on the door it probably isnt i said but when something really bad happens lots of questions need to be asked about everyone who knew the victim there was a victim someone was hurt someone was murdered her hand flew to her mouth gott en himmel who a man named reynold peaty head shake i dont know this person he did janitorial work at some of brad and billys buildings i described peaty when i got to the muttonchops she said oh him youve met him not a meeting just seeing he came here i said she plucked at her badge gave her hair a few more whacks ms holzer annalise holzer lower voice soft guarded i half expected a rank and serial number i said reynold peaty came to see billy no no not to see to bring things back things things billy forgets at the office sometimes mr dowd brings them himself sometimes i guess he sends this man reynold peaty billy didnt kill him that is for sure billy opens the windows to let flies out so he doesnt have to hit them gentle gentle annalise holzer agreed like a nice little boy but forgetful i said everyone forgets what does billy forget the watch the wallet lots of times the wallet mr peaty came by and gave you the wallet no she said he tells me billy lost the wallet and he is returning the wallet how many times did that happen a few she said i do not count lots of times the wallet i raised an eyebrow annalise holzer said a few times thats all those times did mr peaty go inside billys apartment i dont know you watch him nein she said not watching not babysitting mr dowd asks me to help if billy needs something sounds like a good job shrug good salary no money only less rent mr dowds your landlord very nice landlord some of them are likesnakes milo hadnt mentioned any beverly hills properties in the dowds holdings i said so you get a discount on the rent in return for looking in on billy yes exactly what does that involve day to day being here said annalise holzer if he needs something how does billy get around get around go from place to place he doesnt drive he does not go out much said annalise holzer sometimes i take him to a movie on sunday century city i drop him off pick him up mostly i rent him dvds from the video store on olympic near almont drive billy has a big flatscreen tv better than a movie theater no anyone else ever drive him mr dowd picks him up in the morning and brings him home every day they work wide circuit from santa monica canyon to beverly hills and back to the beach city brads unpaid job is there anyone else what do you mean taxi car service never do i see that so billy doesnt go out much never by himself said annalise holzer never do i see him go out even to walk i like to walk when i ask him does he want to walk with me he tells me annalise i did not like gym in school im a big couch potato she smiled i joke with him that he is lazy he laughs does he have any friends no but he is very friendly a homebody i said the word puzzled her he comes home and stays here yes yes exactly watching the flat screen dvds eating i cook sometimes he likes some thingssauerbraten special veal meat spaetzle it is a kind of noodle i cook for two bring it downstairs she looked over her shoulder the room behind her was tidy and bright white porcelain figurines crowded the ledge of an arched tiled mantel in the current market the rent would be three four thousand a month steep on a nurses pay you live alone ms holzer yes youre from germany lichtenstein she pinched thumb to forefinger it is a teeny tiny little country between austria and switzerland i said you know lichtenstein ive heard its pretty banking castles alps it is pretty yes she agreed but i like it here better la s more exciting more to do the music the horses the beach you ride anything with sunshine she said working nights and sleeping days and doing things for billy work is good sometimes i do a double shift what are billys needs i said very easy if he wants takeout and it is a long time for the restaurant to deliver i get him his dinner there is domino pizza on doheny near olympic billy likes thai food theres a nice place on la cienega and olympic sushi is also on olympic nice place near doheny very convenient being near olympic billys a gourmet billy eats anything said annalise holzer you must really think of him as a boy a good boy when i was back on olympic i celled milo expecting voice mail because he was with armando vasquez canceled he said vasquezs dpd had other plans but didnt bother to tell me the prelim on michaelas autopsy finally came in i woulda been there but they did it earlier than scheduled bottom line is no sign of sexual assault cause of death was strangulation the stab wounds on her chest were relatively superficial the neck wound was a puncture pathologist cant say what caused it get to billys place yet just finished with that and youre going to feel smart the woman upstairs is a nurse on the night shift at santa monica hospital meaning shes gone by ten fifteen or so plus she thinks la s an exciting city likes art the beach riding horses her tan says shes out plenty during the day not much supervision on top of that peaty came to billys apartment several times claimed he was sent by brad to return things billy left at the office brad told us he thought peaty wasnt licensed to drive unless he lied about that peaty misrepresented his presence how many times is several the woman couldnt quantify or wouldnt she said billy lost his wallet a lot then she backtracked to a few whats her name annalise holzer shes one of those people who gives you lots of details and ends up not telling you much she considers billy childlike gracious absolutely no problem some of that could be the rentbreak brad gives her the buildings another dowd property that so not on the bnb list maybe the dowds have another corporation or a holding company that doesnt trace back to their names all that real estate he said these people have got to be hugely rich and rich people get protected holzer was protective all right but i wouldnt trust her to know the details of billys life meaning peaty coulda been a regular at darling billys ive got to take a serious look at the guy after i speak to vasquezs wife thats the change in plans all of a sudden i cant have access to armando until i talk to the missus about what pds being cryptic itll probably turn out to be a stupid lawyer trick but the da insists i check it out das office has their own investigators whom they pay thats why im figuring it for scut palmed off on me where are you meeting the wife right here in my office half an hour im twenty minutes away good chapter jacalyn vasquez minus three kids and makeup and jewelry looked even younger than when id seen her on sunday streaked hair was tied back in a somber ponytail she wore a loose white blouse blue jeans and sneakers florid acne played havoc with her forehead and cheeks her eyes had regressed into sooty sockets a tall honeyhaired woman in her twenties held vasquezs arm the blondes locks were long and silky she wore a tight black suit that showcased a bikini figure a ruby stud in her left nostril fought the suits conservative cut the pretty hair and tight body sparred with a monkeyish face the camera would savage she surveyed the tiny space and frowned howre we all going to fit in here milo smiled and you are brittany chamfer public defenders office i thought mr vasquezs attorney was kevin shuldiner im a thirdyear law student said brittany chamfer working with the exoneration project she amplified her frown this is like a closet well said milo one less body should help enjoy the fresh air ms chamfer come on in ms vasquez my instruction was to stay with jackie my instruction is that you enjoy the fresh air he stood and the chair squeaked silencing it with one hand he offered the seat to jacalyn vasquez right here maam brittany chamfer said im supposed to stay youre not an attorney and ms vasquez hasnt been charged with anything still milo took one big step that brought him to the doorway brittany chamfer had to step back to avoid collision and the arm shed used to support jacalyn vasquez pulled free vasquez looked past me the office couldve been miles of glacier brittany chamfer said ill have to call the office milo ushered vasquez in closed the door by the time she sat down jacalyn vasquez was crying milo gave her a tissue when her eyes dried he said you have something to tell me ms vasquez uhhuh what is it maam armando was protecting us protecting the family uhhuh from him mr peaty the pervert you knew mr peaty to be a pervert nod how did you know that everyone said everyone in the building yeah like mrs stadlbraun yeah who else everyone can you give me some names eyes down everyone did mr peaty ever do anything perverted that you know about personally he looked at jacalyn vasquez poked her left breast milo said he looked at you a lot he ever touch you head shake his looks made you feel uncomfortable yeah you tell armando uhuh why not i didnt want to make him mad armando has a temper silence so peaty looked at you said milo you figure that made it okay for armando to shoot him also the calls thats what im here to tell you milo s eyes narrowed what calls maam the night calling hanging up calling hanging up i figured it was him peaty yeah because he was a pervert her eyes dipped again you figured it was mr peaty harassing you said milo yeah had he done that before hesitation ms vasquez uhuh he hadnt done it before but you suspected it was him did mr shuldiner come up with that it coulda been him milo said any other reason the calls bothered you they kept hanging up they said milo stretching the word vasquez looked up confused milo said maybe you were worried about a they jackie huh armandos old homeboys armando dont have no homeboys he used to jackie silence everyone knows he used to run with the s jackie vasquez sniffed everyone knows milo repeated that was like a long time ago said vasquez armando dont bang no more whos they the calls there was a bunch any other calls last night my mother what time like six jacalyn vasquez sat up straighter the other one wasnt no homeboys what other one after the ones that hung up someone talked like a whisper you know a whisper yeah whatd they whisper about him they said he was dangerous liked to hurt women someone whispered that about peaty yeah you heard this they talked to armando what time did this whispering call come in jackie likewe were in bed with the tv armando answered and he was pissed off cause a the other calls hanging up hes like started yelling into the phone and then hes like stopped listened i said what he waved his hand like you know he listened and his face got all red that was the last time armando got mad real mad cause of the whispering uhhuh did armando tell you about the whispering after he hung up jacalyn vasquez shook her head later when later last night calling from jail yeah you never heard the whispering and armando didnt tell you about it at the time then after armando shot peaty he decided to tell you i aint lyin i can understand your wanting to protect your husband i aint lyin lets say someone did whisper said milo you figure that made it okay to shoot peaty yeah whys that jackie he was dangerous according to the whisperer i aint lyin maybe armando is armando aint lyin did armando say if this whisperer was a man or a woman armando said the whispering made so you couldnt tell pretty good whispering i aint lyin jacalyn vasquez folded her arms across her bosom and stared at milo you know jackie that any calls to your apartment can be verified huh we can check your phone records fine she said the problem is said milo all we can know is that someone called you at a certain time we cant verify what was said it happened according to armando armando aint lyin all those hangups said milo then all of a sudden someones whispering about peaty and armandos listening jacalyn vasquezs hands still crossed climbed to her face and pushed against her cheeks her features turned rubbery when she spoke through compressed lips the words came out slurred like a kid goofing it happened armando told me it happened brittany chamfer was waiting in the hall playing with her nose stud she whipped around saw jacalyn vasquez dabbing her eyes you okay jackie he don believe me chamfer said what milo said thanks for coming in chamfer said were looking for the truth common goal chamfer considered her response what message should i give to mr shuldiner thank him for his civic duty pardon thank him for creativity too brittany chamfer said im not going to tell him that have a nice day i will chamfer flipped her long hair will you renewing her grip she propelled jacalyn vasquez up the corridor milo said thats why the das office palmed it on me what a crock youre dismissing it out of hand i said youre not if vasquezs lying to exonerate himself he couldve picked something stronger like peaty threatening him explicitly so hes stupid maybe thats it i said he leaned against the wall scuffed the baseboard even if someone did call vasquez to prime the pump against peaty the right suspects in jail lets say ertha stadlbraun got things stoked up because peaty had always creeped her out my interview tipped her over and she stirred up the tenants one of them was an incompletely reformed banger with a bad temper and boom boom boom if youre comfortable not checking it out so am i he turned his back on me imbedded both hands in his hair and turned it into a fright wig smoothing it down was a partial success he stomped back into his office when i entered he had the phone receiver in hand but wasnt punching numbers know what kept me up last night damned snow globe brad thought meserve put it there but the one in the van says peaty did would peaty taunt brad maybe peaty didnt leave it what meserve thinks hes an actor i said actors do voiceovers the infernal whisperer i cant get distracted by that kind of crap alex still have to check out all those buildings peaty cleaned stuff could be hidden anywhere cant ignore billy either because he hung with peaty and i was masochistic enough to find out he passed the receiver from hand to hand what id love to do is get to billy in his apartment away from brad and gauge his reaction to peatys death he huffed lets take care of this whispering bullshit he called the phone company talked to someone named larry what i need is for you to tell me its crap so i can avoid the whole subpoena thing thanks yeahyou too ill hold moments later his faced flushed and he was scribbling furiously in his pad okay lorenzo thanko muchono i mean itwell forget this conversation took place and ill get you the damned paper asap the receiver slammed down he ripped a page out of the pad and shoved it at me the first evening call to the vasquez apartment had come in at five fiftytwo pm and lasted thirtytwo minutes the callers midcity number was registered to guadalupe maldonado the call from jackie vasquezs mom at like six milo closed his eyes and pretended to doze as i read on five more calls between seven and ten pm all from a area code that milo had notated as stolen cell the first lasted eight seconds the second four then a trio of twosecond entries that had to be hangups armando vasquez losing patience and slamming down the phone i said stolen from who dont know yet but it happened the same day the call came in keep going under the five calls was the doodle of an amoebic blob filled with crosses then something milo had underlined so hard hed torn paper final call pm fortytwo seconds long despite vasquezs anger something had managed to hold his interest different caller area code milo reached over and took the page shredded it meticulously and dropped it in his trash basket you have never seen that you will see it once the goddamn subpoena that is now goddamn necessary produces legit evidence ventura county i said maybe camarillo not maybe for sure my man lawrence says a pay phone in camarillo near the outlets he wasnt able to be that precise but well find out now ive got a possible link to the gaidelases which should make you happy all along you never saw peaty for them so whatre we talking about an based killer who prowls the coast and ive gotta start from scratch only if the gaidelases are victims i said as opposed to the sheriffs thought the facts pointed to a willful disappearance and maybe they were right armando told his wife the whispering made it impossible to identify the sex of the caller if its amateur theater were talking about cathy gaidelas could be a candidate his jaws bunched he scooted forward on his chair inches from my face i thanked god we were friends all of a sudden the gaidelases have gone from victims to psycho murderers it solves several problems i said no bodies recovered and the rental car was left in camarillo because the gaidelases ditched it just as the company assumed who better to cancel credit cards than the legitimate owners and to know which utilities to call back in ohio nice couple hiding out in ventura county and venturing into la to commit nasty for starts why would they homebase out there proximity to the ocean and you dont have to be a millionaire there are still places in oxnard with lowrent housing he yanked his forelock up and stretched his brow tight where the hell did all this come from alex my twisted mind i said but think about it the only reason weve considered the gaidelases a nice couple is because cathys sister described them that way but susan palmer also talked about an antisocial side drug use years of mooching off the family cathy married a man people suspect is gay theres some complexity there what im hearing is minor league complexity whats their motive for turning homicidal how about extreme frustration coming to a head were talking two middleaged people whove never achieved much on their own they make the big move to la delusional like thousands of other wannabes their age and looks make it even chancier but they take a methodical approach acting lessons maybe they were rejected by other coaches and nora was their last chance what if she turned them away in lessthandiplomatic terms charlie manson didnt take well to hearing he wasnt going to be a rock star this is about revenge on nora he said revenge on her and the symbols of youth and beauty she surrounded herself with tori giacomo got killed before the gaidelases disappeared that wouldnt have stopped the gaidelases from having contact with her if not at the playhouse at work maybe she served them a lobster dinner and thats how they learned about the playhouse they do tori then wait nearly two years to do michaela thats a dish gone way cold alex thats assuming no other students at the playhouse have gone missing he sighed i said the hoax couldve served as some kind of catalyst noras name in the paper michaelas and dylans too not to mention latigo canyon i could be totally off base but i dont think the link can be overlooked and neither can armando vasquezs story he stood stretched sat back down buried his face in his hands for a while and looked up blearyeyed creative alex fanciful inventive impressively outside the goddamn box the problem it doesnt solve is peaty a definite bad guy with access to all of the victims and a rape kit in his van if the gaidelases were chasing stardom why would they have anything to do with a loser like him let alone set him up to be shot and how the hell would they know to prime the pump by phoning vasquez i thought about that its possible the gaidelases met peaty at the playhouse and some bonding took place outsiders commiserating thats a helluva lot going on during a failed audition assuming the gaidelases were ever at the playhouse maybe nora kept them waiting for a long time then dismissed them unceremoniously if they did bond with peaty they couldve had opportunity to visit his apartment and pick up on tension in the building or peaty talked about his dislike for vasquez ertha stadlbraun said peaty never had visitors ertha stadlbraun goes to sleep by eleven i said be interesting to know if anyone at the apartment recognizes the gaidelases photos he stared at me peaty andy and cathy and lets toss in billy dowd because were feeling generous what some kind of misfit club look at all those schoolyard shootings committed by outsiders oh lord he said before i get sucked into this vortex of fantasy i need to do some boring old police work as in pinpointing the phone booth and trying to pull some prints as in keep searching for any troves peaty mightve stashed god knows where as inlets not shmooze any more okay my heads splitting like a luau coconut yanking his tie loose he hauled himself up crossed the tiny office and threw back the door it hit the wall chunked out a disk of plaster bounced a couple of times my ears were still ringing when he stuck his head in seconds later where can i find one of those aminoacid concoctions that makes you smarter they dont work i said thanks for your input chapter the brazilian rosewood door of erica weisss law firm shouldve been used for guitar backs twentysix partners were listed in efficient pewter weisss was near the top she kept me waiting for twenty minutes but came out to greet me personally late thirties silverhaired blueeyed statuesque in charcoal armani and coral jewelry sorry for the delay doctor i was willing to come to you no problem coffee black would be fine cookies one of our paras whipped up some chocolate chips this morning cliffs a great baker no thanks coming up with black coffee she crossed a field of soft navy carpet to an entry square of hardwood her exit was a castanet solo of stiletto heels her lair was a bright cool corner space on the eighth floor of a highrise on wilshire just east of rossmore in hancock park gray felt walls macassar ebony deco revival furniture chrome and black leather chair that matched the finish of her computer monitor stanford law degree tucked in a corner where it was sure to be noticed a coffinshaped rosewood conference table had been set up with four black club chairs on wheels i took the head seat maybe it was meant for erica weiss she could always tell me that an eastern wall of glass showcased a view of koreatown and the distant gloss of downtown to the west out of sight was nora dowds house on mccadden weiss returned with a blue mug bearing the law firms name and logo in gold leaf the icon was a helmet over a wreath filled with latin script something to do with honor and loyalty the coffee was strong and bitter she looked at the head chair for a second settled to my right with no comment a filipina carrying a courtreporters stenotype machine entered followed by a young spikehaired man in a loosefitting green suit who weiss introduced as cliff hell be witnessing your oath ready doctor sure she put on reading glasses and read a file while i sipped coffee then off came the specs her face got tight and the blue in her eyes turned to steel first of all she said and the change in her voice made me put my cup down she concentrated on the top of my head as if something odd had sprouted there pointing a finger she turned doctor into something unsavory for the next half hour i fielded questions all delivered in a strident rhythm dripping with insinuation scores of questions many taking patrick hausers point of view no letup erica weiss seemed to be able to speak without breathing just as suddenly she said finished big smile sorry if i was a little curt doctor but i consider depositions rehearsals and i like my witnesses prepared for court you think itll come to that id bet against it but i dont bet anymore she peeled back a cuff and studied a sapphireringed lady rolex in

next to the car their backs to me brad wore a light brown linen suit and gestured with his right hand his left arm rested on billys shoulder billy wore the same blue shirt and baggy dockers half a foot shorter than his brother but for his gray hair the two of them couldve passed for father and son dad talking son listening the sound of my engine cutting made brad look over his shoulder a second later billy aped him by the time i got out both brothers were facing me the polo shirt under brads jacket was aquamarine pique on his feet were perforated peanutbuttercolored italian sandals cloudy day but hed dressed for a beachside power lunch his white hair was ragged and he looked tense billys face was blank a grease stain rorschached the front of his pants he greeted me first hi detective hows it going billy bad noras nowhere and were scared brad said more worried than scared bill you said remember the brochures bill what did i tell you be positive said billy exactly i said brochures billy pointed at the house brad went in there again brad said first time was superficial this time i opened some drawers found travel brochures in my sisters nightstand nothing seems out of place except maybe some extra space in her clothes closet packed to go i said i hope thats it what kind of brochures i said places in latin america want to see them please he jogged to the caddy and brought back a stack of glossies pelicans pouch southwater caye belize turneffe island belize posada la mandragora buzios brazil hotel monasterio cusco peru tapir lodge ecuador looks like vacation plans i said still youd think shed tell us said brad i was going to call you to see if you found any flights she took noras passport hadnt been used i said nothing so far but still checking does nora ever fly privately no why covering all bases weve talked about doing that said brad mostly ive talked about it being so close to santa monica airport you see those beauties take off and it looks real inviting same thing milo had said for the dowds it could be more than fantasy i said what did nora think she was ready to do a time share but once i found out the cost i said forget it the cool thing would be owning my own plane but that was never an option how come were not close to that financial league detective did nora agree with that assessment brad smiled nora isnt much for budgeting would she charter something on her own i suppose its possible but shed have to get the money from me she doesnt have her own funds she has a checking account for day to day but for serious money she comes to me it works out better for all of us billys eyes rose to the sky i never get to go anywhere come on bill said brad we flew to san francisco that was a long time ago it was two years ago thats a long time billys eyes got dreamy one hand dropped toward his crotch brad cleared his throat and billy jammed the hand in his pocket i turned back to brad its not in character for nora to take off without telling you nora does her own thing on a limited level but shes never traveled for any length of time without letting me know those trips to paris exactly brad glanced at the brochures i was going to contact those resorts but if you want to do it you can keep the information will do he rubbed the corner of one eye maybe nora will waltz in tomorrow with a i was going to say with a terrific tan but nora doesnt like the sun i waved the brochures these are all sunny spots brad glanced at billy billys eyes were still aimed at the sky im sure theres a logical explanation detective just wish ianyway thanks for stopping by if you learn anything please let me know theres something you should know i said reynold peaty was murdered last night brad gasped what thats crazy billy froze stayed that way but his eyes locked into mine nothing absent about his gaze now brad said billy bill continued to stare at me pointed a finger you just said something terrible im sorry reyn got murdered billys hands balled no way brad touched his arm but billy shook him off and ran to the center of noras lawn where he began punching his thighs brad hurried over talked in his brothers ear billy shook his head violently and walked several feet away brad followed talking nonstop billy stepped away again brad persisted through a series of billys head shakes and grimaces finally billy allowed himself to be ushered back flared nostrils doubled the width of his pug nose thick white spittle flecked his lips who killed reyn he demanded a neighbor i said they had an argument and a neighbor said brad one of our tenants who a man named armando vasquez that one shit right from the getgo i had a bad feeling about him but his application was in order and nowadays you cant turn down a tenant based on intuition he tugged at a lapel jesus what happened what worried you about vasquez he seemed likeyou know the cholo thing where is he brad said billy i wanna kill him back shh an argument howd it get from talking to murdering hard to say christ said brad talking about what billys eyes were slits wheres the lowlife in jail said brad to me right hes in custody for how long said billy a long time i said tell me when he gets out so i can shoot his ass brad said billy stop billy glared breathed heavily brad tried to touch him again billy shook him off ill stop now fine okay but when he gets out ill shoot a bullet up his ass he punched air billy thats reyn was my friend bill he wasnt a real okay okay whatever bill im sorry he was your friend you have every right to be upset im not upset im pissed fine be pissed back to me an argument jesus i was going to go by that building today or tomorrow why brad cocked a head toward his brother billy was studying the grass making the circuit about to fire and evict peaty billy punched his palm reyn was my friend now hes dead thats fucked up i said what did you and reyn do together billy brad tried to step between billy and me but billy twisted around him reyn was polite to me brad said billy reyn had some problems remember i told you about them driving too fast so what you do that brad billy brad smiled and shrugged billy cocked his head at the cadillac not in the the s too fucking slow thats what you always say too fucking slow to move its big old fucking ass you drive fast in the sting ray and the porsche and the austin fine brad snapped he smiled again the detective gets it bill you say the rays as fast as that girl in your classwhat was her name er er er jocelynthe sting rays as fast as jocelynjocelynoldersonoldensonand just as expensive you always say that the sting thats a joke bill im not laughing said billy to me reyn drove too fast a long time ago and got in trouble does that mean he has to get his ass killed brad said no ones saying that billy im asking him brad it doesnt mean that i said it fucking pisses me off billy broke free again headed for the driveway climbing over the caddys passenger door with some effort he sank down arms folded and stared straight ahead brad said climbing in like that he knows thats against the he must really be upset though for the life of me i cant tell you why he considers peaty his friend he lowered his voice wishful thinking what do you mean my brother has no peer group when i first hired peaty i noticed him staring at billy like billy was some kind of freak i told him to stop doing that and he did and after that he was friendly to billy i figured he was kissing up to me anyway thats probably what billys responding to anyone who treats him like half a man is his buddy after you guys dropped in at the office he told me you were his buddies over in the cadillac billy started rocking i said hes pretty upset for having no relationship at all with peaty my brother has trouble with change learning someone you know has been murdered is serious change yes of course im not minimizing it all im saying is its harder for billy to process that kind of thing he shook his head shot to death over a stupid argument now that billys not listening can you tell me what really happened same answer i said i wasnt protecting billy oh okay sorry look id better go calm him down so if youre sure billy and peaty didnt associate im positive peaty was a janitor for gods sake i said hes been to billys apartment brads lower lip dropped what are you talking about i repeated what annalise holzer had told me lost articles he said that makes no sense at all is billy absentminded yes but we were wondering if peaty stopped by at your instruction my instruction ridiculous as far as i knew he didnt drive remember brad wiped his brow annalise said that is she reliable god i sure hope so he scratched his head if she said peaty dropped by i guess he did but ive got to tell you im astonished that peaty and billy would associate we dont know they associated just that peaty dropped things off yes billys absentminded but usually he tells me when hes left something and i tell him dont worry well get it tomorrow if peaty did drop something off im sure thats where it ended he looked over at billy rocking harder first nora taking off and now this i said theyre adults chronologically must be hard being the protector mostly its no big deal sometimes its a challenge this is one of those sometimes this is a real big sometime at some point i said wed like to talk to billy about peaty why peatys dead and you know who shot him just to be thorough what does it have to do with billy probably nothing is peaty still a suspect for that girls murder still all those questions you asked about him when you came to my house it was pretty obvious what you were getting at do you really think peaty couldve done something like that its an open investigation i said meaning you wont say look i appreciate what you guys do but i cant just let you browbeat billy browbeatings not on the agenda mr dowd just a few questions believe me detective he has nothing to tell you youre sure about that of course i am i cant allow my brother to be drawn into anything sordid because hes chronologically an adult but exactly he doesnt seem retarded i said i told you he isnt said brad what he is no ones ever been sure nowadays hed probably be called some kind of autistic back when we were kids he was just different mustve been tough whatever his eyes shifted sideways toward the cadillac billy rested his head down on the dashboard there isnt a mean bone in his body detective but that didnt stop other kids from tormenting him im younger but i always felt like the older brother thats the way its remained and im going to have to ask you to respect our privacy maybe it would be good for billy to talk i said why he seemed pretty traumatized by the news sometimes getting it out helps now you sound like a shrink said brad new edge in his voice youve got experience with shrinks back when we were kids billy got taken to all kinds of quacks vitamin quacks hypnosis quacks exercise quacks psychiatric quacks no one did a damn thing for him so lets all just stick to what we know best you chase bad guys and ill take care of my brother i walked over to the caddy brads protests at my back billy sat up rigid his eyes were shut and his hands clawed the placket of his shirt nice seeing you again billy it wasnt nice this is a bad news day brad got in the drivers seat started up the engine real bad news i said billy nodded real real real bad brad turned the ignition key im backing out detective i waited until theyd been gone for five minutes then walked up to nora dowds door and knocked got the silence id expected empty mailbox brother brad had collected noras correspondence cleaning up everyones mess as usual he claimed billy was harmless but his opinion was worthless i got back in the seville and drove away passing albert beamishs house the old mans curtains were drawn but he opened his door red shirt green pants drink in hand i stopped and lowered the car window hows it going beamish started to say something shook his head in disgust went back inside chapter billy had been attached to peaty and billy had a temper was he too dull to realize the implication of a relationship with reynold peaty or was there no implication one thing was likely the janitors visits had been more than dropping off lost articles as i drove sixth street toward its terminus at san vicente i considered billys reaction shock anger desire for vengeance another sib defying brad a childs impulsiveness together with a grown mans hormones could be a dangerous combination as milo had pointed out billy had begun living on his own right around the time of tori giacomos murder and the gaidelases disappearance perfect opportunity for billy and peaty to take their friendship to a new level if the two of them had become a murder team peaty was certain to have been the dominant one some leadership an outwardly creepy alcoholic voyeur and a dullard manboy didnt add up to the kind of planning and care that had stripped michaelas dumpsite of forensic detail concealed tori giacomos body long enough to reduce it to scattered bones then there was the matter of the whispering phone call from ventura county no way billy couldve pulled that off iagoprompt courtesy of the phone lines it had worked id hypothesized about a cruel side to the gaidelases but there was another pair of performance buffs worth considering nora dowd was an eccentric dilettante and a failure as an actress but shed been skillful enough to fool her brother about breaking off with dylan meserve toss in a young lover with a penchant for rough sex and mind games and it cooked up interesting maybe brad had found no sign of struggle in noras house because thered been none travel brochures in a nightstand drawer and missing clothes plus dylan meserves skip on his rent weeks ago said a longplanned trip albert beamish hadnt seen anyone living with nora but someone entering and exiting the house after dark would have escaped his notice a woman who thought private flying was a nifty idea her passport hadnt been used recently and meserve had never applied for one but hed grown up on the streets of new york couldve known how to obtain fake paper getting through passport control at lax might be a challenge but jetting from santa monica to a landing strip in some southoftheborder village with payoff cash would be another story brochures in a drawer no real attempt to conceal because nora was confident no one would broach her privacy when i stopped for a red light at melrose i took a closer look at the resorts shed researched pretty places in south america maybe for more than the climate i drove home as fast as sunset would allow barely took the time to look for hausers brown audi moments after logging on to the internet i learned that belize brazil and ecuador all had extradition treaties with the us and that nearly all the countries without treaties were in africa and asia hiding out in rwanda burkina faso or uganda wouldnt be much fun and i couldnt see nora taking well to the feminine couture of saudi arabia i studied the brochures again each resort was in a remote jungle area to be extradited you had to be found i pictured the scene maydecember couple checks into a luxury suite enjoys the beach the bar the pool nighttimes the right time for al fresco candlelight dinners maybe a couples massage long hot incandescent days allow plenty of time to search for a leafy suburb hospitable to affluent foreigners nazi war criminals had hidden for decades in latin america living like nobility why not a couple of lowprofile thrill killers still if nora and dylan had escaped for the long run why leave brochures anywhere to be discovered unless the packets were a misdirect i looked up jet leasing air charter and timeshare companies in southern california compiled a surprisingly long list spent the next two hours claiming to be bradley dowd experiencing a family emergency and in dire need of finding his sister and his nephew dylan lots of turndowns and the few outfits who checked their passenger logs had no listing of nora or meserve which proved nothing if the couple had assumed new identities for milo to get subpoenas of the records hed need evidence of criminal behavior and all dowd and meserve had done was disappear unless dylans misdemeanor conviction could be used against him milo would be tied up right now with boring police stuff i called him anyway and described billy dowds behavior he said interesting just got michaelas full autopsy results also interesting we met at nine pm at a pizza joint on colorado boulevard in the heart of pasadena s old town hipsters and young business types feasted on thin crust and pitchers of beer milo had been scoping out bnb buildings in the eastern suburbs for evidence of peatys unofficial storage asked if i could meet him when i left the house at eight fifteen the phone rang but i ignored it when i arrived he was at a front booth apart from the action working on an eighteeninch disk crusted with unidentifiable foodstuffs his own pitcher half full and frosted hed doodled a happy face on the glass the features had melted to something morose and psychiatrically promising before i could sit he hoisted his battered attaché case took out a coroners file and placed it across his lap when youre ready dont ruin your dinner munch munch i ate already not very social of you he massaged the pitcher erased the face wanna glass i said no thanks but he went and got one anyway left the file on his chair at the front were routine forms signed by deputy coroner ac yee md in the photos what had once been michaela brand was a departmentstore manikin taken apart in stages see enough autopsy shots and you learn to reduce the human body to its components try to forget its ever been divine think too much and you never sleep milo returned and poured me a beer she died of strangulation and all the cuts were postmortem whats interesting are numbers six and twelve six was a closeup of the right side of the neck the wound was an inch or so long slightly puffed at the center as if something had been inserted in the slot and left there long enough to create a small pouch the coroner had circled the lesion and written a reference number above the ruler segment used for scale i paged to the summary found the notation postmortem incision superior border of the sternoclavicular notch evidence of tissuespreading and surface exploration of the right jugular vein twelve was a front view of a smooth fullbreasted female chest michaelas implants spread as if deflated dr yee had pointed to the spots where theyd been stitched up and noted good healing in the smooth plain between the mounds were five small wounds no pouching yees measurements made them shallow a couple were barely beneath the skin i returned to the description of the neck lesion surface exploration playing around with the vein maybe a special type of play said milo yee wouldnt put it in writing but he said the cut reminded him of what an embalmer might do at the start of a body prep the location was exactly what youd choose if you wanted to expose the jugular and the carotid artery for drainage after that you spread the wound to expose the vessels and insert cannulas in both of em blood drains out of the vein while preservatives pumped into the artery but that didnt happen here i said no only a scratch on the vein a wouldbe embalmer who lost his nerve or changed his mind or lacked the equipment and knowledge to follow through yee said there was an immature quality to the murder the neck stuff and the chest lacerations he called dinky and ambivalent he wouldnt put that in writing either said it was for a shrink to decide he extended a palm i said better find yourself a decisive shrink fear of commitment so ive been told he laughed and drank and ate anyway thats the extent of the weird stuff there was no sexual penetration or fooling with the genitalia or overt sadism not much blood loss either most of it settled and the lividity showed the body was on its back for a while manual strangulation i said look in her eyes and choke the life out of her it takes time maybe its enough to get you off watching he said peatys thing with him and billy being a couple of arresteddevelopment losers immature i can see them fooling with a body but being afraid to dig too deep now youre telling me ol billys got a temper he does but but what youre not convinced i dont see billy and peaty being clever enough more important i dont see billy setting up peaty with that call maybe hes not as stupid as he comes across the real actor in the family brad can obviously be fooled i said but he and billy lived together so i doubt to that extent learn anything new about the stolen cell phone he flipped the attaché case open got his notepad motorola v cingular wireless account registered to ms angeline wasserman bundy drive brentwood interior designer married to an investment banker the phone was in her purse when it got stolen the day of the call nine hours before ms wasserman was shopping got distracted turned her head and poof her big concern was the whole identity theft thing the purse too fourfigure badgleysomething number badgley mischka your brand ive known a few women ha wanna guess where she was shopping camarillo outlets i said the barneys outlet specifically tomorrow when it opens at ten ill be there showing around pictures of peaty and billy the gaidelases nora and meserve judge crater amelia earhart anyone else you wanna suggest nora and meserve may be cavorting as we speak i told him about the travel brochures my calls to the private jet outfits another subpoena called for if i had grounds he said the paper for ms wassermans cell came in fast because itd been reported stolen but im still waiting on the phone booth trace hopefully ill have it in hand tonight night owl judge his smile was weary ive known a few jurists i said meserves hoax conviction wont help with the passenger logs misdemeanor offense pled down to community service not hardly youre liking him and nora better now nor more andy and cathy as psychos their leaving town puts them in my radar nora and mr snow globe he hid his own car in brads treasured space just like brad assumed left the globe there for a screwyou if he and nora targeted peaty they couldve learned about peatys unregistered van left the second globe as a misdirection rape kit too why not i said or it was peatys everyone at the playhouse seems to have known about peatys staring and brad knew about peatys arrest record so its not a big stretch to assume nora couldve found out if nora and dylan wanted a scapegoat they had a perfect candidate years of picking off the weak ones and then they just decide to leave for the tropics been there done it time to explore new vistas i suggested brad told you that nora would have to come to him for serious dough brads been wrong about lots of things he took the coroners file back leafed through it absently i said dylan had michaela bind him tight around the neck he pretended to be dead so effectively it scared the hell out of her she also said pain didnt seem to be an issue for him the old psychopath numbness he said a young black cornrowed waitress came over and asked if we were okay milo said please wrap this to go and ill try that brownie sundae closing the file the waitress caught the coroner label you guys in tv she said csi or something like that something like that said milo deft fingering of cornrows eyelid flutter im an actor big smile shock of shocks really said milo extremely really ive done a ton of regional theater in santa cruz and san diego including the old globe where i was a main fairy in midsummer ive also done improv at the groundlings and a nonunion commercial in san francisco but youll never see that it was for amtrak and they never ran it she pouted i said it happens it sure does but hey its all good ive only been in la for a few months and an agent at starlight is just about ready to sign me good for you dmitra she said extending her hand alex this is milo hes the boss milo glared at me smiled at her she sidled closer to him thats a great name milo pleased to meet you can i leave you my name and number milo said sure cool thanks leaning in she rested a breast on his shoulder and scrawled on her order book ill bring your brownie sundae right now totally on the house chapter we set out for the outlets at nine am taking the seville because youve got leather seats beautiful day sixtyfive sunny if you had nothing on your mind you could pretend california was eden milo said lets do the scenic route that meant sunset to the coast highway and north through malibu when i approached kanan dume road i lifted my foot from the gas pedal keep going slouching but his eyes had fixed on the odometer imagining the trip from a killers perspective at mulholland highway we crossed over the ventura county line sped past the beach house id rented with robin years ago the call id walked out on last night had been from her no message other than to phone id tried not home the road compressed to two lanes and continued through miles of cliffbordered state parkland and oceanfront campgrounds at sycamore creek the hills were pillowed by wetyear vegetation lupine and poppies and cactus played on the landside to the west was crashing pacific and milkshake breakers i spotted dolphins leaping twenty yards offshore glorious milo said all that green stuff when the fires take hold its a barbecue remember a few years ago when this was charcoal good morning to you too an eastward turn on las posas road took us through miles of vegetable fields green leafy rows in some of the acreage the rest was brown and flat and dormant upick sheds and produce stands were shuttered for the off season combines and other metal monsters perched out past the furrows awaiting the signal to chew and churn and inseminate at camarillo s western edge a southerly cruise on factory stores drive led us to a peachpink village of commerce a hundred twenty stores divided into north and south sections barneys new york occupied the western tip of the southern wing a compact welllit space attractively laid out staffed well nearly empty wed walked three steps when a spikehaired young man in all black came up to us can i help you he had sunken cheeks and mascaraed eyes wore a cologne full of citrus the platinum soul patch under his lip rightangled with each syllable like a tiny diving board milo said you carry stefano ricci ties the fivehundredbuck deals with the real gold thread no sir im afraid we just kidding friend fingering the skinny wrinkled polyester thing that hung down his paunch the young man was still working on a smile when milo flashed the badge off to one side a pair of persian saleswomen looked us over and spoke in low tones police were here about a theft that occurred four days ago a customer got her purse stolen sure ms wasserman shes a regular every month like clockwork i find her purse for her all the time this time i guess it really did get stolen absentminded lady ill say said the young man theyre beautiful pieces youd think shedi dont want to gossip shes a nice lady this time it was a snakeskin badgemish shes got missoni and cavallo vintage judith leiber day bags hermès chanel youd think said milo im not putting her down shes a really nice person perfect size zero and she tries to tip the staff even though its not allowed did you find it not yet those other times where did she leave them mr topher lembell im a designer so im always noticing details the badge was sweet anaconda this youbetternoticeme pattern the dye job was so good you could almost think a snake could really be mauve wheres ms wasserman tend to leave her purses the dressing room thats where i always find them you know under a pile of clothes this time she claimed she last saw it over there pointing to a display counter in the middle of the store shiny things arrayed neatly under glass nearby was a display of last seasons mens linen suits in earth tones canvas shoes straw hats fiftydollar tshirts milo said you doubt that i guess shed know said topher lembell though if she left it out in the open youd think someone wouldve noticed what with it being so gorgeous and everyone knowing about ms wassermans forgetfulness maybe someone did said milo i meant us officer we had a full staff that day because it was real busy lots of stock came in including stuff that didnt move at the warehouse sale and was deepdeepdiscounted the company advertised plus preferred customers get emails like ms wasserman shes definitely preferred a busy day could make it harder to notice things said milo youd think so but on superheavy days were supercareful so actually theft rates go down its the medium days that are worse enough people so were outnumbered you turn your back and someones boosted something still ms wassermans purse did get stolen topher lembell pouted no ones perfect my bets still on the dressing room she was in and out all morning trying on stuff tossing it on the floor when shes in that mode she can create a real mess dont tell her i said that okay im one of her favorites its like she uses me for a personal shopper sealed lips said milo now would you do me a favor and look at these photos and tell me if any of these people were in the store that day suspects said topher lembell this is cool can i tell my friends about being part of an investigation or is it a big topsecret deal tell anyone you want is everyone here who was working that day we had five more people including one of their friends from the valley eyeing the persian women the others were larissa christy andy and mo they all go to college come in weekends and on heavy days larissa and christy are due in to pick up their check i could call and see if they can come earlier and maybe i can get mo and andy on the phone theyre roomies thanks for the help said milo sure lets see those suspects like i said ive got a great eye for detail as milo produced the photos topher lembell studied the wrinkled necktie and the washandwear shirt beneath it by the way weve still got some good deals on last seasons goods lots of loose comfy stuff milo smiled and showed him dmv headshots of nora dowd and dylan meserve hes younger and cuter than her the snaps of cathy and andy gaidelas evoked sorry no these two look kind of wisconsin i grew up in kenosha are they really criminals how about this one lembell studied reynold peatys arrest shot and stuck out his tongue ugh the moment he stepped inside wed be on the lookout uhuh milo said on a busy day despite the extra staff couldnt someone blend in with the crowd if it was me in charge never my eyes are like lasers on the other hand some people another glance at the saleswomen now idling silently near a rack of designer dresses one of them caught milo s eye and waved tentatively he said lets see what your colleagues have to say and if you could make those calls to the temps right now id appreciate it im on it said topher lembell following along as we crossed the room by the way i do custom couture mens suits jackets pants made to precise measure all i charge is five percent over the cost of fabric and ive got surplus rolls from dormeuil and holland sherry some really cool super s if youre a wee bit hard to fit im harder after a big meal said milo no prob i can create an expandable waistband with tons of stretch hmm said milo let me think about ithello ladies forty minutes later we were parked near the food court at the northern edge of the complex drinking iced tea from twentyounce cups milo removed his straw bent it into segments created a plastic tapeworm pulled it tight his mood was low no ids on any of the photos by the staff including the histrionic larissa and christy who arrived giggling and continued to view the process as hilarious roommates andy and mo were interviewed by phone in goleta same for fahriza nourmand of westlake village no one recalled anyone lurking near angeline wassermans person or purse no suspicious characters that day though someone had boosted a package of mens briefs topher lembell gave up angeline wassermans phone number scrawling on the back of his own babyblue business card call me any time for a fitting but dont tell anyone here about it technically im not allowed to do my own thing on company time but i dont think god really cares do you now milo copied wassermans number into his pad crumpled the card and tossed it in my ashtray i said no interest in custom couture for that i call omar the tentmaker how about stefano ricci five hundred bucks for a ties a bargain rick he said his cravats cost more than my suits when im feeling vindictive i use it against him he played with the straw tried to rip the plastic failed and jammed it back through the lid of his drink just before i came to your place i got an id on the phone booth used for the whispering crap lets have a look it aint exactly a trek gas station at las posas and ventura a fiveminute drive trucks and cars lined up at the pumps hungry motorists streamed in and out of an adjacent stop shop the booth was off to the side near the bathrooms no police tape or indication anyone had dusted for prints i remarked on that and he said ventura pd came by at six am lifted a whole bunch of latents even with afis itll be a while before thats untangled we went into the food store where he showed the photos to the clerks head shakes apathy back outside he said any ideas whoever stole the purse was careful enough to use the cell for the hangups then switch to the pay phone for the whispering or were talking two people working as a team either way the caller stuck around in camarillo so how about checking over there i pointed across ventura to a mass of other eateries sure why not we made it through six restaurants before he said enough maybe the absentminded ms wasserman will recognize someone you didnt show any shots of billy dowd couldnt come up with any he said didnt figure it mattered cause i dont see billy making his way out here by himself even if he managed to the barneys staff wouldve noticed him not cool enough just like junior high whyd you bother showing peatys picture he didnt call vasquez and tag himself as dangerous i wanted to see if hes ever been out here looks like none of our parties of interest have been not necessarily i said angeline wasserman is here every month like clockwork the staff knew her as absentminded so maybe someone else did someone stylish enough to blend in like dylan meserve no one recognized his picture alex maybe he knows something about special effects he shops in disguise a performance i said that could be the whole point i took the back to the city making good time as milo called in for messages he had to introduce himself three times to whoever answered at the west la station hung up cursing new receptionist idiot nephew of a city councilman still doesnt know who i am for the last three days ive gotten no messages which is fine except when im actually trying to solve a case turns out all my slips ended up in someone elses box a d named sterling whos out on vacation luckily it was all junk he punched angeline wassermans number barely had time to recite his name before he was listening nonstop finally he broke through and set up an appointment to meet in an hour design center shes at a rug place doing a highlevel multilevel wilshire corridor condo the day she got ripped off she thinks some guy was checking her out in the outlet parking lot who all i got was a guy in an suv she said shed work on her recollection wanna hypnotize her he laughed she sounded excited just like topher the designer you didnt know you were in a glam profession he showed his teeth to the rearview mirror scraped an incisor ready for my closeup mr demille time to scare small children and household pets manoosian oriental carpets was a cavernous space on the ground floor of the design center s blue building crammed with hundreds of handloomed treasures and smelling of dust and brown paper angeline wasserman stood in the center of the gallerys main room redhaired cheerfully anorexic facially tucked so many times her eyes had migrated fishlike toward the sides of her head limegreen shantung pants fit her stick legs like saran around chicken bones her orange cashmere jacket wouldve flared if she had hips bouncing like a slinky toy among hempbound rolls of rugs she smiled orders at two young hispanic guys unfurling a waisthigh stack of x sarouks as we approached her she sang out ill do it and launched herself at the rugs tossing back dense flaps of woven wool she passed instantaneous judgment on each no no definitely no maybe no no no on that one too weve got to do better darius the stocky bearded fellow she addressed said how about some kashans ms w if theyre better than these darius waved to the young guys and they left angeline wasserman noticed us inspected a few more piles finished and patted her hair and said hello police people milo thanked her for cooperating showed her the photos her index finger tapped no no no no no so tell me how come lapds involved when it happened in ventura it might be related to an la crime maam wassermans piscine eyes glowed some sort of bigtime crime ring figures whys that someone who recognizes a badgley mischka is clearly a pro she waved away the photos think youll ever find my little beauty hard to say in other words no okay thats life it was a year old anyway but should a miracle come down from above the one thing i ask is that you only return it if its in perfect shape if its not just donate it to some police charity and let me know so i can write it off here today gone tomorrow right lieutenant good attitude maam my husband thinks im pathologically insouciant but guess who looks forward to getting up in the morning and who doesnt anyway there wasnt much cash in there maybe eight nine hundred dollars and i put a stop on the magic plastic had anyone tried to use the cards thank god no my amex blacks limitless the phones no big deal either it was time for an upgrade now let me tell you about that guy who was checking me out he was already there when i pulled into the lot so he wasnt stalking me or anything like that what probably happened is he was casing the lot for a pigeon thats the right term isnt it and he saw me as a perfect little dove because of the purse the purse my clothes my demeanor bony hands traversed bony flanks i was dolled out guys even when hunting le grande bargainne i refuse to dress down how was this person checking you out said milo looking at me right through his car window his window was rolled up all the way and it was tinted so i couldnt get a good look but im sure he had his eye on me curled lashes danced im not flattering myself lieutenant believe me he was looking what do you remember about him caucasian i couldnt make out details but the way he was turned i had a full view of his face a rednailed finger touched a collagen lip by caucasian i mean light skinned i suppose he couldve been a pale latino or some kind of asian not black that i can tell you for sure he stayed in the car the whole time and continued to watch me i just know he was following me with his eyes was the engine idling hmmno i dont think sono definitely not everything you saw was through the glass yes but it wasnt just what i saw it was what i felt you know that itchy tingle you get on the back of your neck when someones watching you sure said milo im glad you understand because my husband doesnt hes convinced im flattering myself husbands said milo grinning wassermans return smile tested the outer limits of her skeletal face could there have been more than one person in the car ms wasserman i suppose so but the feeling i got was one person the feeling there was just asolitary flavor to him she touched a concave abdomen i trust this is there anything else you can say about him at first i just figured it for guy behavior checking out the goods after the badge got stolen was when i started thinking he couldve been up to no good was the phone used yes maam whered they call outer mongolia or some crazy place la well said angeline wasserman that shows a lack of creativity maybe i was wrong about what him being some highlevel crime guy and not just a crook high level because he knew what a badge was said milo the whole image being at barneys driving a rover a range rover a real pretty one shiny and newy what color silver mines anthracite thats why it didnt bother me at first his looking at me both of us with rovers parked near each other kind of a twinsie karma you know chapter a new stack of rugs arrived angeline wasserman inspected a fringe these knots are tangled milo muttered story of my life if she heard him she didnt indicate darius are these the best youve got driving to butler avenue i said amex black never used i know same as with the gaidelases but do you see them tooling around in a range rover that just happens to match nora dowds no need to answer when we arrived at the station milo demanded his messages from the new receptionist a terrified bald man in his forties named tom who said theres nothing new lieutenant i promise i followed milo s chuffy climb up the stairs when we reached his office he unpacked his attaché placed the autopsy file next to his computer and requested a bolo on the range rover all before sitting down how about this alex nora and meserve have an love nest and those brochures were a diversion im thinking something on the beach because whats a rich girl without a beach house could be right there in camarillo or farther north oxnard harbor ventura carpinteria mussel shoals santa barbara or points beyond i said could be points south too maybe meserve didnt know latigo because hed hiked there noras a malibu gal he said has a rural hideaway tucked in the mountains something registered to her individually not part of the bnb partnership easy enough to find out what she pays property tax on he flipped the computer on the screen flashed blue then black sparked a couple of times and died several attempts to reboot were greeted by silence he said expelling profanities is a waste of oxygen let me borrow someone elses terminal i used the time to leave another message for robin read through michaelas autopsy findings again playing with veins and arteries the playhouse nora tiring of theatrical abstractions meeting dylan meserve and discovering common interests embalming noras taste in pets milo returned good news i said if failures your idea of success the circuit that feeds all the computers is down tech support was summoned hours ago im going downtown to the assessors office to do it the oldfashioned way if tax leeches communicate with their buds in other counties maybe i can get hooked up with ventura and santa barbara if not im on the road again humming the willie nelson song youre taking this well all part of my audition he said for what mentally stable individual grabbing his jacket he opened the door and held it for me i said taxidermy what the coroners guess about embalming think noras fluffy dog he sat back down some horrific arts and crafts thing i was thinking stage prop for what grand guignol he shut his eyes knuckled a temple your mind the eyes opened if dowd and meserve have an evil hobby why wasnt michaela actually messed with she was rejected i said same for tori giacomo or not scattered bones make it impossible to know why i shook my head that level of pathology the symbolism can be beyond anyone elses comprehension two pretty girls wrong for the part he said the gaidelases on the other hand have never been found meaning maybe their heads are hanging on a damn wall another temple massage okay now that the images are firmly planted in my brain and im sure to have a lovely day lets get the hell out of here i followed him up the hall when we reached the stairwell he said snuff and stuff i can always count on you to cheer me up on our way out tom the receptionist sang out have a nice day lieutenant milo s reply was sotto voce and obscene he left me standing on the sidewalk and continued to the staff parking lot seeing his irritation at the lost messages brought to mind the disgusted look on albert beamishs face yesterday constitutional crankiness or had the old man ever eager to spread dirt on the dowds poked around and actually learned something useful tried to tattle and got no callback no sense overloading milo s circuits i drove to hancock park beamishs doorbell was answered by a tiny indonesian maid in a black uniform clutching a dustclogged feather duster mr beamish please no home any idea when hell be back no home walking over to noras house i took a close look at the barn doors of her garage bolted i nudged the panels felt some give but my bare hands were unable to spread the doors wide enough milo had left it at that i wasnt bound by the rules of evidence fetching a crowbar from the trunk of the seville i carried it parallel to my leg went back and managed to pry the doors an inch apart a stale gasoline smell blew out no range rover or any other vehicle at least milo could be spared the bother of a warrant my cell phone beeped dr delaware its karen from your exchange ive got a message from dr gwynn that was marked priority he asked if you can come by his office soon as you have a chance dr gwynns a she i said ohsorry louise wrote this one down im new do you usually specify gender dont worry about it when was the call twenty minutes ago just before i came on did dr gwynn give a reason for wanting me over it just says asap doctor want the number i know it for allison to reach out it had to be something bad her grandmother another stroke worstcase scenario even so why call me maybe because she had no one else her message tape picked up i drove to santa monica empty waiting room the red light next to her name was unlit meaning no session in progress i pushed open the door to the inner offices proceeded through a short hall to allisons corner suite knocked on her door and didnt wait for an answer she wasnt at her desk or in one of the soft white patient chairs when i said allison no one answered this felt wrong before i could process that thoroughly the back of my head exploded in pain hammeronmelon pain cartoonists are right you really do see stars i reeled got smashed again back of the neck this time i sank to my knees wobbled on allisons soft carpet fought for consciousness a new pain burned my right flank sharp electric was i being cut heavy breathing behind me someone straining with effort blur of dark trouser leg the second kick to my ribs took all the fight out of me and i went down on my face hard leather continued to have its way with bone my brain rang like a gong i tried to ward off further blows but my arms were numb for some reason i counted three kicks four five six for good meas chapter gray soupy world viewed from the bottom of a stockpot i drowned in my chair blinked trying to clear eyes that wouldnt open someone played a trombone solo my eyelids finally cooperated the ceiling swooped down changed its mind soared miles above a white plaster sky blue sky no the blue was off to the left a smudge of black on top pale blue same exact color as the burned cork smell in my throat the black allisons hair the pale blue one of her suits memories flooded my head fitted jacket skirt short enough to show a nice bit of knee braiding around the lapels covered buttons lots of buttons it could take a long sweet time to free them the pain in my skull took over my back and my right side someone moved above allison to the right cant you see he needs help shut up my eyelids sank i blinked some more turned it into an aerobic activity and finally achieved some focus there she was in one of the soft white chairs where she hadnt been beforehow long ago i tried to look at my watch the face was a silver disk my vision cleared a bit id been right she was wearing the exact suit id pictured give the boy an a for movement from the right standing over her was dr patrick hauser one of his hands had vanished in her hair the other held a knife pressed to her smooth white throat red handle swiss army knife one of the larger versions for some reason i found that ludicrously amateurish hausers clothes clinched it white golf shirt baggy brown pants brown wingtips hardtoed wingtips way too dressy for the outfit white was the wrong color if you wanted to avoid those stubborn bloodstains hausers shirt was sweatsplotched but free of red beginners luck no sense rubbing it in i smiled at him something funny i had so many snappy comebacks forgot all of them gong gong allisons eyes shifted to the right past hauser toward her desk nothing else there but a wall and a closet closet blocked by the door when you opened it deep blue irises moved again definitely the desk the far end where her purse sat hauser said sit up and get that pen i was already sitting silly man i spread my arms to show him hit an arm of the wooden desk chair not sitting at all slumped nearly prone head tilted back spine in an odd position maybe thats why everything hurt so bad i tried to straighten nearly passed out cmon up up up barked hauser every inch of movement heated the toaster coils that had replaced my spinal nerves it took years to reach a sitting position and the ordeal robbed me of breath inhaling was hellish breathing out worse a few more centuries and my eyes got clearer i gained a sense of context allison and hauser fifteen feet away my chair pushed up to allisons desk the side where a new patient might sit seeking consultation therapy charts and allisons desktop doodads on the pale oak surface shed been doing paperwork when hed hauser said get the pen and start writing what pen ah there it was hiding among the noise and the color next to a clean white sheet of paper some comical guys voice said wriwhuh i cleared my throat licked my lips the rephrase came out writuh whuh hauser said cut the theatrics youre fine allison moved her left shoe mouthed something that looked like sorry she winced as the knife blade pressed into her skin hauser didnt seem to be aware of his own movement or her reaction write you sonofabitch sure i said bun cun you crew cue me in youre going to retract everything you told that bitch lawyer label the other bitches for the malingering bitches they are sign and date ah theh then what whah happahs aftah i chew thah then well see you unethical asshole alethical once youre exposed said hauser life will be cream and sugar for who his glasses slid down his nose and he flicked his head to right them the movement distanced the blade from allisons neck then it was back a low sound fluttered his lips shut up and write or ill cut her and set it up like you did it youre serious do i look as if im kidding his eyes watered his lower lip vibrated i was doing just fine until everyone started lying all my life ive done for others now its time to take care of number one i managed to pick up the pen nearly dropped it heavy little sucker were they making them of lead nowadays wasnt lead bad for kids no that was pencils no that was graphite i flexed my right arm and its mate no more numbness the pain hadnt abated but i was starting to feel human i said for this to be cruda credulab credible shouldnt it be notary publicked hauser licked his lips his glasses had slid down again but he didnt try to adjust them stop faking i didnt hit you that hard thanks i said but the question is stillrevelant you write ill worry about whats relevant the pen had stopped trying to escape my hand settled awkwardly between ring finger and pinky i managed to roll it into writing position allison watched me i was scaring her a pen made of lead what would the epa think of that i said so i write now how hauser said what do you mean how what words do i tell start by acknowledging that youre a pathological liar unfit to practice should i use first person isnt that what i just said hausers jowls shook with rage his arm did too and once more the knife danced away from allisons skin not a good multitasker his right hand dug in and twisted allisons hair she gasped closed her eyes and bit her lip i said please stop hurting her im not hurting her youre pulling her hair i said hauser looked down at his hand stopped twisting this isnt about her my point you dont have a point he said you owe me if i wanted to hurt you i couldve used a club or something all i did was sucker punch you with my bare hand same way you did me i hurt my knuckles doing it im not a violent person all i want is justice kicked me in the ribs i said sounding like a petulant child when you punched me at that restaurant you escalated the level of violence all i wanted to do was talk rationally blame yourself you scared me at the restaurant i said that brought a smile to his lips are you scared now yeah then harness the fear sublimate start writing and we can all go home i knew he was lying but i believed him tried another smile he stared past me allison glanced at her purse blinked several times i said how bout i start like this my name is alex demlaware im a crinical psychologist licensed by the state of california my license number is droning on hauser followed with choppy movements of his head warming to the recitation because it was everything he wanted to hear fine write i leaned over the desk shielding his view of my right hand with my left arm lowering the nib of the pen to just above the paper i made writing motions oops i said out of ink bullshit dont try i held up the pen tell me what you want me to do hauser thought the knife drifted get another one out of the drawer dont agitate me i struggled to my feet holding the chair for support should i lean over the desk or go around go around that way pointing to the right circling toward the front of the desk i grazed allisons purse with my sleeve opened the drawer took out several pens rested for breath no act my ribs felt like bonemeal on the return trip i touched the purse again hazarded a look unzipped allisons bad habit id given up lecturing to her about it i pretended to bang my knee against the desk corner cried out in pain and dropped the pens idiot my balance is off i think you knocked something loose bullshit i didnt hit you that hard i passed out maybe ive got a concussion your head was stationary and if you had a rudimentary knowledge of neuropsych youd know that severe concussions result most often from two objects in motion colliding i looked at the carpet pick them up i bent collected the pens straightened and made my way back as hauser watched the knife had shifted a few inches from allisons throat but his right hand kept a firm hold on her hair i met her eyes edged to the right farther from hauser that relaxed him allison blinked i said one thing before hauser could answer allison struck out at his knife arm twisted away and slid out of his grasp he shouted she ran toward the door he went after her i had the purse groped with tingling fingers found it allisons shiny little automatic perfect for her small hand too small for mine shed oiled it recently and maybe some of the lubricant had made its way to the grip or my motor skills were shot and thats why my shaking arms bobbled the weapon i caught it used both hands to steady my aim hauser was a foot behind allison flushed and huffing knife held high he made a grab for her caught another handful of hair yanked her head back chopped down i shot him in the back of the knee he didnt fall immediately so i blew out the other knee for good measure chapter id spent ten years working in a hospital some smells never change robin and allison sat across from my bed next to each other like friends robin in black allison still in the babyblue suit i remembered pokes and probes and other indignities but not being transported here the cat scan and xrays had been boring the mri a bit of claustrophobic fun the spinal tap was no kind of fun at all no more pain though what a tough guy i was robin and allison or maybe it was allison and robin smiled i said what is this some kind of beauty contest milo stepped into view i said i redact and retract and refract any former statement visàvis aesthetic competetition smiles all around i was a hit at the risk of utterly bonanzal banalistical cliché where the bleep am i hospitalwise cedars said milo in a slow patient way that suggested it wasnt the first time hed answered the question didja get to see rick you really should you guys dont spend enough time together pained smiles timing its all about timing i said ladies and germs milo edged closer rick says hi he made sure they did all the necessary crap no concussion or hematomas and your brains not swollen at least not more than it usually is you do have some bruised disks in your cervical spine and a couple of cracked ribs ergo king tut ergo pogo logo i touched my side felt the stiff swaddle of bandages rick didnt get to operate no unkindest cut not this time pal he was blocking my view i told him so and he retreated to a corner of the room i looked at the girls my girls so serious both of them maybe i hadnt said it loud enough no unkindeness cutaroo two pretty attempts at sympathy chuckles i was dying up here just got in from lost wages i said and boy is my vertebral discography tired robin said something to allison or maybe it was the other way around making sense of all this was a pretzel a pretty girl pretzel mustard and salt who the hell could untangle it what someone who sounded like me shouted whats the conversational thread being woven into the warp of the contestants you need to sleep said allison she looked ready to cry robin too time for new materiali slept just fine yesterday girls they sedated you said robin youre under sedation right now demerol said allison later you can take percocet whyd they do that i said im no doper i get low on life robin got up and moved bedside allison followed hanging slightly behind all that perfume whoa you wearing chanel i demanded of milo come on over dude and join the olfactory celebration allison caught my eye no purse to look for now she was holding it where were you i said when i came into the office you werent he had me in the closet robin said poor thing i said her or me both of you robin took allisons hand and squeezed allison looked grateful everyone so sad utter waste of energy time to get dressed and have juice and coffee maybe an english muffin and be out of here in no timewhere were my clothesid get dressed in front of all of them we were all chums i mustve said something to that effect maybe with a bit of vulgarity because both of the girls my pretty girls looked shocked robin inhaled and patted the hand without the iv allison wanted to do the same thing i could tell she really wanted to maybe she even still liked me that way but the iv stopped her i said no sweat you can pat me too she obeyed hold my hands i commanded both of you everyone join hands they complied good pretty girls i told milo you on the other hand cant hold anything he said aw shucks i went back to sleep chapter rick wanted me to stay in the hospital another night for observation but i said enough he laid on all the medical authority but nothing helps in the face of industrialstrength obstinacy i called a taxi and checked myself out carrying a goody bag of painkillers antiinflammatories steroids and a smallprint list of dire side effects robin had been by earlier allison had called once but hadnt shown up since the first time i got to know her said robin shes lovely female bonding i said shes nice thats all and you talked about the weather egomaniac she stroked my hair i called you wednesday because i decided to move back still want that yes allisons okay with it didnt know we needed her permission she adores you said robin but i love you i had no idea what that meant had regained enough coherence not to ask i told her to feel free to come by to visit you but she wants to give us some time together she feels horrible about what happened alex why leading you to hauser he had a knife to her throat she didnt have much choice im sure hauser asked around found out we used tohang out knowing me endangered her i need to apologize my eyes brimmed with tears what was that all about robin wiped them its no ones fault alex the guys obviously unbalanced now hell be an unbalanced cripple wonder when the police are coming by to interview me milo s taking care of all that he says given hausers previous arrest there shouldnt be any problem in a perfect world i said cool lips braised my forehead itll be all right honey you need to rest and keep healing allison really blames herself she feels she shouldve known better given what youd told her about hauser thats utterly ridiculous im sure shell be thrilled to hear that from you in those exact words i laughed the bandages around my ribs felt like sashes of ground glass it hurts honey not a bit you poor lying baby she kissed my eyelids then my mouth too damn delicate i needed something closer to pain reached around and pressed her head down when she finally pulled away she was breathless more woman i said ugha ugha she snaked her hand under the bedcovers reached down one of the parts seems to be in working order man of steel i said youre really coming back if you want me to of course i want you to maybe after the pain goes away youll change your i placed a finger across her lips when are you doing it a few days pause im thinking ill keep the studio like you said for work and when you want to get away from me i said no baby ive had plenty of that chapter i walked out of the hospital trying to look like someone who worked in a hospital the cab arrived ten minutes later i was home by seven pm the seville was parked in front something else milo had taken care of the taxi driver had hit several potholes in west hollywood the city that loves decorating avoids the unglamorous stuff pain on each impact had been reassuring i could stand it i stashed the percocet in my medicine cabinet opened a fresh bottle of extrastrength advil i hadnt heard from milo since yesterdays hospital visit maybe that meant progress i reached him in his car thanks for getting my wheels home that wasnt me that was robin are you being a good patient im home rick okayed that rick and i reached a meeting of the minds silence real smart move alex if you listened to him youd be wearing better ties more silence im fine i said thanks for handling hauser as much as i handled ive got problems ahead therell be some shit to deal with but those in the know say youll be okay meanwhile the assholes in the jail ward wearing yellow pajamas and looking at inkblots what happened he imploded he made bad decisions and projected them onto me how badly did i wound him he wont be playing soccer any time soon allisons little shooter came in handy huh sure did i said did you find any properties nora dowd owns in or near back in the swing he said just like that on sound advice whose my own he laughed as a matter of fact noras got three deeds to her name condo in carpinteria couple of houses in goleta all of which have been leased out long term her tenants have never met her but they like her because she keeps the rent low bnb manages the buildings no a santa barbara company does i spoke to the manager nora gets checks in the mail never visits thats it alex no trystpad no direct link to camarillo no malibu getaway maybe she and meserve made the calls and took off for that tropical vacation i said do the brothers own anything out there why would that matter billys a mope and brad hates meserve so far looking for peatys hideyholes has been a big zero once i finish with armando vasquez ill look into private flights whats to do on vasquez second interview first time was last night call from vasquezs dpd at pm armando wanted to talk faithful public servant that i am i trudged over the agenda was vasquez embellishing the phone call story claiming the night of the murder wasnt the first time same thing happened a week or so before he cant remember exactly when or how many times no hangups just someone whispering that peaty was a dangerous pervert could hurt vasquezs wife and kids da wants to blunt any justification defense so ive got to stick with it meanwhile theyll be pulling a months worth of phone records while i was there i showed vasquez my photo collection hes never seen the gaidelases nora or meserve the thing is i finally got a shot of billy and vasquez also doesnt recognize him but im sure billys been to the apartment with brad meaning vasquez not being there during the day is pretty useless like everything else ive come up with anything you need me to do i need you to heal up and not be a foolish mummy one other thing that came up is peatys body just got claimed by a cousin from nevada she asked to speak to the d in charge says she left a bunch of messages thanks again idiot tom im squeezing her in tomorrow afternoon to see if she can shed some light on peatys psyche das orders with the defense painting him as a psychobrute im supposed to learn his good points speaking of idiot tom i recounted beamishs disgusted expression wouldnt surprise me maybe beamish remembers more stolen fruitwhat elseoh yeah i called some taxidermy supply houses no record of nora or meserve buying creepy accoutrements okay here i am at le grande lockup ready for mr vasquez time to add a few more lies to my daily diet daybreak brought the worst headache of my life stiff limbs a cottony mouth a palmful of advils and three cups of black coffee later i was moving fine if i kept my breathing shallow i phoned allison thanked her message tape for its mistresss presence of mind apologized for getting her involved in serious ugliness i told robins tape i was eager to see its mistress no listing for albert beamish i tried his law firm a crispvoiced receptionist said mr beamish rarely comes in i think the last time i saw him washas to be months emeritus some of the partners have professorships so we like the term is mr beamish a professor no she said he never liked teaching his thing was litigation i reached beamishs tudor at eleven am the same indonesian maid answered yes she beamed mister home moments later the old man came shuffling out wearing a saggy white cardigan over a brown knit shirt pinkstriped seersucker pants and the same house slippers with wolves heads on the toes his sneer was virtuoso the prodigal policeman arrives what does it take to motivate you people thereve been some problems with the phones i said he cackled with the joy of omniscience cleared his throat four times hacked up something wet and swallowed it my tax dollars put to good use what did you call about sir you dont know thats why im here you still havent seen the message then how did you i figured it out mr beamish from the look of contempt on your face when i drove by the look of a puckered lipless mouth curled ambiguously a veritable sherlock whats the message i said when you talk you flinch young man im a little sore mr beamish carousing on my dollar i unbuttoned my jacket undid a couple of shirt buttons and revealed the bandages around my middle broken ribs a few same thing happened to me when i was in the army he said not combat heroics i was stationed in bayonne new jersey and some irish lout from brooklyn backed a jeep right into me but for the grace of a few inches id have ended up childless singing soprano and voting democrat i smiled dont do that he said got to hurt like hell then dont be funny i said he smiled a real smile devoid of scorn army doctors couldnt do a damn thing to patch me just wrapped the ribs and told me to wait when i mended they shipped me off to the eto no medical progress since then when did this happen to you not that i really care two days ago not that its any of your business he gave a start glared plucked brown fabric from his sunken chest broke into arid laughter coughed up more mucus when the wheezing stopped he said how about a drink its almost noon as i followed him through dim dusty highceilinged rooms full of georgian antiques and chinese porcelain he said howd the other guy fare worse than me good we sat at a round table in his octagonal breakfast room just off a kitchen whose stainless steel counters and chipped white cabinets said it hadnt been altered for half a century mullion windows looked out to a shade garden the table was seasoned mahogany cigarette burned and watermarked circled by four queen anne chairs the wall covering was a pale green silk asian print crowded with peonies and bluebirds and fictitious vines faded white in spots a solitary framed photo hung on the wall black and white also diminished by decades of ultraviolet when beamish left to fetch the drinks i took a look at the picture a lanky lighthaired young man in an army captains uniform stood arm and arm with a pretty young woman her cloche hat rested on dark curls she wore a fitted summer suit and held a bouquet big ship in the background uss something a fountainpenned caption in the lower right border read long beach betty and al back from the war at last beamish returned with a cutcrystal decanter and a pair of matching oldfashioned glasses lowered himself to a chair slowly struggling to hide his own wince then changing his mind eventually he said you dont need to be beat on to ache nature does it all by her cruel self he poured us each two fingers slid my tumbler across the table thanks for the encouragement i held mine up he grunted and drank i imagined milo in forty years hacking and swigging and pronouncing about the sorry state the world had gotten itself into old and whitehaired the fantasy ended when i got to heterosexual and rich beamish and i drank the whiskey was a single malt peaty sweetish going down with a nice afterburn that reminded you it was alcohol he licked the spot where his lips used to be put his glass down this is the good stuff lord knows why i brought it out uncharacteristic burst of generosity i said youre an insolent one none of the obsequiousness of a public servant im not one im a psychologist a what no dont answer i heard you fine one of those eh the fat detective sent you over here to deal with an unbalanced old fossil all my idea i gave him a short explanation of my relationship to the police expected the worst beamish drank some more and tweaked the tip of his nose when rebecca died i saw no point in living my children insisted i see a psychiatrist and sent me to a jewish chap in beverly hills he prescribed pills i never took and referred me to a jewish woman psychologist in his office i rejected her outofhand as a highpriced babysitter but my children coerced me turned out they were right she helped me im glad sometimes its still difficult he said too much damned space on the bed ah enough mawkishness if we sit here too much longer youll send me a bill heres the message i left the fat detective a woman came by three days ago poking around that ones pile of logs pointing in the general direction of noras house i went over and asked her what she was doing and she said she was looking for her cousin nora i told her nora hadnt been seen in a while and that the police may very well suspect nora of nefarious activity she didnt seem at all surprised by that possibility is it doctor alex is fine did you cheat on your exams he snapped no then you earned your damned degree so use it for gods sake one thing i detest is the ersatz familiarity the beatniks ushered in you and i may be drinking my best single malt sir but if you addressed me by my christian name id toss you out on your ear that would be painful under the circumstances i said he worked his lips conceded a smile whats your family name delaware now then dr delawarewhere was i the cousin didnt seem surprised on the contrary said beamish the possibility that nora was under suspicion seemed downright syntonic he grinned a psychological term i learned it from dr ruth goldberg aplus i said any reason the cousin wasnt surprised i pressed her on that but she was not forthcoming quite the contrary she was eager to leave and i had to prevail upon her to leave her name and phone number another slow rise from the table and a fiveminute absence allowed me to finish my scotch beamish reappeared holding a piece of white paper folded to a twoinch square gnarled fingers labored at unfolding and smoothing half a sheet of heavystock letterhead stationery martin crutch and melvyn a legal corporation olive street address long list of smallprint names beamishs near the top at the bottom of the page shaky handwriting in black fountain pen smeared around the edges marcia peaty a number i looked it up thats las vegas said beamish though she didnt seem like the vegas type shes the dowds cousin so she said and it doesnt seem the kind of thing one would pretend she wasnt particularly wellbred but not vulgar and nowadays thats an accomplishment i refolded the paper thanks a little light just switched on in your eyes dr delaware have i been useful more than you might imagine would you care to tell me why id like to but i cant as i started to rise beamish poured me another finger of scotch thats fifteen dollars worth dont sip standing up terribly vulgar thanks but ive had enough sir temperance is the last refuge of cowards i laughed he pinged the rim of his glass its absolutely necessary that you bolt like a panicky horse im afraid so mr beamish i waited for him to get to his feet he said later then once youve put them all away would you let me know what ive accomplished them that one her brothers nasty lot just as i told you the first time you and the fat detective came traipsing around persimmons i said that of course he said but youre after more than purloined fruit chapter it took six minutes for the jail deputy to return to the phone yeah hes still here please have him call me when he gets out its important he asked me for my name and number again said okay but his tone said dont count on it an hour later i tried again a different deputy said let me check sturgis hes gone i finally reached him in his car he said vasquez wasted my time all of a sudden he remembers peaty threatened him overtly ill mess you up dude sounds more like something vasquez would say shuldiners gonna push a chronic bullying defense anyway im finished with it finally able to focus on nora and meserve still no sign they took any commercial flight but angeline wassermans id of the range rover can probably get me some subpoenas for private charter lists im off to file paper how you feeling is the woman the coroner referred to you named marcia peaty yeah why shes the dowds cousin as well i told him what i learned from albert beamish the old man actually had something to say so much for my instincts i said the dowd sibs hire their cousin as a minimumwage janitor and give him a former laundry room to live in tells you something about their character the fact that none of them thinks to mention it says more have a chance to look into the brothers private holdings not yet guess id better do it marcia peaty never told me she was their cousin as well as peatys when are you meeting her an hour shes staying at the roosevelt on hollywood i set it up for musso and frank figured id at least get a good meal out of it family secrets and sand dabs i said i was thinking chicken potpie sand dabs for me i said youre actually hungry starving i parked in the gigantic lot behind musso and frank all that land developers had to be drooling and i imagined the roar of jackhammers the restaurant was nearly a century old impervious to progress and regress so far so good milo had staked out a corner booth in the southeast corner of mussos larger room twentyfoot ceilings painted a grim beige you dont see anymore green print hunting scenes on the walls oak paneling nearly black with age strong drinks at the bar an encyclopedic menu touts whats now called comfort food but used to be just food some items take time and the management warns you not to be impatient musso might be the last place in la where you can order a slab of spumoni for dessert cheerful greenjacketed busboys circled the cavernous space and filled water glasses for the half dozen parties enjoying a late lunch redjacketed waiters who made albert beamish seem amiable waited for a chance to enforce the nosubstitution rule a few booths featured couples looking happily adulterous a table in the middle of the room hosted five whitehaired men wearing cashmere sweaters and windbreakers familiar but unidentifiable faces it took a while to figure out why a quintet of character actors men whod populated my childhood tv shows without ever getting star billing all of them looked to be pushing a robust eighty lots of elbowbending and laughter maybe the bottom of the funnel wasnt necessary for grace milo was working on a beer computer lines are finally back up i just had sean run the property search and guess what nothing for brad but billy owns ten acres in latigo canyon a short drive above where michaela and meserve pretended to be victims oh my i said just land no house thats how its registered maybe there are nocode shacks on the property i said believe me im gonna find out he looked at his timex brads the dominant one but he doesnt own any land of his own not even the house in santa monica canyon thats billys sos the duplex in beverly hills three parcels each for billy and nora i said nothing for brad could be one of those tax things alex he takes a salary for managing all the shared buildings has some irs reason not to own on the contrary property tax is deductible so are depreciation and expenses on rentals spoken like a true land baron id made serious money buying and selling properties during a couple of booms had opted out of the game because i didnt like being a landlord put the profits in bonds and clipped coupons not too smart if net worth was your goal i used to think my goal was serenity now i had no idea i said maybe cousin marcia can clue us in he tilted his head toward the back of the room yup being a veteran detective id say thats her the woman who stood to the right of the bar was six feet tall forty or so with curly dishwater hair and a piercing stare she wore a black crewneck and slacks carried a cream leather handbag milo said shes checking the premises like a cop and waved she waved back and approached the purse was printed with a worldmap design a gold crucifix pendant was her only jewelry up close her hair was wiry combed in a way that obscured half her right eye the iris and its mate were bright and searching and gray narrow face sharp nose outdoor skin no resemblance i could see to reynold peaty or to the dowds lieutenant marcia peaty pleased to meet you maam milo introduced me minus my title i pictured al beamish scowling marcia peaty shook our hands and sat i remember this place as having great martinis you from la originally raised in downey my father was a chiropractor had an office there and right here in hollywood on edgemont a good report card used to earn me lunch with him we always came here and when no one was looking he let me try his martinis i thought they tasted like swimming pool acid but never let on wanting to be mature you know she smiled now i like them all by myself a waiter came over and she ordered the cocktail on the rocks with olives and an onion my version of salad the waiter said another beer milo said no thanks you the memory of beamishs single malt leased space in my palate coke the waiter frowned and left milo said what can i do for you ms peaty im trying to find out what happened to reyn howd you hear about it im a colleague used to be las vegas pd twelve years she said mostly vice and auto and then i did some jail duty im working private security now big company we handle some of the casinos no shortage of work in sin city said milo you guys arent exactly sitting around the drinks arrived marcia peaty tried her martini better than i remembered the waiter asked if we were ready to order chicken potpie sand dabs sand dabs another memory said marcia peaty cant get them in vegas milo said cant get em too often in la either mostly its rex sole she looked disappointed cheap substitution nope theyre basically the same little flatfish with lots of bones one lives deeper no one can tell the difference you into fishing im into eating virtually the same huh said marcia peaty more like twins than cousins cousins can be real different she removed an olive from her drink chewed swallowed how i found out about reyn was id been trying to call him for days and no one answered its not like i call him regularly but one of our greataunts died and he inherited some money no big deal twelve hundred bucks when i couldnt get hold of him i started calling around hospitals jails finally i learned what happened from your coroner calling jails and the crypt said milo thats a specific curiosity marcia peaty nodded reyn was highrisk for problems always had been i didnt have any fantasies of turning him into a solid citizen but every so often id feel protective we grew up together in downey he was a few years younger im an only child and he was too so kin was in short supply once upon a time i thought of him as a little brother i said highrisk brother im not going to sugarcoat him but he wasnt a psychopath just not smart one of those people who always make bad decisions you know maybe it was genetic our fathers were brothers my dad worked three jobs putting himself through cleveland chiropractic cracked enough backs to go from trailer trash to respectable reyns dad was an alcoholic loser never held down a steady job in and out of jail for pennyante stuff reyns mom wasnt much better she stopped big sad story its nothing you guys havent heard before milo said howd you both end up in nevada reyn ran away from home when he was fifteen more like walked out and no one cared im not sure what he did for ten years i know he tried the marines ended up in the brig dishonorable discharge i moved to vegas because my dad died and my mom liked playing the slots when youre an only child you feel responsible my husbands from a family of five kids big old mormon clan totally different world milo nodded ten years reyn showed up when he was twentyfive at my mothers condo tattooed and drunk and hed put on about sixty pounds she wouldnt let him in he didnt argue but he kept hanging around on her street so mom called cop daughter when i saw him i was shocked believe it or not he used to be a nicelooking guy i gave him some cash set him up at a motel told him to sober up and move to another city the last part he kept reno next i heard from him was two years later needing money for bail i cant tell you where he was in between bad decisions i said hes never been violent said marcia peaty just another one of those revolvingdoor dudes milo said his peeper bust could be thought of as scary maybe im rationalizing but that seemed more like drunk and disorderly hed never done anything like that before hasnt since right people say he stared a lot made em uncomfortable yeah he tends tended to space out said marcia peaty like i said he was no einstein couldnt add threedigit sums i know it sounds like im giving a mope a free pass but he didnt deserve to get shot by that banger can you fill me in on how it happened milo gave her the barest details of the murder leaving out the whispering phone calls and vasquezs claim of harassment she said one of those stupid things and sipped a half inch of martini banger going to pay hell get something meaning defense is gonna paint your cousin as a bully reynold was a boozesoaked loser but he never bullied an ant he have any kind of love life marcia peatys hazel eyes narrowed speedtrap gaze what does that have to do with anything da wants a clear picture of what he was like i cant find evidence of any love life just a collection of young girl videos marcia peatys knuckles whitened around her glass how young barely legal why does any of that matter reynold worked as a janitor at an acting school a couple of female students were murdered marcia peaty blanched uhuh no way i worked vice long enough to know a sex criminal when i see one and reynold wasnt and that aint family denial trust me on this youd best be looking elsewhere speaking of family lets talk about your other cousins i mean it she said reyn wasnt wired that way the other cousins said milo who the dowds you were at nora dowds house the other day told a neighbor you were her cousin marcia peaty slid her glass toward her left hand then back to her right lifting the pick skewering the onion she twirled put it back that wasnt strictly true theres lenient truth said milo shes not my cousin brad is hes her brother marcia peaty sighed its complicated weve got time chapter like i said i come from trailer trash said marcia peaty no shame in that my father dr james peaty pulled himself up its even more to his credit unlike his brother i said brothers plural she said and sister reyns dad roald was the youngest in and out of prison his whole life later shot himself next up was millard and between him and my dad was bernadine she died after being put away put away for what said milo alcoholinduced craziness she was a goodlooking woman but she used her looks in not the best way she pushed her plate away i know all this from my mother who hated dads family so she may have heaped it on a bit but overall i think she was accurate because dad never denied it mom used to hold up bernadine as a negative example for me dont do what that immoral wench did whatd bernadine do said milo left home at seventeen and went down to oceanside with a friend another wild girl named amelia stultz the two of them worked the sailor trade and god knows what else bernadine got pregnant by some guy on shore leave who she never saw again had a baby boy brad i said she nodded thats how brad came into this world when bernadine got put away he was three or four got sent to california to live with amelia stultz whod done a whole lot better married a navy captain with family money milo said amelia was an immoral wench but she raised someone elses kid the way my mother told it my uncle millard blackmailed her said hed tell her rich husband about her past if she didnt take the brat conniving fellow your besotted uncle i said did he ask anything for himself maybe money changed hands i dont know marcia peaty frowned im aware that this lays responsibility on everyone but my father ive wondered about that could dad have been that calculated a cheek muscle jumped even if hed wanted to help brad no way my mother would have agreed to take him in the rich captain was bill dowd junior hancock park she said on the surface brad lucked out the problem was amelia had no interest in raising her own kids let alone one shed been stuck with shed always fancied herself a dancer and an actress a performer mom called it which meant stripping in some of those tijuana clubs and maybe worse howd amelia snag captain dowd she was greatlooking said marcia peaty blond bombshell when she was young maybe it was like that country song guys going for women on the trashy side or family tradition albert beamish had said bill dowd junior married a woman with no class just like his mother milo said amelia took brad in but didnt care to raise him we talking abuse or just neglect i never heard about abuse more like she ignored him completely but she did that with her own kids too both of whom had problems have you met nora and billy three yup i havent seen them since we were kids whatre they like milo ignored the question howd you happen to see them as kids dad mustve felt guilty because he tried to make contact with brad when i was around five we drove into la and visited amelia dowd liked my dad and started inviting us to birthday parties mom griped about it but down deep she didnt mind going to a fancy affair in a big house she did warn me away from bill three said he was retarded couldnt be counted on to control himself he ever act scary she shook her head he just seemed quiet and shy obviously he wasnt normal but he never bothered me nora was a space cadet walked around talking to herself mom said look at amelia marrying rich living the good life but she ends up with defective kids i dont want to make it sound like mom was a hateful person she just had no use for dads family and anyone associated with them his whole life uncle millard did nothing but sponge off us and roald was no picnic either before he died also when mom talked like that it was always part of complimenting me moneys nothing honey your children are your legacy and that makes me a wealthy woman milo said could we talk to your mom shes gone four years ago cancer she was one of the ladies you see at the slots wheelchairbound smoking and feeding nickels i said brad goes by dowd was he adopted legally dont know maybe amelia let him use the name to avoid uncomfortable questions or said milo she wasnt such a witch i guess said marcia peaty mom could be intolerant i said captain dowd didnt mind another child captain dowd wasnt a real tough guy just the opposite anything amelia wanted she got did your mother ever say anything about how brad fared psychologically her name for him was the troublemaker and she warned me away from him too she said unlike billy he was smart but always lying and stealing amelia sent him away several times to boarding schools and military academies persimmons and more alfred beamish had pegged brads behavior but never uncovered the boys origins mansions country clubs rented elephants at birthday parties a mother who really wasnt who fancied herself a performer i said how did amelia dowd channel her interest in acting what do you mean all those performance dreams that never came to pass sometimes people live through their kids was she a stagedoor mom brad did tell me she tried to get the kids on tv as a group singing and dancing he said he could carry a tune but the others were tonedeaf the photocovered wall of the playhouse theater floated into my head among the famous faces a band i hadnt recognized kiddy quartet of mophaired youngstersthe kolor krew what was the name of the group he never said when did all this take place lets seebrad was about fourteen when he told me so it mustve been right around then he laughed about it but he sounded bitter said amelia dragged them to talent agents made them sit for photos bought them guitars and drums they never learned to play gave them voice lessons that were useless even before that shed tried to get nora and billy three jobs as actors not brad he told me amelia only included him in the band because the other two were hopeless he call her that i said amelia she thought i never heard him call her mom nora and billy have any success at all individually i think nora got some dinky modeling jobs department store stuff kiddy clothing bill three got nothing he wasnt smart enough brad told you all this said milo you and he talk often just during those parties what about as adults except for one facetoface twelve years ago its been the phone and not often maybe once every couple of years who calls who he calls me christmas greetings that kind of thing mostly showing off how rich he is telling me about some new car he bought twelve years ago i said thats pretty precise marcia peaty fooled with her napkin theres a reason for that and it might be important to you guys twelve years ago brad got questioned on a vegas case i was doing hot cars a d from headquarters calls me says a person of interest is tossing my name around claiming were kissing cousins i find out who it is call brad its been a while since weve talked but he turns on the charm like its yesterday great to hear from you cuz he insists on taking me to a big dinner at caesars turns out hed been living in vegas for a year doing some kind of real estate investment never thought to get in touch and once he didnt need me i didnt hear from him for seven more years christmas to brag about what being back in la living well and running the family real estate business he invited me to visit said hed give me a spin in one of his cars as in he has a lot of them platonic invitation i said hard to say with brad i chose to take it as platonic milo said what kind of case was he questioned on missing girl dancer at the dunes never found brad had dated her was the last person to see her he ever go beyond person of interest nope no evidence of a crime was ever uncovered brad said she told him she wanted to try for something better and left for la that happens a lot in our town i said something better as in breaking into acting marcia peaty smiled what else is new remember this girls name said milo julie something i can get it for you or you can call yourself the primary d was harold fordebrand he retired but hes still in vegas listed in the book i used to work with an ed fordebrand harold said he had a brother who did la homicide no evidence of a crime said milo but what did harold think about brad didnt like him too slick called him mr hollywood brad wouldnt take a polygraph but theres no crime against that what was his reason just didnt want to he get lawyered up nope she said cooperated fully real relaxed mr hollywood i said maybe some of amelias aspirations rubbed off he actually learned how to act she said i never thought of it that way but maybe bradley can definitely tell you what you want to hear i said those birthday parties amelia threw were any of them for him nope just for billy three and nora that had to suck but he never showed any anger they were great parties rich kid parties i always looked forward to them wed drive up from downey with my mother complaining about those people being vulgar and my father giving that little smile of his when he knew better than to argue brad showed no resentment at all just the opposite he was always smiling and joking would take me around that huge house show me his hobbies making wiseass comments about how lame the party was he is a few years older than me was cute in that blond surfer way to be honest back then i had a crush on him he ridiculed the parties i said mostly he poked fun at amelia how everything was a big production with her she was always trying to time stuff precisely like a stage show she did tend to go over the top rented elephant i said that was something she said howd you hear about it a neighbor told us the grumpy old guy she laughed yeah i can see why it would stick in his mind the smell alone it was for billy threes thirteenth i remember thinking this is baby stuff hes way too old for this except he was younger mentally and seemed to be digging it all the kids were digging it too because the elephant was messing the street big time were whooping and pointing at pounds of stuff coming out holding our noses you know meanwhile amelias looking ready to faint doing the whole marilyn monroe platinumblond thing tight silk dress tons of makeup running after the animal trainer on these gigantic spike heels everyones waiting for her to step in elephant doo real tight dress busting out of it she was about twenty pounds past her prime milo took out the photos showed her michaela and tori giacomos headshots nicelooking girls she said they still that cute or are we talking bad news any resemblance to amelia maybe the blondeness amelia was moreconstructed fuller in the face and she looked like she took all morning putting herself together what about julie the missing showgirl see any similarities she peered closely i only saw one picture of her and it was twelve years agoshe was blond too so theres that she did make the dunes stage so were not talking a toadyeah i guess in a general way what about these people flashing the mp shots of cathy and andy gaidelas marcia peatys mouth opened and closed this could be amelia dowd shes heavy around the jaw and the cheeks in the exact same way the guys not a deadringer for bill dowd junior but he isnt that different eithersimilar around the eyes the crags the whole gregory peck thing dowd looked like peck my mom said amelia bragged about it all the time i guess there was some truth to it except captain dowd was about five five mom used to say hes gregory peck on the morning after an earthquake and a tornado and a flood minus the charisma and sawed off at the knees i said this guys been compared to dennis quaid i can see thatnot as cute she studied the pictures some more returned them you guys are dealing with serious bad arent you you said captain dowd was no tough guy i said what else can you say about him quiet inoffensive never seemed to do much masculine what do you mean manly man hardly she said just the opposite mom was convinced he was gay or as she put it a homo i cant say i saw that but i was too young to be thinking in those terms your father have any opinions about it said milo dad kept his opinions to himself but your mom was definite about it mom was always definite whys it important amelia and the captain have been dead for years how many years it was between the time brad got called in for questioning and the next time i heard from him which was five years laterim thinking ten years ago they died at the same time car crash said marcia peaty driving up to san francisco i think the captain fell asleep at the wheel you think said milo thats what mom said but she was big into blame maybe he had a heart attack i cant say for sure at the birthday parties i said when brad took you around the house and showed you his hobbies what kinds of things was he interested in typical boy stuff she said stamp collection coin collection sports cards he had a knife collection is that what youre getting at its just a general question anything else anything elselets seehe flew kites had some nice ones lots of little metal cars he was always into cars there was an insect collection butterflies pinned to a board stuffed animals not the girly kind trophies hed stuffed himself taxidermy yeah birds a raccoon this real weird horned lizard that sat on his desk he told me hed learned how to do it at summer camp was pretty good at it had these boxes fishing tackle boxes with compartments full of glass eyes needles and thread glue all kinds of tools i thought it was cool asked him to show me how he did it he said soon as i get something to fix he never did i think i went to maybe one more party and by that time i had a boyfriend wasnt thinking about much else lets talk about your other cousin said milo any idea how reynold came to work for the dowds that was me she said that bragging call from brad five years ago christmas there was lots of background noise like he was doing some heavy partying this was after reyns trouble in reno i told brad seeing as youre some big real estate honcho how about helping out a country cousin he didnt want to hear about it he and reyn didnt know each other i dont think theyd seen each other since they were kids but i was in an obnoxious mood and kept working on him working on his pride you know guess your business isnt so big youd need outside help that kind of thing finally he said have him call me but if he fucks up once thats it next thing i know reynolds calling me from la telling me brads gonna hire him to manage some apartments brad hired him to mop and sweep so ive learned said marcia peaty real sweet huh reynold accepted it reynold didnt have too many options brad ever let on to anyone that reynold was family nope said milo would billy and nora be aware of the connection not unless brad told them theres no blood tie there or reynold told them weve heard he and billy hung out that so she said hung out how reynold dropped by billys apartment allegedly to drop off lost objects allegedly brad denies sending him on errands you believe him milo smiled theyre both your cousins but youd prefer we focus on brad not reynold that why you came down to la i came down because reynolds dead and no one else is going to bury him hes all ive got left in terms of family except brad brads your concern not mine you dont like him he was raised in another family she said silence finally she said julie the dancer that bothered me big time now youre showing me photos of other blond girls reynold was dumb and sloppy and a drunk but he was never cruel so far you havent told us anything brad did that was cruel no i havent said marcia peaty and i guess i cant because like i said he and i havent exactly been hanging out but you know guys she said this is real weird and i dont think i like it like what being on the receiving end of what i used to dish out its for a good cause marcia said milo in terms of julie the showgirl did harold fordebrands gut say anything more about brad than he was slick youd have to ask harold once he found out brad was my cousin he kept me out of the loop how about your gut brads demeanor bothered me like he was enjoying some private joke you guys know what i mean despite that you got reyn a job with him and now reyns gone she said her face crumpled and she turned to hide it from us when she faced us again her voice was small youre saying i screwed up big time no said milo im not trying to guilttrip you far from it all this stuff youre telling us is beyond helpful were just groping around here no case yet not hardly i was hoping i was wrong she said about what brad being somehow involved with reynolds death no indication he is i know an altercation youre saying thats all there was to it so far the old stonewall said marcia peaty ive laid a few bricks myself let me ask you this the way brad treated reyn giving him scut work the dowds owning all those properties and they stick reyn in a hovel that add up to the milk of human kindness these people are just what mom always said they were whats that poison palming itself off as perfume chapter marcia peaty switched the subject and milo didnt stop her procedural questions about how to take possession of her cousins body his rundown wasnt much different from the one hed given lou giacomo she said paperwork aerobics okay thanks for your time am i wasting my time asking you to keep me informed something resolves well let you know marcia if not when you have any serious leads he smiled she said thats why i never did homicide too much effort getting the optimism meter up vice can get sketchy too thats why i didnt do vice for long give me a nice boosted set of wheels chrome dont bleed said milo aint that the truth she reached for the check milo placed his hand on it let me pay for my share on the house said milo you or the department the department right she put down a twenty slid out of the booth shot us a tight smile and hurried off milo pocketed the cash and pushed crumbs around his plate ol brads been a baaad boy young blondes i said too bad tori dyed her hair amelia the whole platinum bombshell thing what hes killing stepmommy over and over his own mother abandoned him handed him over to someone who didnt even pretend to care he has lots of reasons to hate women he was in his thirties when julie the showgirl disappeared think she was his first hard to say the main thing was he got away with it built up his confidence for the move back to la after amelia and the captain died he managed to take over the family real estate empire cared well for billy and nora because happy sibs dont complain maybe the playhouse is a tax dodge and a sop for nora but it was good for him too start an acting school who shows up gorgeous mutants he said all those blonde auditions and rejects like the gaidelases normally brad would ignore people like cathy and andy but they reminded him of amelia and the captain down to the captains effeminate manner hows this for a scenario he ran into them leaving an audition or waiting for a tryout either way it had to feel like destiny he played nice guy promised to help told them meanwhile enjoy your vacation do some hiking i know a great spot billys acreage in latigo he folded and unfolded his napkin snatched up his phone got harold fordebrands number from vegas called left a message guy sounds exactly like ed i said the kolor krew was a quartet who the kiddiepop group amelia tried to market i described the publicity shot on the playhouse wall the dowd kids plus one maybe theres someone else who can fill us in about the good old days he said you feel like researching the history of bubblegum music be my guest i need another facetoface with the sib who really aint one starting with a dropin at the bnb office if brads not there its over to his house eventually a day at the beach will be on the agenda i said think billy even knows he owns the latigo property brad bought it and put it in billys name brad lives near the ocean has surfed enough to grow knots on his knees meaning he knows malibu a nice secluded oceanview lot on the landside might appeal to him especially if it was paid for with billys money being in charge of family finances brad could get billy to sign on the dotted line or just forge billys name meanwhile billy pays the property tax and doesnt have a clue the assessor says there are no structures on the lot what would brad use it for meditation planning a dream house burying bodies billy pays brad plays he says noras no business type either meaning brad can basically do what he wants with all the money he rubbed his face all this time ive been looking for peatys stash spots but brad has access to dozens of buildings and garages all over the county he came right out and told us he stores his cars in some of the properties he did indeed what was that playing mind games or bragging about his collection this is a guy who needs to feel important im wondering if it couldve been him watching angeline wasserman from that range rover why would it be him last time i saw him he had on a nice linen suit there were a bunch just like it hanging from a rack at the barneys outlet snappy dresser he said maybe a regular just like wasserman he observes her knows shes absentminded lifts her purse the goal was to get her phone he couldntve have cared less about the money or the credit cards i said the more i think about that the better i like it welldressed middleaged guy who shops there all the time no reason to suspect him angeline might know his face but the rovers tinted windows wouldve prevented her from realizing it was him it was his ride she concentrated on anyway twinsie karma he retrieved wassermans number from his pad and punched it ms wasserman lieutenant sturgis againi know you are but just one more question okay theres a gentleman who shops at the outlet regularly midforties nicelooking white hair you doohno its moremaybeokay thanksno thats it he hung up thats brad i see him all the time did he have something stolen too seeing him as a victim not a suspect i said because hes welloff and stylish you got it great guy terrific taste you should see the gorgeous cars he drives lieutenant each time a different one turns out angeline and ol brad ask each others opinions about outfits all the time hes always honest but he does it with sensitivity charming fellow you think his driving noras wheels means nora and meserve are in on it with him or tough luck for them dont know but either way brad had something to do with the calls to vasquez setting up his own cousin the same cousin he put to work as a janitor and housed in a dump given brads background blood ties could twist all sorts of ways if vasquez was telling the truth about getting calls the previous week the setup was extremely well thought out priming a murder he said how could brad be sure vasquez would blow and shoot peaty he couldnt but he knew both parties and mrs stadlbraun played the odds he told me he had bad feelings about vasquez but rented to him anyway because there was no legal out thats nonsense a landlord especially one with brads experience can always find a reason game of chance he said brad lived in vegas one table doesnt work out move to the next one okay lets assume he set peaty up why with peatys police record and pattern of creepy behavior hed be a perfect scapegoat for michaela and tori and any other missing girls who turned up look what happened after the shooting you got to search peatys van discovered the rapekit stashed conveniently in back no real effort to conceal and lo and behold there was a snow globe in the toolbox just like the one left on the seat of meserves toyota which you knew about in the first place because brad called you in a panic after finding the car in one of his own parking spaces if meserve cut town with nora why would he leave his wheels where they were sure to be discovered at the very least he couldve put the toyota in noras garage which by the way is empty and avoided ticking off brad by the way he said crowbar he shook his head drank i said maybe noras not the only one with theatrical interests only reason we knew about the snow globe in the first place was brad brought it up when we talked to him at his house painting meserve as a gold digger what was that another misdirect or it was true and he had good reason to hate meserve he loosened his belt crushed ice with his molars and swallowed it picked up the check on you or the department i said for your information im trying out that bumper sticker wisdom spontaneous acts of kindness blah blah blah maybe the almighty will reward me with a close on this mess never knew you to be religious theres things that can get me praying walking to the parking lot i said three personal real estate parcels for billy and nora none for brad just like the birthday parties his childhood was one big exclusion because the dowds never stopped seeing him as anything but an imposition amelia recruited him for the kolor krew only because he could sing when his behavior grew troublesome she sent him away used and discarded he said persimmons id put money on a whole lot more antisocial behavior the point is the same patterns continued into adulthood as long as brad serves a purpose taking care of nora and billy he gets creature comforts but at the root hes hired help doesnt even own the house he lives in legally hes just another tenant in a sense its to his advantage spending other peoples money and living large but still it has to grate hired help passing himself off as the boss he said wonder how he finagled himself into that position probably by default nora and billy are incapable hes the caretaker and the payoff is cars clothes properties that he palms off as his image he pulls off the awshucks bigmoney thing beautifully angeline wassermans part of that world and she bought it good actor good at impressing women i said young naive women would be no challenge toris exhusband figured shed been dating someone with money a starving actress serving fish to make the rent on a north hollywood dump and a guy with a porsche same for michaela michaela never indicated to you that she was seeing anyone no but it wouldnt have come up my consult focused on her legal problems one thing she did make clear dylan was no longer her style maybe because shed found someone better mr hot wheels he said still doesnt answer the question of how brad got to pull the reins why would the dowds hand over all that control maybe they didnt but once the parents were dead he wrangled his way in as a trustee of the estate cozying up to the lawyers greasing someones palm making the case that he was the best choice someone with smarts who had billys and noras best interests at heart if nora and billy agreed why not once he was in he was set trustees dont come up for review unless someone complains about abuse of fiduciary responsibility nora and billy get their needs met everyones happy the playhouse and the family manse for her takeout pizza and a widescreen for billy meanwhile brad collects the monthly rent checks think hes siphoning off cash wouldnt shock me he strode to the parking attendants booth paid for both our cars i said now youre veering into mother teresa territory he gazed skyward and pressed his palms together hear that how about some evidentiary manna god helps those who help themselves i said time to check the small print on bnbs letters of incorporation first i want to face brad oneonone we sat in his unmarked talking about the best approach the final decision was another chat about reynold peatys shooting milo talking me scoping out the nonverbal cues mentioning the phone calls to armando vasquez if the timing seemed right we took separate cars to the strip mall on ocean park the door to bnb properties was locked and no one answered as milo turned to leave the door at the end of the secondfloor landing caught my eye sunny sky travel we specialize in tropical getaways posters in the window sapphire ocean emerald palm trees bronze people hoisting cocktails at the bottom brazil milo followed my gaze had the door open by the time i got there a young cateyed woman wearing a sleeveless raspberry top sat at a computer station typing soft eyes rubenesque roundness a nameplate on the desk said lourdestexeiros a handsfree phone headset rested atop a nest of black curls the walls were papered with more posters a revolving rack of brochures filled a corner she smiled at us said hold on a sec to the handsfree mouthpiece i went over to the rack found what i was looking for turneffe island belize posada la mandragora buzios brazil hotel monasterio tapir lodge pelicans pouch housed in adjacent compartments can i help you guys your neighbor a few doors down mr bradley dowd said milo flashing the badge how well do you know him the real estate guy did he do something his name came up in an investigation whitecollar crime he make you uneasy no i dont know him hes hardly ever at his office he just seems like a whitecollar guy if he did something dark eyes sharpened with curiosity milo said does he come to his office by himself usually with another guy i think its his brother cause he seems to be looking after him even though the other guy looks older sometimes he leaves him there by himself hes kind ofyou know not quite right the other guy billy dont know his name she frowned has he bothered you not really once i was here and the airconditioning wasnt working so i had the door open he came in said hi and just stood there i said hi back and asked if he was thinking of taking a trip he blushed said he wished and left only times i saw him after that was downstairs at the italian place getting food for his brother when he saw me he got real embarrassed like hed been caught doing something naughty i tried to make a little conversation but it was hard for him thats when i realized he wasnt normal how so kind of retarded you cant tell by looking he looks like a regular guy has brad ever come in here also just once a couple of weeks ago he introduced himself real friendly maybe too much you know slick exactly he told me he was thinking of taking a vacation in latin america and wanted information i offered to sit down with him and discuss choices but he said hed start with those pointing to the rack he grabbed a handful but i never heard back did he leave the country or something why would you ask that said milo the places we book she said in the movies they always have bad guys running to brazil everyone thinks theres no extradition treaty trust me anywhere without a treaty you wouldnt want to vacation ill bet anything else you want to tell us about him cant think of any okay thanks he leaned over her desk wed appreciate it if you didnt mention we were here asking about him of course not said lourdes texeiros should i be scared of him milo looked at her took in the black curls not at all another misdirection i said as we descended the stairs wanting us to think nora traveled with meserve either because hes protecting her or he made her and meserve disappear im betting on door number two all these years he takes care of a coupla mopes who just happen to be members of the lucky sperm club why change all that now nora had always deferred to him maybe that changed meserve shows up he said and captures her affections i said another selfstyled player goodlooking ambitious manipulative younger than brad but not unlike him could be thats what attracted nora to him in the first place whatever the reason she wasnt giving him up the way she had the others meserve worms his way into her affections and her pocketbook deeppocketbook brads got nominal power but he serves at the discretion of the estate noras a ditz but it would be hard to claim shes not of sound mind legally if she demanded control over her own assets it would pose a major complication for brad if she convinced billy to do the same it would be a disaster byebye façade banished when hes of no further use i said just like when he was a kid we walked in silence to the cars he said michaela and tori and the gaidelases and lord knows how many others get done for bloodlust and nora and meserve get done for money or a mixture of bloodlust and money he considered that nothing new about that i guess ricks relatives didnt just lose their lives in the holocaust their homes and their businesses and all their other possessions got confiscated take it all i said the ultimate trophy chapter we took the seville to santa monica canyon no porsche or any other car in brad dowds driveway lights out in the redwood house no reply to milo s knock i joined the traffic crawl on channel road finally made it down to the coast highway hit moderate flow from chautauqua to the colony once we got past pepperdine university the land yawned and stretched and the road got easy the ocean was slate hungry pelicans dove i made it to kanan dume road with some sunlight to spare turned up onto latigo canyon an assessors map of billy dowds property rested in milo s lap ten acres no building permits ever issued the seville s no mountain car and i slowed as the pitch steepened and the turns pinched nothing on the road until i neared the spot where michaela had run across screaming an old tan ford pickup was parked there on the turnoff an old tan man stood looking into the brush plaid shirt dusty jeans beer gut hanging over his buckle filmy white hair fluffed in the breeze a long hooked nose sliced sky smoke seeped from under the trucks hood milo said pull over the old man turned and watched us his belt buckle was stippled brass an oversized oval featuring a basrelief horse head you okay mr bondurant why shouldnt i be mr detective looks like an overheat it always does that pinhole leak in the radiator long as i feed it faster than it gets hungry im okay bondurant shuffled over to the truck reached in the passenger window and took out a yellow plastic jug of antifreeze liquid diet said milo youre sure the block wont crack you worried about me mr detective protect and serve find out anything about the girl still working on it sir bondurants eyes vanished in a mesh of fold and crinkle meaning nothing huh looks like youve been thinking about her the old mans chest swelled who says this is the spot where you saw her its also a turnoff said bondurant he hefted the antifreeze stared at the brush naked girl its like one of those stories you tell in the service and everyone thinks youre lyin he licked his lips few years back that woulda been something sucking in his belly he hitched his jeans the roll of fat shimmered down covered the horses eyes milo said know your neighbors dont got any real ones no neighborhood spirit around here let me tell you how its like said charley bondurant this used to be horse land my grandfather raised arabians and some tennessee walkers anything you could sell to rich folk some of the arabians made it to santa anita and hollywood park a couple of em placed everyone who lived here was into horses you could smell the shit miles away now its just rich folk who dont give a damn about anything they buy up the land for investment drive up on sunday stare for a coupla minutes dont know what the hell to do with themselves and go back home rich folk like brad dowd who whitehaired fellow midforties drives all kinds of fancy cars oh yeah him said bondurant guns those things too damn fast coming down the mountain exactly what i mean wearing those hawaiian shirts he here often once in a while all i see is the damn cars speeding by lots of ragtops thats how i know about the shirts he ever stop to talk you didnt hear me said bondurant he speeds by a gnarled hand slashed the air how often is once in a while said milo bondurant half turned his hawknose aimed at us you want a count if youve got charts and graphs ill take them mr bondurant the old man completed the turn hes the one who killed her dont know but youre thinking he could be milo said nothing bondurant said youre a quiet guy except when you want something from me let me tell you government never did much for the bondurant family we had problems no help from the government what kind of problems coyote problems gopher problems draught problems prowling hippie problems damned mourning cloak butterfly problems i say butterfly you think cute cause youre a city boy i think problem one summer they swarmed us laid their eggs in the trees destroyed half a dozen elms nearly polished off a sixtyfoot weeping willow know what we did we ddted em he folded his arms across his chest that aint legal you ask the government can i ddt nope against the law you say what should i do to protect my elm trees they say figure something out butterfly homicides not my thing said milo caterpillars all over the place pretty fastmoving for what they were said bondurant i had fun stepping on em the car guy kill the girl hes what we call a person of interest thats government doubletalk for im not gonna tell you more bondurant allowed himself half a smile milo said whens the last time you saw him maybe a couple of weeks ago that dont mean nothing im asleep by eight thirty someones driving past i aint gonna see it or hear it ever notice anyone with him nope ever see anyone else go to that property why would i said bondurant its above me a good mile and a half i dont go prowling around even when walter maclntyre owned the land i never went up there because everyone knew walt was nuts and excitable how so im talking years ago mr detective always interested in learning walter maclntyre didnt kill no girl hes been dead thirty years the car guy mustve bought the land from walters son whos a dentist walter was also a dentist big practice in santa monica he bought the land back in the fifties first city folk to buy my father said watch and see what happens and he was right walter started off like he was gonna fit in built this huge horse barn but never put no horses in it every weekend hed be up here driving a truck but no one could figure out why probably staring at the ocean and talking to himself about the russians what russians the ones from russia said bondurant communists thats what walter was nuts about convinced himself any minute they were gonna come swarming over and make us all potatoeatin communists my father had no use for communists but he said walter took it too far a little youknowwhat a finger rotated near his left ear obsessive you want to use that word fine bondurant hitched his jeans again and returned to his truck on bandy legs he put the antifreeze back on the passenger seat slapped the palm of his hand on the hood the smoke had reduced to occasional wisps he said ready to go hope you find whoever killed that girl beautiful thing damn shame the entrance to the property was unmarked i overshot and had to travel half a mile to find a spot wide enough for a uturn as is my tires were inches from blue space and i could feel milo s tension i coasted back slowly as he squinted at the plot map finally he spotted the opening ungated and shaded by twisting sycamores hardpack dirt ramping high above the canyon two sturns and the surface converted to asphalt continued to climb keep it slow said milo doing the coplaser thing with his eyes nothing to see but dense walls of oak and more sycamores a skimpy triangle of light on the horizon suggesting an end point then two acres in the land flattened to a mesa curtained by mountains and canopied by a cumulusflecked sky uncultivated acres had given way to bunchgrass coastal sage yellow mustard a few struggling loner oaks in the distance the asphalt drive cut through the meadow straight and black as a draftsmans line threequarters of the way to the back of the property stood a massive barn flanks of redwood board silvered by time dour slabface unbroken by windows shingle roof windblunted at the corners a ludicrously small front door cool air carried some of the mustard tang our way milo said no building permits issued folks round these parts dont truck with no guvment nowhere to conceal the seville completely i left it parked off the asphalt partially hidden by tree boughs and we walked milo s hand dangled over his jacket when we were fifty feet away the buildings dimensions asserted themselves three stories high a couple hundred feet wide he said thing that size but the doors too small to get a car through wait here while i check the back he took out his gun sidled around the barns north side was gone a few minutes returned with the weapon reholstered showandtell time double rear doors ten feet high were wide enough for a flatbed to drive through clean oiled hinges looked freshly installed a generator large enough to power a trailer park chugged behind us some kind of bird trilled but didnt show itself tire tracks scored the dirt a frenzy of tread marks too many to make sense of near the righthand door a padlock lay on the dirt i said you found it that way thats the official story the barn had no hayloft just a threestory cavity cathedralsized vaulted by stout weathered rafters walls tacked with white drywall dust filters like the one wed seen in the playhouse garage whirred every twenty feet or so an antique gravity gas pump stood to the right of an immaculate worktable shiny tools in a punchboard rack chamois cloths folded into neat squares tins of paste wax chrome polish saddle soap a flagstone spine wide enough for a fourhorse march ran up the center of the room both sides were lined with what dr walter maclntyre had conceived as horse stalls the doors were gone and the concrete floors were swept clean each compartment held a gaseating steed milo and i walked up the flagstone he looked into each car placed his hand on the hoods a quartet of corvettes two bathtub porsches one with a racing number on its door brad dowds newer silver roadster a black jaguar dtype lurked like a weapon unmindful of the cream packard clipper towering snobbishly in the next stall slot after slot filled with lacquered chromed sculpture red ferrari daytona the monstrous babyblue caddy brad had driven to noras house silver ac cobra bronze gto every hood cold milo straightened from the deep bend it took to inspect a yellow pantera walked to the far wall and surveyed the collection a boy and his hobbies the daytona costs as much as a house i said either he pays himself a huge salary or hes been siphoning unfortunately chrome dont bleed and its blood im after outside the barn he replaced the open lock and wiped it clean gazillion dollars worth of gocarts and he doesnt bother bolting i said he doesnt expect visitors confident fellow no reason not to be we began the return trip to the car walked around the south side ten steps later we stopped synchronized as a drill team a gray circle easy to spot the grass had died two feet from the perimeter leaving a halo of cold brown dirt steel disk nubbed with little metal pimples a lever folded flat pulled up easily when milo tried it an inch of lift evoked a pneumatic hiss he let it drop back into place i said bert the turtle who cartoon character in these booklets they gave out to schoolkids in the fifties teaching the basics of civil defense a bit before my time but i had a cousin who held on to hers bert was big on ducking into his shell knew proper bombshelter etiquette in my school it was dropdrills he said put your head between your knees and kiss your ass goodbye he toed the edge of the shelter lid ol walter really was worried about the communists and now brad reaps the benefits chapter milo walked around looking for a surveillance camera none i can see but who knows returning to the shelter lid he squatted lifted the handle a few more inches hiss hiss he let it fall back into place air lock i said keep nuclear fallout at bay play canasta while the bombs drop stretching prone he pressed his ear to steel you hear the cries of a damsel in distress like i do off in the distance a puny breeze barely ruffled the meadow the trilling bird had gone mute if clouds made noise the silence mightve relented i said loud and clear grounds to search he lifted the handle halfway peered in had to stand and put his weight into completing the arc the hatch gave way with a final whisper and he stepped back waited inched over to the opening looked down again snaking through a tube of corrugated steel was a spiral staircase metal treads stripped with friction pads bolts secured the flight to the underside of the rim the big question remains he said is he down there none of those cars have been driven recently but that could just mean hes bunked down for a while removing his desert boots he unsnapped his holster but left the gun nestled sitting at the edge of the opening he swung his legs in something happens you can have my bert the turtle lunch box he descended i took off my shoes and followed stay up there alex and be here alone if he shows up he started to argue stopped himself not because hed changed his mind staring at something at the bottom of the stairs was a door same gray steel as the hatch a shiny brass coat hook was screwed to the metal from the hook a white nylon cord hung taut its ends were looped around a pair of ears waxywhite ears the head they connected to was lean wellformed crowned by thick dark hair wellformed face but hideous dermis more paperlike than corporeal lumps distorted the cheekbones where stuffing had settled nearly invisible sutures held the mouth shut and pried the eyes open blue eyes wide with surprise glass the thing that had once been dylan meserve was as lifelike as a milliners mold milo crawled out his gullet throbbed he paced i got closer to the opening smelled the formaldehyde saw writing on the door an inch below the things chin shimmied down low enough i read neat printing black marker project completed below that a date and a time two am four days ago milo walked around for a while searching for evidence of burial returned shaking his head looked into the maw of the bomb shelter lord only knows what else is down there the moral dilemma is is there someone down there who can be saved i said if there is will attempting it make matters worse you could try calling him if hes down there maybe we can hear the ring if we can hear it hes probably heard us already at least hes not going anywhere i eyed the dangling head talk about probable cause he took out his cell and tried brad dowds number no sound from below his eyes widened mr dowd lieutenant sturgisno nothing huge but i thought maybe we could chat about reynold peatyjust tying up loose endsi was hoping more like tonight where are you we stopped by there earlieryeah we mustvelisten sir no no prob coming back to your house were not far camarilloactually it is related but im not at liberty to saysorryso can we youre sure today would be a lot easier mr dowdokay i understand sure tomorrow it is click he said hard day out in pasadena plumbing leaks blah blah blah mr cool and charming until i mentioned camarillo got this little catch in his voice happy to cooperate lieutenant but i just cant today you shook him up he needs to regroup maybe hell revert to what calmed him down when he was a kid whats that arts and crafts milo went down in the hole again pounded the door while keeping his distance from the thing on the coat hook sidled away from it and found a spot on the door where he could press his ear without touching dead flesh he knocked on the metal door then pounded climbing back out he brushed away nonexistent dirt if anyones in there i cant hear it and the doors bolted solid lowering the hatch he wiped it clean scuffed out the footsteps wed left in the dirt halo we put our shoes on and retraced our steps back to the car worked hard at obscuring our tracks i drove off the property and repeated the climb id taken when id overshot when we found nowhere to hide the seville within walking distance i turned around and descended a mailbox two properties down from billy dowds land was lettered with gold stickons the osgoods a sagging plankandchickenwire fence blocked a gravel drive flag up on the box milo got out and checked least a weeks worth lets trespass unlatching the gate he stood back as i drove through swung it closed hopped back in the osgoods owned a much smaller spread than billy dowd same oaksycamore combo a flat brown lawn in place of a meadow in the center a pale green fifties ranch house with a whitepebble roof squatted behind an empty corral no animals no animal smell half a dozen empty trash cans stood against one side a cheap prefab swing set tilted nearby and a childs plastic trike blocked the front door the sky had started to darken no light spat from any windows milo reached over the tricycle and knocked on the front door anyway left his card wedged between the door and jamb and a note under one of the seville s wiper blades as we walked back to the road i said whatd you write oh lucky citizens he said you are doing your bit for god and country we reentered billys property on foot found a watch spot just shy of where the trees met the meadow thirty feet back from the drive the ground was spongy with dead leaves and dust we sat against the stout trunk of a lowbranching oak nicely concealed milo and me bugs and lizards and unseen scampering things nothing to talk about neither of us wanted to talk the sky was bruised deep blue then black i thought of michaela and dylan camping down the road led to the hoax spot by brad dowd had he harbored plans of ending the game with a bloody surprise only to be stymied by michaelas escape was that reason to kill her or did she just fit some kind of role same for dylan i struggled to remember him from his photos not the thing time passed squeaks sounded above us leaves shivered then a delicate flutter of wings as a bat zipped out of the oak and circled high above the meadow then another then four great said milo when does the ominous soundtrack start da dum da dum he laughed i did too why not we took turns napping his second snooze lasted five minutes and when he shook himself awake he said shoulda brought water who knew wed be camping a boy scouts always prepared you scouted right yup me too if bsa only knew huh think anyones down in that hole hopefully not someone like dylan i said he rested his face in one hand a moment later if he doesnt show up tonight alex you know how itll have to go task force cant wait to write that warrant application yes your honor taxidermy night had settled in so completely it seemed permanent neither of us spoke for the next half hour when headlights yellowed the asphalt we were both wide awake fog lights engine purr the vehicles squarish bulk passed us fast and sped toward the barn we got to our feet stayed in the tree cover advanced the range rover came to a stop just to the left of the barns undersized front door then silenced a man got out the drivers side switched on a bug light above the door the bulb had a yellowgreen tint and it turned brad dowds white hair chartreuse he went around to the passenger side opened the door held a hand out to someone female petite a blousy jacket over trousers obscured her contours the two of them walked to the door and the woman waited as brad opened it moved into the yellow beam profile limned firm chin nubby little nose bobbed gray hair tinted olive by the light nora dowd said something that sounded perky brad dowd turned toward her spread his arms wide she rushed into the hug nothing sisterly about the gesture as her hands began caressing the back of his neck his hands cupped her rear she giggled her face tilted up as their mouths met long grinding kiss she reached down for his groin he laughed she laughed they went inside they were back moments later walking handinhand around the south side of the barn nora skipping brad said gorgeous night isnt this just the best nora said party time they reached the bombshelter hatch nora stood by fluffing her pageboy as brad worked the lever putting weight into it just as milo had ooh she said my big strong mayan got something beaucoup strong for you babe got something soft and sweet for you babe the lid popped open brad pulled out a small penlight and aimed it into the opening you were right i like him there talk about a welcome said nora knock knock knock he always did like to hang out nora laughed brad laughed she walked over and goosed him is that a nuclear missile in your pocket or are you just happy to see me atrocious mae west rendition brad kissed her and touched her and switched off the penlight lets get your stuff out of there im sure youre tired of mole life im ready she said but it was fun brad sat on the rim of the entry as he prepared to descend milo rushed him threw a choke hold around his neck yanked him back hard onto his back flipped him onto his belly just as quickly did the arm twist and cuffed him nora gave no struggle when i grabbed her and yanked her arms behind her milos knee bore down on the center of brads back brad gasped cant breathe if you can talk you can breathe i felt nora tense up was ready when she tried to break free soft arms not much muscle tone and her wrists were so small i could grip both with one hand i used two anyway pulled her hard enough to arch her torso youre hurting me leave her alone said brad leave him alone said nora family togetherness said milo touching its not what you think said nora hes not really my brother what is he she laughed not a pretty sound brad said wait until you hear from our lawyer whats the beef said milo taxidermus interruptus the two of them shut up chapter we marched them into the barn brad kept looking at nora she didnt look back milo said hold on to her alex as he propelled brad up the center path choosing the caddy he stashed brad in the front passenger seat looky here an aftermarket seat belt the sash was drawn over brads abdomen the skin on the back of his neck had gone as white as his hair he looked like a piece of marble statuary nora focused straight ahead her wrists felt soft as if bones had begun to melt she smelled of french perfume and cannabis milo made sure brad was secured then closed the caddys door as metal hit metal i felt a shock of tension course from noras shoulder to her hip she said nothing but her breathing quickened then she lifted her right foot and tried to drive a spike heel into my instep as i danced away she began twisting and spitting i probably hurt her maintaining control because she cried out or maybe that was acting milo strode over and took her check the workbench and see if you can find suitable bindings for ms funnel here nora dowd said brad raped me it was nonconsensual thats redundant said milo huh nonconsensual rape confusion in the doperuddy eyes milo said thats some art project hanging from the door nora began sobbing tearlessly dylan i loved him so much brad got jealous and did that horrible thing i tried to stop it youve got to believe me howd you try to stop it by reasoning with him intellectual debate said milo the merits of organic kapok versus polyurethane foam nora wailed oh my god this is terrible still dryeyed an onion wouldve helped she sniffed looked up at milo he said your shows closing due to bad reviews in a workbench drawer i found a roll of duct tape and two spools of heavy white rope milo said do it he had noras arms bent behind her back and shed switched from crying to cursing she swore louder as i bound her wrists tried to headbutt milo s arm by the time he managed to drag her across the barn from the caddy and get her in the passenger seat of a white thunderbird shed gone mute he said fun fun fun when milo takes it away and belted her in too the two of us stood there panting his face was sweaty and i felt moisture trickle down the side of my head my ribs hurt the back of my neck felt as if id encountered a blunt guillotine milo used his phone the sirens began as distant moans enlarged to nuclear trombone slides i was working hard at not thinking and the noise was sweet music eight sheriffs squad cars strobefest of blinking lights milo had his badge out right away a sliteyed sunburned sergeant in bodyconscious tans got out of the lead car lapd said milo keep your hands where i can see em multiple weapons trained on us we complied the sergeant swaggered toward us with that mixture of fear and aggression cops display when theyre faced with uncertainty his mustache was orange and bristly big enough to nest hummingbirds m pedersohn on his tag tight neck muscles a squint at the small print on milo s shield didnt warm the atmosphere freckled hands slapped on tan hips okayyou came up here for what jobrelated said milo lemme show you the dispatcher said something about a body said pedersohn thats partially accurate said milo what milo motioned round the south side of the barn pedersohn stood in place showing his men he couldnt be bossed around milo disappeared from view pedersohn went after him a peek inside the hatch turned the sergeants sunburn to chalk jesus he grabbed his mustache rubbed his teeth with the side of his index finger is that it aint plastic said milo jesusoh manhow longs it been there one question of many rearing their nasty little heads sarge have you called your lab guys umnot yet another look down our downtown guys are obviously going to need to deal with this then you should call them too pedersohn yanked his radio off his belt stopped squinted where are the suspects pretending to be taking a road trip what said pedersohn milo walked away from him again pedersohn looked at me i said multiple murder makes him cranky a deputy coroner named al morden who lived in the palisades was called to the scene he descended the stairs looked at the head refused to go farther until the shelter was declared safe lots of whome looks from the deputies sergeant mitchell pedersohn said our downtown guys should be here soon milo said my offer visàvis the lunch box stands alex pedersohn said what milo climbed down in the hole he was back moments later look ma no booby traps whats down there pedersohn demanded three separate shelters linked by tunnels think of it as your basic paranoid triplex one of thems got womens clothes and toiletries and a comfy bed pictures of our suspects on the walls kinda homey the others arent homey at all i meant in terms of evidence thats kinda

michaelas honda finally showed up parking garage of a bnb building in sierra madre towed to the motor lab as we speak congratulations as i was saying hows my prose eloquent i said please dont tell me you want to have lunch its way past lunchtime have your people call my people and well do dinner he sank down hard enough to make the desk chair groan enough with the glib macho posturing im thrashed and not ashamed to admit it get any sleep around five hours he said over five days time for a break i said it aint the workload thats keeping me up boyo its the reality as long as youve perused care to add any insights the playhouse was a talent pool in a much worse way than we imagined for nora it served double duty she got to feel omnipotent and she and brad both enjoyed selecting victims cold bitch he said arrogant too that time we came to her house she didnt even pretend to care about tori or michaela im not sure shes capable of pretending no acting chops howd she get so many people to believe in her by attracting a hungry crowd who thought they were getting a bargain emotionally needy people will swallow poisoned koolaid he sighed all those pretty folk auditioning having no idea what the part really was any luck identifying the other girls not yet no other male bodies show up yet but im not counting on this being the end of it theres still a dozen bnb properties we havent looked at and the backhoes have only dug up a corner of the property how do you see the hoax figuring in theater of the cruel nora and brad hatched it up for fun convinced dylan meserve he was a coconspirator but he was a human chess piece think he knew what was in store for michaela have you found any indication that he was aware of the other victims not so far he said but the way he had michaela pretend to choke him that coulda been foreshadowing her fate right or he had his own kinks i said well probably never find out unless some kind of diary shows up or brad or nora start talking so far theyre both dummying up he said i got brad on suicide watch like you suggested jail guard said brad thought that was funny maintaining the facade i said once it crumbles hell have nothing left youre the shrinkback to the hoax nora winkwinks at meserve pretends to be outraged and kicks michaela out of class why my bets still on setting michaela up for brads rescue she was broke unemployed hungry for attention frustrated careerwise if brad just happened to drive by in one of his shiny cars and struck up a conversation it couldve seemed like providence she already knew his face from the playhouse so there wouldnt be any stranger anxiety and brads connection to nora wouldve made michaela eager to hook up with him trying to get back in noras good graces or he mightve told her he had his own connections could help her career same for tori same for all of them seduction instead of abduction he said nice dinner good wine come up and enjoy the sunset at my malibu place wonder how michaela felt when she saw he was taking her back to latigo canyon if hed built up trust by wining and dining her it couldve kept her anxiety in check or he took her somewhere else first and restrained her if hes got another chamber of horrors it hasnt turned up yet one things for sure nothing went on at his house or noras not a speck of nasty at either i said why sully the home front when youve got a special place set aside for your hobbies these people are all about splitting speaking of hobbies any theory about why meserve and the gaidelases were the only specimens they preserved the neck wound says they thought of preserving michaela i said went so far as to insert a cannula in her neck then changed their minds no way to get inside their heads but the gaidelases and meserve fit some kind of fantasy if i could finish the file theres nothing in there about the past alex just more ugly im stuck with this but youre not go home and forget about all of it i said any luck decoding the scrambled disk he ran his tongue over cracked dry lips scratched his scalp rubbed his face hed shaved carelessly and a patch of white fur ran along his jaw his eyes were hooded and weary youve developed a hearing problem i repeated the question you never let go he said thats why you pay me the big bucks the disk is decoded and loaded in room four ive been watching it for the last hour hence my sage advice about going home no sense postponing the inevitable i said whats inevitable i was at the scene when you found the shelter someones going to subpoena me either the da or stavros menas both dowds tried to hire menas but nora got him and she wasnt feeling sisterly brads looking for new representation money talks and shes got the mike minus the millions brad skimmed he

to a sweatglossed dinnerplate face frizzy muttonchops clipped mustache reynold peatys hands lowered onto the girls shoulders his right thumb slipped under the right spaghetti strap toyed with the string slid it off the girl jumped and twisted craned to see him his left hand gripped the top of her head and held her in place hes hurting mouth shut said brad dowd dont want to catch flies peatys right hand reached around and clamped over the girls mouth she made frantic little muffled noises peatys hand slapped her so hard her eyes rolled back with one hand peaty pulled her up by her hair the other edged closer to her throat yeah he said perfect said brad this is reynold the two of you are going to improvise a little skit i flicked off the picture milo was wide awake looking sadder than id ever seen him i said you told me so and walked out of the room chapter the next week was emotional bouillabaisse trying with no success to get billy dowd more appropriate lodgings and regular therapy fending off erica weisss requests for another deposition so she could slam the final nail in hausers coffin ignoring increasingly strident calls from hausers defense attorney i hadnt been to the station since viewing the dvd six minutes watching a girl id never met the day i moved robin in i pretended my head was clear after i schlepped the last carton of her clothes into the bedroom she sat me down on the edge of the mattress rubbed my temples and kissed the back of my neck still thinking about it huh using unfamiliar muscles the ribs dont help dont waste energy trying to convince me she said this time i know what im getting myself into my contact with milo was limited to one eleven pm phone call his voice thick with fatigue wondering if i could take care of some ancillary stuff while he coped with the mountain of evidence on what the papers were calling the bomb shelter murders one nitwit columnist in the times trying to connect it to cold war paranoia i said sure whats ancillary stuff anything you can do better than me that came down to being a grief sponge a fortyfiveminute session with lou and arlene giacomo lasted two hours hed lost weight since id seen him and his eyes were dead she was a quiet dignified woman hunched over like someone twice her age i sat there as his rage alternated with her anguished accounts of life with tori the two of them trading off with a rhythm so precise it couldve been scripted as the time ground on their chairs edged farther and farther apart arlene was talking about toris confirmation dress when lou shot to his feet snarling and left my office she started to apologize changed her mind we found him down by the pond feeding the fish they left silently and neither answered my calls that night the clerk at their hotel said theyd checked out the widowed mother of brad dowds las vegas victim juliet dutchey turned out to be a former showgirl herself a veteran of the old flamingo hotel midfifties and still toned andrea dutchey blamed herself for not discouraging her daughter from moving to vegas then switched to squeezing my hand and thanking me for all id done i felt id done nothing and her gratitude made me sad dr susan palmer came in with her husband dr barry palmer a tall quiet wellcoiffed man who wanted to be anywhere else she started off all business crumpled fast he kept his mouth shut and studied the prints on my wall michaela brands mother was too ill to travel from arizona so i spoke with her over the phone her air machine hissed in the background and if she cried i didnt hear it maybe tears required too much oxygen i stayed on the line until she hung up without warning no relative of dylan meserve surfaced i phoned robin at her studio and said im finished you can come back i wasnt escaping she said just doing my job busy pretty much come home anyway silence sure i called albert beamish he said ive been reading about it apparently i can still be shocked its shocking stuff they were spoiled and indolent but i had no idea they were fiends beyond persimmons i said good god yes alex may i call you that sure mister beamish he chortled first off thanks for informing me that was uncharacteristically courteous especially coming from a member of the megeneration youre welcome i think he cleared his throat second do you golf no sir why not never got into it damn shame at least you drinkperhaps one day should you have time if you bring out the good stuff i only stock the good stuff young man what do you take me for two weeks after his arrest brad dowd was found dead in his cell the noose hed used to hang himself had been fashioned from a pair of pajama pants hed ripped into strips after lightsout hed been on suicide watch housed in the high power ward where things like that werent supposed to happen the guards had been diverted by a neighboring inmate pretending to go crazy and smearing his cell with feces that prisoner a gang leader and murder suspect named theofolis moomah underwent a miraculous recovery the moment brads body was cut down a search of moomahs cell uncovered a stash of extra commissary cigarettes and a roll of fiftydollar bills brads attorney a downtown court regular whod defended several gang leaders expressmailed his bill to the arraignment judge stavros menas esq called a press conference and bellowed that the suicide supported his claim that brad had been a mad svengali and his client an unwitting dupe the da offered a contradictory analysis get ready for a circus the animalrights people wouldnt mind i vowed to forget about all of it figured the whydunit would stop eating at me eventually when it didnt i got on the computer chapter the woman said i still cant believe you tracked me down that way her name was elise van syoc and she was a realtor working out of the coldwell banker encino office it had taken a long time but id found her using her maiden name ryan and a decadesold nickname ginger groovy bass player for the kolor krew her identity and a print of the photo id seen at the playhouse finally surfaced courtesy wwwnoshotwonderscom a cruelly mocking compendium of failed pop bands flung by the gargantuan slingshot that was the internet when i called her she said im not getting involved in any court stuff its not about court stuff what then curiosity i said professional and personal at this point im not sure i can separate the two that sounds complicated its a complicated situation youre not writing a book or doing a movie absolutely not a psychologistwhose therapist are you exactly i tried to explain my role she cut me off where do you live beverly glen own or rent own did you buy in a long time ago years ago have any equity total equity good for you dr delaware a person in your situation might find it a good time to trade up ever think about the valley you could get a much bigger place with more land and some cash back if youre openminded about the other side of the hill i pride myself on being openminded i said im also big on remembering people whove extended themselves for me some negotiator you absolutely promise i wont end up in court swear on my trust deed she laughed i said do you still play bass oh please more laughter i got asked to join because i had red hair she thought it was some kind of omen the kolor krew get it amelia dowd crazy mrs dthis is sure taking me back i dont know what you think i can tell you anything you remember about the family would help for your psychological insights for my peace of mind i dont understand its a horrendous case im pretty close to haunted hmm she said i guess i can sum it up in one sentence they were nuts could we discuss it anyway i said time and place of your choosing would you seriously consider a tradeup i hadnt thought about it but good time to start thinking okay i need lunch anyway what the heck meet me at lucretia on ventura near balboa hour and a half i need you to be prompt maybe i can show you life on the other side of the hill can be tasty the restaurant was big pale airy nearly empty i arrived on time elise van syoc was already there bantering with a young male waiter as she nursed a cosmopolitan and chewed on a single brazil nut ginger was no longer a redhead her coif was puffy collarlength ashblond tailored black pantsuit tailored face wide amber eyes a dealclosing smile accompanied a firm dry handshake youre younger than you sound dr delaware you too how sweet i sat down and thanked her for her time she glanced at a diamond movado did brad and nora really do what everyones saying i nodded how about some juicy tidbits you dont want to know but i do you really dont i said what its disgusting thats an understatement yuck she sipped her cosmopolitan tell me anyway i parceled out a few details elise van syoc said howd you get all that equity working with the police it cant pay very well ive done other things such as investments private practice consults very interestingyou dont write just reports why it sounds like a good bookim afraid this isnt going to be lunch just a drink ive got an escrow to close huge place south of the boulevard and theres really nothing i can tell you about the dowds other than they were all weirdos thats a good place to start the waiter came over lean dark hungryeyed i asked for a grolsch and he said for sure when he brought the beer elise van syoc clinked her glass against mine are you in a relationship im asking in terms of your space needs i am she grinned do you cheat i laughed she said nothing ventured and finished the last bit of brazil nut i said the kolor krew the kolor krew was a joke howd you get involved i said the other three members were sibs like i told you over the phone i was recruited by crazy mrs d because of your hair color that and she thought i had talent i was in the same class as nora at essex academy my dad was a surgeon and we lived on june street back then i thought i liked music took violin lessons switched to the cello then i conned my dad into getting me an electric guitar i sang like a goose on downers wrote ridiculous songs but try telling me i thought i was grace slick brad and nora really killed all those people every one of them why thats what im trying to figure out its so bizarre she said knowing someone who did that maybe i should write a book something new in her eyes now i understood why shed agreed to meet with me ive heard its tough i said writing she laughed i wouldnt do it myself id hire someone put my name on it there are some big best sellers who do that guess so you dont approve i said so amelia dowd thought you had talent maybe i shouldnt give you my story i have no interest in writing it up in fact if you do write a book you can quote me promise swear she laughed i said amelia dowd she heard me play cello in the essex academy orchestra and thought i was some kind of casals which tells you about her ear immediately she calls my mother they knew each other from school affairs teas at the wilshire country club acquaintances more than friends amelia tells mother shes putting together a band a wholesome family thing like the partridge family the cowsills the carpenters my hair makes me perfect i obviously have a gift and bass is just another form of cello right your mother bought that my mothers a conservative dar lady but shes always loved anything to do with showbiz the secret she tells everyone once she knows them long enough is that she dreamed of becoming an actress looked exactly like grace kelly but nice girls from san marino didnt do that even if nice girls from the philadelphia main line did she was always on me to join drama club but i refused ripe for mrs ds picking plus mrs d made it sound like a done deal big record contract pending interviews tv appearances did you believe it i thought it sounded idiotic and lame the cowsills my taste was big brother and the holding company i went along with it on the off chance something would happen and id be able to miss school did the dowd kids have any musical experience brad played a little guitar nothing fancy a few chords billy held a guitar like a spaz amelia was always adjusting it if he could carry a tune i never heard it nora could but she couldnt harmonize and she was always bored and spaced out shed never shown interest in anything other than drama club and clothes fashion plate i said not really she always dressed wrong way too fancy even at essex things had gotten casual was joining drama club her idea or her mothers hers i always thought she always pushed for the big parts never got them because she couldnt memorize lines very well a lot of people thought she was semiretarded everyone knew billy was i guess the assumption was it was hereditary what about brad smarter than those two anyone would be howd he adjust socially girls liked him she said he was cute but he wasnt what id call popular maybe because he wasnt around much why not one year hed be there the next year hed be gone at some outofstate school because of trouble hed gotten into but mrs d sure wanted him around the year she tried to start the band how far did you guys get i said halfway to nowhere when i showed up at their house for the first rehearsal and saw what utter bullshit it was going to be i went home and told mother forget it she said we ryans dont have quitting in our blood and notified me that if i wanted my own car id better buckle down she slapped one palm against the table then the other sounded a slow ponderous fourfour beat that was noras idea of playing drums billy was supposed to play rhythm guitar and hed managed to learn two screechy chords c and g i think but it sounded like a pig being strangled she screwed up her lips as if that wasnt bad enough we tried to sing pathetic that didnt stop crazy amelia from what dragging us to have promo pictures taken she found a discount photographer on highland near sunset some old fart who slurred his words and had fortyyearold blackandwhites of people youve never heard of taped to the walls of his studio she wrinkled her nose the place smelled like cat pee the costumes smelled like an oldage home im talking boxes of stuff all jumbled together we had to pose as indians pilgrims hippies you name it everyone in a different color varied garb and hue as mrs d phrased it was going to be our signature it worked for the village people so where are they once the photos were done it was agenttime one blowdried sleaze after another amelia flirted with every one of them im talking hip rub deep cleavage flash calculated eyelash flutter the works she had this blond bombshell thing going on played it to the hilt that doesnt sound like someone a conservative dar lady would trust i said funny about that isnt it i guess showbiz trumps everything you ask people in this city if theyd give up a vital organ for a walkon in a movie i guarantee you most would ask wheres the scalpel half the people in my business have had some connection to the industry come over to the office and youll see faces you vaguely recognize but cant place im talking the girl who served coffee to the banker lady on the beverly hillbillies during the second act of one episode shes still got that sag card in her purse works it into every conversation the smart ones learn that even if they make it it lasts as long as warm milk the others are like amelia dowd living in fantasyland twentyfour seven anyway thats the history of the kolor krew the project never got anywhere we mustve done two dozen auditions none lasted longer than fifteen seconds because the moment the agents heard us sing they winced we knew we were horrendous but amelia would be standing there snapping her fingers beaming when i got home id light up a doobie call my friends get all hystericalgiggly howd the dowd kids handle it billy was an obedient robot might as well have come with wheels nora spaced out just like always did the whole mona lisa thing brad was always hiding a smirk hes the one who finally spoke up not disrespectfully more like cmon were not getting anywhere amelia ignored him i mean literally just pretended he wasnt there and went on talking which was a switch in what way generally she paid plenty of attention to brad abusive not exactly special attention elise van syoc tried to impale a lime wedge on her stirrer this could be the important part of my book she seduced him or maybe it was the other way around i cant even say for sure something happened but the way those two related wasnt exactly motherson i never noticed until i started spending all that time with them it took a while to notice mrs d being odder than usual whatd she do she was no great shakes as a mom with billy and nora she was distant but with brad maybe she figured technically because brad was an adopted cousin and not her sonstill he was fourteen and she was a grown woman hip rubs and cleavage i said some of that but usually it was more subtle private smiles little looks that shed sneak in when she thought no one was watching occasionally id catch her brushing his arm and hed touch her back nora and billy didnt seem to notice i wondered if i was imagining it felt like an alien dropped on planet strange how did brad react sometimes hed pretend not to be aware of what she was doing other times hed clearly be liking it there was definitely some kind of chemistry going on how far it went i dont know i never told anyone not even my friends who thought in those terms back then but you were grossed out i was she said but when amelias own kids didnt seem bothered i started to wonder if i was seeing things small smile being fortified by puffs of an illegal herb fed my doubts amelia was seductive i said but she sent brad out of state several times maybe she wanted him out of the picture so she could deal with her own impulses would you call that a psychological insight sure would she smiled maybe i should be an analyst how many times is several id say three four because hed gotten into trouble those were the rumors did the rumors get specific i said your basic juvenile deliquency she said do they use that term anymore i do whatre we talking about theft truancy all that she frowned also some people in the neighborhood had pets that went missing and there was talk brad was involved why i honestly dont know thats just what was said thats important isnt it cruelty to animals is related to being a serial killer right its a risk factor i said when was the last time brad was sent away after amelia gave up on the band not right after maybe a month five weeks what convinced her to quit who knows one day she just called up mother and announced that there was no future for popular music as if shed made the choice what a loon and soon after that brad was gone guess she no longer needed himnow that were talking about it i realize how bad it mustve been for him used and discarded if he was bothered he didnt show it just the opposite he was always calm nothing got to him thats not normal either is it would you be my psychological consultant get a contract and well talk what about captain dowd what about him was he involved in the band he wasnt involved in anything i ever saw which wasnt that different from most fathers in the neighborhood but they were gone because of work captain dowd lived off inheritance never held down a job howd he spend his time golf tennis collecting cars and wine and whatever lots of vacations abroad or as my mother called them grand tours where europe i guess did he travel with his wife sometimes she said but mostly it was by himself that was the official story unofficially she played with her glass lets put it this way once i overheard father joking to a golf buddy about how the captain had joined the navy to be close to boys in tight blue uniforms he traveled with young men more like traveled to find young men the rumor mill i said keeps the grass green she said captain dowd being gay was public knowledge if my father knew everyone did he seemed like a nice enough man the captain but not much of a presence maybe thats why amelia flirted with everyone including brad i said i guess they were all crazy she said does that explain what happened its a start thats not much of an answer im still figuring out the questions amber eyes hardened and i thought shed come back with a sharp retort instead she stood and smoothed the front of her trousers gotta run i thanked her again for her time she said i know you were snowing me about keeping an open mind but id like to call you if a hot property comes up something really worth your while its a terrific time in the market for someone in your position how about a phone number i gave her a card paid for the drinks and walked her to her silver mercedes roadster she got in started up the car lowered the top ill probably never do a book hate writing maybe a cable movie good luck its strange she said after you called i tried to make sense of it looking back for something that couldve predicted it come up with anything this is probably irrelevant im sure im reading all kinds of crazy things into insignificant stuff but if what theyre saying about what happened to those people is truethe gory details i mean theyre true she drew a compact from her purse checked her face in the mirror tamped her hair put on a pair of sunglasses mrs d had this routine shed go through when we goofed off during rehearsal which was often and she lost her patience but was trying not to show it because she wanted to be one of the gang like mama cowsill or shirley jones cool mom i said as if thats ever possibleanyway what shed do is start clapping her hands to quiet us down then shed make like she was the red queen from alice in wonderland the first few times she announced it i am the red queen and i will be obeyed eventually we caught on whenever she clapped it was going to be a red queen routine which consisted of her spouting lines like im five times richer and cleverer than you or what use is a child with no meaning i took it for just another of her eccentricities but maybe she went silent maybe what this will probably sound literal to you after spouting all this lewis carroll stuff shed scrunch up her eyebrows and cackle and raise a finger in the air and start waving it around like she was testing the wind if we still werent paying attention which we usually werent shed let out this honking noise couldve been a mans it was so deep then shed make goofy eyes and shake her chest like a stripper gone berserk she was big up there it was ridiculous running her hands over her own narrow torso finally if we still werent toeing the line then shed lower her hand like this and run it across her throat and place both hands on her hips and scream off with your heads it was silly but creepy i hated when she did it nora and billy didnt seem to care and brad thats the thing she said brad used to smile one of those private smiles like it was a private joke between him and amelia you know about his hobby right he was really into it back then had all kinds of knives used to carry knives around i never saw him hurt anyone and he was never threatening at least not to me so it probably means nothing amelia with her hand over her throat i said nothing elise van syoc said right chapter i drove over the hill thinking about what family had meant to the dowd kids boundaries were to be blurred people were to be used performance was all brad had been abandoned taken in reluctantly exploited expelled brought back to be pressed into service by a woman who resented him and lusted for him years later after her death hed wormed his way back into the family and attained the power role knowing hed never belonged never would by that time hed murdered juliet dutchey maybe other women yet to be discovered reserving his boyhood hobby for three victims back when milo and i had been theorizing hed wondered out loud about cathy and andy gaidelas being parental symbols you guys still believe in the oedipal thing more than i did a few weeks ago why meserve the only time id seen brad express overt anger was when he talked about meserve young slick manipulator brad seeing himself two decades younger despite the smooth manner the clothes the cars the image did it all boil down to selfhatred a body hanging in a jail cell said maybe used and discardedit didnt explain the extent of the horror it never does i wondered why i kept trying i reached mulholland coasted down past dream houses and other encumbrances unable to let go brad had been the ultimate actor protecting billy and nora bedding her stealing from both of them pressing his own cousin into murderous service then setting him up to be executed coming on to another cousin a female cop at the same time he was being investigated by her colleagues in a showgirls disappearance why not why would blood ties mean anything to him marcia peaty had no problem seeing brad as evil but she was certain cousin reynold had just been a pennyante loser excop but way off shed be dealing with that for a long time if she were my patient id work at getting her to see she was human nothing less nothing more when you got down to it rules and exceptions were hard to separate church deacons sneak into dark houses and strangle families diplomats and ceos and other respectable types embark on sex tours of thailand anyone can be fooled but for arrogance brad and nora mightve plied their hobby for years how long would it have taken before he looted the trust fund completely and decided nora was no longer useful the jet card and the island off belize said not long did nora numbed callous perpetually stoned have any idea her life had been saved what kind of life lay ahead for her initial severe depression for sure once the reality of prison life set in if she was deep enough to suffer if she coped and set up a prison theater things could get rosier casting directing experiencing a few years down the line she might even merit one of those rehabmiracle puffpieces in the times or maybe i had too much faith in the system and nora would never see the inside of a penitentiary cell back on mccadden place walking her stuffed dog stavros menas was wasting no opportunity to shout that she was just another of brads victims milo and i had heard her joking about meserves head but both of us could be made to look foolish on the stand and la juries distrusted cops and shrinks the disks showed her having consensual sex with brad and meserve but nothing more no forensic evidence tied her directly to the killings and nowadays juries expected nifty science menas would rack up billable hours trying to get everything ruled inadmissible maybe hed put nora on the stand and shed finally get a starring role one way or the other hed earn his million the lawyers vying for stewardship of billy dowds diminished life would also do fine still no callback from the judge whod warehoused billy and sentenced him to eating soft food with plastic utensils the time id visited hed called me his friend put his his head on my shoulder and wet my shirt with his tears what use is a child with no meaning amelia dowd had no idea what crop shed cultivated i wondered what captain william dowd junior had known as hed ambled abroad on grand tours both of them perishing in a car crash big cadillac veering off the road and over a cliff on route on the way to the pebble beach auto show no suspicion it hadnt been an accident but brad had been in town the week theyd set out and brad knew cars milo had raised that with the da the prosecutors agreed it was interesting theoretically but the evidence was long gone brad was dead time to concentrate on building a case against a living defendant time for me to robins truck was parked in front of the house i expected to find her in a back room drawing or reading or napping she was waiting for me in the living room sitting on the big couch with her legs tucked under her a sleeveless skycolored dress set off her hair her eyes were clear and her feet were bare learn anything she said that maybe i shouldve taken up accounting she got up took me by the hand led me toward the kitchen sorry not hungry i said i wouldnt expect you to be we continued into the service porch a plastic pet crate sat in front of the washerdryer not spikes crate shed junked that not in the spot spikes crate had occupied off slightly to the left robin kneeled unlatched the grate drew out a wrinkly fawncolored thing flat face rabbit ears moist black nose huge brown eyes met robins then aimed at me you can name her she said her i figure you deserved that no more macho competition shes from a championship line with great disposition she rubbed the puppys belly handed her over warm as toast almost small enough to fit in one hand i tickled a fuzzy blunt chin a pink tongue shot out and the puppy craned the way bulldogs do one of the rabbit ears flopped over itll take a couple of weeks before they stay up said robin spike had been a leadboned package of muscle and grit this one was butterysoft how old i said ten weeks runt of the litter the breeder promises shell fill in the puppy began licking my fingers i brought her closer to my face and she tonguebathed my chin she smelled of dog shampoo and that innate perfume that helps puppies get nurtured i scratched her chin again she jutted her mandible in response licked my fingers some more made a throaty sound closer to feline than canine love at first sight said robin she petted the puppy but the puppy pressed closer to me robin laughed im really in for it that so i asked the puppy or is it just infatuation the puppy stared at me followed every syllable with those huge brown eyes lowering her head she nuzzled my cheek purred some more butted until her knobby little cranium was buried under my chin squirming she finally found a position she liked closed her eyes fell asleep snored softly mellow i said we could use a bit of that dont you think we could i said thanks sure
