nature are born of custom montaigne prologue september autumn is a glorious season despite its frequent use as a metaphor for approaching death and dying nowhere is its invigorating ambience and riotous color more apparent than in the northeastern united states even in early september the hot hazy humid days of the new england summer are progressively replaced by crystalline days with cool clear dry air and azure skies september was a case in point not a cloud marred the translucent sky from maine to new jersey and within the macadam maze of downtown boston and the concrete grid of new york city the temperature was a comfortable seventyseven degrees fahrenheit as the day drew to a close two doctors coincidently and reluctantly fumbled to pull their ringing cell phones from their belt clips in their respective cities neither was happy about the intrusion each was fearful that the melodic ring would herald a crisis that would require their professional attention and presence an inopportune interruption as both individuals were anticipating interesting personal evening activities unfortunately the doctors intuitions were correct since both calls were to give credence to autumns metaphorical reputation the call in boston concerned someone about to die with the acute onset of chest pain profound weakness and difficulty breathing while the one in new york was about someone recently but clearly already dead both situations were emergencies for the respective physicians necessitating that they put their private plans on hold what the doctors didnt know was that one of the calls would initiate a sequence of events that would seriously impact them both put both in jeopardy and turn them into bitter enemies and the other call would ultimately put a different spin on the first boston massachusetts pm dr craig bowman let his arms dangle at his sides for a moment to relieve his aching forearm muscles he had been standing in front of the mirror that was attached to the backside of the closet door struggling to tie a black formal bow tie hed worn a tuxedo at most a half a dozen times in his life the first time at his highschool prom and the last time when he got married and on all of those previous occasions hed been satisfied to snap on a pretied model that came with the rented tux but now in his reincarnation of himself he wanted the genuine article hed bought himself a brandnew tuxedo and wasnt about to settle for a fake tie the trouble was he really didnt know how to tie it and had been embarrassed to ask the salesclerk at the time he hadnt been worried since he figured it would somehow be similar to tying his shoes sadly it was proving to be a lot different and he had been attempting to tie the blasted thing for a good ten minutes luckily leona his new and dynamite secretarycumfile clerk and even newer companion had been preoccupied with her makeup in the bathroom worst case hed have to ask her if she knew how to do it craig really didnt want to do that they hadnt been seeing each other socially that long and craig preferred that she maintain her apparent belief in his sophistication fearing hed otherwise never hear the end of it leona had what his matronly receptionistsecretary and his nurse called a mouth tactfulness wasnt her strong suit craig shot a quick glance in leonas direction the door to the bathroom was ajar and she was doing her eyes but all he could see was a side view of her curvaceous twentythreeyearold derriere covered with a lustrous pink silk crepe she was on her tiptoes leaning over the sink to get closer to the mirror a fleeting selfsatisfied smile passed over craigs face as he thought of them walking down the aisle of symphony hall that evening which was why they were getting decked out in their finery compensating for being a mouth leona was a looker especially in the lowcut dress that they had recently bought at neiman marcus he was sure she was going to turn some heads and that hed be dodging some envious looks from fellow fortyfiveyearold men craig realized such feelings were rather juvenile to say the least but hed not felt them since that first time hed worn a tuxedo and he was going to enjoy it craigs smile faltered when the question occurred to him whether any of his and his wifes friends might be there in the audience his goal certainly wasnt to humiliate anyone or hurt anyones feelings yet he doubted hed see any acquaintances because he and his wife had never gone to the symphony nor had any of their few friends who were mostly overworked physicians like himself taking advantage of the citys cultural life hadnt been part of their particular suburban lifestyle thanks to the hours a typical practice of medicine demanded craig had been separated from alexis now for six months so it wasnt unreasonable to have a companion he didnt think it was an age issue as long as he was with an adult woman of a reasonable postcollege age it shouldnt matter after all being seen out and about with a date was going to happen sooner or later as active as hed become in addition to regular attendance at the symphony hed become a regular at a new gym as well as at the theater the ballet and a number of other activities and social gatherings that normal educated people participated in in a worldclass city since alexis had consistently refused to go along with his new persona right from its inception he now felt he was justified to accompany whomever he wanted he wasnt going to be held back from becoming the person he aspired to be hed even joined the museum of fine arts and was looking forward to exhibition openings despite never having ever been to one hed had to sacrifice enjoying such cultural activities during the arduous and isolating effort of becoming a doctor particularly becoming the best doctor he could be which meant that for ten years of his adult life he was absent from the hospital only to sleep and then once hed finished his specialty training in internal medicine and hung out his proverbial shingle hed had even less time for personal pursuits of any kind including unfortunately much family life hed become the archetypal intellectually provincial workaholic with no time for anyone but his patients but all that was changing and regrets and guilt particularly about family issues had to be put on hold the new dr craig bowman had left behind the lockstep hurried unfulfilling and uncultured workaday life he knew that some people might call his situation a midlife crisis but he had a different name for it he called it a rebirth or more accurately an awakening over the previous year craig had become committed to even obsessed with transforming himself into a more interesting happier wellrounded better person and because of it a better doctor on the desk of his intown apartment was a pile of catalogues from various local universities including harvard he intended to take classes in humanities maybe one or two a semester to make up for lost time and best of all thanks to his makeover hed been able to return to his beloved research which had completely fallen by the wayside once hed started practice what had started out in medical school as a remunerative job doing scut work for a professor studying sodium channels in muscle and nerve cells had turned into a passion when he was elevated to the level of a fellow researcher craig had even coauthored several scientific papers to great acclaim while hed been a medical student and then resident now he was back at the bench able to spend two afternoons a week in the lab and he loved it leona called him a renaissance man and although he knew the description was premature he thought that with a couple of years of effort he might come close the origin of craigs metamorphosis had been rather sudden and had taken him by complete surprise just over a year previously and quite serendipitously his professional life and practice had changed dramatically with the double benefit of significantly raising his income as well as his job satisfaction all at once it had become possible for him truly to practice the kind of medicine hed learned in medical school where patients needs eclipsed the arcane rules of their insurance coverage suddenly craig could spend an hour with someone if the patients situation required it appropriately it had become his decision in one fell swoop hed been freed of the dual scourge of falling reimbursements and rising costs that had forced him to squeeze more and more patients into his busy day to get paid he no longer had to fight with insurance personnel who were often medically ignorant hed even started making house calls when it was in the patients best interest an action that had been unthinkable in his former life the change had been a dream come true when the offer had unexpectedly come over the transom hed told his wouldbe benefactor and now partner that hed have to think about it how could he have been so stupid not to agree on the spot what if he had missed the opportunity to grab the brass ring everything was better save for the family problem but the root of that issue was how submerged hed been from day one in his former professional situation ultimately it had been his fault which he freely admitted he had let the exigencies of current medical practice dictate and limit his life but now he certainly wasnt drowning so maybe the family difficulties could be resolved in the future given enough time maybe alexis could be convinced how much better all their lives could be meanwhile he resolved to enjoy bettering himself for the first time in his life craig had free time and money in the bank with an end of the bow tie in each hand craig was about to try tying it again when his cell phone rang his face fell he glanced at his watch it was ten after seven the symphony was to start at eight thirty his eyes switched to the caller id the name was stanhope damn craig blurted with emphasis he flipped open his phone put it to his ear and said hello doctor bowman a refined voice said im calling about patience shes worse in fact this time i think shes really sick what seems to be the problem jordan craig asked as he turned to glance back into the bathroom leona had heard the phone and was looking at him he mouthed the name stanhope and leona nodded she knew what that meant and craig could tell from her expression that she had the same fear he had namely that their evening was now in jeopardy if they arrived at the symphony too late theyd have to wait for the intermission to sit down which meant forgoing the fun and excitement of the entrance which both had been keenly anticipating i dont know jordan said she appears unnaturally weak she doesnt even seem to be able to sit up besides weakness what are her symptoms i think we should call an ambulance and go to the hospital shes greatly perturbed and shes got me concerned jordan if you are concerned then i am too craig said soothingly what are her symptoms i mean i was just there at your home this morning dealing with her usual medley of complaints is it something different or what patience stanhope was one of less than a halfdozen patients that craig labeled problem patients but she was the worst of the group every doctor had had them in every kind of practice and found them tedious at best and maddening at worst they were the patients who persisted day in and day out with a litany of complaints that were for the most part completely psychosomatic or totally phantom and that could rarely be helped by any therapy including alternative medicine craig had tried everything with such patients to no avail they were generally depressed demanding frustrating and timeconsuming and now with the internet quite creative with their professed symptoms and desire for lengthy conversations and handholding in his previous practice after ascertaining their hypochondriasis beyond a reasonable doubt craig would arrange to see them as infrequently as possible mostly by shunting them off to the nurse practitioner or to the nurse or rarely to a subspecialist if he could get them to go particularly to see a psychiatrist but in craigs current practice setup he was limited in his ability to resort to such ruses meaning the problem patients were the only bugbears of his new practice representing only three percent of his patient base as reported by the accountant they consumed more than fifteen percent of his time patience was the prime example he had been seeing her at least once a week over the last eight months and more often than not in the evening or at night as craig frequently quipped to his staff she was trying his patience the comment never failed to get a laugh this is far different jordan said its entirely dissimilar to her complaints last evening and morning how so craig asked can you give me some specifics he wanted to be as certain as possible about what was going on with patience forcing himself to remember that hypochondriacs occasionally actually got sick the problem with dealing with such patients was that they lowered ones index of suspicion it was like the allegory of the shepherd boy crying wolf the pain is in a different location okay thats a start craig said he shrugged for leonas benefit and motioned for her to hurry if the current problem was what he thought he wanted to take leona along on the house call how is the pain different the pain this morning was in her rectum and the lower part of her belly i remember craig said how could he forget bloating gas and problems with elimination described in disgustingly exquisite detail were the usual complaints where is it now she says its in her chest shes never complained of pain in her chest before thats not quite true jordan last month there were several episodes of chest pain thats why i gave her a stress test youre right i forgot about that i cant keep up with all her symptoms you and me both craig wanted to say but he held his tongue i think she should go to the hospital jordan repeated i believe shes having some difficulty breathing and even talking earlier she managed to tell me she had a headache and was sick to her stomach nausea is one of her common afflictions craig interjected so is the headache but this time she threw up a little she also said she felt like she was floating in the air and kind of numb those are new ones im telling you this is altogether different is the pain visceral and crushing or is it sharp and intermittent like a cramp i cant say could you ask her it may be important okay hold the line craig could hear jordan drop the receiver leona came out of the bathroom she was ready to craig she looked like she belonged on the cover of a magazine he indicated as much by giving her a thumbsup she smiled and mouthed whats happening craig shrugged keeping the cell phone pressed to his ear but twisting it away from his mouth looks like im going to have to make a house call leona nodded then questioned are you having trouble with your tie craig reluctantly nodded lets see what i can do leona suggested craig raised his chin to give her more room to work as jordan came back on the line she says the pain is terrible she says its all of those words you used craig nodded that sounded like the patience he was all too familiar with no help there does the pain radiate anywhere like to her arm or neck or any other place oh my word i dont know should i ask her please craig replied after a few deft maneuvers leona pulled on the looped ends of the bow tie and tightened the knot she had made after a minor adjustment she stepped back not bad even if i say so myself she declared craig looked at himself in the mirror and had to agree she had made it look easy jordan s voice came over the phone she says its just in her chest are you thinking shes experiencing a heart attack doctor it has to be ruled out jordan craig said remember i told you she had some mild changes on her stress test which is why i advised more investigation of her cardiac status even though she was not inclined i do remember now that you mention it but whatever the current affliction i believe its progressing i believe she even appears rather blue okay jordan ill be right there but one other quick question did she take any of those antidepressant pills i left this morning is that important it could be although it doesnt sound like she is having a drug reaction we have to keep it in mind it was a new medication for her thats why i told her not to start until tonight when she went to bed just in case they made her dizzy or anything i have no idea if she did or not she has a lot of medication she got from dr cohen craig nodded he knew very well that patiences medicine cabinet looked like a miniature pharmacy dr ethan cohen was a much more liberal prescriber of medication than craig and he had originally been patiences physician it had been dr cohen who had offered craig the opportunity to join his practice but he was currently craigs partner more in theory than in fact the man was having his own health issues and was on an extended leave that might end up being permanent craig had inherited his entire current roster of problem patients from his absent partner to craigs delight none of his problem patients from his previous practice had decided to pay the required fee to switch to the new practice listen jordan craig said im on my way but make an effort to find the small vial of sample pills i gave patience this morning so we can count them i will give it my best effort jordan said craig flipped his phone shut he looked at leona ive definitely got to make a house call do you mind coming with me if it turns out to be a false alarm we can go directly to the concert and still make the entree their house is not that far from symphony hall fine by me leona said cheerfully while pulling on his tuxedo jacket craig went quickly to his front closet from the top shelf he got his black bag and snapped it open it had been a gift from his mother when hed graduated from medical school at the time it had meant a mountain to craig because he had an idea of how long his mom had to have squirreled money away without his father knowing to afford it it was a sizable oldfashioned doctors bag made of black leather with brass hardware in his former practice craig had never used it since he didnt make house calls but over the last year hed used it a lot craig tossed a bunch of supplies he thought he might need into the bag including a bedside assay kit for myocardial infarction or heart attack biomarkers science had advanced since hed been a resident back then it could take days to get the results back from the lab now he could do it at the bedside the assay wasnt quantitative but that didnt matter it was proof of the diagnosis that was important also from the top shelf he pulled down his portable ecg machine which he handed to leona when craig had formally separated from alexis he had found an apartment on beacon hill in the center of boston it was a fourthfloor walkup duplex on revere street with good sunlight a deck and a view over the charles river to cambridge the hill was central to the city and fulfilled craigs needs superbly especially since he could walk to several good restaurants and the theater district the only minor inconvenience was the parking problem he had to rent a space in a garage on charles street a fiveminute walk away what are the chances we can get away in time for the concert leona asked when they were on their way in craigs new porsche speeding westward on storrow drive craig had to raise his voice against the whine of the engine jordan seems to think this might be legit thats what scares me living with patience he knows her better than anybody how can he live with her shes such a pain in the ass and he seems like quite a refined gentleman leona had observed the stanhopes in the office on a couple of occasions i imagine there are benefits i have a sense she is the one with the money but who knows peoples private lives are never what they seem including my own until recently he gave leonas thigh a squeeze i dont know how you have such patience with such people leona marveled no pun intended its a struggle and between you and me i cant stand them luckily they are a distinct minority i was trained to take care of sick people hypochondriacs to me are the same as malingerers if i had wanted to be a psychiatrist i would have studied psychiatry when we get there should i wait in the car its up to you craig said i dont know how long ill be sometimes she corners me for an hour i think you should come in it would be boring to sit in the car it will be interesting to see how they live hardly the average couple the stanhopes lived in a massive threestory georgianstyle brick house on a sizable wooded lot near the chestnut hill country club in an upscale area of brighton massachusetts craig entered the circular drive and pulled up to the front of the building he knew the route all too well jordan had the door open as they mounted the three steps craig had the black bag leona carried the ecg machine she is upstairs in her bedroom jordan said quickly he was a tall meticulous man dressed in a dark green velvet smoking jacket if he marveled at craig and leonas formal attire he didnt let on he held out a small plastic vial and dropped it in craigs hand before turning on his heel it was the free sample bottle of zoloft craig had given patience that morning craig could see immediately that one of the six pills was missing obviously she had started the medication earlier than craig had suggested he pocketed the vial and started after jordan do you mind if my secretary comes along craig called out she can possibly lend me a hand leona had demonstrated a few times in the office her willingness to help out craig had been impressed by her initiative and commitment from the start long before he thought of asking her to a social event he was equally impressed that she was taking night courses at bunker hill community college in charlestown with the idea of eventually getting some sort of medical degree as a technician or nurse for him it added to her appeal not at all jordan responded over his shoulder waving for them to follow he had started up the main staircase that skirted the palladian window above the front door separate bedrooms leona whispered to craig as they hurried after jordan it kind of defeats the purpose i thought that was only in old movies craig didnt respond they quickly descended a long carpeted hallway and entered the feminine master suite upholstered in a square mile of blue silk patience her eyelids heavy was lying in a kingsize bed semipropped up with overstuffed pillows a servant in a demure french maids outfit straightened up she had been holding a moist cloth against patiences forehead with a quick glance at patience and without saying a word craig rushed over to the woman dropped the bag on the bed next to her and felt for a pulse he snapped open the bag and pulled out his bloodpressure cuff and stethoscope as he wrapped the cuff around patiences right arm he barked to jordan call an ambulance with only a slight elevation of his eyebrows to indicate he had heard jordan went to the nightstand phone and dialed he gave the servant woman a wave of dismissal good lord craig murmured as he tore off the cuff he snapped the pillows from behind patiences body and her torso fell back onto the bed like a rag doll he yanked down the covers and pulled open her negligee then listened briefly to her thorax with his stethoscope before motioning to leona to give him the ecg machine jordan could be heard speaking with the operator craig fumbled to unsnarl the ecg leads and quickly attached them with a bit of conducting jelly is she going to be all right leona asked in a whisper who the hell knows craig answered shes cyanotic for christs sake whats cyanotic theres not enough oxygen in her blood i dont know if its because her heart isnt pumping enough or shes not breathing enough its one or the other or both craig concentrated on the ecg machine as it spewed out a tracing there were only little blips widely spaced craig tore off the output strip and took a quick closer glance at it before jamming it into his jacket pocket he then snapped the leads off patiences extremities jordan hung up the phone the ambulance is on its way craig merely nodded as he rapidly rummaged in his bag and pulled out an ambu breathing bag he placed the mask over patiences nose and mouth and compressed the bag her chest rose easily suggesting good ventilation could you do this craig asked leona as he continued to ventilate patience i guess so leona said hesitantly she squeezed between craig and the headboard and took over the assisted breathing craig showed her how to maintain a seal and keep patiences head back he then glanced at patiences pupils they were widely dilated and unreactive it wasnt a good sign with the stethoscope he checked patiences breath sounds she was being aerated well back in his black bag craig pulled out the assay kit for testing for the biomarkers associated with a heart attack he tore open the box and pulled out one of the plastic devices he used a small heparinized syringe to get some blood from a major vein shook it and then put six drops into the sample area he then held the device under the light well thats positive he said after a moment he then haphazardly tossed everything back into his bag what is positive jordan asked her blood is positive for myoglobin and troponin craig said in laymans terms it means shes had a heart attack with his stethoscope craig ascertained that leona was ventilating patience appropriately so your initial impression was correct jordan commented hardly craig said im afraid i have to say she is in a very bad situation i was trying to communicate as much on the phone jordan said stiffly but at the moment i was referring to the heart attack she is worse off than you led me to believe craig said as he got out some epinephrine and atropine along with a small bottle of intravenous fluid i beg your pardon i was quite clear she was progressively getting worse you said she was having a little trouble breathing actually she was hardly breathing at all when we got here you could have let me know that you said you believed she was rather blue whereas i find her totally cyanotic craig deftly started an intravenous infusion he taped the needle in place and gave the epinephrine and atropine he hung the small iv bottle from the lampshade with a small s hook he had made for that specific purpose i was doing the best i could to communicate to you doctor i appreciate that craig said holding up his hands in a conciliatory gesture im sorry i dont mean to be critical im just concerned about your wife what we need to do now is get her to the hospital as quickly as we can she needs to be ventilated with oxygen and she needs a cardiac pacer on top of that im certain she is acidotic and must be treated for it the undulating sound of the approaching ambulance could be heard in the distance jordan left to go downstairs to let in the emergency technicians and direct them up to patiences room is she going to make it leona asked as she continued compressing the ambu bag she doesnt look quite as blue to me youre doing a great job with that breathing bag craig responded but im not optimistic since her pupils havent come down and shes so flaccid but well know better when we get her over to newton memorial hospital get some blood work get her on a respirator and a pacer would you mind driving my car i want to ride in the ambulance in case she arrests if she needs cpr i want to do the chest compressions the emts were an efficient team it was a man and a woman who obviously had worked together for some time since they anticipated each others moves they swiftly moved patience to a gurney brought her downstairs and loaded her into the ambulance within just a few minutes of their arrival at the stanhope residence they were back on the road recognizing a true emergency they had the siren screaming and the woman drove accordingly en route the male emt phoned ahead to newton memorial to advise them of what to expect patiences heart was still beating but barely when they arrived a staff cardiologist whom craig knew well had been summoned and she met them on the unloading dock patience was rolled inside with dispatch and an entire team began to work on her craig told the cardiologist what he could including the results of the biomarker assay confirming the diagnosis of myocardial infarction or heart attack as craig had anticipated patience was first put on a respirator with one hundred percent oxygen followed by an external pacemaker unfortunately it was quickly confirmed that she then had the problem of pea or pulseless electrical activity meaning the pacemaker was creating an image on the electrocardiogram but the heart was not responding with any beats one of the residents climbed up onto the table to start chest compressions blood work came back and the blood gases were not bad but the acid level was close to the highest the cardiologist had ever seen craig and the cardiologist looked at each other both knew from experience that pea had a dismal outcome with a hospital inpatient even when caught quickly the situation with patience was far worse since she had come in by ambulance after several hours of attempting all possible efforts to get the heart to respond the cardiologist took craig aside craig was dressed in his formal shirt complete with bow tie still in place blood spatter adorned the upper part of his right arm and his tuxedo jacket hung on a spare iv pole against the wall it must have been extensive cardiac muscle damage the cardiologist said its the only way to explain all the conduction abnormalities and the pea things might well have been different if we had been able to start on her a bit sooner from your description of the time course i imagine the size of the initial infarct significantly grew craig nodded he looked back at the team that was still doing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on patiences slim frame ironically her color had returned to near normal with the oxygen and the chest compressions unfortunately they had run out of things to try did she have a history of cardiovascular disease she had an equivocal stress test a few months ago craig said it was suggestive of a mild problem but the patient refused any followup studies to her detriment the cardiologist said unfortunately her pupils have never come down suggesting anoxic brain damage with that in mind what do you want to do its your call craig took in a deep breath and let it out noisily as a reflection of his discouragement i think we should stop i agree one hundred percent the cardiologist said she gave craigs shoulder a reassuring squeeze then walked back to the table to tell the team it was over craig got his tuxedo jacket and walked over to the er desk to sign the paperwork indicating the patient was deceased and that the cause was cardiac arrest following myocardial infarction then he went out into the emergency room waiting area leona was seated among the sick the injured and their families she was flipping through an old magazine dressed as she was she appeared to craig like a nugget of gold among nondescript gravel her eyes rose up as he approached he could tell she read his expression no luck she said craig shook his head he scanned the waiting area where is jordan stanhope he left over an hour ago really why what did he say he said he preferred to be at home where he would await your call he said something about hospitals depressing him craig gave a short laugh i guess thats consistent i always thought of him as a rather cold odd duck who was just going through the motions with his wife leona tossed aside the magazine and followed craig out into the night he thought about saying something philosophical about life to leona but changed his mind he didnt think shed understand and he was worried he wouldnt be able to explain it neither spoke until they got to the car do you want me to drive leona asked craig shook his head opened the passenger door for leona then walked around and climbed in behind the wheel he didnt start the car immediately we obviously missed the concert he said staring out through the windshield to say the least leona said its after ten what would you like to do craig didnt have any idea but he knew he had to call jordan stanhope and wasnt looking forward to it losing a patient must be the hardest thing about being a doctor leona said sometimes its dealing with the survivors craig responded without any idea how prophetic his comment would turn out to be new york new york pm dr jack stapleton had been sitting in his cramped office on the fifth floor of the office of the chief medical examiner for more hours than he was willing to admit his office mate dr chet mcgovern had deserted him just after four when chet left for his workout at his posh midtown gym as was often the case hed badgered jack to come along with glowing tales of the newest batch of nubile female members in his bodysculpting class with their skintight outfits that left nothing to the imagination but jack had begged off with his customary rejoinder that he preferred being a participant rather than an observer when it came to sports he couldnt believe that chet could still laugh at what had become such a hackneyed comeback at five oclock dr laurie montgomery jacks colleague and soul mate had poked her head in to say she was heading home to shower and change for the romantic rendezvous jack had arranged for the two of them that evening at their favorite new york restaurant elios where they had had a number of memorable dinners over the years she had suggested he come along to freshen up as well but he again begged off saying he was swamped with work and hed meet her at the restaurant at eight unlike chet she didnt try to change his mind from her perspective it was such a rare event for jack to be so resourceful on a weeknight that she wanted to bend over backward in hopes of encouraging such behavior his usual evening plans included a deathdefying dash home on his mountain bike a strenuous run on the neighborhood basketball court with his neighborhood buddies a quick salad at one of the columbus avenue restaurants around nine followed soon after by a mute collapse into bed despite what he had said jack didnt have that much to do and had been scrounging around to keep himself busy particularly over the last hour even before he had sat down at his desk he had been reasonably caught up with all his outstanding autopsy cases the reason he was forcing himself to labor this particular afternoon was to keep his mind occupied in a vain attempt to control the anxiety he felt about his secret plans for the evening the process of submerging himself in either his work or strenuous athletic activity had been his balm and salvation for more than fourteen years so he wasnt about to abandon the ruse now unfortunately his contrived work wasnt holding his interest especially since he was running out of things to do his mind was beginning to wander into forbidden areas which began to torment him into having second thoughts about the evenings plans it was at that moment that his cell phone came to life he glanced at his watch there was less than an hour to go before dday he felt his pulse accelerate a phone call at that moment was an inauspicious sign since the chances of it being laurie were nil the chances were huge that it was someone who could throw the evenings schedule out of whack pulling the phone from his belt clip jack eyed the lcd screen just as he feared it was allen eisenberg allen was one of the pathology residents who was being paid by the office of the chief medical examiner to cover routine problems after hours which the forensic investigator on duty thought needed the attention of a medical doctor if the problem was beyond the pathology residents comfort zone then the medical examiner on call had to be contacted tonight it was jack sorry to have to call you dr stapleton allen said his voice whiny and grating whats the problem its a suicide sir okay so whats the question cant you guys handle it jack didnt know allen very well but he knew steve marriott the evening forensic investigator who was experienced its a highprofile case sir the deceased is the wife or girlfriend of an iranian diplomat hes been screaming at everyone and threatening to call the iranian ambassador mr marriott called me for backup but i feel like im in over my head jack didnt respond it was inevitable he would have to visit the scene such highprofile cases invariably took on political implications which was the part of jacks job that he detested he had no idea if hed be able to make the site visit and still get to the restaurant by eight which only added to his anxiety are you still there dr stapleton last time i looked jack retorted i thought maybe wed been cut off allen said anyway the location is apartment fiftyfourj in the united nations towers on fortyseventh street has the body been moved or touched jack pulled on his brown corduroy jacket unconsciously patting the square object in its right pocket not by me or the forensics investigator what about by the police jack started down the hallway toward the elevators the hall was deserted i dont believe so but i didnt ask yet what about by the husband or boyfriend you should ask the police the detective in charge is standing next to me and he wants to talk with you put him on hey buddy a loud voice said forcing jack to pull the phone away from his ear get your ass over here jack recognized the gravelly voice as that of his friend of ten years detective lieutenant lou soldano of the homicide division of the new york city police department jack had known lou almost as long as he had known laurie it had been laurie who had introduced them i might have known youd be behind this jack lamented i hope you remember that were supposed to be at elios at eight hey i dont schedule this crap it happens when it happens what are you doing at a suicide you guys think it might not be hell no its a suicide all right with a contact gunshot wound to the right temple my presence is a special request from my beloved captain in appreciation of the parties involved and how much flak they are potentially capable of producing are you coming or what im on my way has the body been moved or touched not by us who is that yelling in the background thats the diplomat husband or boyfriend we have yet to figure that out hes a little squirt but hes feisty and makes me appreciate the silent grieving type hes been yelling at us since we got here trying to boss us around like hes napoleon whats his problem jack asked he wants us to cover his naked wife or girlfriend and hes madder than hell because we insist on not disturbing the scene until you guys finish checking it out hold on jack said are you telling me the womans naked naked as a jaybird and to top it off she doesnt even have any pubic hair shes shaved like a cue ball which lou jack interrupted it wasnt a suicide excuse me lou questioned with disbelief are you trying to tell me you can tell this was a homicide without even seeing the scene ill look at the scene but yes im telling you it wasnt a suicide was there a note supposedly but its in farsi so i dont know what it says the diplomat says its a suicide note it wasnt a suicide lou jack repeated the elevator arrived he boarded but kept the door from closing he didnt want to lose the connection with lou ill even put a fiver on it ive never heard of a case of a woman committing suicide in the nude it just doesnt happen youre joking no im not the thought is thats not the way women suicide victims want to be foundyoud better act accordingly and get your crimescene people there and you know the feisty diplomat husband or whatever he is has got to be your numberone suspect dont let him disappear into the iranian mission you might not see him again the elevator door closed as jack flipped his phone shut he hoped there wasnt a deeper meaning behind the interruption of the evenings plans jacks true bete noire was the fear that death stalked the people he loved making him complicit when they died he looked at his watch it was now twenty after seven damn he said out loud and slapped the elevator door a few times with the palms of his hands in frustration maybe he should rethink the whole idea with rapidity born of repetition jack got his mountain bike from the area of the morgue where the potters field coffins were stored unlocked it put on his helmet and wheeled it out onto the th street loading dock between the mortuary vans he climbed on and cycled out into the street at the corner he turned right onto first avenue once he was on the bike jacks anxieties melted away standing up he put muscle into his pumping and the bike shot forward rapidly picking up speed rushhour traffic had abated to a degree and the cars taxis buses and trucks were moving at a good clip jack was not able to keep up but it was close once he had achieved his cruising speed he settled back onto the seat and shifted into a higher gear from his daily bike riding and basketball playing he was in tiptop shape the evening was glorious with a golden glow suffusing the cityscape individual skyscrapers stood out sharply against the blue sky the hue of which was deepening with every passing minute jack streaked past the new york university medical center on his right and a little further north the un general assembly complex when he could jack moved to his left so that he was able to turn onto th street which was oneway conveniently heading east the un towers was a few doors up from first avenue sheathed in glass and marble the structure soared up an impressive sixtysomeodd stories into the evening sky directly in front of the awning that stretched from its entrance to the street were several new york city squad cars with their lights flashing hardened new yorkers walked by without a glance there was also a battered chevy malibu doubleparked next to one of the squad cars jack recognized it as lous in front of the malibu was a health and human services mortuary van as jack locked his bike to a noparking signpost his anxieties returned the ride had been too short to have any lasting effect it was now seven thirty he flashed his medical examiners badge to the uniformed doorman and was directed to the fiftyfourth floor up in apartment j things had quieted considerably when jack walked in lou soldano allen eisenberg steve marriott and a number of uniformed officers were sitting around the living room as if it were a doctors waiting room what gives jack asked silence reigned there wasnt even any conversation were waiting on you and the crimescene people lou said as he got to his feet the others followed suit instead of lous signature rumpled and slightly disheveled attire he was wearing a neatly pressed shirt buttoned to the neck a subdued new tie and a tasteful although not terribly wellfitted glen plaid sport jacket that was too small for his stocky frame lou was a seasoned detective having been in the organizedcrime unit for six years before moving over to homicide where hed been for more than a decade and he looked the part i have to say you look pretty spiffy jack commented even lous closely cropped hair looked recently brushed and his famous five oclock shadow was nowhere to be seen this is as good as it gets lou commented lifting his arms as if flexing his biceps for effect in celebration of your dinner party i snuck home and changed whats the occasion by the way wheres the diplomat jack asked ignoring lous question he glanced into the kitchen and a room that was used as a dining room except for the living room the apartment seemed empty hes flown the coop lou said he stormed out of here just after i hung up with you threatening all of us with dire consequences you shouldnt have let him go jack said what was i supposed to do lou complained i didnt have an arrest warrant couldnt you have held him for questioning until i got over here listen the captain sent me on this case to keep things simple and not to rock the boat holding that guy at this stage would be rocking the boat bigtime okay jack said thats your problem not mine lets see the body lou gestured toward the open bedroom door do you have an id on the woman yet jack asked not yet the building supervisor says shed only been here less than a month and didnt speak much english jack took in the scene before homing in on the body there was a slight butchershop odor the decor read designer the walls and carpet were all black the ceiling mirrored and the curtains clutter of knickknacks and furniture all white including the bed linens as lou had explained the corpse was completely naked lying supine across the bed with the feet dangling over the beds left side although darkly complected in life she was now ashen against the sheet except for some bruising about the face including a black eye her arms were splayed out to the sides with the palms up an automatic pistol was loosely held in her right hand with her index finger inside the trigger guard her head was turned slightly toward the left her eyes were open high on the right temple was evidence of an entrance gunshot wound behind the head on the white sheet was a large bloodstain extending away from the victim to her left was some blood spatter along with bits of tissue some of these middle eastern guys can be brutal with their women jack said so ive heard lou said is that bruising and black eye from the bullet wound i doubt it jack said then he turned back to steve and allen have our pictures been taken of the body yes they have steve marriott called from over near the door jack pulled on a pair of latex rubber gloves and carefully separated the womans dark almost black hair to expose the entrance wound there was a distinct stellate form to the lesion indicating that the muzzle of the gun had been in contact with the victim when it had discharged carefully jack rolled the womans head to the side to look at the exit wound it was low down below the left ear he straightened up well thats more evidence he said evidence of what lou asked that this wasnt a suicide jack said the bullet traveled from above on an angle downward thats not the way people shoot themselves jack formed a gun with his right hand and placed the tip of his index finger as the hypothetical muzzle next to his temple the plane of the finger was parallel with the floor when people shoot themselves the track of the bullet is generally almost horizontal or maybe slightly upward never downwards this was a homicide staged to look like a suicide thanks a lot lou grumbled i was hoping your deduction about her being naked would prove to be wrong sorry jack said any idea how long shes been dead not yet but a wild guess would say not that long anybody hear a gunshot that would be more accurate unfortunately no lou said lieutenant one of the uniformed policemen called out from the doorway the crimescene boys have arrived tell them to get their butts in here lou responded over his shoulder then to jack he asked are you done or what im done well have more information for you in the morning ill be sure to do the post myself in that case ill try to make it too over the years lou had learned to appreciate how much information could be gleaned from victims of homicide during an autopsy all right then jack said snapping off the gloves im out of here he glanced at his watch he wasnt late yet but he was going to be it was seven fiftytwo it was going to take him more than eight minutes to get to the restaurant he looked at lou who was bending over to examine a small tear in the sheet several feet away from the body in the direction of the headboard what do you have what do you think of this think it might be where the slug penetrated the mattress jack leaned over to examine the centimeterlong linear defect he nodded that would be my guess theres a tiny bit of bloodstain along the edges lou straightened up as the crimescene technicians carried in their equipment lou mentioned getting the slug and the technicians assured him theyd do their best are you going to be able to get away from here at some reasonable time jack inquired lou shrugged no reason why i cant leave with you with the diplomat out of the picture theres no reason for me to hang around ill give you a lift ive got my bike jack said so put it in my car youll get there sooner besides its safer than that bike of yours i cant believe laurie still lets you ride that thing around the city particularly when you guys see so many of those messengers who get flattened im careful jack said my ass youre careful lou responded ive seen you streaking around the city on more than one occasion jack debated what to do he wanted to ride the bike for its calming effect and also because he couldnt stand the odor of the fifty billion cigarettes that had been smoked in lous chevy but he had to admit that with lou driving the car would be quicker and the hour was fast approaching all right he said reluctantly my goodness gracious a spark of maturity lou said he took out his keys and tossed them to jack while youre dealing with the bike ill have a word with my boys to make sure they are squared away ten minutes later lou was driving north on park avenue which he claimed would be the fastest route uptown jacks bike was in the backseat with both wheels removed jack had insisted that all four windows be rolled down which made the interior of the car breezy but bearable despite the overflowing ashtray you seem kind of wired lou said as they skirted grand central station on the elevated roadway im worried about being late worst case well be fifteen minutes late in my book thats not late jack glanced out the passengerside window lou was right fifteen minutes fell into the appropriate time frame but it didnt make him feel any less anxious so whats the occasion you never said does there have to be an occasion jack responded all right already lou said casting a quick glance in jacks direction his friend was acting out of character but lou let it drop something was up but he wasnt about to push it they parked in a noparking tow zone a few steps away from the restaurants entrance lou tossed his police vehicle card onto the dashboard you think this is going to be safe jack questioned i dont want my bike getting towed along with your vehicle theyre not going to tow my car lou said with conviction the two men walked into elios and entered the fray the place was packed particularly around the bar near the front door everybody is back from the hamptons lou explained practically yelling to be heard over the general din of voices and laughter jack nodded excused himself to those in front of him and squeezed sideways deeper into the restaurant people juggled their drinks as he brushed by he was looking for the hostess who he remembered as a softspoken willowy woman with a kind smile before he could find her someone tapped insistently on his shoulder when he turned he found himself looking directly into lauries bluegreen eyes jack could tell she had taken her freshening up quite seriously her luxurious auburn hair had been let out of her restrained workaday french braid and cascaded to her shoulders she was dressed in one of his favorite outfits a white highcollared victorianstyle ruffled blouse with a honeybrown velvet jacket in the halflight of the restaurant her skin glowed as if illuminated from within to jack she looked terrific but there was a problem instead of the warm fuzzy happy expression he was expecting she appeared more like amber and ice laurie seldom bothered to conceal her emotions jack knew something was wrong he apologized for being late explaining how hed been called out on a case where hed met lou reaching behind him jack pulled lou into their sphere of conversation lou and laurie exchanged several cheektocheek air kisses laurie responded by reaching behind her and drawing forward warren wilson and his longtime girlfriend natalie adams warren was an intimidatingly wellmuscled african american with whom jack played basketball almost nightly as a consequence they had become close friends after greetings were exchanged jack yelled that he would find the hostess to inquire about their table as he began pushing his way toward the hostess stand again he sensed that laurie was right behind him jack stopped at the hostesss podium just beyond there was a clear buffer zone that separated the people dining from those standing around the bar jack caught sight of the hostess in the process of seating a dinner party he turned back to laurie to see if her expression had changed subsequent to his apology for being late you werent late laurie said as if reading his mind although the comment was exonerating the tone wasnt we had just got here a few minutes before you and lou it actually was good timing jack studied lauries face from the set of her jaw and the compression of her lips it was clear she was still irritated but he had no idea what was troubling her you look out of sorts is there something i should know i expected a romantic dinner laurie said her tone was now more wistful than angry you never told me you were inviting a horde warren natalie and lou are hardly a horde jack responded they are our best friends well you could have and should have told me laurie responded it didnt take long for her irritation to resurface i was obviously reading more into the evening than you intended jack looked off for a moment to control his own emotions after the anxiety and ambivalence hed expended planning the evening he was unprepared for negativism even if it was understandable obviously hed inadvertently hurt lauries feelings while being so absorbed in his own the fact that she was counting on the two of them being alone hadnt even occurred to him dont roll your eyes at me laurie snapped you could have been more communicative about what you had in mind for the evening you know that i dont mind any time you want to go out with warren and lou jack looked off in the other direction and bit his tongue to keep from lashing back luckily he knew that if he did the evening could well become unsalvageable he took a deep breath resolved to eat crow and then locked eyes with laurie im sorry he said with all the sincerity he could muster under the circumstances it didnt occur to me you would take offense with it being sort of a dinner party i should have been more upfront to be honest i invited the others for support lauries eyebrows pulled together in obvious confusion what kind of support i dont understand at the moment it would be hard to explain jack said could you give me a little slack for like a halfhour i suppose laurie said still confused but i cant imagine what you mean by support yet i do appreciate your apology thank you jack said he breathed out forcefully before looking back into the depths of the restaurant now wheres that hostess and wheres our table it took another twenty minutes before the group was seated toward the rear of the dining room by then laurie had seemingly forgotten her earlier pique and was acting as if she was enjoying herself with easy laughter and animated conversation although jack felt she was avoiding looking at him she was seated to his immediate right so all he could see was her sculpted profile to jack and lauries delight the same handlebarmustached waiter whod waited on them during their prior dinners at elios appeared at their table most of those previous meals had been delightful although some had been less so yet still unforgettable the last dinner a year previously had been in the latter category and it had marked the nadir of their relationship occurring during a monthlong break from living together it had been at that dinner that laurie had revealed to jack that she was pregnant and jack had had the insensitivity of flippantly asking who the father was although jack and laurie had subsequently patched up their relationship the pregnancy had had to be terminated in short order it had been a tubal ectopic pregnancy necessitating emergency surgery to save lauries life seemingly on his own initiative although actually on jacks prior request the waiter proceeded to distribute longstemmed flutes he then opened a bottle of champagne the group cheered at the sonorous pop of the cork the waiter then quickly filled everyones glass hey man warren said holding up his bubbly to friendship everyone followed suit except jack who instead held up an empty hand if you dont mind id like to say something right off the bat youve all wondered why ive invited you here tonight particularly laurie the fact of the matter is that i needed your support to go through with something ive wanted to do for some time but have had trouble marshaling the courage with that in mind id like to make a toast thats rather selfish jack thrust his hand into the side pocket of his jacket with a struggle he managed to extract a small square box made of distinctive shiny robinseggblue paper and tied with a silver bow he placed it on the table in front of laurie and then lifted his glass id like to make a toast to laurie and myself all right lou said happily and with emphasis to you guys he raised his glass the others did the same except for laurie to you guys warren repeated here here natalie said everyone took a drink except laurie who was transfixed by the box in front of her she thought she knew what was happening but she couldnt believe it she fought against her emotional side which threatened to bubble to the surface youre not going to participate in the toast jack questioned her her immobility aroused an unwelcome doubt as to what he had thought her reaction would be all of a sudden he questioned what he would say and do if she refused with some difficulty laurie pulled her eyes away from the carefully wrapped box and locked onto jacks she thought she knew what was inside the tiny package but was afraid to admit it shed been wrong too many times in the past as much as she loved jack she knew he labored under the strain of psychological baggage there was no doubt hed been severely traumatized by tragedy prior to their having met and she had acclimatized herself to the chance he might never get over it hey come on lou urged what the hell is it open it up yeah come on laurie warren urged am i supposed to open it now laurie questioned her eyes were still locked onto jacks that was the general idea jack said of course if you prefer you can wait a couple more years i dont mean to put any pressure on you laurie smiled occasionally she found jacks sarcasm humorous with trembling fingers she removed first the tie and then the wrapping from the package everyone but jack leaned forward with anticipation the underlying box was covered with black crushed velvet with the trepidation that jack might be playing an elaborate and inappropriate trick on her she snapped open the box gleaming back at her was a tiffany solitaire diamond it sparkled with what appeared to be an inner light she turned the box around so the others could see while she shut her eyes and fought against tears such emotionalism was a personality trait she despised in herself although under the present circumstances even she could understand it she and jack had been dating for almost a decade and living with each other on and off for years shed wanted to marry and she had been convinced he felt similarly there were a series of oohs and ahhs from lou warren and natalie well jack questioned laurie laurie struggled to get herself under control she used a knuckle to wipe away a tear from each eye she looked up at jack and made an instantaneous decision to turn the tables on him and pretend she didnt know what he was implying it was something jack could very well have done after all these years she wanted to hear him actually say what the engagement ring implied well what she questioned its an engagement ring jack said with a short selfconscious laugh i know what it is laurie responded but what does it mean she was pleased putting pressure on jack had the benefit of keeping her own emotions in check a slight smile even appeared at the corners of her mouth as she watched him squirm be specific you ass lou barked at jack pop the question jack realized what laurie had done and a smile came to his face as well all right all right he said quieting lou laurie my love despite the danger in the past that has befallen those i love and hold dear and my fear such danger could extend to you would you marry me thats more like it lou said holding his glass again in the air i propose a toast to jacks proposal this time everyone drank well jack repeated redirecting attention to laurie laurie thought for a moment before answering i know your fears and understand their origin i just dont share them be that as it may i fully accept the risk whether real or imagined if something is to happen to me it will be my fault entirely with that caveat yes i would love to marry you everyone cheered as jack and laurie exchanged a selfconscious kiss and awkward hug laurie then took the ring from the box and tried it on she extended her hand to look at it it fits perfectly its exquisite i borrowed one of your rings for a day to be sure of the size jack admitted not the biggest rock in the world lou said did it come with a magnifying glass jack threw his napkin at lou who caught it before it wrapped around his face your best friends are always honest lou laughed he handed the napkin back its a perfect size laurie said i dont like jewelry to be gaudy you got your wish lou added no one is going to call it gaudy when will the big day be natalie asked jack looked at laurie obviously we havent talked about it but i think ill leave it up to laurie really laurie questioned really jack answered then id like to talk to my mom about the timing shes let me know on many an occasion in the past that shed like me to have my wedding at the riverside church i know that was where she had wanted to be married herself but it didnt happen if its all right id like her to have a say as to the timing and the place fine by me jack said now wheres that waiter i need some more champagne boston massachusetts october pm one month later it had been a great workout craig bowman had used the weight room for a halfhour to tone up and stretch then hed gotten into a series of competitive pickup threeonthree basketball games by pure luck hed managed to be teamed up with two talented players for well over an hour he and his teammates had not lost and had given up the court only from sheer exhaustion after the basketball craig had indulged himself with a massage followed by a steam and shower now as craig stood in front of the mirror in the vip section of the sports clubla mens locker room and regarded himself critically he had to admit he looked better than he had in years hed lost twentytwo pounds and an inch from his waist since hed joined the club six months ago perhaps even more apparent was the disappearance of the pudgy sallowness of his cheeks in its place was a healthy rosy glow as an attempt to appear more contemporary hed let his sandycolored hair grow out a bit and then had it styled at a salon such that he now brushed it back on both sides rather than parting it on the left as hed done for as long as he could remember from his perspective the overall change was so remarkable that had he seen himself a year ago he wouldnt have recognized himself he surely was no longer the stodgy bromidic doctor craigs current routine was to come to the club three times a week monday wednesday and friday of the three days friday was the best since it was the least crowded and afforded the psychological stimulus of the weekend stretching out in front of him with all its promise as a standing policy hed decided to close the office at noon on fridays and take calls with his cell phone that way leona could come with him to work out as a present for her as well as himself hed sprung for a second membership several weeks previously leona had moved in with him at his beacon hill home shed decided on her own that it was ridiculous for her to pay for an apartment in somerville when she was staying with him every night craig initially had been miffed about the move because there had been no discussion and it had been presented as a fait accompli to him it seemed coercive just when he was reveling in his new freedom but after a few days he had adjusted he had forgotten the power of eroticism also he rationalized that the living arrangement could be reversed with ease if the need arose craigs final preparation was to slip on his new brioni jacket after shrugging his shoulders a few times to settle it into place he glanced back into the mirror turning his head from side to side to view himself from slightly different angles he briefly entertained the idea of studying acting instead of art the notion brought a smile to his face he knew his imagination was running wild yet the thought was not completely preposterous as well as things were going he couldnt help feel that the world was his oyster when craig was fully dressed he checked his cell phone for messages he was in the clear the plan was to head back to the apartment relax with a glass of wine and the newest new england journal of medicine for an hour or so then on to the museum of fine arts to check out the current exhibition and finally go to dinner at a new trendy restaurant in the back bay whistling under his breath craig walked from the locker room out into the main lobby of the club to his left was the signin desk while to his right down a corridor past the bank of elevators were the bar and restaurant muted music could be heard from the general area although the athletic facilities were generally not crowded on friday afternoons happy hour at the bar was another story and was just beginning to gear up craig checked his watch hed timed things perfectly it was quarter to five the exact time hed agreed to meet leona although they came to the club and left together while they were there they each did their own thing leona was currently into the stair machine pilates and yoga none of which thrilled craig a quick visual sweep of the sitting area confirmed that leona had yet to emerge from the womens side craig wasnt surprised along with a relative lack of reserve punctuality was not one of her strong points he took a seat perfectly content to watch the parade of attractive people coming and going six months ago in a similar circumstance he would have felt like the odd man out now he felt entirely at ease but no sooner had he gotten comfortable than leona appeared coming through the womens locker room door just as he had critically regarded himself a few minutes earlier craig gave leona a quick onceover the workouts were benefiting her as well though due to her comparative youth shed been firm rosycheeked and shapely from the start as she drew near he could appreciate that she was an attractive as well as a highspirited and headstrong young woman her main handicap from craigs perspective was her revere massachusetts accent and syntax particularly grating was her tendency to pronounce every word ending in an er as if it ended in a short but harsh a believing he had her interests at heart craig had tried to call her attention to her habit with the hope of getting her to change but shed reacted angrily venomously accusing him of being an ivy league elitist so craig had wisely given up over time his ear had acclimated to a degree and in the heat of the night he really didnt care whether she had an accent how was your workout craig asked getting to his feet terrific leona responded better than usual craig winced the accent on terrific was on the first syllable instead of the second and better came out as beddah as they walked to the elevator he resisted the urge to comment by tuning her out while she carried on about her workout and why he should try both pilates and yoga he contentedly mused about the upcoming evening and what a pleasant day it had been so far that morning at the office hed seen twelve patients not too many and not too few there had been no rushing frantically from one exam room to another which was the usual course of events at his old practice over the months he and marlene his matronly main secretary and receptionist had developed a system of scheduling patients according to each patients need based on the diagnosis and the individuals personality the shortest visits were fifteen minutes for rapid returnvisit checkups with compliant and knowledgeable patients and the longest was one and a half hours the hourplus visits were generally for new patients with known and serious medical problems healthy new patients were scheduled from fortyfive minutes to one hour depending on age and seriousness of the complaints if an unexpected problem developed during the course of the day such as an unscheduled patient needing to be seen or craig having to go over to the hospital which hadnt happened that day marlene would call the upcoming patients to reschedule if possible and appropriate as a consequence it was rare for people to wait in craigs office and equally rare for him to suffer the anxiety of being behind and trying to catch up it was a civilized way to practice medicine and far better for everyone nowadays craig actually liked going to the office it was the kind of medicine hed imagined when hed dreamed of becoming a doctor the only slight bugaboo in what was otherwise a nearperfect situation was that it had not been possible to keep all aspects of his relationship with leona a secret suspicions were rampant and made worse by leonas youth and willfulness consequently craig had to weather an undercurrent of disapproval from marlene and his nurse darlene as well as observe their resentful and passiveaggressive behavior toward leona youre not listening to me leona complained irritably she leaned forward to glare at craig both had been facing the elevator doors as they descended to the parking garage of course i am craig lied he smiled but leonas mercurial petulance wasnt assuaged the elevator doors opened on the valetparking floor and leona stalked out to join a halfdozen people waiting for their vehicles craig followed a few steps behind relatively wide swings of emotion were a trait of leonas that craig was not fond of but they were generally quick if he just ignored them had he slipped a few minutes earlier up in the lobby and called attention to her accent it would have been a different story the previous and only time hed made such a comment had caused a twoday snit craig gave his parking stub to one of the attendants red porsche coming right up dr bowman the attendant said while touching the peak of his cap with his index finger in a form of salute he sprinted away craig smiled inwardly he was proud that he had what he considered the sexiest car in the garage and the antithesis of the volvo station wagon hed had in his previous life craig imagined that those waiting around him for their cars would be duly impressed the parking attendants obviously were impressed as evidenced by their always parking his vehicle close to the valet stand if i seem a little distant craig whispered to leona its because im looking forward to our evening all of it he winked suggestively leona regarded him with one eyebrow raised indicating she was only partially placated the reality was that she demanded full attention a hundred percent of the time at the same moment that craig heard the familiar whine and roar of his car engine starting somewhere nearby he also heard his name called out from behind him what caught his attention particularly was that his middle initial m had been included few people knew his middle initial and fewer still knew that it stood for mason his mothers maiden name craig turned expecting to see a patient or perhaps a colleague or an old schoolmate instead he saw a stranger approach the man was a handsome african american quickmoving intelligentappearing and approximately craigs age for a moment craig thought he was a teammate from that afternoons threeonthree basketball marathon who wanted to gloat anew over that afternoons victories doctor craig m bowman the man questioned again as he stepped directly up to craig yes craig said with a questioning nod he was still trying to place the individual he wasnt one of the basketball players nor was he a patient or a schoolmate craig tried to associate him with the hospital but he couldnt the man responded by placing a large sealed envelope in craigs hand craig looked at it his name along with his middle initial was typed on the front before craig could respond the man turned on his heel and managed to catch the elevator hed arrived in before the doors had had a chance to close the man was gone the transaction had taken only seconds whatd you get leona asked i havent the slightest idea craig said he looked back down at the envelope and got his first inkling of trouble printed in the upper corner was superior court suffolk county massachusetts well leona questioned arent you going to open it im not sure i want to craig said although he knew he would have to sooner or later craigs eyes scanned the people grouped around him waiting for their cars a number were curiously looking at him after having witnessed the encounter as the valet pulled craigs porsche up to the stand and got out holding the driversside door ajar craig worked his thumb under the envelopes flap and tore it open he could feel his pulse quicken as he pulled out the contents he was holding a dogeared sheaf of papers stapled together well leona repeated with concern she could see craigs exerciseinduced ruddiness perceptively fade craigs eyes lifted and locked onto leonas they reflected an intensity leona had not seen she couldnt tell if it was from confusion or disbelief yet it was clearly shock for a few beats craig seemed paralyzed he didnt even breathe hello leona called questioningly anybody home she waved a hand in front of craigs marmoreal face a furtive glance told her that they had become the object of everyones attention as if he were waking from a petit mal seizure craigs pupils narrowed and color rapidly resuffused his face his hands began to reflexively crumple the papers before rationality intervened ive been served craig croaked in a whisper the bastard is suing me he straightened the papers and rapidly flipped through them who is suing stanhope jordan stanhope what for medical malpractice and wrongful death this is outrageous concerning patience stanhope who else craig demanded viciously through clenched teeth hey im not the enemy leona said raising her hands in mock defense i cannot believe this this is an outrage craig shuffled through the papers again as if perhaps hed misread them leona glanced over to the valets a second attendant had opened the passenger door for her the first was still holding open the driversside door leona looked back at craig what do you want to do craigie she whispered insistently we cant stand here forever forever came out as forevah shut up craig barked her accent grated against his raw nerves leona let out a suppressed mockingly aggrieved laugh then warned dont you dare talk to me like that as if waking a second time and becoming aware that all eyes were on them craig apologized under his breath then added i need a drink okay leona agreed still miffed where here or at home here craig snapped he turned and headed back to the elevators with an apologetic smile and shrug for the benefit of the valets leona followed craig when she got to him he was repeatedly punching the elevator button with a knuckle you have to calm down she told him she looked back at the group people quickly averted their gaze to pretend they had not been watching its easy for you to say to calm down craig shot back youre not the one being sued and getting served like this in public is goddamn humiliating leona didnt try to make conversation again until they were seated at a small but tall table apart as much as possible from the happyhour crowd the chairs were barstools with low backs which accounted for the table height craig had a double scotch which was hardly customary for him normally he drank sparingly for fear of being called professionally at any given hour leona had a glass of white wine she could tell from how he shakily handled his drink that his mindset had transformed yet again hed gone from the initial shocked disbelief to anger and now to anxiety all within the fifteen minutes since hed been handed the summons and the complaint ive never seen you so upset leona offered although she didnt quite know what to say she felt she needed to say something she was never good at silence unless it was on her terms as a purposeful pout of course im upset craig snapped as he raised his drink he was shaking enough to cause the ice to clink repeatedly against the glass when he got it to his lips he managed to slosh scotch over the rim shit he said as he put the glass back down and shook the scotch from his hand he then used the cocktail napkin to wipe his lips and chin i cannot believe this oddball bastard jordan stanhope would do this to me especially after all the time and energy ive squandered on his hypochrondriacal clingy excuse for a wife i hated that woman craig hesitated for a moment then added i suppose i shouldnt be telling you this its the kind of thing doctors dont talk about i think you should talk about it seeing how upset you are the truth is that patience stanhope drove me crazy with her disgusting rehash over and over of every damn bowel movement she ever had and that was on top of the graphic descriptions of greenishyellow gloppy phlegm she coughed up on a daily basis and even saved to show me it was pathetic she drove everybody crazy including jordan and even herself for christs sake leona nodded although psychology was not one of her strengths she felt it was important to let craig rail on i cant tell you how many times over the last year i had to drive out there after work or even in the middle of the night to that huge house of theirs to hold her hand and listen to her carry on and for what she rarely followed through with anything i suggested including stopping her smoking she smoked like a fiend no matter what i said really leona questioned unable to contain herself she carried on about coughing up phlegm and continued to smoke dont you remember how her bedroom reeked of cigarette smoke not really leona said with a shake of her head i was too taken by the situation to smell anything she smoked like there was no tomorrow one cigarette after another going through several packs a day and that was just a part of it im telling you she was the poster woman for all the noncompliant patients of the world especially concerning medication she demanded prescriptions and then took the drugs or didnt take them according to her whim did you have any idea why she didnt follow orders probably because she liked being sick it gave her something to do thats the long and short of it she was a waste of time for me for her husband even for herself her passing was a blessing for everyone she didnt have a life craig had calmed down enough to take a drink of his scotch without spilling any i remember from the few times i had contact with her in the office she seemed like a piece of work leona said placatingly thats the understatement of the year craig grumbled she was an entitled bitch with some inherited money meaning she expected me to hold her hand and listen to her complaints ad nauseam i struggled through four years of college four years of medical school five years of residency board certification and authored a handful of scientific papers and all she wanted was for me to hold her hand that was it and if i held it for fifteen minutes she wanted thirty and if i gave her thirty she wanted fortyfive and if i refused she became sulky and hostile maybe she was lonely leona suggested whose side are you on craig demanded angrily he slapped his drink down onto the table clanking the ice cubes she was a pain in the ass geez relax already leona urged she glanced around selfconsciously and was relieved to see that no one was paying them the slightest attention just dont start playing devils advocate craig snapped im not in the mood im only trying to get you to calm down how can i calm down this is a disaster ive worked all my life to be the best doctor hell im still working at it and now this craig angrily slapped the envelope containing the legal papers but isnt this the reason you pay the malpractice insurance you complain about craig eyed leona with exasperation i dont think you understand this screwball stanhope is publicly defaming me by demanding his quote day in court the process is the problem its bad no matter what happens im helpless a victim and if you go to trial who knows how it will turn out there are no guarantees even in my situation where ive been bending over backward for my patients particularly patience stanhope making house calls for crying out loud and the idea it would be a trial by my peers thats a bad joke file clerks plumbers and retired schoolteachers have no idea what its like being a doctor like me getting up in the middle of the night to hold hypochondriacs hands jesus h christ cant you tell them make it part of your testimony craig rolled his eyes with exasperation there were occasions when leona drove him batty it was the downside of spending time with someone so young and inexperienced why does he think there was malpractice leona asked craig looked off at the normal beautiful people around the bar obviously enjoying the evening with their happy banter the juxtaposition made him feel worse maybe coming up to the public bar was a bad idea the thought went through his mind that perhaps becoming one of them through his cultural endeavors was really beyond his grasp medicine and its current problems including the malpractice mess had him ensnared what malpractice was there supposed to have been leona asked rephrasing her question craig threw up his hands listen bright eyes its generic on the complaint saying something about me not using the skill and care in making a diagnosis and treatment that a reasonable competent doctor would employ in the same circumstance blah blah blah its all bullshit the long and short is that there was a bad outcome meaning patience stanhope died a personal injurymalpractice lawyer will just go from there and be creative those guys can always find something that some asshole courthousewhore doctor will say should have been done differently bright eyes leona snapped back dont be condescending to me okay im sorry craig said he took a deep breath obviously im out of sorts whats a courthousewhore doctor its a doctor who hires himself or herself out to be a quote expert and who will say whatever the plaintiff attorney wants him to say it used to be hard to find doctors to testify against doctors but not anymore there are some worthless bastards that make a living doing it thats terrible its the least of it craig said he shook his head dejectedly its mighty hypocritical that this screwball jordan stanhope is suing me when he didnt even stay around at the hospital while i was struggling to revive his pathetic wife hell on a number of occasions he confided with me that his wife was a hopeless hypochondriac and that he couldnt keep all her symptoms straight he was even apologetic when shed have him call and insist i come to the house at three in the morning because she thought she was dying that really happened on more than one occasion usually the house calls were in the evenings forcing me to interrupt what i was doing but even then jordan would always thank me so he knew what kind of effort it was coming out there for no good reason the woman was a disaster everyone is better off with her out of the picture including jordan stanhope yet he is suing me and claiming damages of five million dollars for loss of consortium what a cruel joke craig shook his head dejectedly whats consortium what someone is supposed to get from a spouse you know company affection assistance and sex i dont think they were having much sex they had separate bedrooms you probably have that right i cant imagine hed want to or even be able to have sex with that miserable hag do you think the reason hes suing you might have something to do with you criticizing him that night he did seem to take offense craig nodded a few times leona had a point with glass in hand he slipped off the barstool and returned to the bar for a refill as he waited among the happy revelers he thought about leonas idea and wondered if she was correct he remembered regretting what he had said to jordan when hed gotten into patiences bedroom and saw how bad off she was his comment had just popped out of his mouth in the stress of the circumstances and how surprised hed been at the time hed thought his hasty apology had been sufficient but maybe not if not he was going to regret the incident even more with a second double scotch craig worked his way back to the table and got himself onto his barstool he moved slowly as if his legs weighed a hundred pounds apiece to leona he seemed to have made yet another transition he now appeared depressed his mouth slack and his eyes droopy this is a disaster craig managed with a sigh he stared down into his scotch his arms folded on the table this could be the end of everything just when things are going so well how can it be the end of everything leona asked trying to be lively what are you supposed to do now that you have been served craig didnt answer he didnt even move leona couldnt even see him breathing shouldnt you get a lawyer leona persisted she leaned forward in an attempt to look up into craigs face the insurance company is supposed to defend me craig responded in a flat voice well there you go why not call them craig raised his eyes and met leonas he nodded a few times as he gave leonas suggestion consideration it was almost five thirty on a friday night yet the insurance company might have someone on call it was worth a try he could use the reassurance that he was at least doing something a big part of his anxiety was from the helplessness he felt in the face of such an overwhelming disembodied threat with newly found urgency craig snapped his cell phone from its clip on his belt using klutzy fingers he scrolled through his address book like a beacon in a dark night the name and cell phone number of his insurance agent popped into view craig made the call it ended up requiring several calls including having to leave his name and number in an emergency voicemail but within a quarter of an hour craig was able to tell his story to a real person with an authoritative voice who acted calmly knowledgeable his name was arthur marshall the sound of which craig found curiously reassuring since this is your first brush with this kind of event arthur was saying and since we know from experience how uniquely unsettling it is i think it is important for you to understand that for us it is all too common in other words we are experienced in dealing with malpractice litigation and we will give your case all the attention it deserves meanwhile i want to emphasize that you should not take it personally how else can i take it craig complained its calling into question my lifes work its putting everything in jeopardy that is a common feeling for someone like yourself and entirely understandable but trust me it is not like that it is not a reflection of your dedication and lifes work more often than not it is a fishing expedition in hopes of a financial windfall despite the plaintiff attorneys claims to the contrary everyone familiar with medicine knows that lessthanperfect outcomes even involving honest mistakes are not malpractice and the judge will so advise the jury if this action were to go to a trial but remember the vast majority of such cases do not go to trial or if they do the vast majority are won by the defense here in massachusetts by statute your claim must go before a tribunal and with the facts youve given me it probably will stop there craigs pulse had come down to a nearly normal level youre wise to have contacted us so early in the course of this unfortunate affair dr bowman in short order we will assign a skilled experienced attorney to the case and for that we will need to get the summons and the complaint asap you are required to answer within thirty days of service i can messenger this material on monday that will be perfect meanwhile let me suggest you begin to refresh your mind about the case particularly by getting your records together its something that has to be done and it will give you the feeling you are doing something constructive to protect yourself from our experience we know that is important craig found himself nodding in agreement in regard to your records dr bowman i must warn you not to change them in any way or form that means do not change a misspelled word or an obvious grammatical error or something you might feel is sloppy do not change any dates in short do not change a thing do you understand absolutely good of those malpractice cases found for the plaintiff a sizable number involved some editing of the records even if the editing was entirely inconsequential any alteration is a recipe for disaster since it impugns your integrity and truthfulness i hope im making myself clear perfectly clear thank you mr marshall im feeling a bit better and indeed you should doctor rest assured we will be giving your case our full attention since all of us want to bring it to a speedy successful conclusion so that you can get back to what you do best taking care of your patients id like nothing better we are at your service dr bowman one last issue of which im sure you are already cognizant do not i repeat do not discuss this matter with anyone accept your spouse and the attorney we assign this extends to all colleagues acquaintances and even close friends this is very important craig looked guiltily across the table at leona realizing how much hed been inappropriately babbling close friends craig questioned that means possibly having to forgo emotional support we recognize that but the downside is worse and what exactly is the downside he wasnt sure how much of the incoming conversation leona could hear she was watching him intently because friends and colleagues are discoverable plaintiff attorneys can and do if it serves their interests force friends even close friends and colleagues to be witnesses often to great effect ill keep that in mind craig said thank you for your admonitions mr marshall craigs pulse had quickened again being honest with himself he had to admit that he really didnt know leona beyond her youthful and understandable selfcenteredness having been so talkative added to his anxiety and thank you dr bowman we will be in touch as soon as we get the summons and the complaint try to relax and go about your life ill try craig said without a lot of conviction he knew he was going to be living under a dark cloud until all was settled what he didnt know was how dark it was going to get in the meantime he vowed to avoid calling attention to leonas accent he was smart enough to know that what he had confided about his feelings toward patience stanhope would not play well in a court of law new york new york october pm jack stapleton turned his attention to the heart and the lungs in front of him spread out on the autopsy table was the naked gutted remains of a white fiftysevenyearold female the victims head was propped up on a wooden block and her unseeing eyes stared blankly at the overhead fluorescent lights up until that point in the postmortem there had been little pathology save for a rather large apparently asymptomatic uterine fibroid specifically there had been nothing as yet to account for the death of an apparently healthy woman who had collapsed in bloomingdales miguel sanchez the evening mortuary technician whod come in at pm to start his day was assisting while jack prepared to examine the heart and lungs miguel was busy at the sink washing out the intestines by merely palpating the surface of the lungs jacks experienced hands perceived an abnormal resistance the tissue was firmer than usual which was consistent with the organs weight being higher than normal with a knife that looked like a gardenvariety butcher knife jack made multiple slices into the lung again there was the suggestion of more resistance than he would expect lifting the lung he examined the cut surfaces which reflected the organs consistency the lung appeared denser than normal and he was confident that the microscopic would show fibrosis the question was why were the lungs fibrotic turning his attention to the heart jack picked up toothed forceps and a pair of small bluntnosed scissors just when he was about to begin work on the muscular organ the door to the hallway opened jack hesitated as a figure appeared and approached it took only a moment for him to recognize laurie despite the light reflecting off her plastic face mask i was wondering where you were laurie said with a hint of exasperation she was dressed in fullbody disposable tyvek protective gear as were jack and miguel it was a standing order by dr calvin washington the deputy chief medical examiner to wear such an outfit for protection against potential infectious agents when in the autopsy room one never knew what kind of microbes might be encountered especially in an autopsy room as busy as the one in new york city wondering where i was suggests you were looking for me brilliant deduction laurie said she glanced down at the ghostly pale human shell on the table this was the last place i thought to look for you why such a late post you know me jack quipped i have no restraint whatsoever when an opportunity to have fun knocks on my door anything interesting laurie said immune to jacks sarcastic humor she reached out and touched the surface of the cut lung with her gloved index finger not yet but i think im about to hit pay dirt you can see that the lung appears fibrotic i believe the hearts going to tell us why whats the background of the case the victim was given the price of a pair of jimmy choo shoes in bloomies and arrested very funny seriously she did arrest in bloomingdales of course i dont know what she was doing apparently the store staff and a good samaritan doctor who happened to be on the scene attended to her immediately they started cpr and it was continued in the ambulance all the way over to the manhattan general when the body arrived over here at the ocme the head doc in the er called to give me the story he said that no matter what they did in the er they couldnt get so much as a single beat out of the heart even with a pacemaker as chagrined as they were that the patient was so uncooperative as to not revive he was hoping we could shed some light in case there was something else that could have been done i was impressed with his interest and initiative and since that is the kind of professional behavior we should be encouraging i told him id do the case straight off and get right back to him very commendable and industrious on your part laurie said of course doing an autopsy at this hour youre making the rest of us look like slackers if it looks like a duck quacks like a duck its a duck okay wise guy im not going to try to compete with your repartee lets see what you got youve got my interest so go for it jack bent over quickly but carefully traced the major coronary arteries and then proceeded to open them suddenly he straightened up well lookie here he said he picked up the heart and held it so laurie could see more easily he pointed with the tip of his forceps good grief laurie exclaimed that might be the most dramatic narrowing of the main trunk of the posterior descending artery ive ever seen and it looks developmental not atheromatous that would be my take as well and it probably explains the unresponsive heart a sudden even transient blockage would have caused a massive heart attack involving parts of the conduction system i imagine the entire posterior side of the heart was involved in the infarction but as dramatic as it is it doesnt explain the pulmonary changes why dont you open the heart that was exactly my intention exchanging the scissors and forceps for the butcher knife jack made a series of cuts into the hearts chambers voila he said leaning out of the way so laurie could see the splayed organ there you go a damaged incompetent mitral valve a very incompetent mitral valve this woman was a walking time bomb waiting to explode its amazing she didnt have symptoms from either the coronary narrowing or the valve to drive her to a physician its also too bad both problems were surgically correctable fear often makes some people sadly stoic youve got that right jack said as he started taking samples for microscopic examination he put them into appropriately labeled bottles you still havent told me why you were looking for me an hour ago i got some news we now have a wedding date i was eager to run it by you because i have to get back to them as soon as possible jack paused in what he was doing even miguel at the sink stopped rinsing out the intestines this is a curious environment for such an announcement jack said laurie shrugged its where i found you i was hoping to call back this afternoon before the weekend jack briefly glanced over at miguel whats the date june ninth at one thirty what do you think jack chuckled what am i supposed to think it seems a long time off now that we have finally decided to go through with it i was kind of thinking about next tuesday laurie laughed the sound was muffled by her plastic face screen which briefly fogged up thats a sweet thing to say but the reality is that my mother has always anticipated a june wedding i personally think june is a great month because the weather should be good not only for the wedding but also for a honeymoon then its okay with me jack said casting a second quick look in miguels direction it was bothering him that miguel was just standing there not moving and obviously listening there is only one problem june is so popular for weddings that the riverside church is already booked for all the saturdays in the month can you imagine eight months in advance anyway june ninth is a friday does that bother you friday saturday it doesnt matter to me im easy fabulous actually id prefer saturday because its traditional and easier for guests but the reality is that the options not available hey miguel jack called how about finishing with those intestines lets not make it your lifes work im all done dr stapleton im just waiting for you to come on over and take a peek oh jack said simply mildly embarrassed for assuming the tech was eavesdropping then to laurie he said sorry but i have to keep this show on the road no problem laurie said she trailed after him over to the sink miguel handed over the intestines which had been opened throughout their length and then thoroughly rinsed to expose the mucosal surface theres something else i found out today laurie said and i wanted to share it with you go ahead jack said as he methodically began to examine the digestive system starting from the esophagus and working southward you know ive never felt particularly comfortable in your apartment mainly because the building is a pigsty jack lived in a fourthfloor walkup unit in a dilapidated building on th street just opposite the neighborhood playground he had paid to have completely reconditioned stemming from a persistent belief that he didnt deserve to be comfortable he lived significantly below his means lauries presence however had altered the equation i dont mean to hurt your feelings about this laurie continued but with the wedding coming up we have to give some thought to our living situation so i took the liberty of looking into who actually owns the property which the supposed management company where you send your checks was reluctant to divulge anyway i found out who owns it and contacted them to see if they would be interested in selling guess what they are as long as its purchased in its as is condition i think that raises some interesting possibilities what do you think jack had stopped examining the guts in his hands as laurie spoke and he now turned to her wedding plans over the autopsy table and now hearthandhome issues over the intestinal sink dont you think this might not be the best place for this discussion i just learned about this minutes ago and i was excited to tell you so you could start mulling it over terrific jack said suppressing an almost irresistible urge to be more sarcastic mission accomplished but what do you say to the idea we discuss buying and i assume renovating a house over a glass of wine and an arugula salad in a slightly more appropriate setting thats a marvelous idea laurie said happily see you back at the apartment with that said laurie turned on her heels and was gone jack continued to stare at the door to the hall for several beats after it had closed behind her its great you guys are getting married miguel said to break the silence thank you its not a secret but its not common knowledge either i hope you can respect that no problem dr stapleton but i have to tell you from experience that getting married changes everything how right you are jack said he knew that from experience as well boston massachusetts monday june am eight months later prologue all rise the uniformed court officer called out as he emerged from the judges chambers he was holding a white staff directly behind the bailiff appeared the judge swathed in flowing black robes he was a heavyset african american with pendulous jowls graying kinky hair and a mustache his dark intense eyes cast a quick glance around his fiefdom as he mounted the two steps up to the bench with a forceful deliberate gait reaching his chair he turned to face the room framed by the american flag to his right and the massachusetts state flag to his left both capped by eagles with a reputation of fairness and sound knowledge of the law but a quick temper he was the embodiment of steadfast authority enhancing his stature a concentrated band of bright morning sunlight penetrated the edge of the shades that were pulled down over the metal mullioned windows and cascaded over his head and shoulders giving his outline a golden glow like that of a pagan god in a classical painting hear ye hear ye hear ye the court officer continued in his baritone bostonaccented voice all persons having anything to do before the honorable justices of the superior court now sitting at boston and in the county of suffolk draw near give your attendance and you shall be heard god save the commonwealth of massachusetts be seated reminiscent of the effect of the conclusion of the national anthem at a sporting event the bailiffs final command initiated a murmur of voices as everyone in courtroom took their seats while the judge rearranged the papers and water pitcher before him the clerk sitting at a desk directly below the bench called out the estate of patience stanhope et al versus dr craig bowman the honorable justice marvin davidson presiding with a studied motion the judge snapped open an eyeglasses case and slipped on his rimless reading spectacles positioning them low on his nose he then looked over the tops at the plaintiffs table and said will counsels identify themselves for the record in contrast to the bailiff he had no accent and his voice was in the bass range anthony fasano your honor the plaintiffs attorney said quickly with an accent not too dissimilar to the bailiffs as he rose from his chair to a halfstanding position as if supporting a heavy weight on his shoulders but most people call me tony he gestured first to his right im here on behalf of the plaintiff mr jordan stanhope he then gestured to his left next to me is my able colleague ms renee relf he then quickly regained his seat as if he was too shy to be in the spotlight judge davidsons eyes moved laterally to the defense table randolph bingham your honor the defense attorney said in contrast to the plaintiffs attorney he spoke slowly emphasizing each syllable in a mellifluous voice im representing dr craig bowman and im accompanied by mr mark cavendish and i can assume you people are ready to get under way judge davidson said tony merely nodded in assent whereas randolph again rose to his feet there are some housekeeping motions before the court he said the judge glared at randolph for a beat to suggest he didnt like or need to be reminded of preliminary motions looking down he touched his index finger to his tongue before searching through the pages in his hands the way he moved suggested he was vexed as if randolph s comment had awakened the renowned disdain he had for lawyers in general he cleared his throat before saying motions for dismissal denied it is also the courts feeling that none of the proposed witnesses or evidence is either too graphic or too complex for the jurys ability to consider it consequently all motions in limine denied he raised his eyes and again glowered at randolph as if saying take that before switching his gaze to the court officer bring in the venire we have work to do he was also known as a judge who liked to move things along as if on cue an expectant murmur arose again from the spectators beyond the bar but they didnt have long to converse the clerk rapidly pulled sixteen names from the jury hopper and the court officer went to fetch the people selected from the jury pool within minutes the sixteen were escorted into the room and sworn to begin the voir dire the assemblage was visibly disparate and almost equally divided between the sexes although the majority was caucasian other minorities were represented approximately threequarters were dressed appropriately and respectfully with half of them businessmen or businesswomen the rest were attired in a mixture of tshirts sweatshirts jeans sandals and hiphop clothes some of which had to be continuously hiked up to keep them from falling off a few of the experienced venirepersons had brought reading material mostly newspapers and magazines although one latemiddleaged woman had a hardcover book some were awed by the surroundings others brazenly dismissive as the group filed into the jury box area and took their seats judge davidson gave a short introduction during which he thanked the prospective jurors for their service and told them how important it was since they were to be finders of fact he briefly described the selection process despite knowing they had already been apprised of the same in the jury room he then began asking a series of questions to determine suitability with the hope of weeding out those jurors with particular bias that might prejudice them against either the plaintiff or the defendant the goal was he insisted that justice be served justice my ass craig bowman said to himself he took a deep breath and shifted in his seat he had not been aware of how tense hed been he lifted his hands which had been coiled into fists in his lap and placed them on the table leaning forward on his forearms he opened his fingers and fully extended them feeling more than hearing snapping from his complaining joints he was dressed in one of his most conservative gray suits white shirt and tie all on specific orders of his attorney randolph bingham seated to his immediate right also on specific orders from his attorney craig kept his facial expression neutral as difficult as that was in such a humiliating circumstance he had been instructed to act dignified respectful whatever that meant and humble he was to guard against appearing arrogant and angry not appearing angry was the difficult part since he was furious at the whole affair he was also instructed to engage the jurors to look them in the eyes to consider them as acquaintances and friends craig laughed derisively to himself as his eyes scanned the prospective jurors the idea that they were his peers was a sad joke his eyes stopped on a waiflike female with blond stringy hair that was all but hiding her pale pixie face she was dressed in an oversized patriots sweatshirt the arms of which were so long that only the tips of her fingers were visible as she continuously parted her hair in front of her face pulling it to the sides in order to see craig sighed the last eight months had been pure hell when hed been served with the summons the previous autumn hed guessed the affair was going to be bad but it had been worse than hed ever imagined first there had been the interrogatories poking into every recess of his life as bad as the interrogatories were the depositions were worse leaning forward craig looked over at the plaintiffs table and eyed tony fasano craig had disliked a few people in his life but he had never hated anyone as much as hed come to hate tony fasano even the way tony looked and dressed in his trendy gray suits black shirts black ties and clunky gold jewelry added to his loathing to craig tony fasano appearing like a sleazy mafioso understudy was the tawdry stereotype of the modernday personalinjury ambulancechasing lawyer out to make a buck over someone elses misfortune by squeezing millions out of rich reluctant insurance companies to craigs disgust tony even had a website bragging as much and the fact that he might ruin a doctors life in the process made no difference in the world craigs eyes switched to randolph s aristocratic profile as the man concentrated on the voir dire proceeding randolph had a slightly hooked highbridged nose not too dissimilar to tonys but the effect was altogether different whereas tony looked at you from beneath his dark bushy eyebrows his nose directed downward partially covering a cruel smirk on his lips randolph held his nose straight out in front maybe slightly elevated and regarded those around him with what could be considered by some to be mild disdain and in contrast to tonys full lips which he wetted frequently with his tongue as he talked randolph s mouth was a thin precise line nearly lipless and when he talked a tongue was all but invisible in short randolph was the epitome of the seasoned and restrained boston brahmin while tony was the youthful and exuberant playground entertainer and bully at first craig had been pleased with the contrast but now looking at the prospective jurors he couldnt help but wonder if tonys persona would make more of a connection and have more influence this new concern added to craigs unease and there was plenty of reason for unease randolph s reassurances notwithstanding the case was not going well of particular note it had been in essence already found for the plaintiff by the statutory massachusetts tribunal which had ruled after hearing testimony that there was sufficient properly substantiated evidence of possible negligence to allow the case to go to trial as a corollary to this finding there was no need for the claimant jordan stanhope to post a bond the day that craig had learned this news was the blackest for him of the whole pretrial period and unbeknownst to anyone he had for the first time in his life considered the idea of suicide of course randolph had offered the same pabulum that craig had been given initially namely that he should not take the minor defeat personally yet how could he not take the finding personally since it had been rendered by a judge a lawyer and a physician colleague these were not highschool dropouts or stultified bluecollar laborers they were professionals and the fact that they thought he had committed malpractice meaning he had rendered care that was substandard was a mortal blow to craigs sense of honor and personal integrity he had literally devoted his entire life to becoming the best doctor he could be and he had succeeded as evidenced by stellar grades in medical school by stellar evaluations during the course of his residency at one of the most coveted institutions in the country and even by the offer to become part of his current practice from a celebrated and widely renowned clinician yet these professionals were calling him a tortfeasor in a very real sense the entire image of his selfworth and selfesteem had been undermined and was now on the line there had been other events besides the tribunals ruling that had seriously clouded the horizon back at the beginning even before the interrogatories had been completed randolph had strenuously advised that craig make every effort to reconcile with his wife alexis give up his intown recreational apartment as randolph had referred to it and move back to the newton family home it had been randolph s strong feeling that craigs relatively new selfindulgent as he called it lifestyle would not sit well with a jury willing to listen to experienced advice although chafing at the dependency it represented craig had followed the recommendations to the letter hed been pleased and thankful that alexis had been willing to allow him to return albeit to sleep in the guest room and shed been graciously supportive as evidenced by her sitting at that very moment in the spectator section reflexively craig twisted around and caught alexiss eye she was dressed in a casually professional style for her work as a psychologist at the boston memorial hospital with a white blouse and blue cardigan sweater craig managed a crooked smile and she acknowledged it with one of her own craig redirected his attention to the voir dire the judge was castigating a frumpy accountant who was intent on being excused for hardship the man had claimed clients couldnt do without him for a weeks trial which was how long the judge estimated the proceeding would take considering the witness list which was mostly the plaintiff attorneys list judge davidson was merciless as he told the gentleman what he thought of his sense of civic responsibility but then dismissed him a replacement was called and sworn and the process continued thanks to alexiss personal generosity which craig attributed primarily to her maturity and secondarily to her training as a psychologist things had gone reasonably well at home over the last eight months craig knew it could have been intolerable if alexis had chosen to behave as he probably would have if the situation had been reversed from his current vantage point craig was able to view his socalled awakening as a juvenile attempt to be someone he wasnt he was born to be a doctor which was an encompassing calling and not a brahmin socialite in fact hed been given his first doctor kit by his doting mother when he was four and he could remember administering to his mother and older brother with a precocious seriousness that foreshadowed his clinical talent although in college and even the first years of medical school hed felt his calling was basic medical research he would later realize he had an inherent gift for clinical diagnosis which impressed his superiors and thereby pleased him as well by the time he graduated from medical school he knew he was to be a clinician with an interest in research not vice versa although alexis and his two younger daughters meghan eleven and christina ten had been forgiving and seemingly understanding tracy had been another story at age fifteen and in the throes of adolescence she had been overtly and persistently unable to forgive craig for abandoning the family for six months perhaps associated there had been some unfortunate episodes of rebelliousness with disturbing drug use open violation of curfews and even sneaking out of the house at night alexis was concerned but since she had an open communication with the girl she was reasonably confident that tracy would come around alexis urged craig not to interfere under the circumstances craig was happy to oblige since he would have had no idea how to handle the situation under the best of circumstances and was intellectually and emotionally preoccupied with his own disaster judge davidson struck two potential jurors for cause one was openly hostile to insurance companies and thought they were ripping off the country ergo sayonara another had a cousin whod been in craigs former practice and had heard craig was a wonderful doctor several other juror prospects were dismissed when the counselors began using some of their peremptory challenges including a welldressed businessman by tony and a young africanamerican male dressed in elaborate hiphop gear by randolph four more veniremen were called from the jury pool and sworn the questions continued having to deal with tracy s resentment had hurt craig but it was nothing compared to the problems he had with leona as the spurned lover she became vindictive especially when she found herself having to find another apartment her poor attitude disrupted the office and craig was caught between a rock and a hard place he couldnt fire her for fear of a sexual discrimination suit on top of his malpractice problem so he had to deal with her as best as he could why she didnt quit on her own he had no idea since it was open warfare between her and the duo marlene and darlene every day there was a new crisis with both marlene and darlene threatening to quit but craig couldnt let them since he needed them more than ever as handicapped as he was emotionally and physically from the lawsuit he found practicing medicine almost impossible he couldnt concentrate and he saw every patient as a potential litigant almost from the day hed been served he suffered recurrent bouts of anxiety which aggravated his hypervigilant digestive system causing heartburn and diarrhea compounding everything was the insomnia forcing him to use sleeping pills and making him feel sodden instead of refreshed when he awoke all in all he was a mess the only good part was that he didnt regain the weight he had lost from going to the gym thanks to his lack of appetite on the other hand he did regain his previously sallow pudgy face which was now made worse by sunken eyes lined with dark circles as baneful as leonas behavior was in the office in terms of complicating craigs life it was trumped by her effect on the malpractice suit the first hint of trouble occurred when she appeared on tony fasanos witness list how bad it was going to prove to be became evident at her deposition which was a painful affair for craig as he was forced to witness the depth of her resentment ultimately humiliating him with her scoffing description of his lack of male prowess prior to the deposition craig had confessed to randolph the details of his affair with leona so randolph would know what to expect and what questions to ask hed also warned how irresponsibly talkative hed been about his feelings toward the deceased the night hed been served but he might as well have saved his breath whether it was from spite or just a good memory leona had recalled most everything craig had said about patience stanhope including his hating the woman calling her an entitled hypochrondriacal bitch and his assertion that her passing was a blessing for everyone after such revelations even randolph s perennial optimism about the suits ultimate outcome had taken a serious hit when he and craig left fasanos secondfloor office on hanover street in boston s north end randolph was even more taciturn and constrained than usual shes not going to help my case is she craig had asked vainly hoping that his fears were unfounded i hope this is the only surprise you have for me randolph had answered your glibness has succeeded in making this an uphill struggle please reassure me you havent spoken in a similar regrettable fashion to anyone else i havent thank god as they had climbed into randolph s waiting car craig had acknowledged to himself that he despised randolph s superior attitude although later he came to understand that what he hated was the dependency that bound him to the lawyer craig had always been his own man struggling singlehandedly against the obstacles hed faced until now now he couldnt do it alone he needed randolph and as a consequence craigs feelings toward the defense attorney went back and forth during the pretrial months depending on how the affair unfolded craig became aware of a huff of displeasure from randolph as tony used his last preemptory strike to remove a nattily dressed nursinghome administrator randolph s elegant finger tapped with displeasure against his yellow legal pad seemingly in retribution randolph then struck the waif in the oversized sweatshirt two more individuals were then called from the jury pool and sworn and the questions continued leaning over toward his lawyer craig asked in a whisper what he needed to do to use the restroom his hypervigilant colon was responding to his anxiety randolph assured him it wasnt a problem and that he should just indicate the need as he was now doing craig nodded and pushed back his chair it was humiliating to sense all eyes upon him as he exited the bar through the gate the only person he acknowledged was alexis with everyone else he avoided eye contact the mens room was oldfashioned and reeked of stale urine craig wasted no time getting into a stall to avoid any contact with several suspiciouslooking unshaven men loitering by the sinks and conversing in hushed voices with its graffitied walls its marble mosaic floor in disrepair and the disagreeable odor the mens room seemed symbolic of craigs current life and with his digestive system behaving as it was he was afraid hed be making frequent visits to its unpleasant surroundings during the course of the trial with a piece of toilet paper he wiped the seat after hed sat down he thought again of leonas deposition and although it had been possibly the worst deposition in regard to its potential impact on the cases outcome it hadnt been the worst from a purely emotional point of view that dubious honor belonged to both his own deposition and those of tony fasanos experts to craigs dismay tony had had no trouble getting local area experts to agree to testify and the lineup was impressive all were people he knew and admired and who knew him first to be deposed was the cardiologist whod helped with the resuscitation attempt her name was dr madeline mardy second was dr william tardoff chief of cardiology at newton memorial hospital and third and most distressing for craig was dr herman brown chief of cardiology at boston memorial hospital and chair of cardiology at harvard medical school all three testified that the first minutes after a heart attack were the most crucial in terms of survival they also concurred that it was common knowledge that it was absolutely key to get the patient to a hospital facility as expeditiously as possible and that any delay was unconscionable although all were dismissive of the idea of making a house call in the face of a suspected myocardial infarction randolph made all of them state that they believed craig did not know for certain the patients diagnosis before arriving at her bedside randolph had also gotten two of the three to state on the record that they were impressed by craigs willingness to make a house call no matter what the diagnosis randolph had not been as troubled by the experts depositions as craig and took them in stride the reason they bothered craig so much was that the doctors were respected colleagues craig took their willingness to testify for the plaintiff as an overt criticism of his reputation as a physician this was especially true for dr herman brown whom craig had had as a preceptor in medical school and as an attending during his residency it was dr browns criticism and disapproval that cut craig to the quick especially since craig had gotten such approbation from the same individual when craig had been a student to make matters worse craig had been unable to get any local colleague to testify on his behalf as upsetting as craig found the experts depositions his own deposition had been far more disturbing hed even judged it the single most irksome and distressing experience in his life to date especially since tony fasano had stretched the session out for two grueling days like a kind of filibuster randolph had to a degree anticipated craigs difficulties and had tried to coach him hed advised craig to hesitate after a question in case an objection was appropriate to think for a moment about the ramifications of a question before answering to take his time answering to avoid offering anything not asked and above all not to appear arrogant and not to get into an argument hed said he couldnt be more specific since hed never opposed tony fasano in the past mainly because it was apparently tonys first foray into the malpractice arena from his usual personalinjury specialty the deposition had taken place in randolph s posh state street office with its stunning view over boston harbor initially tony had been reasonable not quite pleasant but certainly not confrontational that was the playground entertainer persona hed even persisted in cracking a few offtherecord jokes although only the court reporter had giggled but the entertainer persona soon disappeared to be replaced by the bully as he began to hammer and accuse about craigs professional and private life in humiliating detail craigs weak defenses began to crumble randolph objected when he could even tried to suggest recess at several junctures but craig had gotten to the point where he would not hear of it despite being warned against anger craig had gotten angry very angry and then proceeded to violate all of randolph s admonitions and ignore all recommendations the worst exchange happened in the early afternoon of the second day even though randolph had again warned craig about losing control during lunch and craig had promised to follow his advice craig quickly fell into the same trap under the onslaught of tonys preposterous allegations wait a second craig had snapped let me tell you something please tony had retorted im all ears ive made some mistakes in my professional life all doctors have but patience stanhope was not one of them no way really tony had questioned superciliously what do you mean by mistakes i think it wise if we take a break here randolph had said trying to intervene i dont need a goddamned break craig shouted i want this asshole to understand just for a second what its like to be a doctor to be the one right there in the frontline trenches with sick people as well as hypochondriacs but our goal is not to educate mr fasano randolph had said it doesnt matter what he believes mistakes are when you do something stupid craig had said ignoring randolph and leaning forward to get his face closer to tonys like cutting a corner when youre exhausted and have ten more patients to see or forgetting to order a test when you know its indicated because you had an intervening emergency or like making a stupid house call instead of meeting a seriously ill patient who was struggling to breathe at the hospital so you could get to the symphony on time the sound of the outer mens room door slamming brought craig back to the present hoping his lower intestine would stay quiescent for the rest of the morning he finished up pulled on his suit jacket and went out to wash his hands as he did so he looked at himself in the mirror he winced at his reflection his appearance now was markedly worse than it had been before he started at the gym and he didnt see much chance for improvement in the near future with the trial just getting under way it was going to be a long stressful week especially considering his disastrous performance at his deposition immediately after the debacle he hadnt needed randolph to tell him how miserably hed performed although randolph was gracious enough merely to suggest that they needed to practice prior to his testifying at the trial before craig had left randolph s office that day craig had pulled randolph aside and looked him in the eye there is something i want you to know hed said insistently i have made mistakes as i told fasano even though ive tried my damnedest to be a good doctor but i didnt make a mistake with patience stanhope there was no negligence i know randolph had said believe me i understand your frustration and your pain and i promise you no matter what ill do my best to convince the jury of the same back in the courtroom craig regained his seat the voir dire had been completed and the jury impaneled judge davidson was giving them some initial instructions including making certain their cell phones were off and explaining the civil procedure they were about to witness he told them that they and they alone were to be the triers of fact in the case meaning they would be deciding the factual issues at the end of the trial he said he would charge them with the appropriate points of law which was his bailiwick he thanked them again for their service before looking over his spectacles at tony fasano plaintiff ready judge davidson asked he had already told the jury that the proceedings would start with the plaintiff attorney making his opening statement one moment your honor tony said he leaned over and conversed in a whisper with his assistant ms relf she nodded while she listened and then handed him a stack of note cards during the brief delay craig tried to begin engaging the jury as randolph had recommended by regarding each in turn hoping for eye contact as he did so he hoped that his expression did not reflect his inner thoughts for him the concept that this disparate mixed bag of laypeople represented his peers seemed ludicrous at best there was a nonchalant firefighter in a spotless white tshirt with bulging muscles there was a clutch of housewives who appeared to be electrified about the whole experience there was a bluehaired retired schoolteacher who looked like everybodys image of a grandmother an overweight plumbers assistant in jeans and dirty tshirt had one foot propped up on the front rail of the jury box next to him in sharp contrast was a welldressed young man with a scarlet pocket square spilling out of the breast pocket of a tan linen jacket a prim female nurse of asian extraction was next with her hands folded in her lap next were two struggling smallbusinessmen in polyester suits who clearly looked bored as well as irritated at having been coerced into their civic duty a considerably more welltodo stockbroker was in the back row directly behind the businessmen craig felt a mounting despair as his eyes went from each individual juror to the next except for the asian nurse none were willing to make eye contact even briefly he couldnt help but feel that there was little chance any of these people save for the nurse could have any idea of what it was like being a doctor in todays world and when he combined that realization with his performance during his deposition and with leonas expected testimony and the plaintiffs experts testimony chances for a successful outcome seemed distant at best it was all very depressing yet a fitting end to a horrid eight months of anxiety grief isolation and insomnia engendered by his constant mental replaying of the whole affair craig was aware that the experience had affected him deeply robbing him of his selfconfidence his sense of justice his selfesteem even his passion for practicing medicine as he sat there looking at the jurors he wondered irrespective of the outcome if he would ever be able to be the doctor he had once been boston massachusetts monday june am tony fasano gripped the edges of the podium as if he were at the controls of a mammoth video game his pomaded slickedback hair had an impressive sheen the large diamond in his gold ring flashed as it caught the sunlight his goldnugget cuff links were in full view despite his relatively short stature his boxy build gave him a formidable appearance and his robust swarthy complexion gave him a look of health despite the courtrooms sallowcolored walls after hiking a tasseled loafer onto the podiums brass rail he began his opening statement ladies and gentlemen of the jury i want to express my personal appreciation of your service to allow my client jordan stanhope his day in court tony paused to glance back at jordan who remained impassive and motionless as if he were a mannequin he was dressed impeccably in a dark suit with a sawtooth white handkerchief peeking out of his breast pocket his manicured hands were folded in front of him his countenance expressionless facing around tony regained eye contact with the jurors his face assumed the expression of the bereft mr stanhope has been in deep mourning barely able to function after the regrettable unexpected passing nine months ago of his lovely dutiful wife and lifes companion patience stanhope it was a tragedy that neednt have happened and it wouldnt have happened except for the disgraceful negligence and malpractice of my opposing counsels client dr craig m bowman craig reflexively stiffened randolph s fingers promptly wrapped themselves around craigs forearm and he leaned toward the doctor control yourself he whispered how can that bastard say that craig whispered back i thought that was what this trial is about it is indeed hes permitted to state the allegation i do admit hes being inflammatory regrettably that is his reputed style now tony said pointing ceilingward with an extended index finger before i provide you good folks with a road map of how i will substantiate what ive just said id like to make a confession about myself i didnt go to harvard like my esteemed opposing colleague im just a city boy from the north end and sometimes i dont talk that great the plumbers assistant laughed openly and the two polyester suits cracked smiles despite their apparent pique but i try tony added and if youre a little nervous about being here understand that i am too the three housewives and the retired schoolteacher smiled at tonys unexpected admission now im going to be upfront with you good people tony continued just like ive been with my client ive not done a lot of malpractice work in fact this is my first case the muscular firefighter now smiled and nodded approval of tonys candor so you might be asking yourself why did this wop take the case ill tell you why to protect you and me and my kids from the likes of dr bowman mild expressions of surprise registered on most of the jurors faces as randolph rose up to his full patrician height your honor i must object counsel is being inflammatory judge davidson regarded tony over the tops of his glasses with a mixture of irritation and surprise your comments are pushing the limits of courtroom decorum this is an arena for verbal combat but established rites and rules are to be followed especially in my courtroom do i make myself clear tony raised both beefy hands above his head in supplication absolutely and i apologize to the court the problem is occasionally my emotions get the better of me and this is one of those cases your honor randolph complained but he didnt finish the judge waved for him to sit while ordering tony to proceed with appropriate propriety this is fast becoming a circus randolph whispered as he took his seat tony fasano is a clown but a deviously clever clown craig regarded the attorney it was the first time hed seen a crack in the mans glacial aplomb and his comment was disturbing there was a definite element of reluctant admiration after a brief glance at his cards in the crook of the lecterns top tony returned to his opening statement some of you might wonder why cases like this arent settled by learned judges and accordingly question why you have to interrupt your lives ill tell you why because you have more common sense than judges tony pointed at each juror in term he had their full attention its true with all due respect your honor tony said looking up at the judge your memory banks are jammed full of laws and statutes and all sorts of legal mumbo jumbo whereas these people he redirected his attention to the jury are capable of seeing the facts in my book this is an absolute maxim if i ever get into trouble i want a jury why because you people with your common sense and your intuitional ability can see through the legal haze and tell where the truth lies several of the jurors were now nodding agreement and craig felt his pulse quicken and a cramp grip his lower bowels his fear about tony connecting with the jury was seemingly already coming to pass it was indicative of the whole sorry affair just when he felt things couldnt get any worse they did what im going to do tony continued gesticulating with his right hand is to prove to you four basic points number one by the doctors own employees i am going to show that dr bowman owed a duty to the deceased number two with the testimony of three recognized experts from three of our own areas renowned institutions i will show you what a reasonable doctor would do in the circumstance the deceased found herself in the evening of the fifth of september number three with the testimony of the plaintiff of one of the doctors employees and of one of the experts who happened to be involved in the actual case i will show you how dr bowman negligently failed to act as a reasonable doctor would have acted and number four how dr bowmans conduct was the proximate cause of the patients sad death thats it in a nutshell perspiration appeared on craigs forehead and his throat felt suddenly dry he needed to use the restroom but he didnt dare he poured himself some water from a pitcher in front of him with an embarrassingly shaky hand and took a drink now we are back on terra firma randolph whispered he obviously was not as moved as craig which was some consolation but craig knew there was more what i have just outlined tony continued is the core of a gardenvariety case of medical malpractice its what the fancy expensive lawyers like my opponent like to call the prima facie case i call it the core or the guts a lot of lawyers like a lot of doctors have a fondness to use words nobody understands particularly latin words but this isnt a gardenvariety case its much worse and thats why i feel so strongly about it now the defense is going to want you to believe and they have witnesses to suggest that dr bowman is this great compassionate charitable doctor with a pictureperfect nuclear family but the reality is far different objection randolph said dr bowmans private life is not an issue counsel is trying to impugn my client judge davidson stared down at tony after taking off his reading glasses you are straying afield here son is the direction you are taking relevant to this specific allegation of medical negligence absolutely you honor it is key you and your clients case are going to be in a lot of hot water if it is not objection overruled proceed thank you your honor tony said before reconnecting with the jurors on the night of the fifth of september when patience stanhope was to meet her untimely end dr craig bowman was not snuggled in his cozy posh newton home with his darling family oh no you will learn by a witness who was his employee and girlfriend that he was with her in his intown love nest objection randolph said with uncharacteristic forcefulness inflammatory and hearsay i cannot allow this type of language craig felt blood rush to his face he wanted to turn and connect with alexis but he couldnt get himself to do it not with the humiliation he was experiencing sustained counsel stick to the facts without inflammatory embellishments until the witness testifies of course your honor it is just hard to rein in my emotion youll be in contempt if you dont understood tony said he looked back at the jurors what you will hear testimony to is that dr bowmans lifestyle had changed dramatically objection randolph said private life lifestyle none of this has relevance to the issue at hand this is a medical malpractice trial good lord judge davidson exclaimed with frustration counsels approach the bench both randolph and tony dutifully went to the side of the judges box out of earshot of everyone in the courtroom and most important beyond the range of both the court reporter and the jury at this rate this trial is going to take a year for christs sake judge davidson groused my entire months schedule will have to be trashed i cannot allow this farce to continue randolph complained its prejudicial to my client i keep losing my train of thought with these interruptions tony grumbled pipe down i dont want to hear any more pissing and moaning out of either one of you mr fasano give me some justification for this excursion from the relevant medical facts it was the doctors decision to go to the deceaseds home on a house call instead of agreeing to the plaintiffs request to take his wife directly to the hospital even though as the doctor himself will testify he suspected a heart attack so what judge davidson questioned i assume the doctor responded to the emergency without undue delay were willing to stipulate that but dr bowman didnt make house calls before he had his midlife crisis or awakening as he calls it and before he moved into town with his lover my experts will all testify that the delay caused by making the house call was critical in patience stanhopes death judge davidson ruminated on this as he did so he absently rolled his lower lip into his mouth such that his mustache reached halfway down his chin provider lifestyle and mindset are not the issues in medical malpractice randolph asserted legally the question is simply whether there was a deviation from the standard of care causing a compensable injury generally you are right but i believe mr fasano has a valid point provided subsequent testimony supports it can you say thats unequivocally the case to the letter tony said with assurance then it will be up to the jury to decide objection overruled you may proceed mr fasano but i warn you again about inflammatory language thank you your honor randolph returned to his seat ostensibly annoyed were going to have to weather the storm he said the judge is allowing fasano unusual discretion on the positive side it will add fodder for the appeal if there is ultimately a finding for the plaintiff craig nodded but the fact that randolph for the first time was voicing the possibility of a negative outcome added to craigs growing despondency and pessimism now where the devil was i tony said after regaining the podium he shuffled through his note cards briefly adjusted the sleeves of his silk jacket so that his shirt cuffs presented just enough and his clunky gold watch was just visible he raised his eyes in the third grade i learned i was terrible speaking in front of groups and it hasnt changed much so i hope you give me a little slack a number of the jurors smiled and nodded in sympathy we will present testimony that dr bowmans professional life changed dramatically almost two years ago prior to that he had essentially a traditional feeforservice practice then he switched he joined and has essentially taken over a successful concierge practice objection randolph said this trial is not about style of practice judge davidson sighed with frustration mr fasano is dr bowmans style of practice germane to the issue we discussed at the sidebar absolutely your honor objection overruled proceed now tony said engaging the jury im looking at a number of faces here that look a little blank when i mention the term concierge medicine and you know why because there are a lot of people who dont know what it is including me before i took on this case its also called retainer medicine meaning those patients who want to be included in the practice have to cough up some big bucks up front each and every year and were talking about some big money with some of these practices upwards of twenty thousand dollars a head per year now dr bowman and his mostly retired partner dr ethan cohen dont charge that much but they charge a lot as you can well imagine this style of practice can only exist in wealthy sophisticated areas like some of our major cities and posh locales like palm beach or naples florida or aspen colorado objection randolph said your honor concierge medicine is not on trial here i disagree your honor tony said looking up at the judge in a way concierge medicine is on trial then relate it to the case counselor judge davidson said irritably objection overruled tony looked back at the jurors now what do people in a concierge practice get for all this upfront moola besides getting kicked out of the practice and abandoned if they dont come up with the dough youll hear testimony for what they supposedly get its going to include guaranteed twentyfourseven access to their doctor with the availability of the doctors cell phone numbers and email address and a nowait guarantee for their appointments both of which i personally think people should get without having to fork over retainer fees but most important of all in relation to this current case they get the possibility of house calls when appropriate and convenient tony paused for a moment to let his comments sink in during the trial you will hear direct testimony that on the evening of september fifth dr bowman had tickets to the symphony for himself and his livein girlfriend while his wife and darling daughters were moping at home with him currently back in the family manse id love to have the doctors wife as a witness but i cant because of spousal confidentiality she must be a saint objection randolph said for the very reason cited sustained you will also hear testimony tony continued with hardly a break that the known standard of care when a heart attack is suspected is to get the patient to the hospital immediately in order to initiate treatment and when i say immediately im not exaggerating because minutes maybe seconds count between life and death you will hear testimony that despite my clients pleading to take his stricken wife to meet dr bowman where she could be treated dr bowman insisted he make a house call and why did he make the house call you will hear testimony that it was important because if patience stanhope did not have a heart attack even though from his own testimony you will hear that he suspected it if she didnt then he would be able to get to the symphony on time to drive up in his new red porsche walk in and be admired for his culture and for the young attractive woman he had on his arm and therein my friends lies or lays im never sure which the medical negligence and malpractice for in his own vanity dr bowman violated the standard of care that dictates a heart attack victim get to a treatment facility absolutely as soon as possible now you will hear some different interpretation of these facts from the efforts of my more polished and experienced colleague but i am confident that you people will see the truth as i believe the massachusetts tribunal did when they heard this case and recommended it for trial objection randolph called out leaping to his feet and move to strike and request the court to admonish counsel the tribunals findings are not admissible beeler versus downey massachusetts supreme judicial court sustained judge davidson snapped defense counsel is correct mr fasano im sorry your honor tony said he stepped over to the plaintiffs table and took a paper offered by ms relf i have here a copy of massachusetts laws chapter two thirtyone section sixty b saying the panels findings and testimony before the panel are admissible that was overturned by the case cited judge davidson said he looked down at the court reporter remove the reference to the tribunal from the record yes sir the court reporter said judge davidson then engaged the jury you are directed to disregard mr fasanos comment about the massachusetts tribunal and you are instructed that it will play no role whatsoever in your responsibility as triers of fact am i understood the jury all nodded sheepishly the judge glanced down at tony inexperience is not an excuse for not knowing the law i trust there will be no more slipups of this sort or i will be forced to declare a mistrial i will try my best tony said he returned to the podium slabfooted he took a moment to gather his thoughts then looked up at the jury i am confident as i said that you will see the truth and find that dr bowmans negligence caused the death of my clients lovely wife you will be then asked to award damages for the care guidance support counsel and companionship that patience stanhope would be providing today to my client if she had lived so thank you for your attention and i apologize to you as i did to the judge for my inexperience in this particular arena of law and i look forward to addressing you again at the conclusion of the trial thank you gathering his cards from the lectern tony retreated back to the plaintiffs table and immediately launched into a hushed but intense conversation with his assistant he was flaunting the paper she had recently handed him with a sigh of relief that tony had finished judge davidson glanced at his watch before looking down at randolph does the defense counsel wish to make an opening statement at this juncture of the proceedings or after the plaintiffs case in chief most definitely now your honor randolph replied very well but first we will take a lunch recess he smartly smacked the gavel courts adjourned until one thirty jurors are instructed not to discuss the case with anyone or among themselves all rise the court officer called out like a town crier as the judge got to his feet boston massachusetts monday june pm although most everyone else began to file out of the courtrooms gallery alexis stapleton bowman did not move she was watching her husband whod sunk back into his chair like a deflated balloon the moment the paneled door to the judges chamber closed randolph was leaning over him and speaking in a hushed tone he had a hand on craigs shoulder randolph s paralegal mark cavendish was standing on the other side of craig gathering up papers a laptop and other odds and ends and slipping them into an open briefcase alexis had the impression randolph was trying to talk craig into something and she debated whether to intervene or wait for the moment she decided that it was best to wait instead she watched the plaintiff jordan stanhope come through the gate in the bar his face was neutral his demeanor aloof his dress conservative and expensive alexis watched as he wordlessly found a young woman who matched his behavior and attire like two peas in a pod as a hospitalbased psychologist alexis had been to numerous trials testifying in various capacities although mostly as an expert witness from her experience she knew that they were anxious affairs for everyone particularly for doctors being sued for malpractice and especially for her husband whom she knew was in a markedly vulnerable state craigs trial was the culmination of an especially difficult two years and a lot was riding on the outcome thanks to her training and her ability to be objective even about personal affairs she knew craigs vulnerabilities as well as his strengths unfortunately in the current crisis she was aware that vulnerability trumped the strengths such that if he did not prevail in this very public questioning of his abilities as a doctor she doubted hed be able to pull together his life which had splintered even prior to the lawsuit with a rather typical midlife crisis craig was first and foremost a doctor his patients came first shed known that fact from the beginning of their relationship and had accepted it even admired it for she knew that being a doctor particularly a good doctor was in her estimation and she had a lot of firsthand knowledge from working in a major hospital one of the toughest most demanding and unrelenting jobs in the world the problem was that there was a good chance at least on the first goround as randolph had confided to her that the case could be lost despite there having been no malpractice in her heart of hearts alexis was sure of that from hearing the story and because she knew that craig always put his patients first even in those situations where it involved some inconvenience and even if it was three oclock in the morning in this instance it was the double whammy of the malpractice claim and the midlife adjustment disorder that complicated the situation the fact that they did occur together did not surprise alexis she hadnt seen many physicians in her practice because seeking help particularly psychological help was generally not in the physicians nature they were givers of care not recipients in this regard craig was a prime example she had strongly suggested he seek therapy especially considering his reaction to leonas deposition and to the deposition of the plaintiffs experts and she could have easily arranged it but he had steadfastly refused hed even reacted angrily when she made the suggestion again a week later when it was apparent he was becoming progressively more depressed as alexis was continuing to debate whether to approach craig and randolph or stay where she was she became aware of another person whod stayed behind in the gallery after the mass exodus what caught her attention were his clothes which were almost identical to the plaintiffs attorneys in style color and cut the similarity of dress as well as their equivalently bricklike habitus and dark hair gave them the superficial appearance of twins as long as they werent together because the man in the spectator area was at least one and a half times the size of tony fasano he also differed by being less swarthy and in contrast to tonys babybottom facial skin he had the regrettable sequela of severe teenage acne the residual scarring on his cheekbones was deep enough to appear like that of a burn at that moment tony fasano broke off his conversation with his assistant grabbed his ostrich briefcase and stormed through the gate into the gallery on his way out of the courtroom it was obvious he was chagrined about the error regarding the tribunal ruling alexis wondered why he was overreacting since his opening statement from her viewpoint had been regrettably effective and was undoubtedly the reason craig was brooding tonys assistant sheepishly followed her boss without even a sideward glance or the slightest hesitation in his step tony called out franco while gesturing for the man dressed like himself to follow franco obediently did so a moment later they all had disappeared through the heavy double doors to the hall which clanged shut with jarring finality alexis glanced back toward her husband hed not moved but randolph was now looking in her direction when he caught her eye he waved for her to come join them with an explicit invitation she was happy to oblige when she got there craigs face looked as downtrodden as shed assumed from his posture you must talk to him randolph ordered venturing from his studied patrician selfpossession with a hint of exasperation he cannot continue to behave in this despondent defeated manner in my experience juries have special antennae im convinced they can sense a litigants mindset and decide the case accordingly are you saying the jury could decide against craig purely because hes depressed thats exactly what im saying you have to tell him to buck up if he continues to comport himself in this negative fashion there is the risk they will assume hes guilty of the alleged malpractice im not suggesting they wont listen to the testimony or consider the evidence but theyll do so only with the thought of possibly negating their initial impression such behavior turns a neutral jury into a prejudicial one and switches the burden of proof from the plaintiff where it should be to us the defense alexis looked down at craig who was now massaging his temples while cradling this head in his hands elbows on the table his eyes were closed he was breathing through an open slack mouth getting him to buck up was a tall order hed been in and out of depression for most of the eightmonth pretrial period the only reason hed acted up at all that morning and in the days immediately leading to the trial was the prospect of getting the trial over with now that the trial had started it was obvious that the reality of the possible outcome had set in being depressed was not an unreasonable response why dont we all go to lunch and we can talk alexis suggested mr cavendish and i will have to skip lunch randolph said i need to plan my opening statement you havent planned it before now alexis questioned with obvious surprise of course id planned it randolph said testily but thanks to judge davidson allowing mr fasano such discretion in his opening statement i must alter mine i was surprised by the plaintiffs opening statement alexis admitted and indeed you should have been it was nothing more than an attempt at character assasination or guilt by association since they obviously have no evidence of actual medical negligence the only good part is that judge davidson is already providing us with grounds for an appeal if needed especially with mr fasanos cheap trick of introducing the tribunals finding you dont think that was an honest mistake hardly randolph scoffed ive had some of his cases researched hes a plaintiffs attorney of the most despicable variety the man has no conscience not that i suspect one in his chosen field of specialty alexis wasnt so certain having watched the attorney harangue his associate if it were a charade it was on oscar level im supposed to buck up and youre already talking about an appeal craig sighed speaking for the first time since alexis has arrived one must prepare for all eventualities randolph said why dont you run along and do your preparation alexis said to randolph dr bowman and i will talk excellent randolph said crisply he was relieved to be freed he motioned to his assistant to leave well see you back here in a timely fashion judge davidson is among his other less desirable traits at least prompt and he expects others to be likewise alexis watched randolph and mark make their way through the courtroom and disappear out into the hallway before looking back down at craig he was watching her gloomily she took randolph s seat how about you and i have some lunch she said the last thing in the world id like to do at this moment is eat then lets go outside lets get out of this magisterial environment craig didnt answer but he did stand alexis led the way out of the bar area through the spectator section and out into the hallway and to the elevator lobby there were small groups of people milling about with some locked in furtive conversation the courthouse oozed an aura of contention from every nook and cranny craig and alexis didnt talk as they took the elevator down and walked out into a bright sunny day spring had finally come to boston in sharp contrast to the oppressive seedy courthouse interior there was hope and promise in the air after crossing a small bricked courtyard wedged between the courthouse and one of boston s government center s crescentshaped buildings craig and alexis descended a short flight of stairs crossing the busy four lanes of cambridge street took some effort but they were soon able to stroll out onto the expansive esplanade fronting boston city hall the square was crowded with people fleeing their confining offices for a little sun and fresh air there were a few fruit stalls doing brisk business without any particular destination the couple found themselves near the entrance to the boston t they sat on a granite parapet angled to face each other theres no way i can tell you to buck up alexis said youre only going to buck up if you want to buck up as if i didnt know that already but i can listen maybe you should just tell me how you feel oh whooptie do always the therapist ready to help the mentally ill tell me how you feel craig echoed mockingly how gallant lets not be hostile craig i believe in you im on your side in this legal affair craig stared off for a moment watching two kids winging a frisbee back and forth he sighed then looked back at alexis im sorry i know you are on my side letting me come back like a dog with his tail between his legs and pretty much no questions asked i appreciate it really i do youre the best doctor i know and i know a lot of doctors i also have some insight into what you are going through which ironically has something to do with your being such a superb physician it makes you more vulnerable but that aside you and i have some issues thats obvious and there will be questions but not now there will be time for dealing with our relationship but we have to get you through this ugly affair first thank you craig said simply and sincerely then his lower jaw began to tremble fighting off tears he rubbed his eyes with the balls of his fingers it took a few moments but when he felt he had himself under control he looked back at alexis his eyes were watery and red he ran a nervous hand through his hair the problem is this ugly affair keeps getting worse im afraid im going to lose the case hell when i think back on my social behavior back then when this happened im embarrassed and knowing that its all going to come out publicly is a disgrace for both of us and a dishonor for you is the airing of your social behavior a big point of whats depressing you its a part but not the biggest part the biggest humiliation is going to be the jury telling the world i practice substandard medicine if that happens im not sure ill be able to practice anymore im having a hard time as it is im seeing everybody as another litigant and every patient encounter a possible malpractice case its a nightmare i think its understandable if i cant practice medicine what else can i do i dont know anything else all i ever wanted to be is a doctor you could do your research fulltime youve always had a conflict between research and clinical medicine i suppose thats an idea but im afraid i might lose my passion for medicine in general so its pretty clear you have to do everything in your power to win randolph says you have to pull yourself together oh randolph good grief craig complained he looked off in the middle distance i dont know about him having seen mr fasanos performance this morning i dont think randolph is the right lawyer hes going to connect with that jury like oil and water whereas fasano already has them eating out of his hands if you feel that way can you request another attorney from the insurance company i dont know i guess but the question would be is it wise at this late juncture who knows craig questioned wistfully who knows well lets deal with what we have lets hear randolph s opening statement in the meantime we have to think of a way to spruce you up appearancewise thats easier said than done do you have any ideas just telling you to buck up is not going to work but what about concentrating on your innocence think about that for the moment you were presented with the seriousness of patience stanhopes condition you did everything humanly possible you even rode in the ambulance so you could be there if she arrested my god craig concentrate on that and your dedication to medicine in general and project it fill the whole damn courtroom how could you be more responsible what do you say craig chuckled dubiously in the face of alexiss sudden enthusiasm let me make sure i understand youre talking about me focusing on my innocence and broadcasting it to the jury you heard randolph hes had a lot of experience with juries and hes convinced they have special senses about peoples mindset i say you try to connect with them god knows it cant hurt craig exhaled forcibly he was hardly confident but didnt have the energy to fight alexiss zeal okay he said ill try it good and another thing try to tap into your physicians ability to compartmentalize ive seen you do it time and time again in your practice while youre thinking about how grand a doctor you are and how you gave your professional best with patience stanhope dont think of anything else be focused craig merely nodded and broke off eye contact with alexis youre not convinced are you craig shook his head he gazed up at the boxy postmodern boston city hall building that dominated the esplanade like a crusader castle its brooding distressed bulkiness seemed to him like a metaphor for the bureaucratic morass that ensnared him it took effort to pull his eyes away and look back at his wife the worst thing about this mess is that i feel so helpless im totally dependent on my assigned insurance company attorney every other hurdle in my life called for more effort on my part and it was always the additional effort that saved the day now it seems like the more effort i make the deeper i sink concentrating on your innocence like im suggesting takes effort compartmentalizing takes effort also alexis thought it ironic that what craig was voicing was exactly how people in general felt about illness and their dependency on doctors craig nodded i dont mind making an effort i said ill try to connect with the jury i just wish there was something else something more tangible well there is one other thing that passed through my mind oh what ive thought about calling my brother jack and seeing if he would come up from new york and help oh that would be helpful craig said sarcastically he wont come you guys havent been close over the years and besides he never liked me jack has had understandable difficulty with us being blessed with three wonderful daughters when he tragically lost both of his its painful for him maybe but it doesnt explain his dislike of me why do you say that did he ever say he didnt like you craig looked at alexis for a beat hed cornered himself and couldnt think of a way out jack stapleton had never said anything specific it was just a feeling craig had had im sorry you think jack doesnt like you the reality is he admires you and he told me so specifically really craig was taken aback convinced that jacks assessment was the opposite yes jack did say you were the kind of student in medical school and residency that he avoided you are one of those people who read all the suggested reading somehow knew all the trivial facts and could quote at length from the latest issue of the new england journal of medicine he admitted that awe did breed a certain contempt but it was actually inwardly directed meaning he wished he could have dedicated himself as much as you did thats very flattering it really is i had no idea but i wonder if he feels the same after my midlife crisis and even if he were to come what possible help could he provide in fact crying on his shoulder might make me feel worse than i do now if thats possible in jacks second career as a medical examiner hes had a lot of courtroom experience he travels all over as an expert witness for the new york me s office hes told me he enjoys it he strikes me as very inventive although on the negative side an inveterate risktaker as despondent as you are about how things are going maybe his impromptu inventiveness could be helpful i truly cant see how i cant either and i suppose thats why i hadnt suggested it before well hes your brother ill leave that decision up to you ill think about it alexis said then she checked her watch we dont have a lot of time are you sure you dont want to grab something to eat you know now that ive gotten out of that courtroom my stomach has been growling i could use a quick sandwich after they stood up craig enveloped his wife in a sustained hug he truly appreciated her support and felt even more embarrassed about his behavior prior to his legal problems she was right about his ability to compartmentalize hed totally separated his professional life and his family life and put far too much emphasis on the professional he prayed hed have a chance to balance the two boston massachusetts monday june pm all rise the court officer called judge marvin davidson whisked out of his chambers with a swirl of black robes at the exact moment the second hand of the wallmounted institutional clock swept past the number twelve the sun had moved in its diurnal trajectory and some of the shades over the storytall windows above the sixfoothigh oak paneling had been raised a bit of cityscape could be seen as well as a tiny patch of blue sky be seated the court officer called out after the judge had done so i trust you all had a refreshing bite to eat the judge said to the jury most jurors nodded and as i instructed i trust no one talked about the case in any capacity all the jurors shook their heads in agreement good now you will hear the opening statement by the defense mr bingham randolph took his time standing up walking to the podium and placing his notes on the angled surface he then adjusted his dark blue suit jacket and the cuffs of his white shirt he stood ramrodstraight using every inch of his sixfootplus height while his longfingered hands gently enveloped the lecterns sides every single silver hair on his scalp knew its assigned place and had been snipped to a predetermined length his necktie with its sprinkling of harvard veritas shields set in a crimson field was tied to perfection he was the picture of inbred refined elegance and stood out in the middle of the shabby courtroom like a prince in a brothel from craigs perspective he couldnt help but be impressed and for a few moments hed gone back to thinking that the contrast with tony fasano might be favorable randolph was the father figure the president the diplomat who wouldnt want to trust him but then craigs eyes moved to the jury and went from the muscular fireman to the plumbers assistant and on to the inconvenienced businessmen every face reflected a reflex ennui that was the opposite of their reaction to tony fasano and even before randolph opened his mouth craigs brief flash of optimism disappeared like a drop of water on a sizzling fry pan yet this rapid flipflop realization wasnt all bad it gave validation to alexiss advice about mindset so craig closed his eyes and conjured up the image of patience stanhope in her bed when he and leona charged into the womans bedroom he thought about how shocked hed been by her cyanosis how quickly hed reacted and everything hed done from that moment until it was apparent she was not going to be resuscitated over the course of the last eight months hed gone over the sequence numerous times and although on a few other cases over the years he could secondguess himself and believe he should have done something slightly different with patience stanhope hed done everything absolutely by the book he was confident that if he were confronted with the same situation that very day he would not do anything differently there had been no negligence of that he was absolutely certain ladies and gentlemen of the jury randolph said slowly and precisely you have heard a unique opening statement from someone who admits he has had no experience in trying medical malpractice cases it was a tour de force with clever initial selfdeprecations which made you smile i didnt smile because i saw the ploy for what it was i will not debase you with such oratory tricks i will merely speak the truth which im certain you will come to understand when you hear the testimony that the defense will present in contrast to the opposing attorney i have had more than thirty years defending our good doctors and hospitals and in all the trials i have participated in i have never heard an opening statement quite like mr fasanos which in many ways was an unfair character assassination of my client dr craig bowman objection tony shouted leaping to his feet argumentative and inflammatory your honor randolph interjected with annoyance he made a small dismissive gesture with one hand toward tony as if shooing away gnats may i approach the bench by all means judge davidson snapped in return he waved for the attorneys to come to the sidebar randolph strode up to the side of the judges bench with tony fast on his heels your honor mr fasano was allowed wide discretion in his opening statement i expect the same courtesy i only described what i intend to substantiate with witnesses which is what an opening statement is supposed to prove and you mr bingham objected about every ten seconds interrupting my train of thought good god judge davidson complained this isnt a murderone trial the judge said its a medical malpractice trial were not even through the opening statements and youre at each others throats at this rate well be here for months he allowed what he said to sink in for a beat let this be a warning to you both i want to move things along hear me each of you are experienced enough to know what is appropriate and what the other will tolerate so rein yourselves in and stick to the facts now to the objection at hand mr bingham whats good for the goose is good for the gander you did object to mr fasano being inflammatory he has every right to object to you doing the same mr fasano it is true you were given wide discretion and god help you and your client if your testimony doesnt support your allegations mr bingham will be allowed the same discretion do i make myself clear both attorneys dutifully nodded fine lets continue randolph returned to the podium fasano sat back down at the plaintiffs table objection sustained judge davidson said for the court reporters benefit continue ladies and gentlemen of the jury randolph said motivation is not usually part of medical malpractice proceedings what is normally at issue is whether the standard of care has been met such that the doctor possessed and used that degree of learning and skill in treating the patients condition that a reasonably competent doctor would employ in the same circumstance you will note that in his opening statement mr fasano said nothing about his experts suggesting that dr bowman did not use his learning and skill appropriately instead mr fasano must bring in the concept of motivation to get his allegation of negligence to be substantive and the reason for this as our experts will testify is that from the instant dr bowman knew the gravity of patience stanhopes condition he acted with commendable speed and skill and did everything possible to save the patients life alexis found herself nodding in agreement as she listened to randolph she liked what she was hearing and thought he was doing a good job her eyes switched to craig he was at least sitting up straight she wished she could see his face from where she was sitting but it was impossible her eyes then went to the jury and her evaluation of randolph s performance began to erode there was something about the jurors posture that was different from when tony fasano was speaking they seemed too relaxed as if randolph wasnt sufficiently engaging their attention then as if to confirm her fears the plumbing assistant gave a long sustained yawn which spread through most of the others the burden of proof lies with the plaintiff randolph continued it is the defenses job to rebut the plaintiffs allegation and the testimony of the plaintiffs witnesses since mr fasano had indicated that motivation is his key stratagem we the defense must adjust accordingly and present with our witnesses an affirmation of dr bowmans commitment and sacrifice throughout his entire life beginning with a doctor kit given to him at age four to be the best doctor and to practice the best medicine objection tony said dr bowmans commitment and sacrifice during his training has no bearing on the particular case at hand mr bingham judge davidson asked will your witnesses testimony relate dr bowmans commitment and sacrifice to patience stanhope absolutely your honor objection overruled judge davidson said proceed but before i outline how we plan to present our case id like to say a word about dr bowmans practice mr fasano described it as concierge medicine and suggested the term had a pejorative connotation alexis glanced back at the jury she was concerned about randolph s syntax and wondered how many of the jurors could relate to the words connotation and pejorative and of those who could how many would think they were pretentious what she saw was not encouraging the jury looked like wax figures however randolph said raising one of his long manicured fingers into the air as though he was lecturing a group of naughty children the meaning of the word concierge in its usual sense is help or service with no negative connotation whatsoever and indeed that is the reason it has been associated with retainer medicine which requires a small upfront fee you will hear testimony from a number of physicians that the rationale for such a practice format is to spend more time with the patient during appointments and during referrals so the patient enjoys the kind of medicine all of us laypeople would like to experience you will hear testimony that the kind of medicine practiced in a concierge practice is the kind of medicine all doctors learn during medical school you will also hear that its origins have come from the economic bind in traditionalpractice settings that forces physicians to crowd more and more patients in a given hour to keep revenues above costs let me give you some examples it was reflex rather than conscious thought that propelled alexis to a standing position in reaction to randolph s foray into dull medical economics excusing herself she moved laterally along the churchlike pew toward the central aisle her eyes briefly met those of the man who was dressed identically to tony fasano he was sitting in the aisle seat directly across as alexis exited her row his expression and unblinking stare unnerved her but then immediately dropped out of her consciousness she headed to the door to the hall and opened it trying to be as quiet as possible unfortunately the heavy door made a click heard all around the courtroom momentarily mortified she stepped out into the hall and then walked out into the large elevator lobby sitting on a leathercovered bench she rummaged in her shoulder bag for her cell phone and turned it on realizing she had poor reception she took the elevator down to the ground floor and walked back out into the sunlight after being indoors she had to squint to avoid the smog of cigarette smoke from the nicotine addicts sprinkled around the courthouse entrance she walked a distance until she was by herself leaning on a railing with her bag over her shoulder and tucked safely under her arm she scrolled through her phones electronic address book until she came to her older brothers entries since it was after two in the afternoon she used his work number at the chief medical examiners office in new york city as the call went through alexis tried to remember exactly when the last occasion had been that shed called and talked with jack she couldnt remember but knew it had to have been months maybe as much as half a year ago as much as shed been consumed by her familys disarray yet even prior to that thered been only intermittent haphazard contact which was unfortunate because she and jack had been extremely close as children life had not been easy for jack specifically fifteen years previously when his wife and two daughters aged ten and eleven had been killed in a commuter plane crash they had been on their way home to champaign illinois after having visited jack in chicago where he was retraining in forensic pathology when jack moved east to new york city ten years previously alexis had been hopeful they would see a lot of each other but it hadnt happened because of what shed said to craig earlier jack was still struggling to get over his tragedy and alexiss children were a painful reminder alexiss oldest daughter tracy had been born one month after jacks tragic loss this better be important soldano jack said without so much as a hello after answering the phone im not getting anything done jack its alexis alexis sorry i thought it was my nypd detective friend hes just called me several times on his cell from his car but keeps getting cut off is it a call you need to take i can call you back no i can talk to him later i know what he wants which we dont have yet we have him well trained so hes enamored with the power of forensics but he wants results overnight whats up its good to hear from you i never expected it would be you at this hour im sorry im calling while youre at work is this a good time to chat apart from your detective friend trying to get ahold of you well to be honest i do have a waiting room full of patients but i suppose they can wait since theyre all dead alexis giggled jacks new humorously sarcastic persona which shed experienced only a few times was a marked change from his prior self hed always had a sense of humor but in the past it was more subtle and frankly rather dry is everything okay up there in beantown its not like you to call during the day where are you at work at the hospital actually im not you know im embarrassed to say i cant remember the last time we spoke it was about eight months ago you called me to tell me craig had come back home as i recall i wasnt all that optimistic about things working out and said so craig has always struck me as not much of a family man i remember saying he was someone who made a great physician but not much of a father or husband im sorry if that hurt your feelings your comments surprised me but you didnt hurt my feelings when i didnt hear back from you i thought i had you could have called me if youd thought as much alexis thought but did not say instead she said since you asked things are not so good up here in beantown im sorry to hear that i hope my prophecy hasnt come to pass no craig is still at home i dont think i mentioned last time we talked that craig has been sued for malpractice no you didnt mention that tidbit was this after hed come back or before its been a difficult time for all of us alexis said ignoring jacks question i can imagine whats hard to imagine is him getting sued with as much of himself as he directs toward his patients then again in the current medicallegal malpractice environment everybody is at risk the trial has just started today well wish him good luck knowing his need to be number one in the class i imagine hes taken what amounts to public censure pretty hard thats an understatement being sued for malpractice is difficult for all doctors but for craig it is especially tough in terms of his selfesteem he put all his eggs in one basket the last eight months have been pure hell for him how has it been for you and the girls its not been easy but we have been managing except perhaps for tracy age fifteen can be a tough time and this added stress has made it worse she cant quite come to grips with forgiving craig for walking out on us when he did and carrying on with one of his secretaries her image of men has taken a beating meghan and christina have taken it more or less in stride as you know craig never had the time to involve himself too much in their lives are things okay between you and craig are things back to normal our relationship has been in a holding pattern with him sleeping in the guest room until this malpractice mess has been resolved im enough of a realist to know his plate is pretty full at the moment its brimming in fact which is why im calling there was a pause alexis took a breath if you need some money its not a problem jack offered no money is not an issue the problem is that there is a good chance craig will lose the case and with the public censure as you called it i think there is a good chance hell fall apart meaning in the vernacular a nervous breakdown and if that happens i really dont see reconciliation happening i think it would be a tragedy for craig for me and for the girls so you still love him thats a difficult question put it this way hes the father of my daughters i know he hasnt been the best father socially not the best husband in a traditional storybook sense but hes been a wonderful provider hes always acted in a caring way i fervently believe he loves us as much as he can hes a doctors doctor medicine is his mistress in a real way craig is a victim of a system that pushed him to excel and to compete from the moment he decided to become a doctor theres always been another test and another challenge hes insatiable for professional approbation traditional social successes dont have the same import for him i knew this was the case when i met him and i knew it when i married him did you think he was going to change not really i have to say i admired him for his dedication and sacrifice and i still do maybe that says something about me but thats beside the point at the moment im not going to argue with you about any of this ive pretty much felt the same about craigs personality having gone through the same training system and felt the same pressure myself i just couldnt have put it into words as well as you have but thats probably because as a psychologist this is your area of expertise it is personality disorders have been my bread and butter i knew before craig and i married that he had a lot of narcissistic traits now it might even have risen to be a disorder since its made aspects of his life dysfunctional the trouble is ive been unable to convince him to see someone professionally which isnt surprising since narcissistic people in general have trouble admitting any deficiencies nor do they like to ask for help since they see dependency as a sign of weakness jack said ive been down that road myself most physicians have a least a touch of narcissism well craig has a lot more than a touch which is why hes finding this current problem so overwhelming im sorry to hear all this alexis but those dead patients of mine are starting to get restive i dont want them to walk out without having been seen could i call you back this evening im sorry to be blabbing alexis said quickly but i have a favor to ask a rather big favor oh jack said would you be willing to fly up here and see if you could help jack gave a short laugh help how could i help youve mentioned in the past how often you testify at trials with all that experience in the courtroom you could help us the insurance company lawyer assigned to represent craig is experienced and seems competent but hes not relating to the jurors craig and i have talked about asking for another lawyer but have no way of judging if that would be wise or not the bottom line is that we are desperate and pessimistic the vast majority of my courtroom appearances have been in criminal proceedings not civil i dont think that matters in the one malpractice case i was involved in i was on the side of the plaintiff i dont think that matters either you are inventive jack you think outside the box we need a small miracle here thats what my intuition is telling me alexis i dont see how i could possibly help im not a lawyer im not good around lawyers i dont even like lawyers jack when we were younger you always helped me youre still my big brother i need you now as i said im desperate even if it turns out to be more psychological support than actual i would be so thankful if youd come jack i havent pushed you to come to visit us since youve been here on the east coast i know it was hard for you i know you have some avoidant traits and that seeing our daughters and me too reminded you of your terrible loss was it that obvious it was the only explanation and id seen some evidence of that kind of behavior back when we were kids it was always easier for you to avoid an emotional situation than confront it anyway ive respected that but now im asking you to put it aside and come up here for me for my daughters and for craig how long is the trial supposed to take most of the week is the general consensus the last time we talked there was something new in my life i didnt tell you im getting married jack thats wonderful news why didnt you mention it it didnt seem right after you told me the latest about your marriage situation it wouldnt have mattered do i know her you met her the one and only time you visited me here at work laurie montgomery were colleagues shes also a medical examiner alexis felt a shiver of distaste descend her spine shed never visited a morgue before visiting jacks place of work even though hed emphasized that the building was a medical examiners office and that the morgue was merely a small part of a larger whole she hadnt found the distinction convincing to her it was a place of death plain and simple and the building looked and smelled as such im pleased for you she said while she vaguely wondered what her brother and his potential wife might talk about over a routine breakfast what makes me particularly happy for you is that youve managed to process your grief about marilyn and your girls and move on i think thats terrific i dont think one ever gets completely over such grief but thank you when is the wedding this friday afternoon oh my goodness im sorry to be asking for a favor at such a critical time its not your fault thats for certain but it does complicate things yet it doesnt preclude it either im not the one making all the plans for the wedding my job was the honeymoon and thats all been arranged does that mean youll come ill come unless you hear back from me in the next hour or so but id better come sooner rather than later so i can get back here otherwise laurie might start thinking im trying to get out of it id be happy to speak with her to explain the situation no need heres the plan ill come up on the shuttle late this afternoon or early evening after work obviously i have to talk with laurie and the deputy director as well as clean up a few things here in my office after i check into a hotel ill call your house what ill need is a complete case file all the depositions description or copies of any evidence and if you can any testimony youre not staying at a hotel alexis said with resolve absolutely not you have to stay at the house we have plenty of room i need to talk with you in person and it would be best for the girls please jack there was a pause are you still there alexis questioned yeah im still here since you are making the effort to come up i want you at the house i really do it will be good for everyone although that might be selfish rationalization meaning i know it will be good for me all right jack said with a touch of reluctance in his voice theres not been any testimony at the trial as of yet the defense is giving its opening statement as we speak the trial is very much still at the beginning the more material you can give me about the case the greater the chance i might be able to come up with some suggestion ill see what i can do about getting the opening statement of the plaintiff well then i guess ill see you later thanks jack its starting to seem like old times knowing that youre coming alexis ended the call and slipped her phone back into her bag when all was said and done even if jack didnt actually help she was glad he was coming he would provide the kind of emotional support only a family member could offer she headed back through security and took the elevator to the third floor as she entered the courtroom and allowed the heavy door to close as quietly as possible behind her she could hear that randolph was still describing the deleterious effect currentday medical economics was having on the practice of medicine choosing to sit as close as possible to the jury she could see by their glazed eyes that they were no more engaged than when she had left alexis was even more pleased that jack was coming it gave her the sense that she was doing something new york new york monday june pm for a few minutes after hanging up with his sister jack sat at his desk and drummed his fingers on its metallic surface he hadnt been completely upfront with her her assessment of why hed avoided visiting her had been on the money which he hadnt really acknowledged worse yet he hadnt admitted it was still the case in fact it might even be worse now since meghan and christina alexiss two youngest were currently about the same ages as his late daughters tamara and lydia yet he was caught in an emotional bind considering how close he and alexis had been back in indiana he was five years her senior and the age difference was just enough for his role to be somewhat parental yet close enough to also be solidly brotherly that circumstance plus guilt from having avoided alexis for the entire ten years hed been in new york made it impossible not to respond to her pleas in her hour of need unfortunately it wasnt going to be easy he stood up and for a brief moment debated whom he should talk to first his first inclination was laurie although he was hardly excited about the prospect since she was clearly uptight about the wedding plans her mother was driving her crazy and she was in turn driving jack crazy consequently he thought perhaps speaking first to calvin washington the deputy chief made more sense calvin was the one who would have to give jack permission to take time off from the ocme for even a briefer moment the hope that calvin would say no to additional leave passed through his mind since both jack and laurie were already scheduled for two weeks vacation starting friday being denied leave to go to boston would certainly solve his issues of guilt toward alexis and reluctance to confront alexiss daughters and the need to bring up the idea with laurie yet such a convenient excuse was not going to come to pass calvin wouldnt say no a family emergency was never turned down but before hed even logged off his computer rationality prevailed intuitively he knew he should at least try to talk with laurie first since if he didnt and she found out that he hadnt tried thered be hell to pay as close as it was to the wedding date with that idea in mind he walked down the hall toward lauries office there was another reason jack was not excited about the proposed trip to boston and that was because craig bowman was far from his favorite person jack had tolerated him for alexiss benefit but it had never been easy from day one when jack had just met the man hed recognized the type thered been several similar personalities in jacks medical school all of whom had been at the very top of his class they were the type of individuals who made it a point to smother anyone with an avalanche of journal article citations supposedly confirming their viewpoint whenever they got into a medical discussion if that had been the only problem jack could have lived with it but unfortunately craigs opinionated ways were also sprinkled with an irritating degree of arrogance grandiosity and entitlement but even that jack could have found bearable if hed been able to occasionally steer the conversation with craig away from medicine but he never could craig was interested only in medicine science and his patients he wasnt interested in politics or culture or even sports he didnt have time as jack closed in on lauries office door he audibly harrumphed when his mind recalled alexis suggesting he had avoidant traits in his personality the nerve he thought for a moment and then smiled at his reaction with a flash of clairvoyance he knew she was right and that laurie would wholeheartedly agree in many ways such a reaction was evidence of his narcissism which he had admitted to alexis jack poked his head into lauries office but her desk chair was empty riva mehta lauries darkly complected silkyvoiced officemate was at her desk and on the phone she glanced up at at jack with her onyx eyes jack pantomimed by pointing toward lauries chair while raising his eyebrows questioningly riva responded by pointing downward and mouthing in the pit without taking the telephone receiver from her ear with a nod of understanding that laurie was down in the autopsy room undoubtedly doing a late case jack reversed course and headed for the elevators now if laurie found out hed gone to calvin first hed have an explanation as per usual he found dr calvin washington in his office next to the chiefs in contrast with the chiefs it was tiny and practically filled with metal filing cabinets his desk and a couple of straightbacked chairs there was barely room for calvins twohundredfiftypound frame to squeeze past his desk and lower itself into his desk chair it was calvins job to run the medical examiners office on a daily basis which was not an easy job considering there were more than a dozen medical examiners and over twenty thousand cases per year resulting in almost ten thousand autopsies on a daily basis there were on average two homicides and two drug overdoses the ocme was a busy place and calvin oversaw all the pesky details whats the problem now calvin demanded in his basso profundo voice in the beginning jack had been relatively intimidated by the mans muscular bulk and stormy temperament as the years passed the two had grown to have a wary respect for each other jack knew calvins bark was worse than his bite jack didnt go into details he merely said he had a family emergency in boston that required his presence calvin regarded jack through his wirerimmed progressive lenses i didnt know you had family in boston i thought you were from somewhere out there in the midwest its a sister jack said simply will you be back in time for your vacation calvin asked jack smiled he knew calvin well enough to know that he was making a stab at humor ill try my darnedest how many days are we looking at cant say for certain but im hoping just one well keep me informed calvin said does laurie know about this sudden development over the years jack had come to realize that calvin had assumed an almost parental attachment to laurie not yet but shes at the top of my list actually shes the only one on my list all right get outta here ive got work to do after thanking the deputy chief who acknowledged him with a wave of dismissal jack walked out of the admin area and took the stairs down to the autopsy floor he waved hello to the mortuary tech in the mortuary office and to the head of security in the security office a waft of what new york city residents call fresh air came in from the open loading dock looking out to th street turning to the right he walked down the stained bare concrete flooring past the big walkin cooler and past the individual refrigerated compartments reaching the autopsy room he glanced inside through the wiremesh window there were two figures in full protective gear in the process of cleaning up a single body with a sutured autopsy incision was on the nearest table it was obvious the case was over jack cracked the door and called out to ask if anyone knew the whereabouts of dr montgomery one of the occupants said shed left five minutes ago cursing under his breath jack retraced his steps and took the elevator back up to the fifth floor as he rode he wondered if there was any way to present the situation that would be easier for laurie his intuition told him she wasnt going to be happy with this new development with as much pressure as her mother was putting on her about fridays proceedings he found her in her office arranging things on her desktop it was apparent shed just arrived riva was still on the phone and ignored them both what a nice surprise laurie said brightly i hope so jack said he leaned his butt against the edge of lauries desk and looked down at her there was no other chair not only did the medical examiners have to share offices in the outdated ocme facility but the offices were small to begin with two desks and two file cabinets filled the room lauries questioning bluegreen eyes stared back at jack without blinking her hair was piled on top of her head and held in place with a fauxtortoiseshell clip a few wisps of hair curled down in front of her face what do you mean i hope so what in heavens name are you going to tell me she was wary i just had a call from my sister alexis thats nice is she all right ive wondered why you two dont stay more in touch especially since she and her husband have been having their difficulties are they still together shes fine and yes they are together the call was about him hes going through a difficult time hes being tried for malpractice thats too bad especially since you said he was such a good doctor i hate to hear that kind of story with what we medical examiners know of the doctors who ought to be sued the bad doctors are much more riskmanagementoriented to make up for what they lack in skill and knowhow what gives jack i know you didnt come in here to discuss the malpractice crisis im sure of that apparently my brotherinlaws case is not going well at least according to alexis and with the extent of his ego investment in being a doctor she believes hell decompensate if he loses furthermore she believes that if that happens the marriage and family will fall apart if alexis didnt have a phd in psychology i might not give all this much credence but since she does i have to assume its on the money laurie cocked her head a few degrees to the side to view jack from a slightly different angle youre obviously leading up to something which i have a feeling im going to find upsetting alexis has pleaded with me to rush up to boston and try to help what on earth could you do probably just hold her hand i was as skeptical as you are and said so but she practically begged me to come to be honest she tapped into my mother lode of guilt oh jack laurie murmured plaintively she took a deep breath and let it out how long will you be away im hoping only a day thats what i told calvin then jack quickly added i came here to your office first to talk to you then stopped in calvins office on the way down to the pit when i found out thats where you were laurie nodded she glanced down at her desktop and played with an errant paper clip it was obvious she was torn between jacks sisters need and her own i dont have to remind you this is monday afternoon and our wedding is set for one thirty on friday i know but you and your mom are doing all the work the honeymoon was my job and its all arranged what about warren as far as i know in his words hes cool but ill check jack had had trouble deciding who was going to be the best man warren or lou ultimately it had come to drawing straws and warren had won other than warren and lou the only people jack had invited to the affair were his office mate dr chet mcgovern and a smattering of his neighborhood basketball buddies hed specifically avoided inviting family for a multitude of reasons and you im ready should i be worried about you going up to boston and confronting your sisters daughters youve told me in the past that was a problem for you how old are they now fifteen eleven and ten werent your two daughters eleven and ten they were from what youve shared with me over the years about how your mind works im worried that you might be set back from having to relate to them where are you staying at the house alexis insisted i dont care if she insisted are you comfortable staying there if youre not listen to yourself and stay in a hotel i dont want you to be set back over this and possibly decide not to go through with the wedding theres a chance your going up there could open old wounds you know me too well ive thought about everything youve said my sense is that giving serious thought to the risk rather than ignoring it is a healthy sign alexis accused me of harboring avoidant traits in my personality as if i wasnt aware of that considering how long its taken you to feel comfortable marrying me lets not get nasty jack said with a smile he waited to be sure she understood he was joking because what she had said was true for a number of years jacks guilt and grief made him feel it was inappropriate for him to be happy hed even felt it should have been he who died not marilyn and the girls it would be small of me to try to talk you out of going laurie continued in a serious voice but i wouldnt be honest if i didnt tell you im not happy about it both from a selfish point of view and for what it could do to your mindset were getting married on friday dont call me from boston and suggest that it be postponed if you do it would be a cancellation not a postponement i hope you dont take that as an unreasonable threat after all this time its how i feel with that said do what you have to do thank you i understand how you feel and for good reason its been a slow road to normalcy for me in a lot of respects when exactly are you going jack glanced at his watch it was close to four pm right now i guess ill cycle back to the apartment grab a few things then head out to the airport currently he and laurie were living on the first floor of jacks old building on th street they had moved down from the fourth floor because the building was under renovation jack and laurie had bought it seven months previously and had made the mistake of trying to live in it while the work was being done will you call me tonight when you get settled absolutely laurie stood up and they hugged jack didnt waste time after cleaning up a few odds and ends on his desk he descended to the basement floor and got his mountain bike from where he stored it with his helmet and bicycle gloves on and a clip on his right trouser leg he peddled up th street and then headed north on first avenue as usual once he was on the bike jacks problems faded the exercise and the attendant exhilaration took him to another world especially during his diagonal transit of central park like a verdant jewel plopped in the middle of the concrete city the park afforded a transcendent experience by the time he popped back out onto central park west at th street the tension that his conversation with laurie had caused was gone it had been worked out of his system by the otherworldliness of the parks flowerfilled interior just opposite his building jack pulled up at the edge of the neighborhood playground warren and flash were on the basketball court shooting baskets in anticipation of one of the neighborhoods fast furious and highly competitive evening games jack opened the gate in the high chainlink fence and wheeled his bicycle into the playground hey man warren called out youve come early you running tonight or what if you are get your ass out here cause its going to be a party tonight warren s impressively muscled youthful body was completely hidden beneath his oversized hiphop outfit flash was older with a full beard that was beginning to gray prematurely his biggest asset other than his jump shot was his mouth he could argue any point and get most people to agree together they made an almost undefeatable team after brief hugs and ritualized handshakes jack told warren he couldnt play because he had to go to boston for a couple of nights beantown warren remarked theres a brother up there whos cool and plays hoops i could give him a buzz and let him know youre in the neighborhood that would be terrific jack said hed not thought about taking his gear but a bit of exercise might be just what the doctor ordered if things got emotionally dicey ill give him your cell and leave his on your voicemail fine jack said listen is everything okay with your tux for friday not a problem were picking it up thursday great jack said maybe ill see you guys wednesday night i could use a run or two before the big day well be here doc warren said he snapped the ball from a startled flash and drilled a long threepointer boston massachusetts monday june pm jack deplaned from the six thirty delta shuttle and allowed the clutch of people to carry him along he assumed they knew where they were going in short order he found himself curbside of the delta terminal and within five minutes the hertz rentacar bus pulled up jack boarded hed not been in boston for some time and thanks to the interminable construction of the airport he didnt recognize a thing as the bus wended its way among the various terminals he wondered what kind of welcome he was going to find when he arrived at the bowman homestead the only person he could count on being hospitable was alexis as far as the others he had no idea of what to expect particularly craig and even alexis hed not seen in person for more than a year which was going to make it somewhat awkward the last time hed seen her had been in new york city where shed come solo to attend a professional psychology meeting jack sighed he didnt want to be there in boston especially since he knew his chances of accomplishing anything were minimal other than to pat his sister on the back and commiserate with her and also since his going had upset laurie he was confident laurie would get over it but she had already been under stress from her mother for the previous few weeks the irony was that she was supposed to enjoy the wedding ceremony as well as the leadup to it instead it had become more of a burden jack had had to bite his tongue on several occasions when hed been tempted to tell her she should have assumed as much if it had been up to jack they would have scheduled a small private affair with just a few friends from his cynical perspective the reality of major social events never lived up to romantic expectation jack and his fellow passengers were eventually dropped off at the hertz facility and without too much stress he found himself behind the wheel of a creamcolored hyundai accent that reminded him of an oldfashioned minute maid juice can armed with a poor map and a few slapdash directions he bravely ventured forth and immediately got lost boston was not a city that was at all kind to a visiting driver nor were the boston drivers it was like a rally as jack struggled to find the suburban town where alexis lived on his rare previous visits hed always met his sister in town shaken but not downandout jack pulled into the bowman driveway at a quarter to nine it was still not completely dark thanks to the approaching summer solstice but the interior incandescent lights were on giving the home what jack assumed to be the falsely cozy appearance of the happy family the house was impressive like others in the immediate newton neighborhood it was a large twoandahalfstory structure made of brick and painted white with a series of dormers poking out of the roof also like the other homes there was an expansive lawn lots of shrubs towering trees and extensive flower beds below each window on the ground floor was a window box brimming with blossoms next to jacks hyundai was a lexus inside the garage jack knew from one of alexiss earlier conversations there was the de rigueur station wagon no one came flying out of the house waving a banner of welcome jack turned off the engine and for a moment entertained the idea of just turning around and leaving yet he couldnt do that so he reached into the backseat for his carryon bag and got out of the car outside there were the familiar noises of the crickets and other creatures save for those sounds the neighborhood seemed devoid of life at the front door jack peered in through the sidelights there was a small foyer with an umbrella stand beyond that was a hallway he could see a flight of stairs that rose up to the second floor still there were no people not a sound jack rang the bell which was actually chimes that he could hear distinctly through the door almost immediately a small androgynous figure appeared bounding down the stairs she was dressed in a simple tshirt and shorts and no shoes she was a lithe towhead with milky white blemishfree skin and delicateappearing arms and legs she threw open the door it was obvious she was strongwilled you must be uncle jack i am and you jack felt his heart quicken he could already see his late daughter tamara christina she declared then without taking her greenish eyes from jack she yelled over her shoulder mom uncle jack is here alexis appeared at the end of the hallway as she approached she exuded major domesticity she was wearing an apron and wiping her hands on a checkered dishtowel well ask him in christina although looking appropriately older alexis appeared pretty much the same as jack remembered her back in their childhood home in south bend indiana there was no doubt they were siblings they had the same sandcolored hair the same matching maplesyrup eyes the same defined features and the same complexion which suggested theyd been in the sun even when they hadnt neither was completely pale even in the dead of winter with a warm smile alexis walked directly up to jack and gave him a sustained hug thanks for coming she whispered in his ear while still embracing alexis jack saw the other two girls appear at the top of the stairs it was easy to tell them apart since tracy at age fifteen was more than a foot taller than meghan at eleven as if not sure what to do they came down the stairs slowly hesitating at each step as they neared it was easy for jack to see their personalities differed as much as their height tracy s skyblue eyes burned with a brazen intensity whereas meghans hazel eyes flitted about not willing to make eye contact jack swallowed meghans eye movement suggested she was shy and introverted just like jacks lydia come down here and say hello to your uncle alexis ordered goodnaturedly as the girls reached the floor level jack was surprised at tracy s height he was regarding her at nearly eye level she was a good three to four inches taller than her mother the other thing he saw was that she had two obvious piercings one was on her nostril topped with a small diamond the other was a silver ring tucked into her exposed navel her attire included a cropped sleeveless cotton top that stretched across precociously impressive breasts on her lower half she wore lowrise billowy harem pants the outfit and accessories gave her a saucy sensuality as brazen as her stare this is your uncle girls alexis said as a way of introduction how come youve never visited us tracy demanded right off she had both hands defiantly thrust into pants pockets did your daughters really die in a plane crash christina asked almost simultaneously girls alexis blurted drawing the word out as if it were five or six syllables long then she apologized to jack im sorry you know children you never know what they are going to say its all right unfortunately they are both reasonable questions then looking into tracy s eyes he said maybe over the next day or so we could talk ill try to explain why ive been a stranger then looking down to christina he added in answer to your question i did lose two lovely daughters in a plane tragedy now christina alexis said butting in since youre the only one whos finished her homework why dont you take uncle jack down to the basement guest room tracy and meghan you two head back upstairs and finish your work and jack i assume youve not eaten jack nodded hed wolfed down a sandwich at laguardia airport but that had long since disappeared into the lower reaches of his digestive tract although he hadnt expected to be he was hungry how about some pasta ive kept the marinara sauce hot and i can throw together a salad that would be fine the basement guest room was as expected it had two high windows that looked into bricklined window wells the air had a damp cool feeling like a root cellar on the plus side it was tastefully decorated in varying shades of green the furniture included a kingsize bed a desk a club chair with a reading lamp and a flatscreen tv there was also a bathroom en suite while jack pulled his clothes out of his carryon bag and hung what he could in the closet christina threw herself into the easy chair with her arms flat on the chairs arms and her feet sticking straight out into space she regarded jack critically youre skinnier than my dad is that good or bad jack questioned he put his basketball sneakers on the floor of the closet and carried his shaving kit into the bathroom he liked the fact that there was a generous shower stall rather than a generic bathtub how old were your daughters when they crashed in the plane although jack should have expected christina to return to the sensitive issue after his inadequate response such a direct personal question snapped him back to that disturbing sequence when hed said goodbye to his wife and daughters at the chicago airport it had been fifteen years ago almost to the day that hed driven his family to the airport to take a commuter flight back to champaign while a band of rogue thunderstorms and tornadoes were approaching through the vast midwestern plains hed been in chicago retraining in forensic pathology after a healthcare giant had gobbled up his ophthalmology practice back in the heyday of managed cares expansion jack had been trying to get marilyn to agree to move to chicago but she had rightfully refused for the childrens sake the passage of time had not numbed jacks memory of the last goodbye as if it had been yesterday he could see in his minds eye watching through the glass partition marilyn tamara and lydia descend the ramp behind the departure gate as they reached the maw of the jetway only marilyn turned to wave tamara and lydia with their youthful enthusiasm had just disappeared as jack was to learn later than night only fifteen or twenty minutes after takeoff the small prop plane had plowed fullspeed into the fertile black earth of the prairie it had been struck by lightning and caught in a profound wind shear all aboard had been killed in the blink of an eye are you okay uncle jack christina asked for several beats jack had been motionless as if caught in a freezeframe im fine jack said with palpable relief hed just relived the moment in his life that he strenuously avoided thinking about and yet the episode concluded without the usual visceral sequelae he didnt feel as if his stomach had flipflopped his heart had skipped a beat or as if a heavy smothering blanket had descended over him it was a sad story but he felt enough distance that it could have involved someone else perhaps alexis was right as shed said on the phone perhaps hed processed his grief and moved on how old were they the same as you and meghan thats awful it was jack agreed back up in the kitchengreat room alexis had jack sit at the family table while she finished boiling the pasta the girls had all retreated upstairs to get ready for bed it was a school night jacks eyes ranged around the room it was an expansive yet cozy room befitting the houses external appearance the walls were a light sunburst yellow a deep comfortable sofa upholstered in a bright green floral fabric and covered with cushions faced a fireplace surmounted by the largest flatscreen television craig had ever seen the curtains were the same print as the sofa and framed a bow window looking out on a terrace beyond the terrace was a swimming pool beyond that was lawn with what looked like a gazebo in the gloom its a beautiful house jack commented in his mind it was more than beautiful compared to how he had been living over the last ten years it was the epitome of luxury craig has been a wonderful provider as i said on the phone alexis said as she poured the pasta into a colander where is he jack questioned no one had mentioned his name jack assumed he was out perhaps on an emergency medical call or possibly conferring with his attorney hes asleep in the upstairs guest room alexis said as i implied were not sleeping together and havent been since he left to live in town i thought maybe he was out on a medical call no hes free of that for the week hes hired someone to cover his practice during the trial his attorney recommended it i think its a good thing as dedicated a doctor as he is i wouldnt want him for my doctor right now hes too preoccupied im impressed hes asleep if it were me id be up pacing the house hes had a little help alexis admitted she brought the pasta and salad over to the table and put it in front of jack it was a hard day with the opening of the trial and hes understandably depressed im afraid hes been selfprescribing sleeping pills to deal with insomnia theres also been some alcohol scotch to be exact but not enough to worry about i dont think at least not yet jack nodded but didnt say anything what would you like to drink im going to have a glass of wine a little wine would be nice jack said he knew more than he wanted to about depression after the plane crash hed fought it for years alexis brought over an opened bottle of white wine and two glasses did craig know i was coming jack asked it was a question he should have asked before hed agreed to come of course he knew alexis said while pouring the wine in fact i discussed the idea with him before i called you and he was okay with it he questioned the rationale but said hed leave the decision up to me to be truthful he wasnt excited about it when we discussed it and he said something that surprised me he said he thought you disliked him you never said anything like that did you absolutely not jack said as he began to eat he wondered how far to take the conversation the truth of the matter was that back when alexis and craig had gotten engaged he didnt think craig was appropriate for alexis but jack had never said anything mainly because he thought without knowing exactly why that doctors in general were a poor risk marriagewise it was only relatively recently that jacks tortured road to recovery had given him the insight to explain his earlier gut reaction namely that the whole medical training process either selected narcissistic people or created them or some combination of the two in jacks estimation craig was the poster boy in this regard his singleminded dedication to medicine almost guaranteed that his own personal relationships would be correspondingly shallow a kind of psychological zerosum game i told him you didnt feel that way alexis continued in fact i said you admired him because you told me that once am i remembering correctly i told you i admired him as a consummate physician jack said aware that he was being mildly evasive i did qualify it by saying you were envious of his accomplishments you did say something to that effect didnt you undoubtedly i have always been awed by his ability to do real publishable basic science research while handling a large successful clinical practice that is the romantic goal of a number of physicians who never even come close i made a stab at it back when i was an ophthalmologist but in retrospect my supposed research was a joke i cant imagine thats true knowing what i do about you getting back to the critical issue how does craig feel about me actually being here you really didnt answer that alexis took a sip of her wine it was apparent she was considering the answer and the longer she paused while doing so the more uneasy jack became after all he was a guest in the mans house i suppose my not answering it was deliberate she admitted hes embarrassed to be asking for help as you suggested he might be on the phone theres no doubt he sees dependency as a weakness and this whole affair had made him feel totally dependent but i have a feeling hes not the one asking for help jack said he finished his pasta and started in on his salad alexis put her wineglass down you are right she said reluctantly im the one whos asking for help on his behalf hes not all that happy about you being here because hes embarrassed but im ecstatic you are here alexis reached across the table and took jacks hand she squeezed it with unexpected ferocity thank you for caring jack ive missed you i know its not the best time for you to be away and that makes it even more special thank you thank you thank you a sudden flash of emotion washed over jack and he felt his face flush at the same time the avoidant nature of his personality kicked in and asserted itself he detached his hand from alexiss took a gulp of wine than changed the subject so tell me about the opening day of the trial alexiss slight smile turned up the corners of her mouth you are smooth just like the old days that was an impressively quick uturn from an emotionally charged arena did you think i might not notice i keep forgetting youre a psychologist jack said with a laugh it was an instinctual reaction for selfpreservation at least you admit to your emotional side anyway about this trial all thats happened so far are the two opening statements by the opposing attorneys and the testimony of the first witness who was the first witness jack finished the salad and picked up the wineglass craigs accountant as randolph bingham explained later the whole reason he was included was merely to establish that craig owed a duty to the deceased which was easy since the deceased had paid the retainer fee and craig had been seeing her on a regular basis what do you mean retainer fee jack asked with surprise craig switched from a traditional feeforservice practice to a concierge practice almost two years ago really jack questioned hed had no idea why i thought craigs practice was booming and he loved it ill tell you the main reason even if he wont alexis said moving herself in closer to the table as if she was about to reveal a secret over the last number of years craig has felt he has been progressively losing control of patient decisions im sure you know all this but with more and more involvement of insurance companies and various health plans with cost containment theres been more and more intrusion into the doctorpatient relationship essentially telling doctors what they can and cannot do for someone like craig it has been a progressive ongoing nightmare if i were to ask him why he made the change what reason would he give jack questioned he was fascinated hed heard of concierge medicine but he thought it was a small fringe group or a mere trendy quirk in the system hed never talked with a doctor who practiced in such a setting he wouldnt admit hed ever compromised a patient decision because of outside influence but hed be fooling himself just to keep his practice solvent he has had to see progressively more patients in any given day the reason he gives for switching to concierge medicine is that it affords him the opportunity to practice medicine the way he was taught in medical school where he could spend as much time as needed with each patient well its the same thing no theres a subtle difference although theres an aspect of rationalization on his part the difference is between a negative push and a positive pull his explanation emphasizes the patient is the style of his practice playing a role in the malpractice case yes at least according to the plaintiffs attorney who i have to say is performing better than anticipated how do you mean to look at him and youll see for yourself if you come to the courtroom youd not imagine on first glance hed be effective how should i say this hes a composite stereotype of the tawdry ambulancechasing personalinjury lawyer and the mafioso defense attorney about half craigs defense attorneys age but hes relating to the jury in a surprisingly effective manner how is craigs practice style supposed to play into the case did the plaintiffs attorney address it in his opening statement absolutely and very effectively the whole concept of concierge medicine is predicated on being able to satisfy patient needs like a concierge at a hotel i get the association to that end each patient has access to the doctor through cell phone andor email so that they can contact the doctor at all hours and be seen if necessary sounds like an invitation to abuse on the part of the patient i suppose with some patients but it didnt bother craig in fact he seemed to like it because he started making house calls at offhours i think to him there was something retro and nostalgic about it house calls jack questioned making house calls is usually a waste of time as a modernage doctor youre so limited in what you can do nonetheless some of the patients love it including the deceased craig had seen her often after hours in fact he had seen her at her home the morning of the very day the malpractice was supposed to have occurred that evening she took a turn for the worse and craig made a house call it seems to me it would be hard to find fault with that one would assume so but according to the plaintiffs attorney it was craigs making the house call rather than sending the patient to the hospital that caused the malpractice since it delayed the diagnosis and emergency treatment of a heart attack that seems absurd jack said indignantly not when you hear it coming from the plaintiffs attorney during his opening statement you see there are other circumstances surrounding the episode that are important it happened when craig and i were officially separated at the time he was living in an apartment in boston with one of his nubile secretarycumfile clerks named leona good god jack exclaimed i dont know how many stories ive heard of married physicians having affairs with their office help i dont know what it is about male medical doctors in this day and age most men in other endeavors know not to date their employees its asking for legal troubles my sense is you are being too generous to the middleaged married males who find themselves locked in a reality that didnt live up to their romantic expectations i think craig falls into such a group but it wasnt leonas twentythreeyearold body that was the initial lure it was ironically enough the change to the concierge practice which provided something hed never had free time free time can be a dangerous thing for someone whod spent half of his life as singleminded as craig it was like he woke up and looked at himself in the mirror and didnt like what he saw all of a sudden he had this manic interest in culture he wanted to make up for lost time and become overnight his image of a wellrounded person but it wasnt enough for him to do it alone like a hobby just as he did with medicine he wanted to indulge it with one hundred percent effort and he insisted i go along with it but obviously i couldnt not with my job and the responsibility of the girls thats what drove him out at least as far as i know leona came later as he realized he was lonely if youre trying to make me feel sorry for him its not going to work i just want you to know what were up against the plaintiffs attorney knows that craig and leona had tickets for the symphony on the night the plaintiffs wife died he says witnesses will prove that craig made the house call even though he suspected the patient had a heart attack on the outside chance it wasnt if he had found that to be the case he would have been able to make the concert symphony hall is closer to the plaintiffs house than newton memorial hospital let me guess this leona is scheduled to be a witness of course shes now the spurned lover to make matters worse she is still working in craigs office and he cant fire her for fear of another lawsuit so the plaintiffs attorney is contending that craig put the patient at risk by playing the odds against the possible diagnosis thats essentially it theyre saying that its not up to the standard of care in terms of making a timely diagnosis which for a heart attack is critical as events have shown they dont even have to prove that the woman would have survived had she been taken to the hospital immediately just that she might have of course the cruel irony is that the allegation is diametric to craigs practice style as weve said hes always put patients first even before his own family jack ran a hand through his hair in frustration this is more complicated than i thought it would be i assumed the question revolved around some specific medical issue this kind of case means there is even less chance of my being any help than i thought who knows alexis said fatalistically she pushed back from the table went over to the service desk and hefted a sizable manila envelope stuffed with papers she brought it back to the table and plopped it down it made a resounding thump heres a copy of the case i put together its pretty much everything from interrogatories to depositions to medical records the only thing thats not included is a transcript of todays proceeding but ive given you a good idea of what was said theres even a couple of craigs recent research papers he suggested i include i dont know why maybe to save face imagining youll be impressed i probably will be if i can understand them anyway it looks like i have my work cut out for me i dont know where you want to work you have a lot of choices can i show you a few alternatives besides your room downstairs alexis led jack on a tour of the first floor of the house the living room was huge but appeared uncomfortably pristine as if no one had ever stridden across its deep pile carpet jack nixed that off the living room was a mahoganypaneled library with a wet bar but it was dark and funereal with poor lighting no thanks down the hall was a media room with a ceilingmounted projector and several rows of lazyboy chairs inappropriate and worse lighting than the library at the end of the hall was a sizable study with matching hisandhers desks on opposing walls his desk was neat with each pencil in a pencil cup sharpened to a needlelike point her desk was the opposite with haphazard stacks of books journals and reprints there were several reading chairs and hassocks a bow window similar to the one in the great room looked out onto a flower bed with a small fountain directly opposite the window was floortoceiling shelving on either side of the entrance door among a mixture of medical and psychology texts was craigs oldfashioned leather doctors bag and a portable ecg machine as far as being a work area the best thing about the room was the lighting setup with recessed ceiling fixtures individual desk lamps and floor lamps by each club chair this is a terrific space jack said but are you sure you dont mind me in your personal study he switched on one of the floor lamps it cast a wide warm glow not in the slightest what about craig since its his space too he wouldnt mind one thing i can assure you about craig hes not territorial okay then heres where ill be i have a feeling it will take me quite a few hours he put the bulging manila envelope down on the table between the two reading chairs as the saying goes knock yourself out im off to bed with the need to get the kids off to school tomorrow comes early around here there are plenty of drinks in the kitchen refrigerator and more in the wet bar so help yourself terrific im all set alexis let her eyes wander down jacks frame then back to his face i have to tell you brother you look good when i visited you out in illinois and you had your ophthalmology practice you looked like a different person i was a different person i was afraid you were going to become overweight i was overweight now you look hale hungry and hollowcheeked like an actor in a spaghetti western jack laughed thats a creative description where did that come from the girls and i recently watched some old sergio leone movies it was an assignment for a film class tracys taking at her school seriously you look like youre in good shape whats your secret street basketball and bike riding i treat them like second careers maybe i should give them a try alexis said with a wry smile then she added good night brother see you in the morning as you might expect its always a bit chaotic with three girls craig watched alexis walk down the hall and then with a final wave disappear up the stairs he turned around and scanned the room again a sudden silence descended like a blanket the place looked and smelled so different from his own surroundings it could have been on a different planet somewhat selfconscious about being in someone elses space jack sat down in the easy chair illuminated by the floor lamp the first thing he did was take out his cell phone and turn it on there was a message and it was from warren with the promised name and phone number of his friend in boston the name was david thomas and jack called immediately thinking he might be in need of exercise if the morrow turned out to be as stressful as he feared alexiss evasiveness about craigs response to jacks visit was enough to make anyone feel less than welcome warren must have been full of praise about jack when he talked to david because david was overly enthusiastic about jack coming for a run this time of year we play every night starting about five oclock man david had said get your honky ass over there and well see what you got he gave jack directions to the court on memorial drive near harvard jack said hed try to get there in the late afternoon next jack called laurie to report that he was settled as best as could be expected so far what do you mean she asked warily i have yet to see craig bowman the story is hes not all that happy im here thats not very nice all things considered particularly the timing jack then described what he thought was the positive news about his response to alexiss daughters he told laurie that one of the girls had even brought up the crash right off the bat but that he had taken it in stride to his pleasant surprise im amazed and pleased laurie said i think its terrific and im relieved jack went on to say that the only bad news was that the malpractice didnt involve a technical medical issue but rather something far more convoluted such that there was even less chance that he could help them than hed thought i hope that means youll be on your way back here straight away laurie said im about to read the file jack said i imagine ill know more at that point good luck thanks ill need it jack ended the call and put his phone away for a moment he strained to hear any noise in the vast house it was as silent as a tomb picking up the manila envelope he dumped the contents onto the side table the first thing he picked up was a research paper craig had coauthored with a renowned harvard cell biologist and had published in the prestigious new englandjournal of medicine it was about the function of sodium channels in cell membranes responsible for nerve and muscular action potentials there were even some diagrams and electron micrographs of subcellular molecular structure he glanced at the materialsandmethods section it was amazing to him that someone could conceive of such arcane concepts much less study them seeing as it was all beyond his current comprehension he tossed the paper aside and picked up a deposition instead it was the deposition of leona rattner boston massachusetts tuesday june am the first thing jack was aware of was a distant verbal disagreement followed by the concussive force of a door slamming for a brief moment he tried to incorporate the sounds into his dream but it didnt make any sense instead he opened his eyes only to have not a clue where he was after checking out the fountain bathed in bright sunlight outside the bow window as well as the interior of the study it all came back to him in a flash in his hand was a deposition of a nurse named georgina okeefe from the newton memorial hospital which he had been in the process of rereading when hed fallen fast asleep gathering up all the papers from the stanhope vs bowman malpractice case jack slipped them into the manila envelope it took some doing to get them all in then he got to his feet a wave of momentary dizziness made him pause briefly he had no idea what time hed fallen asleep hed read through the entire collection of papers and had been in the process of going back over those parts he thought most interesting when his eyes closed involuntarily to his surprise hed been captivated by the material from the start if the story didnt indirectly involve his sister he would have thought it an entertaining script for a soap opera since the colorful characters personalities leapt off the pages there was the gifted and dedicated but arrogant and adulterous doctor the nubile spurned and angry lover the precise and rather laconic bereaved spouse the knowledgeable but contentious experts the parade of other witnesses and finally the apparently hypochondriacal victim it was a comedy of human foibles except for the unfortunate fatal outcome and the fact that it had ended up as a malpractice suit as far as the probable outcome of the suit was concerned at least from reading the material jack thought alexiss concern and pessimism were well founded with his grandiosity and arrogance which came out in the latter stages of his deposition craig did not help his cause the plaintiffs attorney had succeeded in making craig sound as if he believed it was an outrage that his clinical judgment was being questioned that wouldnt play well with any jury and on top of that craig had implied that it was his wifes fault hed had an affair with his secretary whenever jack was pressed to describe the goal of his job as a medical examiner his usual response depending to a degree on the inquirer and the occasion was to say he spoke for the dead as he read over stanhope vs bowman he found himself ultimately thinking mostly about the victim and the unfortunate but obvious circumstance that she could not be deposed or serve as a witness playing a game in his mind he considered how it would influence the case if she were able to participate and thinking along those lines made him believe that she was the key to a successful resolution of the case it seemed to him that if the jury believed she was the hypochondriac craig said she was theyd have to find for the defense despite her final symptoms being all too real and despite craigs narcissistic personality thinking in this vein emphasized the unfortunate reality that there had been no autopsy and accordingly there was no medical examiner on the defenses witness list to speak for the deceased with the manila envelope under his arm jack snuck down the hallway toward the basement stairs beneath the main staircase as scruffy as he was he preferred not to run into anybody as he started down the stairs he heard more yelling above by one of the girls and another door slam down in his quarters jack shaved showered and dressed as quickly as he could when he got back upstairs the entire bowman clan was in the great room the atmosphere was strained the three girls were at the table behind cereal boxes craig was on the sofa hidden behind the the new york times with a mug of coffee on the coffee table in front of him alexis was at the counter busily making sandwiches for the girls lunches the tv above the fireplace was tuned to the local news but the sound was barely on sun streamed in through the bow windows it was almost blinding good morning jack alexis said lightly when she noticed him standing in the doorway i hope you slept okay downstairs it was very comfortable jack said say good morning to your uncle alexis advised the girls but only christina did so i dont know why i cant wear the red top meghan whined because it belongs to christina and she says she prefers you dont alexis said did the plane burn with your daughters in it christina asked christina thats enough alexis said she rolled her eyes for jacks benefit theres fresh juice in the fridge and fresh coffee in the maker what do you usually have for breakfast just fruit and cereal we have both help yourself jack went over to the coffeemaker as his eyes began to search for a cup a mug came sliding down the granite countertop thanks to alexis he filled it with coffee and plopped in a spoonful of sugar and a dollop of cream as he stirred he again took in the room christina and alexis were now embroiled in a conversation about afterschool plans the two other girls seemed silent and sulky craig had not emerged from behind his newspaper which to jack seemed an obvious slight refusing to be cowed and believing a good offense was the best defense jack walked over to the mantel he was now looking directly at craigs newspaper which craig was holding up to its full extent like a barrier wall anything interesting in the news jack asked while taking a sip of his steaming coffee the top edge of the paper came down slowly progressively revealing craigs puffy slack face his eyes were like bullseyes with dark surrounding rings while his sclerae were webbed with minute red capillaries giving him the visage of a man whod been out on an allnight binge in contrast to his weary face he was dressed in a freshly pressed white shirt and conservative tie while his sandycolored hair was neatly brushed with a slight sheen suggesting a dab of gel im hardly in the mood for small talk craig said morosely nor am i jack responded at least we agree right out of the starting gate craig lets clear the air im here on my sisters behest im not here to help you im here to help her if i help you its fallout but let me tell you something i think it stinks that youve been sued for malpractice in my estimation from what i know of you professionally youre the last one who should be sued for malpractice now there are some other social areas in which you dont shine from my perspective but thats another story entirely as far as the case is concerned ive read the material and i have some thoughts you can hear them or not thats your call as far as my staying in your house thats also your call since i demand unanimity on the part of couples when im a guest i can easily move to a hotel except for the muted sounds of the local news and some twittering of birds outside the room went silent and still no one moved until craig noisily collapsed his papers folded them haphazardly and tossed them aside a moment later came the renewed clink of flatware against cereal bowls from the table from the sink came the sound of the faucet being turned on sound and action had returned i have no problem being upfront craig said his voice now sounded more tired and sad than morose when i heard you were coming i was irritated with everything thats going on i didnt think it was an appropriate time for company especially since youd never bothered previously to come for a visit frankly it irked me that you might harbor the mistaken illusion you were the cavalry riding in at the nick of time to save the party in peril having you tell me right off that thats not the case makes me feel differently youre welcome to stay but im sorry im not up to being much of a host as far as your thoughts about the case are concerned id like to hear them i dont expect you to be a host at all considering what you are going through jack said he sat on the corner of the coffee table diagonally across from craig the conversation was going better than hed anticipated he had in mind to further the cause by paying craig a compliment along with all the courtrelated material there were a couple of your most recent research papers i was impressed of course id be more impressed if i understood them my attorney has in mind to introduce them as evidence of the extent of my commitment to medicine the plaintiffs attorney according to his opening statement is going to try to prove the opposite certainly cant hurt i cant imagine how hes going to present them but im no lawyer if he does i have to give you credit craig you are amazing most every doctor i know thinks they would like to do a combination of clinical work and research its the ultimate ideal absorbed in medical school but youre one of the few that actually does it whats so surprising its real research and not those reports of an interesting case type papers that try to masquerade as research theres no doubt it is real research craig said perking up a tad as he warmed to the subject we are learning more and more about voltagegated sodium channels in nerve and muscle cells and it has immediate clinical application in your last paper in nejm you talked about two different sodium channels one for heart muscle and one for nerves how are they different they are structurally different which we are now determining at a molecular level how we knew they were different was because of their marked difference in their response to tetrodotoxin theres a thousandfold difference which is extraordinary tetrodotoxin jack questioned thats the toxin that kills people in japan who eat the wrong sushi craig laughed in spite of himself youre right its sushi made by an inexperienced sushi chef from puffer fish at a particular time of their reproductive cycle remarkable jack commented having accomplished getting craig to perk up he was eager to move on craigs research although interesting was far too esoteric for his liking jumping directly from one subject to another jack brought up his feelings about how the victim patience stanhope was the key element to win his malpractice case if your attorney can indisputably establish the fact in the jurors minds that this woman was the kind of hypochondriac she was the jury will have to find against the plaintiff for a few seconds craig merely stared back at jack it was as if the conversational transition had been so abrupt that his brain had to reboot itself well he said at length its interesting you say that because i already said as much to randolph bingham well there you go were thinking on the same plane which lends more credibility to the idea what did your attorney say not much as i recall i think you should bring it up again jack said and while were on the subject of the deceased i didnt see an autopsy report im assuming there was none am i correct unfortunately there wasnt an autopsy craig said the diagnosis was confirmed by the biomarker assay he shrugged no one expected a malpractice suit im sure if they had the medical examiners would have opted for a postmortem and i would have requested one there was one other small point in the record i thought was curious jack said an er nurse by the name of georgina okeefe who was the admitting nurse at newton memorial hospital she wrote in her notes that the patient had marked central cyanosis the reason it jumped out was because she didnt mention it in her deposition i went back and checked of course the reason i was sensitive to the issue was because in your deposition you said you were shocked at the degree of cyanosis when you saw the patient in fact this issue was a point of disagreement between you and mr stanhope it certainly was a disagreement craig said defensively some of the original sullenness returned to his voice mr stanhope had said on the phone and i quote she looked rather blue whereas when i got to the house she was floridly cyanotic would you have labeled it central cyanosis like ms okeefe central or peripheral whats the difference in this kind of case her heart wasnt pumping her blood fast enough through her lungs there was a lot of deoxygenated blood in her system thats what generally causes cyanosis the issue is the amount of cyanosis i agree the deep cyanosis certainly suggests not enough blood was going through her lungs or that not enough air was getting into her lungs if it were peripheral cyanosis meaning blood just pooling in her extremities it wouldnt have been so conspicuous or even what are you implying craig asked aggressively to be honest i dont know as a medical examiner i try to keep an open mind let me ask you this what kind of relationship did the deceased have with her surviving husband somewhat strange i suppose they certainly werent affectionate in public i doubt they were close since he did commiserate with me about her hypochondriasis you see we medical examiners from experience are naturally suspicious if i were doing this autopsy and considering the cyanosis i would look for any signs of smothering or strangulation just to rule out homicide thats absurd craig snapped this wasnt a homicide good grief man im not suggesting it was im just thinking about it as a possibility another possibility could be the woman had an undiagnosed righttoleft cardiac shunt craig impatiently ran his fingers through his hair which changed his appearance from looking tired but neat to tired and mildly disheveled she didnt have a righttoleft shunt how do you know she didnt let you do any noninvasive cardiac imagery like you wanted after her questionable stress test which by the way i couldnt find we havent been able to locate the tracing yet at the office but we have the results but youre right she refused any cardiac studies so she could have had a congenital righttoleft shunt that was undiagnosed what difference would it make if she had she could have had a serious structural problem with her heart or major vessels which raises the issue of contributing negligence since she refused followup studies to your stress test more importantly if she had a serious structural defect then one might argue the outcome would have been the same even if she had been taken to the hospital immediately if that had been the case then the jury would have to find for you and youd prevail those are interesting arguments but unfortunately for me it is all academic an autopsy was not done so it will never be known if she had a structural abnormality not necessarily jack said an autopsy wasnt done but that doesnt mean one couldnt still be done you mean exhume the body alexis asked from the kitchen area shed obviously been listening provided it wasnt cremated jack added it wasnt cremated craig said it was buried in park meadow cemetery i know because i was invited to the funeral by jordan stanhope i guess that was before he sued you for malpractice obviously it was another reason i was so taken aback when i was served with the summons and the complaint why would the man invite me to the service and then sue me like everything else it doesnt make sense did you go i did i felt obligated i mean i was upset id not been able to resuscitate the woman is it difficult doing an autopsy after being buried for almost a year alexis asked shed come over and taken a seat on the couch it sounds so ghoulish you never know jack said two factors are the most important first how well the body was embalmed second whether the grave stayed dry or if the seal on the casket remained intact the reality is you never know until you open up the grave but regardless of the situation a lot of information can be gleaned what are you guys talking about christina yelled from the table the two other girls had disappeared upstairs nothing sweetie alexis said run up and get your things the school bus is going to be here any minute this could be my contribution to the case jack said i could find out the procedure for exhumation here in massachusetts and do an autopsy short of my providing mere moral support its probably the only way i could offer to help in this affair but its up to you guys you tell me alexis looked at craig what do you think she asked craig shook his head to be honest i dont know what to think i mean if an autopsy were to prove she had some major congenital cardiovascular problem such that any delay getting her to a hospital had no significance id be all for it but what are the chances id have to guess rather small on the flip side if an autopsy were to show her myocardial infarction was even more extensive than one might expect maybe the autopsy would make things worse it seems to me to be a wash ill tell you what jack said ill look into it ill find out all the details and ill let you know meanwhile both of you can give it some thought what do you say i say its a plan alexis responded she looked at craig why not craig said with a shrug ive always said more information is better than less boston massachusetts tuesday june am all rise the court officer called as judge marvin davidson emerged from his chambers and mounted the stairs to the bench the black robes shielded his feet so he seemed to glide like an apparition be seated the court officer called out after the judge had done so jack looked behind himself so he could lower his posterior onto the seat without knocking over his starbucks coffee after the fact hed noted that no one else had brought any refreshments into the courtroom so hed guiltily stashed his coffee beside him on the bench he was sitting next to alexis in the crowded spectators section hed asked her why there were so many observers but shed told him she had no idea whatsoever almost all the spectator seats were taken the morning at the bowman residence had gone better than jack had imagined although craig had flipflopped to a degree from being conversational to brooding theyd at least had a mutually honest talk and jack felt infinitely better being a guest in their home after the girls had left for school thered been more conversation but then it was mostly between alexis and jack craig had reverted to his sullen preoccupied state thered been a long discussion about transportation to and from town but ultimately jack had firmly insisted hed drive he wanted to come to the courtroom to get a feel for the principals particularly the lawyers but then around midmorning he wanted to drive to the boston medical examiners office where hed start his investigation about massachusetts s rules regarding exhumation after that he didnt know what hed do hed told them he might come back to the courtroom but if he didnt hed meet them at the newton house in the late afternoon as the court took its time getting ready to begin by handling the usual housekeeping motions jack studied the principal actors the africanamerican judge looked like a former college football player gone to seed yet the sense of authority he radiated through the confident deliberativeness with which he handled the paperwork on his desk and conversed sotto voce with his clerk gave jack the reassuring feeling he knew what he was doing the two lawyers were exactly as alexis had described randolph bingham was the picture of the elegant polished bigfirm attorney in the way he dressed moved and spoke in sharp contrast tony fasano was the brazen flashy young lawyer who flaunted his trendy clothes and clunky gold accessories yet the characteristic of tony that jack noticed right off and which alexis had not mentioned was that tony appeared to be enjoying himself although the bereaved plaintiff sat rigidly tony and his assistant were carrying on an animated conversation with smiles and suppressed laughter which was a far cry from the defense table which sat in either frozen propriety or defiant despair jacks eyes moved staccato down the line of jurors as they filed into the jury box it was obviously a diverse group which he thought appropriate it struck him that if he ducked out of the court and strolled down the street the first twelve people hed confront would be an equivalent group while jack was studying the jurors tony fasano called the first witness of the day it was marlene richardt craigs matronly secretarycumreceptionist and she was duly sworn and seated in the witness box jack turned his attention to the woman to him she looked like the strongwilled frau that her german name suggested she was of sizable proportions and built square not too dissimilar from tony her hair was up in a tight bun her mouth was set bulldogstyle and her eyes sparkled with defiance it wasnt hard to sense she was a reluctant witness whom tony had the judge declare a hostile witness from the podium tony started out slowly trying to joke with the woman but he was unsuccessful at least thats what jack thought until he switched his attention to the jurors in contrast to the witness most of them smiled at tonys attempts at humor all at once jack could see what alexis had implied namely that tony fasano had a flair for connecting with the jury jack had read marlenes deposition which had very little connection to the case since the day of patience stanhopes demise shed not been in contact with the patient because the patient had not come into the office the two times craig had seen the patient had been at her home so jack was surprised that tony was taking as long as he was with marlene painstakingly charting her association with craig and her own troubled personal life since she and craig had worked together for fifteen years there was a lot to talk about tony maintained his humorous style marlene ignored it at first but after about an hour of what was starting to smack of a filibuster on tonys part she began to get angry and as she did so she started to respond emotionally it was at that point that jack correctly sensed that the jokey style was a deliberate ploy on tonys part tony wanted her offbalance and angry as if sensing something unexpected was coming randolph tried to object that the testimony was endless and immaterial the judge seemed to agree but after a short sidebar conversation which jack could not hear the questioning resumed and quickly hit pay dirt for the plaintiffs cause your honor may i approach the witness tony asked he was holding a folder in the air you may judge davidson said tony stepped up to the witness box and handed the folder to marlene could you tell the jury what you are holding a patient file from the office and whose file is it patience stanhope now there is a file number on the file of course theres a file number marlene snapped how would we find it otherwise could you read it aloud for the jury tony said ignoring marlenes minioutburst pp eight thank you tony said he retrieved the file and returned to the podium expectantly several of the jurors leaned forward mrs richardt would you explain to the jury what the initials pp stand for like a cornered cat marlenes eyes darted around the room before settling for a moment on craig mrs richardt tony prodded hello anybody home they are letters marlene snapped well thank you tony said sarcastically i believe most of the jurors recognized them as letters what im asking is what they stand for and permit me to remind you that you are sworn and giving false testimony is perjury which carries a severe penalty marlenes face which had become progressively red during her testimony got redder still even her cheeks swelled as if she were straining if it will help you remember later testimony will suggest that you and dr craig bowman came up with this filing designation which is not typical in your office in fact i have two other patient file numbers from your office tony held up the two additional folders the first one is peter sagers and the number is ps one twentyone we chose this particular file since the individuals first initials are the same as the deceased yet the letters on her file are pp not ps and my third file is katherine baxter and this number is kb two thirtythree there were others as well and in each instance the two first letters corresponded with the patients initials now we are aware that there are a few other pps but very few so i ask again what does the pp stand for since it is not the patients initials pp stands for problem patient marlene snapped defiantly tonys face twisted into a wry smile for the jurys benefit problem patient he repeated slowly but loudly what in heavens name does that mean do they act up in the office yes they act up in the office marlene spat theyre hypochondriacs they have a bunch of stupid complaints that they make up and take the doctors time away from the people who are really sick and dr bowman agreed with your giving the patients this designation of course hes the one who told us which ones and just so there is no misunderstanding patience stanhopes file was a pp file meaning she was a problem patient is that true yes no further questions jack leaned over toward alexis and whispered this is a publicrelations nightmare what was craig thinking i havent the slightest idea but something like this is not helping in fact things are looking even bleaker jack nodded but didnt say anything more he couldnt believe craig could be so foolish every doctor had patients he or she labeled problem patients but it was never indicated in the record every practice had patients that were hated or despised and that the doctors would try to get rid of as patients but often couldnt jack could remember in his own ophthalmology practice hed had two or three who were so unpleasant that when he saw their names on the schedule it would influence his mood for the whole day he knew such a response was human nature and being a doctor does not absolve the physician from such feelings it was an issue that was swept under the rug during training except in psychiatry randolph smoothly tried on crossexamination to repair the damage as best he could although it was clear the issue had blindsided him with the ritualized process of discovery such surprises were rare tony sported a smug smile labeling a patient as a problem patient is not necessarily disparaging is it mrs richardt i guess not in fact the reason to flag such a patient is to plan on giving them more attention rather than less we did schedule them more time thats exactly my point is it correct to say that as soon as you spotted pp you scheduled the doctor to be with the patient longer yes so it was for the patients benefit to have the pp designation yes no more questions jack leaned over to alexis again im going to head over to the medical examiners office this has given me a bit more motivation thank you alexis whispered back jack felt definite relief as he emerged from the courthouse being ensnared in the legal system had always been one of his phobias and having it happen to his brotherinlaw hit too close to home the notion that justice would miraculously prevail was unreasonably idealistic as craigs case was threatening to show jack didnt trust the system although he couldnt think of a better one he retrieved his rented hyundai from beneath the boston common hed parked it there that morning having stumbled on the public garage after vainly looking for street parking in boston s government center district he had no idea where craig and alexis had parked the original idea had been for him to follow them into the city but whenever he let so much as a car length develop between himself and the bowmans lexus another car always immediately slid in it was especially true once they got on the turnpike and not willing to be as aggressive at highway speeds as would have been necessary to stay directly behind craig and alexis he lost them in the sea of commuters from his perspective the boston driving which had been difficult the night before was a hundred times more challenging in true rushhour traffic using the hertz map hed been able to get into boston proper easily enough from the garage it had been a relatively short and quite pleasant walk to the courthouse once he was out of the dimly lit garage jack pulled to the side of the road and consulted the hertz map it took him a while to find albany street but once he had he was able to orient himself with the help of the boston common which was to his right and the boston public garden which was to his left the garden was ablaze with latespring flowers jack had forgotten what a charming attractive city boston was once you got into it while he drove which took most of his concentration he tried to think of any other way to help craigs cause it seemed an ironic absurdity that craig was going to be found liable for malpractice because hed been gracious enough to make a house call albany street was relatively easy to find as was the medical examiners office making it even easier was a multistory public parking facility immediately adjacent fifteen minutes later jack was talking through a protective glass screen to an attractive young female receptionist in contrast to the outdated medical examiners facility in new york the boston headquarters was spanking new jack couldnt help being both envious and impressed can i help you the woman asked cheerfully i imagine you can jack said he went on to explain who he was and that he wanted to talk to one of the medical examiners he said he wasnt choosy just whoever was available i think they are all in the autopsy room doctor the woman said but let me check while the woman made several calls jack glanced around it was a utilitarian decor with the characteristic odor of fresh paint there was an office for the liaison with the police department and through the open door jack saw a uniformed officer there were several other rooms but jack could only guess at their function dr latasha wylie is available after all and shell be right down the receptionist said she had to practically yell for jack to hear through the glass partition jack thanked her and began to wonder exactly where the park meadow cemetery was if craig and alexis wanted him to do the autopsy he was going to have to move very quickly since they were already at day two of a predicted fiveday trial actually doing the autopsy wouldnt be the challenge the challenge would be the bureaucratic red tape and in a city as old as boston massachusetts jack feared the red tape might be formidable dr stapleton a voice questioned jack started hed been nosily and surreptitiously glancing into one of the other rooms off the lobby trying to figure out its role guiltily jack turned to face a surprisingly youthful africanamerican woman with flowing coalblack tresses and beautypageant good looks jack went from feeling guilty to being momentarily nonplussed there had been too many times lately when hed faced professional female medical colleagues who looked to him like college coeds it made him feel ancient after introductions which included jacks showing his me badge just to emphasize that he wasnt some deranged creep off the street he gave a thumbnail sketch of what he wanted namely information about the exhumation procedure in massachusetts latasha immediately invited jack upstairs to her office which made jack even more envious when he compared it to his own the room wasnt huge or sumptuous but it had both a desk and work area so the inevitable paperwork and microscopic work could be kept separated such that one didnt have to be put away to switch to the other it also had windows it was only a view of the nearby parking garage but it let in a significant amount of daylight something he didnt see in his office once in the office jack gave a detailed account of craigs malpractice case he stretched reality by saying craig was one of the citys premier internists even though he practiced in the suburbs and by suggesting he was going to be found liable for the deceaseds death unless the deceased was exhumed and autopsied his rationale for this embellishment was that he thought that if the boston me s office was motivated enough they could slice through any bureaucratic problems in new york that would have been the case unfortunately latasha disabused him of this idea immediately we medical examiners in massachusetts cannot get involved in ordering an exhumation unless its a criminal case she observed and even then it has to go through the district attorney who in turn has to go to a judge to get a court order jack groaned inwardly bureaucracy was rearing its ugly head its a lengthy process latasha continued essentially it involves this office convincing the district attorney there is a high suspicion of criminality on the other hand if there is no crime involved then its a pro forma procedure here in massachusetts jacks ears pricked up really how is that all you need is a permit jack felt his pulse quicken and how do you get a permit from the town clerk where the cemetery is located or from the board of health if its here in boston the easiest way would be to contact the funeral director who did the burial in the first place if the funeral home is in the same town as the cemetery and it usually is he knows the town clerk or board of health personnel personally it could probably be obtained in an hour with the right contacts thats good news jack said if you go ahead with an autopsy we could help not doing it here of course since this is a public facility and i cant imagine our chief authorizing something like that but we could help by providing specimen jars and fixatives and help processing the specimens we could also help with toxicology if its appropriate will the death certificate have the funeral home on it absolutely disposition of the body has to be recorded whats the name again patience stanhope she died about nine months ago latasha used her computer to bring up the death certificate here it is september eighth to be exact really jack questioned he got up and peered over latashas shoulder at the date it seemed a coincidence september had been significant in his life as well it had been the date of the dinner at elios when he and laurie had gotten engaged its the langleypeerson funeral home in brighton who took the body want me to write the address and phone number down thank you jack said he was still marveling about the date he retook his seat he wasnt superstitious but the coincidence intrigued him whats the time frame when do you see yourself doing this autopsy latasha asked to be perfectly honest it hasnt been decided to actually do it jack admitted its up to the doctor and his wife its my feeling it would help which is the reason i suggested it and why im looking into how to go about it there is something about the exhumation permit i forgot to mention latasha said as an afterthought oh jack said reining in his enthusiasm youll need the approval and signature of the next of kin jacks shoulders visibly sagged he chided himself for not remembering what was now so obvious of course the next of kin would have to agree hed allowed his zeal of helping his sister overwhelm his rationality he couldnt imagine the plaintiff agreeing to allow his dead wife to be dug up in hopes of helping the defense but then he remembered that stranger things have happened and since doing an autopsy might be the only thing he could offer alexis he wasnt going to accept an unchallenged defeat but then again there was laurie back in new york if he were to do an autopsy it would mean staying in boston which would get her upset like so many things in life the situation was far more complicated than hed like fifteen minutes later jack was back in his hyundai accent drumming his fingers on the driversside airbag cover what to do was the question he looked at his watch it was twelve twentyfive any thoughts of returning to the courtroom were nixed since the court would be in recess for lunch he could have called alexiss cell phone but instead he decided on paying a visit to the funeral home with that decided he unfolded his hertz city map and plotted his course driving out of boston was no easier than driving in but once he stumbled onto the charles river he was oriented twenty minutes later he was on the appropriate street in the suburban area of brighton and five minutes after that he found the funeral home it was a housed in a large white woodframe previously singlefamily home built in the victorian style complete with a turret and italianate details extending from the rear was a modern addition of an indeterminate style built of concrete block most important from jacks perspective was that it had ample parking after locking the car jack walked around to the front of the building and mounted the stairs to a spacious wraparound porch there was no porch furniture the front door was unlocked so he walked into the buildings foyer jacks immediate impression was that the interior was as serene as a deserted medieval library with muted gregorian chants providing the appropriate background noise he would have liked to have said it was as severe as a deserted funeral home but since it was a funeral home he felt obligated to come up with something else to his left was a casket gallery with all the caskets propped open to reveal their velvet or satin interiors comforting names like eternal bliss were displayed but prices were not to the right was a viewing room which was currently vacant rows of collapsible chairs faced a raised dais with an empty catafalque floating in the air was a whiff of incense as though it were a tibetan souvenir shop at first jack was confused as to where to go to find a live human but before he could wander too far one appeared as if by magic jack hadnt heard a door open or even approaching footsteps can i help you a man inquired in a barely audible voice he was slender and austere in his black suit white shirt and black tie with his pasty and cadaverous face he looked like a candidate for the establishments services his thin short and deeply colored dyed hair was plastered to the scabrous dome of his head jack had to suppress a smile the man embodied a familiar but false stereotype of a funeral home employee it was as if hed been called by central casting for a part in a ghoulish movie jack knew that reality didnt support the hollywood image in his role as a medical examiner jack had a lot of interaction with funeral home employees and none of them resembled the man standing in front of him can i help you the man repeated slightly louder but almost in a whisper despite there being no one not even the dead whom he could have disturbed he held himself rigidly in check with his hands clasped piously over his abdomen and his elbows tucked in against his body the only thing moving were his narrow lips he didnt even seem to blink im looking for the funeral director at your service my name is harold langley we are a familyowned and operated establishment im a medical examiner jack said he flashed his official badge quickly enough to be reasonably certain harold didnt have time to notice it was not from massachusetts harold visibly stiffened as if jack were an emissary from the massachusetts division of professional licensure suspicious by nature jack thought the reaction curious but he pressed on you people handled the arrangements for patience stanhope who passed away this past september indeed we did i remember it well we also handled the services for mr stanhope a very prominent gentleman in the community also for the only stanhope child im afraid oh jack grunted in response to information hed not been seeking he quickly stored it away and returned to the issue at hand some questions have arisen surrounding mrs stanhopes death and an exhumation and autopsy are being considered has the langleypeerson home had experience doing such a thing we have but on an infrequent basis harold said relaxing back to his originally restrained ceremonious self jack was apparently no longer viewed as a possible threat are you in possession of the required paperwork no what im hoping is that you could help in that regard certainly whats needed is an exhumation permit a transportation permit and a reinterment permit and most importantly the permit must have the signature of the current mr stanhope as the next of kin it is the next of kin who must give authorization so i understand would you have the necessary forms here yes i believe so if youll follow me i can give them to you harold led jack through an archway in the direction of the main stairs but immediately turned left into a darkened deep pilecarpeted hallway it was now apparent to jack how harold had managed to silently appear you mentioned that the first mr stanhope was prominent in the community how so he was founder of the stanhope insurance agency of boston which was very successful in its heyday mr stanhope was a wealthy man and quite a philanthropist which is rare in brighton brighton is a workingclass community meaning the current mr stanhope must be a wealthy man undoubtedly harold said as he led jack into an office as austere as he was the current mr stanhopes history is a marvelous horatio alger story he was born stanislaw jordan jaruzelski a local boy from a workingclass immigrant family who started working at the agency right out of brighton high school he was a whiz kid even though he didnt go to college who worked himself up by his bootstraps to management when the old man passed on he married the widow sparking some lurid speculation he even took the family name although it was a bright sunshinefilled june day outside inside harolds office it was dark enough to necessitate the desk lamp and a floor lamp to be on the windows were covered by heavy dark green velvet drapes after finishing the current mr stanhope saga harold went to an upright fourdrawer file cabinet covered with mahogany veneer from the top drawer he pulled out a folder from within the folder he took three papers one of which he handed to jack the other two he placed on his desk he motioned toward one of the velvetupholstered chairs facing the desk for jack before sitting himself down in his highbacked desk chair thats the exhumation permit i gave you harold said theres a place for mr stanhope to sign giving authorization jack glanced at the paper as he sat down getting the signature was obviously going to be the dealbreaker but for the moment he wasnt going to worry about it who will fill in the rest after mr stanhope signs i will do that what is the time frame you are looking at if its to be done it has to be done immediately then youd better let me know quickly id have to arrange for the vault companys truck and a backhoe could the autopsy be done here at the home yes in the embalming room working around our schedule the only problem is we might not have all the tools you would like for instance we dont have a cranial saw i can get the tools jack was impressed harold looked rather weird but he was informed and efficient i should mention this will be an expensive undertaking what are we talking about therell be the vault company and backhoe charge as well as cemetery fees on top of that will be our charges for obtaining the permits supervision and use of the embalming room can you give me a ballpark idea at least several thousand dollars jack whistled softly as if he thought the figure high whereas in actuality he thought it was cheap with all that was involved he stood up do you have an offhours phone number ill give you my cell phone number terrific jack said one other thing do you know the address of the stanhope home of course everybody knows the stanhope house its a landmark in brighton a few minutes later jack was back in the rentacar again drumming the steering wheel while he thought of what he should do next it was now after two pm returning to the courtroom didnt thrill him hed always been more of a performer than a spectator instead of going back into boston he reached for the hertz map it took him a few minutes but he located the newton memorial hospital and oriented himself and eventually arrived at his destination newton memorial hospital resembled almost every suburban hospital jack had been in it was built in a confusing hodgepodge of various wings added over the years the oldest section had period details like decoration on a cake mostly greek revival but the new structures were progressively plainer the most recent addition was just brick and bronzetinted glass with no embellishments whatsoever jack parked in the visitors area in a lot that backed onto a wetland with a small pond a flock of canada geese were floating motionless on the surface like a bunch of wooden decoys consulting the fat case file jack memorized the names of the people he wanted to speak with the emergencyroom doctor matt gilbert the emergencyroom nurse georgina okeefe and the staff cardiologist noelle everette all three were on the plaintiffs witness list and all three had been deposed by the defense what was troubling jack was the cyanosis issue instead of going to the front entrance of the hospital jack went to the emergency area the ambulance bay was empty to the side was an automatic sliding glass door jack walked in and headed directly to the admitting desk it seemed like a good time to visit there were only three people in the waiting area none of them appeared sick or injured the nurse at the desk looked up as jack approached she was dressed in scrubs and had the usual stethoscope slung around her neck she was reading the boston globe calm before the storm jack joked something like that what can we do for you jack went through his usual spiel including the me badge flash he asked for matt and georgina purposefully using their first names to suggest familiarity theyre not here yet the duty nurse said they work the evening shift when does that start at three jack looked at his watch it was going on three so they will be here shortly they better be the duty nurse said sternly but with a smile to show she was being humorous what about dr noelle everette im sure shes here someplace want me to page her that would be helpful jack retreated to the waiting area with the other three people he tried to make eye contact but no one was willing he eyed an old national geographic magazine but didnt pick it up instead he marveled about stanislaw jordan jaruzelski transforming himself into jordan stanhope and then he brooded about how he was going to get jordan stanhope to sign an exhumation permit it seemed impossible like climbing mount everest not only without oxygen but also without clothes he smiled briefly at the thought of a couple of bareassed climbers standing triumphantly on the rocky summit nothing is impossible he reminded himself he heard dr noelle everettes name over an oldfashioned page system such a page system seemed like an anachronism in the information age with grammarschool kids textmessaging five minutes later the er duty nurse called him back to the admitting desk she told him that dr everette was up in radiology and would be happy to talk with him the nurse then gave him directions the cardiologist was busy reading and dictating cardioangiograms she was sitting in a small viewing room with an entire wall filled with xray films on a movable conveyor belt the only light came from behind the films and washed her with its fluorescent bluewhiteness similar to moonlight but brighter it made the cardiologist appear ghostlike particularly in her white coat jack assumed he looked equally washedout jack was completely forthright he explained who he was and why he was associated with the case i am to be an expert witness for the plaintiff noelle said wishing to be equally forthright im going to testify that by the time the patient arrived here at the emergency room we really had no chance to resuscitate her and i was indignant to learn there had been an avoidable delay some of us oldfashioned physicians who treat all comers and not just those who pay us up front are angry about these concierge doctors were convinced they are selfserving rather than acting in the patients best interests as they claim and which true professionalism dictates so you are testifying because dr bowman is practicing concierge medicine jack asked he was taken aback by noelles emotional response absolutely not noelle said im testifying because there had been a delay getting the patient to the hospital everyone knows that after a myocardial infarction it is critical to start fibrinolytic and reperfusion treatment absolutely as soon as possible if that opinion secondarily says something about my feelings visavis concierge medicine so be it listen i respect your position dr everette and im not here to try to convince you otherwise believe me im here to ask you about the degree of cyanosis the patient apparently had is that something you remember particularly noelle relaxed to a degree i cant say particularly since cyanosis is a frequent sign seen with severe cardiac illness the er nurse wrote in the notes the patient had central cyanosis i mean she specifically said central cyanosis listen when the patient got here she was close to death with dilated pupils completely flaccid body and a pronounced brachycardia with total av black her heart could not be externally paced she was on deaths door cyanosis was just part of the whole picture well thanks for talking with me jack said he stood youre welcome noelle responded as jack made his way back down to the emergency room he was even more pessimistic about the outcome of the case than hed been earlier dr noelle everette was going to be a powerful expert witness for the plaintiff not only because of her expert status as a cardiologist but also because she was articulate and a dedicated physician and because she had been directly involved in the case times have changed jack murmured out loud thinking that it used to be hard to find a doctor to testify against another doctor it seemed to him that noelle was looking forward to testifying and despite what shed said part of her motivation was antipathy toward concierge medicine by the time jack got back to the er the shift had changed although the er was still peaceful jack had to wait to talk with the nurse and the doctor while they got themselves updated on the patients present who were waiting for test results or for the arrival of their personal physicians it was close to three thirty when jack finally was able to sit down with them in a small staff lounge area directly behind the admitting desk both were young jack guessed early thirties jack said essentially the same thing hed said to noelle at the outset but the emergencyroom staffs response was much less emotional or censorious in fact georgina in her bubbly style professed to have been greatly impressed by craig i mean how many doctors arrive at the er riding with the patient in the ambulance i can tell you not many the fact that hes being sued is a travesty it shows how far out of whack the system is when doctors like dr bowman are ambushed by the likes of the ambulancechaser lawyer on the case i cant remember his name tony fasano jack offered he was enjoying hearing someone who shared his thoughts although he wondered if georgina had heard the social side of craigs tale especially since leona had come to the er that fatal night that was it tony fasano when he first came snooping around here i thought he was an extra in one of those gangster movies i really did i mean i couldnt imagine he was for real did he really go to law school jack shrugged his shoulders well it wasnt harvard i can tell you that anyway i cant imagine him calling me as a witness i told him exactly what i thought of dr bowman i think he did a great job he even had a portable ecg machine and had already tested for biomarkers before they arrived here at the er jack nodded as georgina spoke hed read all this in her deposition in which shed fulsomely praised craig when she fell silent jack said what i wanted to talk to you people about was the cyanosis what about the cyanosis dr matt gilbert asked it was the first time hed spoken his laidback personality was overwhelmed by georgina s vivacity you remember the cyanosis silly georgina said giving matt a playful slap on the shoulder before jack could speak she was as blue as a blue moon when they brought her in here i dont think that expression has anything to do with color matt said it doesnt georgina questioned well it should do you not remember the cyanosis jack asked matt vaguely i suppose but her general condition trumped everything else you described it as central cyanosis in your notes jack said to georgina was there some specific reason for that well of course she was blue all over not just her fingers or legs her whole body was blue until they got her on oxygen with the respirator and started doing cardiac massage what do you think might have been the cause jack asked do you think it could have been a righttoleft shunt or maybe severe pulmonary edema i dont know about a shunt matt said but she didnt have any pulmonary edema at all her lungs were clear one thing i remember georgina said suddenly she was completely flaccid when i started another iv line her arm was like a rag dolls is that unique in your experience jack asked yeah georgina said she looked at matt for confirmation theres usually some resistance i guess it varies with the degree of consciousness did either of you see any petechial hemorrhages in her eyes any strange marks on her face or neck georgina shook her head i didnt she looked at matt i was worrying too much about the big picture to see any such details matt said why do you ask georgina questioned im a medical examiner jack explained im trained to be cynical smothering or strangulation has to be at least considered in any sudden death with cyanosis now thats a new angle georgina said a biomarker assay confirmed a heart attack matt said im not questioning there was a myocardial infarction jack said but id be interested if something other than a natural process brought it on let me give you an example i once had a case of a woman arguably a few years older than mrs stanhope who had a heart attack immediately after being robbed at gunpoint it was easy to prove a temporal connection and the perpetrator is sitting on death row to this day my word georgina said after giving both individuals a business card that included his cell phone number jack headed back to his car by the time he unlocked the door and climbed in it was after four oclock he sat for a moment looking out at the small pond he thought about his conversation with the hospital staff thinking it was a wash in regard to craigs cause between noelle and georgina with one avidly for and one avidly against the trouble was that noelle was surely going to testify whereas georgina as she expected probably would not since she wasnt on the defense list other than that he hadnt learned much or if he had he was too dumb to recognize it one thing was for certain hed liked and was impressed by all these people and if he got into an accident and was brought in there hed feel he was in good hands jack thought about his next move what he would have liked to do was drive back to the bowman house suit up in his basketball gear and have a run with david thomas warren s friend over on memorial drive but realistically speaking jack knew that if there were any chance of his contributing to the case by doing an autopsy on patience stanhopes earthly remains he had to force himself to face jordan stanhope with the idea of getting him to sign the exhumation permit the problem was how to get him to do it short of procuring a pistol and holding it to his temple jack could not think of a single reasonable stratagem and ultimately resigned himself to adlibbing while trying to appeal to the mans sense of justice and fairness jack took out the threebyfive index card that harold langley had given him with harolds cell phone number and jordan stanhopes address balancing it on the steering wheel he picked up the trusty hertz map and tried to find the street it took a bit of patience but he located it near both chandler pond and chestnut hill country club assuming that the court would have recessed somewhere in the three thirty to four oclock range he thought now would be as appropriate a time as any to drop in for a visit whether hed get into the mans house or not he had no idea but it wasnt going to be for lack of trying it took him a halfhour of navigating a maddening maze of twisty streets to find the stanhope house the fact that jordan stanhope was a wealthy man was immediately apparent the house was huge with spacious immaculate grounds carefully pruned trees and shrubs and flowering gardens a shiny new dark blue bentley twodoor coupe was parked in the circular drive that fronted the house a separate threecar garage with a carriage house above was just visible through the trees to the right of the main building jack pulled his hyundai accent up alongside its obscenely expensive counterpart the juxtaposition was a study in contrasts he got out of his car and approached the other he had to look inside the extravagant machine humorously attributing his unexpected interest to a heretofore unexpressed gene on his y chromosome the windows were down so the aroma of the luxurious leather bathed the whole area the car was obviously brandspankingnew after making sure he wasnt being observed jack stuck his head through the driversside window the control panel had a simple rich elegance then he noticed something else the keys were in the ignition jack stepped back although he thought it was the height of ridiculousness to spend the kind of money he imagined the car cost the fact that the keys were available unleashed a pleasant fleeting fantasy of breezing down a scenic road in the bentley with laurie at his side it was a reverie that reminded him of a recurrent dream of flying hed had in his youth but the daydream quickly dissolved to be replaced by a mild embarrassment of coveting another mans car even if just for an imagined joyride jack skirted the bentley and approached the front door his reaction to the car had surprised him on several levels most important of which concerned the idea of unabashedly enjoying himself for many years after the fateful plane crash hed been unable to do so since it aroused his guilt of being the only one in the family still alive the fact that he could entertain the idea now was the best suggestion yet that hed made significant progress toward recovery after ringing the doorbell jack turned back to the gleaming bentley hed thought about what the car meant to him but now he pondered what it said about jordan stanhope aka stanislaw jordan jaruzelski it suggested that the man was seriously indulging himself with his new wealth hearing the door open brought jacks attention around and to the issue at hand in his inside jacket pocket was the signatureless exhumation permit and it crinkled as he brought his hand up to shield his eyes the late afternoon sun was reflecting off the polished brass door knocker and momentarily blinded him yes jordan questioned despite the glare jack could tell he was being eyed suspiciously jack was wearing his usual jeans blue chambray shirt knitted tie and summerweight blazer that hadnt been cleaned or pressed for longer than he cared to admit in contrast jordan had on a plaid smoking jacket with a cravat from around his silhouette wafted cool dry air suggesting the homes airconditioning was on despite the mild outdoor temperature im dr stapleton jack began with a sudden decision to suggest a quasiofficial explanation for his visit jack fumbled to extract his wallet with his medical examiner badge he held it up for moment im a medical examiner and id like a moment of your time let me see jordan said as jack tried to quickly return the wallet and badge to its normal location jack was surprised rarely did people actually examine his official credentials new york jordan questioned glancing back up into jacks face arent you rather far afield to jacks ear jordan spoke with a mockmelodiousness and a hint of an english accent that jack associated with elite new england boarding schools to jacks double surprise jordan had reached out to grasp jacks hand to steady it while hed studied the badge his precisely manicured fingers were cool to the touch i take my job seriously jack said defensively reverting to sarcasm and what is your job that brings you from new york all the way to our humble home jack couldnt suppress a smile the mans comment suggested he had an ironic sense of humor similar to jacks the home was anything but humble who is it jordie a crystalline voice called from the cool depths of the homes interior i dont precisely know yet dearest jordan affectionately called back over his shoulder its a doctor from new york ive been asked to help with the legal case you are currently involved in jack said really jordan said with a hint of amazement and exactly how are you intending to help before jack could answer an attractive doeeyed young woman half jordan s age appeared from around jordan and stared at jack she had slipped an arm around jordan s neck and the other around his middle she smiled pleasantly revealing startlingly white perfect teeth why are you standing here invite the doctor in he can join us for tea following the womans suggestion jordan stepped to the side motioned for jack to come into the house and then led him on a lengthy journey through a central hall an expansive living room and out into a conservatory built off the buildings rear surrounded on three sides and roofed with glass the room gave jack the feeling he was back outdoors in the garden although jack initially had thought tea was to be a euphemism for cocktails he was wrong ensconced in an oversized white wicker chair with pastel chintz cushions jack was served tea whipped cream and biscuits by a reserved woman in a french maids uniform who quickly disappeared jordan and his girlfriend charlene mckenna were seated opposite on a matching wicker sofa between jack and his hosts was a low glass table supporting a silver service with additional sweets charlene could not keep her hands off jordan who acted as if he were unaware of her overt affection the conversation initially ranged freely before centering on their plans for the summer which were to include a cruise along the dalmatian coast it was amazing to jack that the couple were willing to do all the talking he sensed that they were starved for entertainment since he didnt have to say much beyond where he was from and that he was currently a houseguest at his sisters in newton after that all he had to go was give an occasional unhuh to indicate he was paying attention this gave jack lots of opportunity to merely observe and he was fascinated jack had heard that jordan was enjoying himself and apparently had been enjoying himself practically from the day patience stanhope had died there had been little time for mourning since charlene had moved in with him several weeks after the funeral the bentley in the driveway was only a month old and the couple had spent a portion of the winter in st barts thanks to a melding of this new information with his cynical nature the possibility in jacks mind of foul play being involved in patiences death became more than a passing thought and made the idea of doing an autopsy even more appropriate and necessary he thought about going back to the boston medical examiners office with his suspicions even if entirely circumstantial to see if they would be willing to approach the district attorney about going to a judge to order the exhumation because surely jordan would never agree to one if hed been in any way responsible for patiences death but the longer jordan talked and the more apparent it was that he was playing the role of an ersatz cultured aristocratic gentleman the less sure jack was of jordans response to an autopsy there had been criminal cases where the perpetrators thought themselves so intelligent that they actively helped law enforcement just to prove how smart they were the pretender jordan seemed to be might fall into that category and agree to an autopsy to make the game that much more exciting jack shook his head his rationality suddenly kicked in and he knew without a shadow of doubt that he was letting his imagination run wild you dont agree jordan asked hed seen jacks head motion no i mean yes jack said as he verbally stumbled trying to cover his blunder the truth was hed not been following the conversation at that point im saying the best time to go to the dalmatian coast is during the fall and not the summer you dont agree i agree jack insisted theres no doubt whatsoever mollified jordan returned to what hed been saying charlene nodded appreciatively jack went back to his musing and admitted to himself that the chance of foul play being involved with patiences death was infinitesimally small the main reason was that patience had had a heart attack and that thered been too many accomplished physicians involved including craig craig wasnt jacks favorite person particularly to be married to his sister but he was one of the sharpest most knowledgeable physicians that jack had ever known there was no way jordan could have fooled such a collection of professionals by somehow causing his wife to have a heart attack such a realization yanked jack back to square one the medical examiners office could not get him an exhumation and autopsy if it were to happen he had to do it himself in that regard jordan s masquerading as the boston brahmin might help jack could appeal to him as a gentleman since true gentlemen have a duty to set the example in ethical behavior by making sure justice prevails it was a long shot but it was all he could come up with while jordan and charlene debated the best time of year to go to venice jack put down his cup and saucer and reached into his side pocket to pull out one of his business cards when a break occurred in the conversation he leaned forward and with his thumb snapped the card down onto the glass tabletop i say what do we have here jordan questioned immediately taking the bait bending forward he glanced at the card before picking it up to examine it more closely charlene took it from him and looked at it as well whats a medical examiner charlene asked its the same thing as a coroner jordan explained not quite jack said a coroner historically is an appointed or elected official tasked to look into causes of death who may or may not have any specific training a medical examiner is a medical doctor whos had graduate training in forensic pathology i stand corrected jordan said you were about to tell me how you intend to help with my suit which i have to say im finding rather a bore and why is that i thought it would be exciting like watching a boxing match instead it is tedious like watching two people arguing im certain i could make it more interesting jack said snatching the opportunity jordan s unexpected opinion about the trial afforded him please be more specific i like your simile comparing the trial to boxing but the reason the match is uninteresting is because the two boxers are blindfolded thats a droll image two fighters unable to see each other and just flailing away precisely and they are blinded because they dont have all the information they need what do they need they are arguing about the care of patience stanhope without patience being able to tell her side of the story and what story would she tell if she could tell it we wont know unless i can ask her i dont understand what you two are talking about charlene complained patience stanhope is dead and buried i believe hes talking about doing an autopsy thats exactly what im talking about you mean dig her up charlene questioned with consternation yuck its not all that uncommon jack said its been less than a year i guarantee something will be learned by doing it and the boxing match as you call it will be in broad daylight and far more engaging like what jordan questioned hed gone quiet pensive like what portion of her heart was involved with the heart attack how it progressed whether there was any preexisting condition only when these issues are known can the question of her care be addressed jordan chewed his lower lip while he considered what jack had said jack was encouraged he knew what he was trying to do was still an uphill struggle but jordan had not dismissed the idea outright of course he might not realize that permission to do the exhumation rested with him why are you offering to do this jordan asked whos paying you no one is paying me i can honestly say that im motivated to see that justice prevails at the same time i have a conflict of interest my sister is married to the defendant dr craig bowman jack carefully watched jordan s face for signs of anger or irritation and saw neither to the mans credit he seemed to be rationally mulling over jacks comments without emotion im all for justice jordan said at length for the moment his mild english accent had abandoned him but it seems to me it would be hard for you to be completely objective fair enough jack said its a good point but if i were to do an autopsy i would preserve all specimens for expert review i could even get a medical examiner to assist me who had no conflict why wasnt an autopsy done originally not all deaths result in autopsies if there had been any question of the manner of death an autopsy could have been ordered by the medical examiners office at the time there were no questions patience had had a documented heart attack and was attended by her physician if the lawsuit had been anticipated an autopsy could have been done i hadnt planned on filing suit although i wouldnt be honest if i didnt admit your brotherinlaw angered me that night he was arrogant and accused me of not communicating adequately about patiences condition when i was pleading with him to take patience directly to the hospital jack nodded hed read about this particular point in both jordans and craigs depositions and had no intention of getting involved in the issue he knew that the origins of many malpractice suits involved poor communication from the physician or his staff in fact i hadnt intended to file suit until mr anthony fasano contacted me jacks ears pricked up the attorney sought you out and not vice versa absolutely just like you did he came to the door and rang the bell and he talked you into filing he did and for essentially the same justification you are using justice he said it was my responsibility to see that the public was protected from doctors like dr bowman and what he called the inequities and inequalities of concierge medicine he was quite persistent and persuasive good lord jack thought to himself jordan s gullibility for the comeon of an ambulancechasing personalinjury lawyer undermined the regard jack had begun to feel for the man jack reminded himself that the man was a phony a wealthy phony but a phony nonetheless who had married up having laid the groundwork jack decided it was time to go for the jugular and get the hell out he reached into his pocket and pulled out the exhumation permit he placed it on the table in front of jordan in order for me to do the autopsy you would have to merely sign this authorization ill take care of the rest what kind of paper is it jordan questioned his puton accent returning he leaned over and glanced at it im not a lawyer its just a routine form jack said he could think of several sarcastic quips but he restrained himself jordan s response caught jack off guard instead of any more questions he reached into the pocket of his jacket but unfortunately not for a pen instead he pulled out a cell phone he speeddialed a number and sat back he eyed jack as the call went through mr fasano jordan said while looking out at his lush lawn ive just been handed a form by a medical examiner from new york that might impact the trial its to give my permission to dig up patience for an autopsy i want you to view it before i sign even from where he was sitting more than ten feet away jack could hear tony fasanos response jack couldnt understand the actual words but the tone was quite clear all right all right jordan repeated i shant sign it until you review it you have my word he flipped his phone shut then looked at jack hes on his way over the last thing jack wanted was to involve the lawyers as hed told alexis the day before he didnt like lawyers particularly personalinjury lawyers with their selfserving claims of fighting for the little guy after the plane crash hed been hounded by lawyers trying to get him to sue the commuter airline maybe ill head out jack said getting to his feet he couldnt help but feel that with tony fasano involved the chances of getting an authorization signature were close to zero you have my cell phone number on my card in case you want to get ahold of me after your lawyer checks out the form no i want to deal with this now jordan said if i dont do it now i dont do it at all so sit down mr fasano will be here before you know it how about a cocktail its after five so its legal he smiled at his hackneyed quip and rubbed his hands together in anticipation jack eased himself back down into the wicker chair he resigned himself to the visits conclusion whatever it was to be jordan must have had a hidden call button because the woman in the french maid outfit suddenly materialized jordan asked for a pitcher of vodka martinis and a dish of olives as if nothing had transpired in the interim jordan comfortably lapsed back into the discussion of his and charlenes imminent travel plans jack declined the offer of a martini he couldnt think of anything he would have wanted less he was entertaining the idea of getting some exercise as soon as he could break away just when jack was reaching the limits of his patience a carillon of bells announced visitors at the front door jordan didnt move in the distance the front door was heard opening followed by muted voices a few minutes later tony fasano swept into the room a few steps behind was another man dressed identically to tony but intimidatingly larger in a reflex show of respect jack stood up he noticed that jordan didnt where is this supposed form tony demanded he had no time for niceties jordan pointed with his free hand the other was holding his martini charlene was sitting snugly at his side toying with the hair on his nape tony snatched up the exhumation permit from the glasstopped table and gave it a rapid onceover with his dark eyes while he did so jack looked him over in contrast to his earlier blithe demeanor in the courtroom he was now ostensibly irate jack estimated he was in his mid to late thirties he had a broad face with rounded features and square teeth his hands were clublike with short fingers jacks attention switched to the significantly larger associate who was dressed in the same gray suit black shirt and black tie he had come to the rooms threshold and stopped he was obviously tonys strongarm crony the fact that tony apparently thought he needed such an associate on a visit to a client gave jack pause whats this nonsense tony demanded waving the form in jacks direction id hardly call an official city form nonsense jack said its an exhumation permit what are you some kind of hired gun for the defense absolutely not hes dr bowmans wifes brother jordan explained hes in town staying at his sisters home to make sure justice prevails thats in his own words justice my ass tony growled at jack you have some nerve busting in here talking to my client wrong jack said lightly i was invited in for a tea party a wiseass on top of it tony snapped its true he was invited in jordan said and we did have tea prior to the martinis im just trying to pave the way to do an autopsy jack explained the more information available the better the chance justice will be served someone needs to talk for patience stanhope i cant believe this bullshit tony said throwing up his hands in exasperation then he waved to his associate franco get over here and get his dog turd out of mr stanhopes home franco obediently stepped into the room he grasped jacks arm around the elbow hiking up jacks shoulder in the process jack debated the rationale for as well as the consequences of resisting as franco started out of the room with jack in tow jack glanced at his host whod not budged from the wicker sofa jordan appeared surprised at the proceedings but didnt intervene as tony apologized for the interruption and promised to take care of the intruder maintaining his firm grip on jacks arm franco marched through the formal living room and out into the marbled central hall with the grand staircase pulling jack along cant we discuss this like gentlemen jack said he began to mildly resist their forward progress as his internal debate continued about how to handle the situation jack wasnt keen on getting physical even though he had been provoked franco was the kind of blocky individual jack associated with linebackers when he played football in college running into a mass of similar size and proportion had been the end of jacks brief football career shut up franco snapped without even so much as a glance back at jack franco stopped when he reached the front door after opening it he propelled jack outside letting go of his arm in the process jack adjusted his jacket and walked down the two steps to the gravel driveway parked at an angle behind the bentley and the hyundai was a large black cadillac of indeterminate vintage it looked like a houseboat compared with the other two vehicles although jack had started for his car and had the keys in his hand he stopped and turned around his rationality told him to get into the car and drive away but that same area on his y chromosome that had admired the bentley was outraged at this summary dismissal franco had stepped out of the house and was standing on the stoop with his legs planted apart and arms akimbo a taunting smirk lingered on his acnescarred face before anything could be said tony barreled out of the house pushing past franco shaped like a considerably smaller version of the bricklike franco he had to swing his hips in a peculiar way to walk with his thick short legs he came directly up to jack poking into jacks face with his index finger let me tell you the reality here cowboy tony snarled i got at least a hundred grand tied up in this case and im expecting one hell of a payoff are you hearing me i dont want you screwing things up everything is going just fine so no autopsy capisce i dont know why you are so upset jack said you could arrange to have your own medical examiner work with me he knew the autopsy issue was dead in the water but he felt a certain satisfaction in aggravating tony the man who was slightly bugeyed to begin with and was even more so now the veins on the sides of his forehead stuck out like dark worms what do i have to say to you tony snarled rhetorically i dont want an autopsy the case is just fine as is no surprises are needed or wanted were going to nail that arrogant concierge mds ass and he deserves it sounds like youve lost your objectivity jack remarked he couldnt help but notice how tonys full lips curled back in unmitigated derision as he pronounced concierge jack wondered if the man had latched onto the issue as a personal crusade there was a touch of zealotry in his expression tony glanced up at franco for support can you believe this guy its like hes from another planet sounds to me like you are afraid of facts jack said i aint afraid of facts tony yelled i got plenty of facts that woman died of a heart attack she should have been at that hospital an hour earlier and if she had we wouldnt be standing here talking whats a hahd attack jack asked poking fun at tonys accent there hadnt been a hint of an r sound and the t was like a soft d thats ittony blurted he snapped his fingers for francos attention get this idiot in his car and out of my sight franco came down the steps quickly enough to jangle the coins in his pocket he stepped around tony and tried to give jack a shove with the flats of his hands jack stood his ground you know ive been meaning to ask you guys how you coordinate your outfits jack said do you decide the night before or is it something you do first thing in the morning i mean its kind of sweet franco reacted with a speed that caught jack by surprise with an open palm he slapped jack on the side of his face hard enough to cause jacks ears to ring jack recoiled instantly and returned the favor with a similar and equally effective blow unaccustomed to people unintimidated by his size franco was more astonished than jack at having been struck as his hand reflexively rose to touch his burning face jack grabbed him by the shoulders and kneed him in the groin franco doubled over into a crouch for a brief instant struggling to get his breath when he came back up he was holding a gun no tony shouted he grabbed francos arm from behind and pulled it down get the hell out of here tony growled to jack holding back the enraged franco like a handler with a mad dog if you screw up my case in any way youll be history theres not going to be an autopsy jack backed up until he bumped into the hyundai he didnt want to take his eyes off franco who was still not standing completely upright and still had the gun in his hand jacks legs felt rubbery from the adrenaline coursing around in his bloodstream once in the car he quickly started it as he looked back at tony and his sidekick he caught sight of jordan and charlene standing in the doorway you aint seen the last of me franco yelled through jacks open passengerside window as jack drove away for more than a quarter of an hour jack drove in a circuitous route through residential areas taking turns haphazardly but not wanting to stop he did not want anyone following him or finding him particularly a large black cadillac he knew hed been stupid at the end of his visit to the stanhope mansion it had been a brief resurgence of the risktaking defiant personality that had emerged after the depression the plane crash and the loss of his family had caused as he came down from the adrenaline rush he felt weak totally lost but within sight of several street signs he pulled over to the side of the road in the shade of a gigantic oak tree to get his bearings as hed been driving jack had toyed with the idea of driving out to the airport washing his hands of the whole affair and flying back to new york the burning skin on the left side of his face was an argument in favor as was the fact that the possibility of doing an autopsy to help his sister and brotherinlaw was now defunct the other compelling argument was that his wedding was approaching at warp speed yet jack couldnt do it sneaking out of town was a cowardly thing to do he picked up the hertz map and tried to guess which main thoroughfare he should try to find and in which direction it would be it wasnt easy because the street he was on wasnt on the map it was either too small or beyond the maps range the problem was he didnt know which was the case just as he was about to start driving again blindly to find a main street his cell phone came to life reaching into his pocket he pulled it out he didnt recognize the number he answered the call and said hello dr stapleton this is jordan stanhope are you okay there have been happier times in my life but basically im okay jack was taken aback by the call i wanted to apologize for the way mr fasano and his associate treated you at my home thank you jack said he thought of other more clever retorts but he held his tongue i saw you being slapped i was impressed by your response you shouldnt have been it was an embarrassingly dimwitted thing to do especially considering the man was armed i felt he had it coming i doubt he shares your opinion that was my least favorite part of my visit ive come to realize just how boorish mr fasano is its embarrassing its not too late to call off the hounds jack thought but did not say im also questioning his tactics and his blithe disregard for finding the truth welcome to the legal profession jack said unfortunately in civil procedures the goal is dispute resolution not finding the truth well im not going to be a party to it ill sign the exhumation permit newton massachusetts tuesday june pm by the time jack got back to the bowman residence it was too late to consider going for exercise hed also missed dinner with the girls who had retired to their respective rooms and were studying for their imminent final exams apparently his presence was already commonplace because none of them came down to say hello to make up for the girls alexis had been effusively welcoming but had immediately noticed the redness bruising and swelling on the left side of his face what in heavens name happened she had questioned with concern jack had brushed her off saying it was nothing but offered to explain it later after hed cleaned up hed changed the subject by asking for craig alexis had told him merely that he was in the great room without elaborating jack had jumped into the shower to wash away the day and now as he got out he wiped the mist from the bathroom mirror to look at his face after the hot water the redness was even more intense than it had been before what he had not noticed was a small bright crimson flameshaped hemorrhage on the white scleral part of his eye leaning closer to the mirror he saw a few tiny subcutaneous hemorrhages over the lateral aspect of his cheekbone there was no doubt that franco had packed a wallop jack couldnt help but wonder how franco looked because jacks palm was still tender from the impact suggesting hed hit him equally hard after a change of clothes jack tossed his laundry into the basket in the laundry room per alexiss instructions how about some supper alexis offered she was standing in the kitchen area that would be terrific jack said im starved i never had time for lunch we all had steaks from the grill roasted potatoes steamed asparagus and salad how does that sound like a dream jack said during this exchange craig hadnt said a word he was sitting forty feet away on the sofa in the great room in exactly the same place hed been that morning but without the newspaper he was dressed in the same clothes hed had on during the day although the shirt was now wrinkled and its top collar button open and his tie loosened like a statue he was staring at the flatscreen television completely motionless jack wouldnt have thought anything abnormal except that the tv wasnt on on the coffee table in front of him stood a halfempty bottle of scotch and an oldfashioned glass brimming with the amber fluid whats he doing jack asked lowering his voice what does it look like hes doing alexis responded hes vegetating hes depressed how did the rest of the day go in court id have to say pretty much the same as the part you watched thats why hes depressed the plaintiffs first expert witness out of three testified it was dr william tardoff who is chief of cardiology at the newton memorial hospital what kind of witness was he unfortunately very credible and he didnt talk down to the jurors he was able to make it crystal clear why the first hour even the first minutes are so important for a heartattack victim after a number of attempted objections from randolph he was able to get it into the record that it was his opinion that patience stanhopes chances of survival had significantly decreased because of craigs delay in confirming his diagnosis and getting her to the treatment facility namely the hospital sounds rather damning especially coming from a department head in craigs own hospital craig has reason to be depressed criticism from anyone is hard for a doctor to take since they put themselves on the pedestal but coming from a respected colleague is a quantum leap worse was randolph able to reduce dr tardoffs impact on crossexamination im sure at least to an extent but its like hes always playing catchup its the rule for the plaintiff to present his case first defense will have its time the system doesnt seem fair but its not like we have an alternative were there only two witnesses today jack asked no there were three total before dr tardoff darlene craigs nurse testified and she was grilled on the problem patient designation the same way marlene had been with the same result during the lunch break randolph was furious at craig for not having told him about it and its easy to understand why it still boggles my mind that craig would permit something like that in his practice im afraid it speaks to a kind of arrogance id be less generous to me its pure stupidity and its certainly not going to help his cause im amazed its been allowed to be introduced its clearly prejudicial in my mind and has nothing to do with alleged negligence but you know what bothers me the most what jack asked he noticed that alexiss face had flushed craigs case is going to suffer but the secretaries designation for those patients was actually appropriate how so jack asked he couldnt help but notice that alexiss color had deepened this was an issue she felt strongly about because they were problem patients each and every one of them in fact calling them problem patients wasnt strong enough they were hypochondriacs of the worst sort i know because craig would tell me about them they were wasting his time they should have gone to a psychiatrist or a psychologist someone who could have possibly have helped them process their issues patience stanhope was the worst of the lot there had been an interval of time about a year ago when she was dragging craig out of bed once a week to make an unnecessary house call it was affecting the whole family so you were upset about patience stanhope of course i was upset it wasnt long after that particular period when she was so demanding that craig moved out jack studied his sisters face he knew her personality tended toward the histrionic back when they were kids and this reaction about patience stanhope suggested the trait hadnt completely disappeared she had gotten herself completely worked up so you werent sorry when she passed on jack said more as a statement than a question sorry i was happy i had told him he should drop her from his practice many times find her another doctor preferably a psychiatrist but you know craig he always refused he had no trouble referring patients to specialists for specialty care but the idea of giving up on a patient was tantamount to failure he couldnt do it how much has he been drinking jack asked to change the subject he nodded toward craigs motionless form too much just like every night jack nodded he knew that abuse of drugs and alcohol by doctors was not an uncommon sequela to being sued for malpractice while were on the subject what would you like to drink alexis asked beer or wine weve got both in the fridge a beer would hit the spot jack said jack got his own beer and while alexis busied herself with jacks dinner he wandered out of the kitchen area and over to the sofa although craig did not move his body his bloodshot eyes rose up and engaged jacks im sorry it was a discouraging day in court jack said in hopes of engaging craig in conversation how much of it did you see craig asked in a monotone only the testimony of your receptionist marlene which was upsetting to hear craig waved a hand as if he were shooing away invisible insects but didnt comment his eyes switched back to the dead tv screen jack would have liked to ask about the pp designation to try to fully understand the mindset that would have allowed craig to so something so politically incorrect and foolish but he didnt it wouldnt have helped anything and was just for his morbid curiosity alexis had been right it had been arrogance craig was one of those doctors who unquestioningly thought everything he did was noble because the core of his life in terms of dedication and sacrifice was indeed noble it was an unfortunate sense of entitlement with craig incommunicative jack wandered back into the kitchen and then out onto the patio with alexis while she grilled his steak alexis was eager to talk about something more upbeat than the malpractice suit she wanted to hear about laurie and the wedding plans jack related the basics but wasnt thrilled about the conversation since he was feeling guilty about being in boston and leaving all the lastminute details to laurie in many respects it was an untenable position he was fated to feel guilty no matter what he did if he left for new york hed feel he was abandoning alexis either way he was slighting someone but rather than wallow in the dilemma he went for another beer fifteen minutes later jack sat down at the large round family table while alexis put a plate of heavenly food in front of him for herself alexis had made a cup of tea and she joined him sitting directly opposite craig had rallied enough to turn on the tv and was watching a local news broadcast id like to tell you about my day jack said in between mouthfuls theres a decision to be made about my role here and what you people want me to do i have to say i had a rather productive afternoon craig alexis called over to her husband i think you should turn off the life support and come over here to hear what jack has to say ultimately this is your decision i dont appreciate being made fun of craig snapped but he did turn off the tv with the remote as if exhausted he got up picked up the scotch bottle and the glass and walked to the table he put the glass down first filled it with scotch before putting the bottle down and took a seat im going to have to cut you off alexis said she reached out for the scotch bottle and slid it out of craigs reach jack expected craig to throw a temper tantrum about his bottle but he didnt instead he gave alexis an overly fake smile to sarcastically thank her while he ate jack told them about his activities chronologically and he tried to be complete he told about going to the medical examiners office and meeting dr latasha wylie and what she was able to tell him about exhuming a body in massachusetts particularly about needing the approval of the next of kin wouldnt that be jordan stanhope alexis questioned hell never agree craig said let me finish the whole story jack said jack told about visiting the langleypeerson funeral home and his discussion with harold langley and getting the permit forms he then told the bowmans what he had learned about jordan stanhope both alexiss and craigs mouths sagged open simultaneously as jack gave them jordan s short biography craig was the first to speak do you think it is true he sputtered harold langley has no reason to lie it must be common knowledge in brighton otherwise harold langley certainly wouldnt have told me funeral directors are generally and rather notoriously tightlipped stanislaw jordan jaruzelski alexis repeated with disbelief no wonder he changed his name i knew jordan was younger than patience craig said but i never suspected anything like that they acted as if they had been married for twentyfiveplus years im amazed i think the interesting part is that patience was the one with the money shes not the one with the money anymore craig commented he shook his head with disgust randolph should have discovered this this is another example of his ineptitude i should have demanded another lawyer normally this is not the kind of information necessary to litigate a malpractice claim jack said although he was surprised himself it didnt come out in jordan s deposition its not relevant im not so sure craig said let me finish jack interrupted then we can talk about the whole situation fine craig said he put his drink down and eagerly leaned forward he was no longer a pathetically brooding individual jack then took the bowmans to the newton memorial hospital with his dialogue and related his conversations with dr noelle everette dr matt gilbert and ms georgina okeefe he talked about his sense that the cyanosis issue was unresolved he said that georgina s main point was that the cyanosis was even not just in the extremities jack asked craig if he had had the same impression i suppose craig said but i was so overwhelmed by her grave general state that i really didnt look at her with that question in mind thats exactly what dr gilbert said as well jack added wait a second craig said holding up his hand did learning what you did about jordan make you think this cyanosis issue is more significant i mean this money situation with a younger man marrying a wealthy widow craig let his sentence trail off as his mind toyed with the idea and its implications i have to say it did jack agreed but relatively briefly in many respects its too soapoperaish if thats a word besides its been documented by the biomarkers that patience had suffered a heart attack as dr gilbert rightfully reminded me today at the same time jordan s curious biography should not be dismissed entirely jack then went on to tell the story hed related to matt and georgina about his case involving the elderly woman whod died of a heart attack after being robbed at gunpoint i think this is all very significant craig said and it continues to make me question randolph s competence what about the bruising on the side of your face alexis asked as if suddenly remembering that jack had agreed to explain it what bruising craig asked jack was to his left meaning the left side of jacks face was angled away you didnt notice alexis questioned with amazement take a look craig stood up and leaned over the table reluctantly jack turned his head so the left side of his face was in craigs view my gosh craig said that does look raw he reached out and touched jacks cheekbone with the tip of his index finger to assess the amount of edema does it hurt jack pulled his face away of course it hurts he said irritably hed always hated how doctors did that they always poked the place you said hurt orthopedic guys were the worst in jacks experience which he had a lot of thanks to all the bumps and bruises he got playing street basketball sorry craig said it looks raw maybe a cold pack would be a good idea want me to get one jack declined craigs ministrations how did it happen alexis asked im coming to it jack said he then related the visit to the stanhopes you went to the stanhope mansion craig questioned with obvious disbelief i did jack admitted is that legal what do you mean legal of course its legal i mean its not like seeking out the jurors or anything if there was any chance of getting a signature i had to go jack then told them about the bentley and then the unexpected charlene craig and alexis exchanged glances of surprise craig gave a short derisive laugh so much for a long mourning period alexis said indignantly the man is shameless likewise for the elaborate gentleman facade this is starting to remind me of another notorious case that took place in rhode island but involved diabetes craig said i know the case you are referring to jack said but even in that case the suddenly wealthy heir was acquitted what about your face alexis said impatiently the suspense is killing me jack told them about how he brought up the issue about exhuming patiences body fully expecting to be rebuffed he then described tony fasanos arrival along with an associate dressed in an almost identical outfit his name is franco alexis said you know him jack questioned he was surprised i dont know him ive just seen him hes hard to miss he comes to the courtroom with tony fasano i only know his name because i heard tony fasano call to him yesterday when they were leaving the courtroom jack related tonys vehement objection to the idea of exhuming patience and doing an autopsy he told them hed been threatened that hed be history if he did the autopsy for a few moments both alexis and craig merely stared at jack they were both dumbfounded by what he had just told them thats weird craig said finally why would he be so against an autopsy jack shrugged presumably because he feels confident in the case he has and doesnt want to rock the boat hes invested some serious money on contingency and hes expecting a mammoth payoff but i have to tell you it makes me more motivated what about your face alexis asked you keep avoiding telling us about it that happened at the end after franco gave me the bums rush i was being cute and stupid i told both of them i thought their matching outfits were sweet so he struck you alexis questioned with consternation well it wasnt a love pat jack said i think you should press charges alexis said indignantly i dont agree jack said stupidly i hit him back so trying to press charges would just get into an argument of who hit whom first you hit that hulky hoodlum alexis questioned with disbelief what have you become in your adulthood selfdestructive people have accused me of that in the nottoodistant past i like to think of myself as occasionally impulsive with a touch of selfrighteous recklessness i dont find this at all funny alexis said nor do i jack agreed but the episode especially me getting whacked helped my argument with jordan that i originally thought was hopeless jack reached into his inner jacket pocket and pulled out the exhumation permit he placed it on the table and smoothed it out with the palm of his hand jordan signed the exhumation permit alexis drew the form closer to herself she looked at jordan s signature and blinked several times as if she expected it might disappear that kind of eliminates any suspicion of his involvement craig said looking over alexiss shoulder who knows jack said what it does for certain is that it puts the idea of an autopsy on the table as a legitimate option its no longer a mere theoretical possibility although now were up against a time constraint assuming that can be overcome the question is whether you people want me to do it or not it has to be decided tonight my feelings have not changed from this morning craig said theres no way to be sure whether it would help or hurt and i can make an argument in either direction i think theres slightly more chance it might help than hinder because of the cyanosis issue jack said there must be some anatomical explanation some contributory pathology but you are right there are no guarantees jack shrugged but i dont want to push the idea im not here to make things worse its your decision craig shook his head as confused as i am its hard to make a decision i think im against it because of the unknown but what do i know im hardly in a position to be objective how about asking randolph alexis suggested if something positive were found by the autopsy hed have to figure out how to get it admitted as evidence with rules of discovery it is not a given it could be youre right jack said randolph should be consulted it would be an exercise in futility if the findings couldnt be introduced theres something not right in this picture craig said im questioning the mens competence and considering replacing him and you both think we should let him decide whether or not to do an autopsy we can tell him jordan stanhopes story at the same time alexis said ignoring craig can we get him on the phone and discuss it with him tonight jack asked the decision about whether or not to do the autopsy really cannot wait even if its given a green light i cant be certain it will happen there are too many variables and not a lot of time we can do better than call him alexis said he lives just around the corner fine craig said throwing up his hands he didnt feel strongly enough about it to overrule both alexis and jack but im not going to be the one to call i dont mind calling alexis said she got up and went over to the desk you seem to be feeling better jack said to craig while alexis was using the phone its up and down craig said one minute im depressed and the next minute hopeful that truth will win out its been that way since this mess started back in october yet today had to be one of the worst days hearing bill tardoff testify against me ive always been friendly with the man i really dont understand it is he a good doctor craig glared at jack before saying ask me that in a couple of days at the moment id be giving you an emotional response right now id like to kill the guy i understand jack said and he did what about dr noelle everette does she have a good reputation with me or the hospital community both like with bill my feelings changed after this malpractice suit before i thought she was okay not great but okay and i referred to her on occasion after the suit im as mad at her as i am at bill as far as her general reputation is concerned its fine shes well liked although not so dedicated as most why do you say that she only works halftime officially although its more like threequarters time her excuse is her family which is nonsense i mean we all have families jack nodded as if he agreed but he didnt he thought craig should have given noelles work ethic a try he probably would have been happier and a far better husband and father the reason i asked about noelle everette jack said after a pause is because she said something interesting today she said some of the oldfashioned physicians a group in which she included herself were angry about you concierge doctors does that surprise you not really i think they might be jealous not everybody can switch to a retainer practice it depends a lot on their patient base you mean whether the patient base is wealthy or not thats a big part of it craig admitted concierge practice is an enviable lifestyle compared with the mess standard practice is being put in im making more money in a lot less time what happened to your patients from your old practice who couldnt come up with the retainer fee they were referred to other peoples standard practice so they were in a sense abandoned no not at all we spent a lot of time giving them names and numbers of other doctors to jack it sounded very much like abandonment but he didnt argue instead he said so you see the kind of anger noelle was talking about as stemming from envy i cant think of any other reason jack could think of a number including the concept of professionalism noelle had mentioned but jack wasnt interested in a debate it was the malpractice case he was most interested in so he asked was patience stanhope an old patient of yours from your old practice no she was a patient of the physician who started the concierge practice that im now essentially running hes in florida and not in the best of health so in a sense you inherited her in a sense alexis came back to the table randolph is coming right over hes interested in the autopsy idea but has reservations including its admissibility like i feared jack nodded but he was more interested in his conversation with craig and he had been debating how to word his next question craig remember this morning when i mentioned the idea of smothering or strangulation in relation to patience stanhope which i later realized was ridiculous since she died of a heart attack how could i forget its an example of how medical examiners like me think i mean i wasnt making any allegations of any sort i was kind of thinking out loud trying to relate central cyanosis to the rest of the facts in retrospect you understand dont you at the time you were bothered by the suggestion i understand but im not myself these days for obvious reasons im sorry no need to apologize im bringing it up only because i want to ask you a question which occurred to me when noelle everette made her comment about a group of oldfashioned doctors being angry about concierge doctors its a question you might think outlandish the same way you responded to the mentioning of strangulation and smothering this morning youve piqued my curiosity ask your question can you think of any remotely possible way you could have been set up by patience stanhopes death what im suggesting is that someone might have seen her passing as a way to put concierge medicine in a bad light does this idea resonate at all or am i once again somewhere beyond the orbit of pluto a small smile appeared at the corners of craigs mouth and slowly spread inward until he laughed and shook his head in wonderment what you lack in rationality you certainly make up for in creativity remember it is a rhetorical question i dont expect an answer just tuck it away in the archives of your brain and see if it resonates with any other facts youve not told anyone are you suggesting some kind of conspiracy alexis asked she was as taken aback as craig conspiracy implies more than one jack said like you asked me to do on the phone im thinking out of the box thats way out of the box craig said the doorbell precluded any more talk of malevolent medical machinations which was how craig referred to jacks idea as alexis went to the door when alexis returned with randolph bingham in tow jack and craig were chuckling at other clever names craig was able to conjure up alexis was pleasantly surprised craig was showing more normal behavior than he had in months which was even more unusual considering the stressful day in court jack was reintroduced to randolph the first time had been outside the courtroom that morning before the trial had recommenced there hadnt been much time and alexis whod done the introducing merely said that jack was her brother whereas now she included details of jacks professional qualifications randolph didnt say anything during alexiss monologue although he nodded a few times at key points im pleased to make your acquaintance again he said when alexis concluded likewise jack said he felt there was an unease about the situation randolph was irrepressibly staid although hed changed from his meticulously tailored courtroom suit his idea of relaxed wear was a heavily starched freshly pressed longsleeved white oxford shirt pleated summerweight wool pants with a knifelike crease and a summerweight cashmere sweater as further evidence of his primness he appeared to have shaved in contrast to jack and craig who both had the expected evening stubble and his silver hair was as perfectly styled as it had been in court should we sit here at the table or go into the living room alexis asked as the host wherever youd like randolph said but we must be expeditious i have a lot of preparation yet to do tonight they ended up sitting around the table where theyd been before randolph s arrival alexis has told me about your suggestion of doing an autopsy on the deceased randolph said perhaps you can tell me why this might be important at this eleventh hour to jacks ear he spoke with the true melodiousness that jack associated with elite new england schools and it suddenly occurred to him that randolph was the archetype to which jordan aspired the question of why jordan wanted to do so was another matter since jack found randolph a passionless man a prisoner of his restrained formality jack ran down his short list in favor of an autopsy sans any reference to conspiracy or individually motivated foulplay theories then he gave his patented spiel about the role of a medical examiners talking for the dead in short jack said as a kind of summation i believe an autopsy would afford patience stanhope her last day in court my hope is to find enough pathology to clear craig or worst case provide an argument for contributory negligence since there is documentation the deceased refused a recommended cardiac workup jack looked across at randolph s arcticblue eyes for some response there was none nor was there from his mouth which was a small almost lipless horizontal slash halfway between his nose and the point of his chin any questions jack asked hoping to generate a response i dont believe so randolph said at length youve stated your case succinctly and well it is an intriguing possibility which i had not thought of since the clinical aspects of the case are so clear my biggest concern involves the admissibility of whatever you might find if something were to be found truly relevant and exculpatory i would have to petition the court for a continuance to allow for proper discovery in other words it could be up to the judge couldnt i be called as a surprise rebuttal witness only to refute previous testimony not to offer new testimony i would be refuting the testimony of the plaintiffs experts claiming malpractice its stretching the rule but i see your point it would be up to the judge at any case and hed be ruling over strenuous objections from the plaintiffs attorney it would be an uphill struggle and would afford the plaintiff foundation for appeal if it were granted a final thought that adds to the difficulties of presenting such new evidence is my experience with judge davidson he is known to like to move things along and is already irritated at the slow pace of this trial theres no doubt he wants to bring it to a close he would not look kindly on new evidence brought in at the very last minute jack shrugged and raised his eyebrows questioningly so you are against it not necessarily this is a unique case with unique challenges and we would be foolish not to do everything we possibly can for a positive outcome new exculpatory evidence could be used as the basis to argue for a new trial through appeal on the other hand i believe the chances of finding something exculpatory are slim indeed with that said id come out sixtyforty in favor of doing it so there you have it randolph stood as did the others thank you for inviting me over and briefing me he said shaking hands all around see you all in court as alexis accompanied randolph to the door jack and craig sat back down he fooled me jack said just when i thought he was telling us he was against my doing the autopsy he tells me hes for it i had the same reaction craig said one thing this little meeting made me realize is that i dont think you should change attorneys jack said randolph might be priggish but he strikes me as keenly intelligent and under that gentleman veneer hes a competitor he definitely wants to win thanks for your opinion craig said i wish i unquestioningly shared it alexis returned she acted mildly irritated why didnt you tell him about your runin with tony fasano and the threat he gave you i didnt want to confuse the issue jack said same reason i didnt bring up my wild theories of foul play or the surprising biography of jordan stanhope aka stanislaw jaruzelski i think that threat issue is more important alexis said doesnt that bother you being threatened like that not really tony fasanos worried about his investment since hes surely taken the case on contingency with that said he strikes me as someone who blows a lot of hot air i dont know alexis said it concerns me well folks jack said its time to fish or cut bait am i going to try to do this autopsy or not one thing i havent mentioned from my experience juries use a commonsense gut reaction in their decisionmaking but they like facts autopsy results are facts that they can grasp in contrast to testimony that is ephemeral and open to interpretation try to keep that in mind if you can honestly tell me you are not concerned about tony fasanos threat then ill vote for the autopsy and you craig jack asked youre the principal here your vote can trump the rest of us my feelings havent changed craig said i think theres more chance finding stuff we dont want to know than things we do but im not going to vote against the two of you and randolph he stood up now im going to go up and put myself in the warm and fuzzy hand of a strong hypnotic with the rest of the plaintiff experts jordan stanhope and possibly leona rattner slated to testify its going to be a taxing day tomorrow for a few minutes after craig had disappeared upstairs jack and alexis sat at the table lost in their own thoughts jack was the first to speak after reaching out and picking up the scotch bottle mixing this hard stuff and a strong hypnotic is not a good idea i cant argue with that have you been at all worried about craig injuring himself you mean overdosing yes either intentionally or otherwise jack could remember his own struggles with selfdestructive thoughts during his years of fighting depression of course ive thought about it but thats one aspect of narcissism in his favor the devotees generally dont hurt themselves also his depression has been far from incapacitating and he has been cycling regularly through periods of normalcy like tonight for instance he probably wouldnt admit it but i think you have raised his spirits by being here it means you care and he respects you thats nice but whats he been taking for sleep do you know just the usual ive kept close tabs im embarrassed to say ive even been counting the pills behind his back you shouldnt be embarrassed thats being prudent whatever alexis said she stood up i think ill head upstairs check on the girls and turn in myself i hate to abandon you but if leona rattner testifies tomorrow its going to be particularly taxing for me too no problem jack said he got to his feet as well im tired myself although i want to read over some of the depositions again i keep thinking i might be missing something that would be key to keep in mind if and when i do the autopsy i certainly dont envy you working on someone whos been buried for almost a year how do you do this kind of work day in day out isnt it repulsive i know it sounds unpleasant maybe even ghoulish but its actually fascinating i learn something every day and i dont have any problem patients dont remind me about problem patients alexis said talk about selfinflicted wounds thats a prime example the silence of the big house settled over jack after alexis said good night and climbed the stairs for a few minutes he reflected on alexiss curiously emotional response to patience stanhope being a problem patient and how alexis was willing to say she was glad patience was gone shed even alluded to thinking that patience stanhope had had something to do with craigs moving out jack shook his head he didnt know what to think instead he finished the beer hed been nursing then went down to his room to retrieve the case file and his cell phone with those in hand he made his way back to the study where hed inadvertently spent the night the room had a comfortable familiar feel after getting himself situated in the same reading chair hed been in the night before jack flipped open his cell phone he felt ambivalence about calling laurie he wanted to hear her voice but he was not excited about dealing with her inevitable resentment when he told her about the possible exhumation and autopsy it was already tuesday night which meant there were only two more full days before friday the other problem was that jack had phoned calvin during the day to say he wasnt going to be at the ocme on wednesday and that hed keep him informed there was a chance calvin had said something to laurie so shed be miffed hearing things secondhand as the call went through jack wiggled to get as comfortable as possible and his eyes swept over the shelving that filed the opposite wall his line of sight stopped on a large black oldfashioned doctors bag next to a portable ecg machine the busy traveler at last laurie said brightly i was hoping it would be you jack launched into an immediate apology for calling late but explained that he wanted to wait until a decision had been made what kind of decision jack took a breath a decision to do an autopsy on the patient whose death is the basis of craigs lawsuit an autopsy laurie questioned with consternation jack this is tuesday night the wedding is one thirty on friday i dont have to tell you thats right around the corner i know theres a time crunch here im keeping it in mind dont worry are you doing the autopsy in the morning i dont think so but theres a chance i suppose the problem is that the body is still in the ground jack laurie whined pulling out his name like taffy why are you doing this to me jack gave laurie the details of the case everything hed learned from the file and then everything that had happened that day sans the episode with franco laurie listened without interrupting until jack was finished then she completely surprised jack she said would you like me to fly up and assist you with the case wishing he could reach across the miles and give her a hug of appreciation jack said thank you for your offer but theres no need it will not be a difficult case unless theres been a lot of water intrusion let me know im certain as a team we could do it quickly after a bit of loving small talk and a promise to call as soon as he knew more jack flipped his phone closed he was about to pull the case file into his lap when his eyes again spotted the doctors bag jack got up and went over to the shelf as he had implied to alexis he didnt think house calls were an appropriate use of a doctors time since they were limited to what could be done without the diagnostic tools available in a wellequipped doctors office but remembering the reference in the case file about a bedside assay kit for biomarkers to confirm heart attack the thought passed through his mind that he might be outdated in truth jack had not even heard about such a kit and was curious to see one he pulled the bag from the shelf and placed it on craigs desk he turned on the goosenecked lamp and opened the bag it opened like a fishing tackle box with a number of small chockfull compartments in trays on the top that opened to the sides below was the main space with a collection of instruments including bloodpressure cuff ophthalmoscope and otoscope jack pulled out the ophthalmoscope just holding the instrument brought back a flood of memories replacing the ophthalmoscope jack looked through the plethora of other material including iv fluid iv lines thermometer emergency medication hemostats culture media and bandages in the bottom far corner of the bag he found the biomarker kit he pulled it out and read the exterior hoping for an insert that might be more informative he opened the box the insert was directly on top after reading the insert jack realized hed have to reassess his evaluation of house calls with such products including new and accurate ways of determining diabetic status a physician could be quite effective in a home environment especially with the portable ecg machine jack had seen next to the doctors bag jack replaced the insert and then the biomarker assay kit when he did so he noticed some debris including an empty atropine vial and an empty epinephrine vial he wondered if they could have been from the time craig had been treating patience stanhope from the record both medications had been used then jack found something that made him sure they were he found a small sample bottle of the antidepressant zoloft with patience stanhopes name and the notation one pill at hour of sleep jack opened the bottle and glanced in at the five pale blue tablets replacing the lid jack put the bottle back next he lifted out the atropine and epinephrine vials both were empty hearing what he thought were footsteps coming down the front steps caused jack a pang of guilt about snooping into private property even if just in a doctors bag it was a clear violation of the trust extended to him as a guest with a bit of panic he quickly replaced the vials closed the bag and jammed it back onto the shelf he dashed across the room leaped back into the club chair and pulled the casefile material onto his lap it was none too soon craig shuffled into the study a few moments later he was dressed in a bathrobe with openbacked slippers on his feet he went over and sat in the other reading chair i hope im not disturbing you he said dont be silly jack answered he couldnt help notice that craigs voice had a monotone that hadnt been there when hed gone upstairs and that when hed walked in his arms had hung limply at his sides as though they were paralyzed it was abundantly clear the man had already taken his sleep medication and hadnt skimped on the dose i just wanted to say thank you for coming up here to boston i know i wasnt much of a host last night and this morning no problem i have a good sense of what youre going through i also wanted to say that im behind the autopsy idea after giving it additional thought that makes it unanimous now after convincing everybody i can only hope i can pull it off well i appreciate your efforts he struggled back to a standing position and wobbled before gaining his balance i glanced in your doctors bag jack said to clear his conscience i hope you dont mind of course not do you need something back when i was making a lot of house calls i amassed a small pharmacy no i was curious about the biomarker kit for heart attacks i never knew they existed its hard to keep up with technology good night good night jack said from where he was sitting he could see down the lengthy hall as craig plodded toward the stairs he was moving like a zombie for the first time jack started to feel sorry for the man newton massachusetts wednesday june am the morning routine was as chaotic as it had been the previous morning including another disagreement between meghan and christina over an article of apparel jack never knew what it was but the tables had been turned now it was meghan denying christina resulting in christina rushing back upstairs in tears alexis was the only one acting normally it was as if she were the glue holding the family together craig was somnolent and spoke little apparently still feeling the effects of his sleeping medication on top of his scotch after the kids had left for school alexis turned to jack what do you want to do about transportation do you want to come with us or drive yourself ive got to drive myself my first stop is the langleypeerson funeral home ive got to get the signed papers over there to start the exhumation process what he didnt say was that he hoped to get in a little basketball in the late afternoon then well see you in the courtroom thats my intention jack said although he harbored a hope that harold langley could work miracles and get patience stanhope out of her eternal resting place that very morning if that could happen then jack could do the autopsy have the gross results by that afternoon present them to craig and alexis and be on the shuttle back to new york that would give him thursday to wrap things up in his office prior to the honeymoon that was to begin on saturday morning it would also give him the opportunity to pick up the tickets and hotel vouchers jack left before alexis and craig he got into his rentacar and headed for the massachusetts turnpike he had assumed that having already visited the langleypeerson funeral home it would be easy to find it again unfortunately he was wrong it took him almost forty minutes of highly aggravating driving to cover approximately five miles as the crow flew muttering obscenities to himself over the stressful experience jack finally pulled into the funeral homes parking lot it was more crowded that the previous day forcing jack to park at the very back when he got around to the front of the building there were people milling about on the porch it was at that point that he guessed a service was about to get under way his suspicions were confirmed when he entered the foyer in the viewing room to the right people were scurrying about arranging flowers and unfolding additional chairs on the catafalque was an open coffin with its occupant comfortably resting the same pious soundtrack as the day before inundated the scene would you care to sign the book a man asked in a quiet sympathetic voice in many respects he was a significantly heavier version of harold langley im looking for the funeral director i am the funeral director mr locke peerson at your service jack mentioned he was looking for mr langley and was directed back to harolds office he found the man at his desk the current mr stanhope has signed the authorization jack said wasting no time with small talk he handed over the form now its a matter of utmost urgency to get the body back here to your embalming room we have a service this morning harold said after that ill get on it do you see any chance of it happening today were really up against a strict deadline dr stapleton do you not remember that the city the vault company a backhoe operator and the cemetery are all involved in this endeavor under normal conditions were talking about a week at least it cannot be a week jack said emphatically its got to be today or tomorrow at the very latest jack shuddered at the implication of having to wait until thursday and wondered what he could tell laurie thats an impossibility perhaps an extra five hundred dollars on top of your usual fee is in order to make up for the inconvenience jack watched harolds expression he had an almost parkinsonian lack of mobility and a pair of narrow lips that recalled randolph s all i can say is that i will give the affair my utmost effort there can be no promises i cant ask for anything more jack said while giving harold one of his business cards by the way do you have any idea of what condition we can expect the body to be in absolutely harold said emphatically the body should be in pristine condition it was embalmed with our usual care and the coffin is a topoftheline perpetual repose mated with a premier cement vault what about the grave site much water none its on the crest of the hill the original mr stanhope had picked it out himself for the family call me as soon as you know something i most certainly will as jack left the funeral home the people on the porch had begun somberly filing in jack got into his car and consulted his map which had been significantly upgraded by alexis who had laughed when shed heard hed been trying to navigate around the city with the rentacar map jacks next destination was back to the medical examiners office thanks to significantly less traffic jack was able to make the journey in comparatively short time the receptionist remembered him she told him that dr wylie was definitely in the autopsy room on this occasion and she took it upon herself without being asked to call down and talk with her the result was that a mortuary tech came up to reception and escorted jack down to the autopsy anteroom two men in mufti were milling about one was africanamerican the other caucasian the caucasian was a big redfaced irishman everyone else was in tyvek protective gear jack was to learn a few minutes later that the men were detectives interested in the case latasha wylie was doing jack was given gear and after suiting up he pushed into the room like the rest of the facility the autopsy room was stateoftheart and made the new york room look like an anachronism in comparison there were five tables three of which were in operation latashas was the farthest away and she waved for him to come over im almost finished latasha said behind her plastic face mask i thought you might like to take a look what do you have jack asked he was always interested its a fiftynineyearold female found dead in her bedroom after having been visited by a man she met on the internet the bedroom was in disarray suggesting a struggle with the bedside table upended and the bedside lamp broken the two detectives waiting out in the dressing area are thinking homicide the woman had a gash on her forehead at her hairline latasha pulled the womans scalp down from where it had been reflected over the face to gain access to the brain jack bent down to look at the laceration it was round and punched in as if delivered by a hammer latasha went on to describe how she had been able to reconstruct what turned out to be an accident and not a homicide the woman had slipped on a small throw rug on the polished wood flooring and had collided with the bedside table hitting her forehead on the lamps finial with the full force of her body weight the case turned out to be an example of how important knowledge of the scene was it seemed that the lamps finial was a rather tall spire ending in a flat disc that resembled a hammerhead jack was impressed and told latasha so all in a days work she said what can i do for you i want to take you up on your offer of autopsy supplies it appears that it is a go provided they can be expeditious getting the body out of the ground im going to do it at the langleypeerson funeral home if you end up doing it after hours id be willing to help and i could bring a bone saw really jack questioned hed not expected such generosity id be happy to have your help sounds like a challenging case let me introduce you to our chief dr kevin carson the chief who was doing a case on table number one turned out to be a tall lanky pleasant individual with a southern accent who mentioned he was on a firstname basis with jacks chief dr harold bingham he said latasha had told him about what jack was trying to do and he supported her offer to process specimens and help with toxicology if needed he said they did not yet do their own toxicology but had access to a superb twentyfourseven facility at the university you tell harold hello from boston kevin said before going back to his case i certainly will jack responded although the man was already bent over the body in front of him and thanks for your assistance he seems like a pleasant chief jack said as he and latasha went out into the anteroom hes very personable latasha agreed fifteen minutes later jack stashed a box of autopsy supplies in the trunk of his accent moving his basketball gear out of the way in the process he also slipped latashas card with cell phone number into his wallet before climbing in behind the steering wheel although alexis had suggested another parking facility near faneuil hall jack was content to return to the one beneath the boston common since it was easier for him to find he also enjoyed the walk skirting the massachusetts state house pushing into the courtroom jack tried to let the door close as silently as possible behind him at that moment the court clerk was swearing in a witness jack had heard the name it was dr herman brown as he stood by the door jacks eyes scanned the room he saw the backs of craigs and jordans heads along with those of their attorneys and the attorneys associates the jury seemed as bored as they had the day before while the judge appeared preoccupied he was shuffling papers glancing at them and reorganizing them as if he were alone in the room jacks eyes scanned the spectators and immediately locked onto francos from the distance francos eye sockets appeared like featureless black holes beneath his neanderthallike brow against his better judgment jack smiled and waved he knew it was foolish since he was taunting the man but jack was unable to stop himself it was a reemergence of the risktaking mentality that he had glommed on to for a number of years as a juvenile coping mechanism for his guilt about surviving his family jack thought he saw the man tense but he could not be certain franco continued to scowl at him for several beats longer but then shifted his gaze when his boss scraped his chair back from the plaintiffs table and headed toward the podium berating himself for deliberately provoking the man jack thought about finding a hardware store and buying some pepper spray if there was to be a second confrontation jack had no intention of trading blows again their difference in size made that an unfair exchange jack returned to scanning the spectators once again he was taken by the number he wondered how many were the proverbial courtroom junkies vicariously thrilled by people receiving their comeuppance particularly the wealthy and powerful as a successful doctor craig was fair game finally jack found alexis she was sitting in the first row over against the wall close to the jury box next to her seemed to be one of the few empty seats jack walked down to the bar and then by excusing himself he stepped into the aisle alexis saw him coming and moved her belongings to make room jack gave her shoulder a squeeze before sitting down any luck alexis whispered progress i hope but its now out of my hands whats been happening here more of the same im afraid it was a slow start since the judge had to deal with some arcane legal stuff the first witness was dr noelle everette that couldnt have been good it wasnt she came across as a superbly trained thoughtful and sensitive professional with the added benefit that shes from the community and was involved in the resuscitation attempt tony handled it well im sorry to say the way he questioned her and the way she answered kept the jurors attention i even saw the three homemakers nodding at one point not a good sign her testimony was essentially the same as dr william tardoffs but to me more effective she comes off like the doctor everyone wishes they had how was randolph on cross not as effective as he was with dr tardoff but personally i couldnt see how he could be considering how well dr everette came across i had the feeling he just wanted to get her off the stand that might have been the best stratagem jack said did the issue of concierge medicine come up oh yeah randolph tried to object but judge davidson is letting it all in did the issue of cyanosis come up no why do you ask it continues to be a nettle in my brain it will be one of the prime things on my mind when and if i do the autopsy a sixth sense made jack turn around and look across the room at franco the man was again glaring at jack with an expression that hovered between a grimace and a cruel smile on a positive note from the angle in which jack was looking he could see that the left hand side of francos face was as red as jacks so far things were apparently equal settling back on the rockhard oak pew jack directed his attention to the proceedings tony was at the podium while dr herman brown was in the witness box in front of the bench the court reporters fingers were playing incessantly on her small machine to create a verbatim record tony was having the witness testify to his impressive academic and clinical credentials and it had been going on for a quarter of an hour as chief of cardiology at the boston memorial hospital he also occupied the chair of the department of cardiology at harvard medical school randolph had stood on several occasions and offered to stipulate as to the witnesss qualifications as an expert to save the courts time but tony had persisted he was trying to impress the jury and it was working it became increasingly apparent to everyone that it would be hard to find a witness more qualified in cardiology or even equivalently qualified the mans appearance and bearing added to his image there was a boston brahmin aura that was similar to randolph s but without the hint of disdain and condescension instead of cold and distant he appeared kind and gentle the sort of person who would go out of his way to put a baby bird back into its nest his hair was grandfatherly white and well groomed his posture straight his clothes were neat but not overly elegant and they had a comfortable livedin look he wore a paisley bow tie there was even a hint of selfdeprecation as tony had to work to get the man to admit reluctantly to his awards and accomplishments why is this medical olympian testifying for the plaintiff in a malpractice trial jack whispered to alexis but it was more of a rhetorical question and he didnt expect an answer he began to wonder if the reason had something to do with noelle everettes unexpected comment about concierge medicine when she had said some of us oldfashioned physicians are angry about concierge doctors maybe dr brown was one of that group because the concept of concierge medicine flew in the face of the new professionalism that academia was trying to espouse and more than anyone else at the trial dr herman brown was representing academia dr brown tony fasano said gripping the sides of the lectern with his short thick fingers before we get to patience stanhopes unfortunate and avoidable death objection randolph said emphatically there has been no establishment that mrs stanhopes death was avoidable sustained judge davidson declared rephrase before we get to patience stanhopes unfortunate death id like to ask you if youve had previous contact with the defendant dr craig bowman i have can you explain the nature of your contact to the jury objection your honor randolph said with exasperation immaterial or if it is material in some unfathomable way then i object to dr brown as an expert witness for bias counsels approach the bench please judge davidson said tony and randolph dutifully grouped at the side of the judges bench im going to be very upset if we have a repeat of monday judge davidson said youre both experienced lawyers behave as such you both know the rules as to the current line of questioning mr fasano am i to assume you have a relevant rationale for your current line of questioning absolutely your honor the core of the plaintiffs case revolves about dr bowmans attitude toward his patients in general and patience stanhope in particular i call to the courts attention the deprecatory pp classification dr brown has the ability to provide some insight into the development of these traits during dr bowmans critical third year in medical school and during his residency training subsequent testimony will relate them directly to the case of patience stanhope okay i will allow this line of questioning judge davidson said but i want it related quickly to establish its relevance am i clear about that perfectly clear your honor tony said unable to suppress a slight smile of satisfaction dont look so goddamned pained judge davidson said to randolph your objection has been recorded my judgment provided mr fasano is being totally honest about relevancy is that the probative value will outweigh the prejudicial i admit it is a judgment call but thats why im here in return i will grant the defense wide leniency on crossexamination as for the question of bias theres been ample opportunity to determine that during discovery and it wasnt but the issue can be examined on cross and i want the pace to pick up judge davidson said ive allocated this week for this trial and here it is wednesday already for the sake of the jurors and my schedule i want it to conclude on friday unless there are some particularly extenuating circumstances both lawyers nodded randolph repaired to his seat at the defense table while tony returned to the podium objection overruled judge davidson called out proceed dr brown tony said after clearing his throat would you tell the jury the nature of your contact with dr craig bowman my first contact was as his preceptor at boston memorial hospital on his internalmedicine rotation during his third year of medical school could you explain what this means since no one in this wonderful jury went to medical school tony made a sweeping gesture down the line of jurors some of whom nodded in agreement everyone was paying rapt attention except for the plumbers assistant who was focusing on his nails internal medicine is the most important rotation and the most demanding during the third year and perhaps for the entire four years it is the first time the students have prolonged contact with the patients from the patients admission to their discharge and they participate in the diagnosis and therapy under strict observation and supervision by the resident house staff and by the preceptor was this preceptor group that included dr bowman a large group or a small group a small group six students to be exact the teaching is intense so you as the preceptor see the students on a regular basis every day so you can observe the overall performance of each student very much so it is a critical time in the students life and it marks the beginning of the individuals transformation from a student to a physician so that attitudes that are observed or develop are important exceedingly so and how do you rate your responsibility as a preceptor visavis attitudes again exceedingly important as a preceptor we have to balance the explicit attitudes toward patients as promulgated by the medical school versus the implicit attitudes often exhibited by the overworked and stressed house staff theres a difference tony questioned with exaggerated disbelief can you explain the difference the amount of knowledge medical trainees must assimilate and have immediate recall of is staggering and increasing every year as pressed as residents are they can sometimes lose sight of the ultimate humanistic aspects of what they are doing and which form the basis of professionalism there are also defensive coping mechanisms in the face of suffering dying and death that are not healthy tony shook his head in bewilderment let me ask you if i have this correct in simplified terms there can be a tendency on the part of medical trainees to devalue individual people like losing sight of the trees by paying too much attention to the forest i suppose dr brown said but it is important not to trivialize this issue well all try tony said with a short chuckle which brought a few tentative smiles from the jurors now lets get back to the defendant dr craig bowman how did he do during his rotation in thirdyear internal medicine generally excellent in the group of six students he was far and away the most knowledgeable and the most prepared i was often astonished at his recall i remember one episode of asking what a patients bun was the bun is a laboratory test tony asked yes i asked it more as a rhetorical question to emphasize that knowledge of kidney function was key in the treatment of the patients condition dr bowman rattled if off without hesitation making me wonder if he had made it up a frequent medical student ploy to cover unpreparedness later i looked it up it was exactly right so dr bowman got a good grade for the course he got an a yet you qualified excellent by saying generally excellent i did can you tell us why i had a nagging feeling which i again got while supervising dr bowman when he was a resident at the boston memorial hospital and what was this feeling i had the impression that his personality objection randolph called out foundation the witness is neither a psychiatrist or psychologist overruled judge davidson said as a physician the witness has had exposure to those fields the amount of which can be challenged on cross the witness may proceed it was my impression that dr bowmans desire to succeed and his lionization of our then chief resident made him view patients as a means to compete he actively sought out the most difficult patients so his presentations were intellectually the most interesting and achieved the widest acclaim in other words it was your impression dr bowman saw patients as a way to further his career essentially yes and that kind of attitude is not consistent with the current concept of professionalism thats correct thank you doctor tony said he paused and looked from one juror to another making eye contact with each allowing the testimony to sink in jack leaned over toward alexis and whispered now i understand what you said about tony fasano this guy is good now hes putting academic medicine and its inherent competitiveness on trial along with concierge medicine whats bothering me is that hes changing craigs successes into a liability in anticipation of randolph trying to do the opposite when tony recommenced his questioning he zeroed in on the patience stanhope episode with a vengeance in short order he got dr brown to testify how important it was to begin treatment for victims of a heart attack absolutely as soon as possible and that from reviewing the records that patiences chances of survival had substantially diminished due to craigs delay in confirming the diagnosis just a few more questions dr brown tony said are you acquainted with dr william tardoff yes i am are you aware he trained at boston university i am and likewise are you acquainted with dr noelle everette and are you aware that she trained at tufts i am on both accounts does it surprise you that three cardiology experts from our areas three prestigious medical schools all concur that dr craig bowman did not meet the standard of care in relation to patience stanhope it does not it merely shows unanimity on the issue of the need for rapid treatment of heart attack victims thank you doctor no more questions tony picked up his papers from the lectern and walked back to the plaintiffs table both his assistant and jordan acknowledged his performance with pats on the arm randolph slowly stood to his commanding height and approached the podium he adjusted his jacket and put one of his heavy thicksoled wingtip lawyer shoes on the rail dr brown randolph began i agree that there is unanimity on the need of treating heart attack victims as soon as possible in an appropriately equipped facility however that is not the issue before the court the issue involves whether or not dr bowman met the standard of care insisting on going to the stanhope residence rather than meeting the victim at the hospital caused a delay but prior to dr bowmans arrival at the stanhope residence there was not a definitive diagnosis according to the plaintiffs testimony at deposition dr bowman told him his wife was having a heart attack that was the plaintiffs testimony randolph said but it was the defendants testimony that he specifically said a heart attack must be ruled out he did not categorically say patience stanhope was having what you doctors call a myocardial infarction or mi if there had not been a heart attack there would not have been a delay is that not true that is true but she had a heart attack thats been documented it was also in the record she had a questionable stress test but my point is that dr bowman did not know for certain patience had had an mi randolph said and he will testify to that in this court but let us turn our attention to your earlier testimony about medical school let me ask you if you got an a in your thirdyear rotation on internal medicine i did did all your fellow students in your preceptor group get as no they did not did they all want to get as i suppose how do you get into medical school must you routinely get as in your premedical curriculum of course and how do you get the most coveted residencies like at the boston memorial hospital by getting as is it not hypocritical for academicians to decry competition as antihumanistic and yet base the whole system upon it they do not have to be mutually exclusive perhaps in the best of worlds but reality is something different competition does not breed compassion in any field as you eloquently testified medical students must absorb a staggering amount of information which is what they are graded on and one further question in this regard in your experience both as a student and as a preceptor is there competition for the quote most interesting patients rather than the routine degenerative afflictions i guess there is and thats because their presentations gather the most acclaim i suppose which suggests that all of the students but particularly the top students to a degree use the patients both to learn from and advance their careers perhaps thank you doctor randolph said now lets turn to the issue of medical house calls what is your professional impression of house calls they are of limited value one doesnt have access to the tools that are necessary to practice twentyfirstcentury medicine so doctors generally are not in favor of house calls would you agree i would besides the lack of equipment it represents an inappropriate utilization of resources since there is too much downtime traveling to and from the home in the same time frame many more patients could be seen so it is inefficient yes you could say that what is the opinion of patients about house calls objection tony called out semirising from his chair hearsay judge davidson snapped off his reading glasses and glared down at tony with irritable disbelief overruled he snapped as a patient which we all are at some point dr brown would be talking from experience proceed would you like me to repeat my question randolph asked no dr brown said he hesitated patients generally like house calls how do you think patience stanhope felt about house calls objection tony said rising again supposition theres no way the witness would know how the deceased felt about house calls sustained judge davidson said with a sigh i assume you read the medical records supplied to the plaintiff yes i read them so you are aware that dr bowman made many house calls to tend to patience stanhope prior to the evening in question often in the middle of the night from reading these records what was the usual diagnosis on these visits anxiety reaction manifesting itself mostly in gastrointestinal complaints and the treatment symptomatic and placebo was pain ever involved yes where was the pain mostly low abdominal but occasionally midepigastric pain in the latter location is occasionally reported as chest pain is that correct yes thats correct from your reading of the record would you say that patience stanhope exhibited at least some evidence of hypochondriasis objection tony called out but stayed in his chair hypochondriasis is never mentioned in the record overruled judge davidson said the court would like to remind the plaintiffs attorney that the witness is his medical expert from reading the record i believe it would be a safe assumption that some element of hypochondriasis was involved does the fact that dr bowman made repeated house calls which you have said most doctors do not favor often in the middie of the night to a woman with avowed hypochondriasis say something to you as a physician about dr bowmans attitude and compassion for his patients no it does not randolph stiffened with surprise and his eyebrows rose your response defies rationality can you explain it is my understanding that house calls are one of the perquisites that patients expect when they pay high retainer fees sometimes as high as twenty thousand dollars a year to be part of a concierge medical practice under such a circumstance one cannot say dr bowmans making house calls necessarily reflects beneficence or altruism but it might yes it might tell me dr brown are you biased against concierge medicine of course im biased against concierge medicine dr brown sputtered up until that moment he had maintained a detached coolness not too dissimilar to randolph s it was clear that randolph s questions had challenged him can you tell the court why you feel so strongly dr brown took a breath to calm himself concierge medicine flies in the face of one of the three basic principles of medical professionalism perhaps you could elaborate of course dr brown said lapsing into his familiar professional role besides patient welfare and patient autonomy the principle of social justice is a key underpinning of twentyfirstcentury medical professionalism the practice of concierge medicine is the absolute opposite of trying to eliminate discrimination in health care which is the key issue of social justice do you believe that your strong feelings in this regard might compromise your ability to be impartial concerning dr bowman i do not perhaps you could tell us why since to use your words it flies in the face of rationality as a wellinformed internist dr bowman knows that the symptoms women experience with myocardial infarction do not follow the classic symptoms experienced by men as soon as an internist thinks about a heart attack in a female particularly a postmenopausal female he should act as if it were a heart attack until proven otherwise theres a parallel in pediatrics if the thought of meningitis occurs to a physician with a pediatric patient the physician is obligated to proceed as if it is and do a spinal tap same with a female and a possible heart attack dr bowman suspected a heart attack and he should have acted accordingly dr brown randolph said it is often said that medicine is more of an art than a science can you tell us what that means it means that factual information is not enough a doctor must use his judgment as well and since this is not an objective arena that can be studied it is labeled an art so scientific medical knowledge has its limits exactly no two humans are exactly the same even identical twins would you say that the situation dr bowman faced on the evening of september eighth when he was called to see for the second time in the same day a woman whom he knew was hypochondriacal called for a large measure of judgment all medical situations call for judgment im asking specifically about the evening in question yes it would have called for a large measure of judgment thank you doctor randolph said gathering up his notes no more questions the witness may be excused judge davidson said then turning to the jurors he added it is nearing the noon hour and it looks to me as if you could all use some sustenance i know i could remember not to discuss the case with anyone or among yourselves he cracked the gavel courts adjourned until one thirty all rise the court officer called out as the judge stepped down from the bench and disappeared into his chambers boston massachusetts wednesday june pm alexis craig and jack had found a small noisy sandwich shop that looked out onto the broad government center esplanade randolph had been invited but hed begged off claiming he had preparation to do it was a beautiful latespring day and the esplanade was full of people escaping from their confining offices for a bit of sunshine and fresh air boston struck jack as an outdoor city much more so than new york craig had been his usual brooding self at first but had begun to relax and join the conversation you havent mentioned the autopsy craig said suddenly whats the status its in the hands of a funeral director at the moment jack said hes got to take the paperwork to the health department and arrange for opening the grave and transporting the coffin so its still a go we are trying jack said earlier i was hoping it might happen this afternoon but since theres been no word i guess well have to aim for tomorrow the judge wants the case to go to the jury on friday craig said discouragingly tomorrow might be too late i hate to put you through all this effort for nothing maybe it is futile alexis agreed dejectedly maybe it is all for nothing jack looked from one to the other hey come on you guys i dont see it for nothing it gives me the sense im doing something and besides im interested the more i think about the cyanosis issue why exactly alexis questioned explain it to me again dont get him started craig said i dont want to raise any false hopes lets analyze this mornings proceedings i didnt think you wanted to talk about it alexis said with some surprise actually id rather forget about it but unfortunately i dont have that luxury if were going to make any changes both craig and alexis eyed jack expectantly what is this jack questioned with a wry smile looking from one to the other an interrogation why me you can be the most objective of all of us alexis said thats obvious how do you feel randolph is doing now that youve seen more of him in action craig asked im worried i dont want to lose this case and not just because there was no negligence involved my reputation will be in the gutter that last witness had been my preceptor in medical school as he said and my attending as a resident i worshipped that guy and still do professionally i can understand how devastating and humiliating this has to be jack replied with that said i think randolph is doing a good job he neutralized most of what tony established with dr brown so i suppose i have to say from what i saw this morning it was a wash the problem is that tony is more entertaining but thats not enough to switch attorneys in midstream what randolph didnt neutralize was dr browns powerful analogy about a pediatric patient and meningitis hes right because that is the way you have to respond to a postmenopausal female when you even think she might be having a heart attack women dont have the same symptoms as men in a surprising number of cases maybe i screwed up because a heart attack did pass through my mind secondguessing oneself is a rampant tendency in physicians in every case of adverse outcome jack reminded craig its especially so when theres alleged malpractice the reality is you bent over backward with this woman who was actually taking advantage of you i know its not politically correct to say that but it is true with all her false alarms calling you out in the middle of the night theres no wonder your index of suspicion of real illness would have been down in the lower basement thank you craig said with his shoulders sagging it means a lot to me to hear you say that the trouble is randolph must make the jury understand that thats it in a nutshell and keep in mind randolph hasnt presented his case you have your own experts who are willing to testify to exactly what i outlined craig took a deep breath and let it out noisily he nodded a few times youre right i cant give up but tomorrow ill have to testify i would think you would be looking forward to it jack said you are the one more than anyone else who knows exactly what happened and when i understand that perfectly well craig said the problem is i despise tony fasano so much i have trouble keeping my cool youve read the deposition he got to me randolph advised me not to appear arrogant i appeared arrogant randolph advised me not to get into an argument i got into an argument randolph advised me not to get angry i got angry randolph advised me only to answer each question i flew off on a tangent trying to justify honest mistakes i was terrible and im afraid it might happen all over again im not good at this consider your deposition a learning experience jack said and remember the deposition lasted two days the judge will not allow that hes the one who wants this trial brought to an end by friday i suppose it boils down to the fact that i dont trust myself craig said the one good aspect of this whole damn affair is that it has forced me to look at myself in the proverbial mirror the reason tony fasano got me to appear arrogant is because i am arrogant i know its not politically correct to say so but i am the best doctor i know ive had confirmation in so many different ways ive always been one of the best students if not the best throughout my training and ive become addicted to acclaim i want to hear it which is why the reverse like what im hearing throughout this malpractice ordeal is so goddamn distressing and humiliating craig fell silent after his outburst both alexis and jack were dumbfounded and momentarily speechless the waiter came over and bused away the dirty dishes alexis and jack glanced briefly at each other and went back to staring wideeyed at craig somebody say something craig demanded alexis spread her hands palms up and shook her head i dont quite know what to say i dont know whether to respond emotionally or professionally try professionally i think i need the reality check im in free fall here and you know why ill tell you why when i went to college and worked my balls off i thought it sucked but that once i got into medical school id be home free well medical school sucked too so i looked forward to residency youre probably getting the picture well residency was no picnic yet around the corner was opening my practice thats when reality really set in thanks to insurance companies and managed care and all the bullshit that has to be endured jack looked at alexis he could tell she was struggling with what to say to these sudden revelations but he was hoping shed come up with something since he was incapable he was shocked by craigs monologue psychology was not his forte by any stretch of the imagination thered been a time when it was all he could do to hold himself together your insight is dramatic alexis began dont give me any patronizing bullshit craig snapped believe me im not alexis said im impressed truly what you are trying to communicate is that your romantic nature has been constantly suffering disillusionment as reality has failed to meet your idealized expectations every time you get to a goal it was not what you thought it would be thats tragic craig rolled his eyes that sounds like bullshit to me its not alexis insisted think about it craig pressed his lips together and knitted his brows for a long moment okay he said finally it does make sense yet it seems like a damn convoluted way of saying things just havent quite worked out but then again ive never been up on psychologyspeak you have been struggling with some conflicts alexis continued its not been easy for you oh really craig said with a touch of superciliousness now dont get defensive alexis urged you specifically asked for my professional response youre right sorry let me hear the conflicts the easiest one is your conflict between clinical medicine and research medicine that has caused you some anxiety in the past because of your need to apply yourself one hundred percent in any pursuit but in this case youve been able to strike a balance a more problematic conflict is between devoting yourself to your practice or devoting yourself to your family this has caused a lot of anxiety craig stared back at alexis but remained silent for obvious reasons i cannot be objective alexis continued what id like to do is encourage you to explore these insights of yours with a professional individual i dont like to ask for help craig said i know but even that attitude says something that might be valuable for you to explore alexis turned to jack do you want to add anything jack raised his hands nope this is an arena im not good at actually what he was thinking was that hed been struggling with his own conflicts namely whether to start a new family with laurie as he was scheduled to do come friday for many years hed said no he didnt deserve to be happy and that another family would demean his first but then as the years had gone by it had changed to a fear of putting laurie at risk jack had struggled with the admittedly irrational fear that his loving someone put them in jeopardy the conversation took a lighter turn and jack seized the moment to excuse himself to use his phone walking out onto the bricked esplanade he dialed the ocme he had meant to leave a message with calvins secretary his hope was that calvin would be out of the office at lunch unfortunately that wasnt the case it was the secretary who was out to lunch calvin answered the phone when the hell are you getting yourself back here calvin demanded when he heard jacks voice its looking bad jack said he then had to hold the phone away from his ear while calvin cursed and carried on about jacks irresponsibility after jack heard what the hell are you doing anyway he put the phone back to his ear and explained the proposed autopsy he told calvin about being introduced to the boston chief medical examiner dr kevin carson really how is that old southern boy calvin questioned seemed fine to me he was in the middle of a case when i met him so we chatted only briefly did he ask for me oh yeah jack lied he said to say hello well tell him hello from me if you see him again and then get back here i dont have to tell you that youve got laurie all up in arms with the big day just around the corner youre not going to try to rush down here at the last minute are you of course not jack said he knew that calvin was one of the people from the office shed insisted on inviting if it had been up to him he wouldnt have invited anyone other than chet his office mate the office already knew too much about their private life after finding craig and alexis whom jack joined for a short stroll in the sunshine they returned to the courthouse when they arrived outside the courtroom other people were just filing in it was quarter after one they followed suit craig went through the bar with randolph and his assistant jordan stanhope was already at the plaintiffs table with tony fasano and renee relf jack guessed that tony was giving jordan lastminute advice before his testimony although the sound of his voice was lost in the general babble of the room his lips were moving rapidly and he was gesticulating with both hands i have a nagging suspicion this is going to be pure theater this afternoon jack said as they worked their way into the same row theyd occupied that morning alexis had said she liked to be near the jurors to watch their expressions and gestures at that moment the jurors had yet to be brought in im afraid you are right alexis said taking her seat and putting her bag down on the floor in front of her jack sat down and adjusted himself as best he could on the unforgiving oak his eyes wandered aimlessly around the courtroom taking in the bookcase filled with law books behind the judges bench within the well was a blackboard on wheels in addition to the plaintiffs and defendants tables all of which stood on a speckled carpet when jacks eyes moved all the way to the right to take in the court officers box they overshot their mark once again he found himself confronting francos beadyeyed stare in contrast with the morning and thanks to the suns current position jack could now see the mans eyes within their deep sockets they were like two gleaming black marbles jack felt the urge to wave again but rationality prevailed hed had his fun that morning being overly provocative made no sense whatsoever did you find craigs comments at lunch as surprising as i did alexis questioned happy to break off with franco jack swung around to face his sister i think astounding would be a better word i dont mean to be cynical but it seems out of character do narcissists recognize themselves as such not usually unless they are in therapy and motivated of course im talking now about someone with a real dysfunctional personality disorder not just a personality trait where most doctors fall jack held his tongue on that issue he wasnt about to get into an argument with alexis about which group craig belonged in instead he asked is this the kind of insight thats a temporary response to stress or a real change in selfknowledge time will tell alexis said but ill be hopeful it would be something very positive in a real way craig is a victim of a system that pushed him to compete and excel and the only way he knew when he was excelling was when he got praise from his teachers like dr brown as he admitted he became addicted to that kind of approbation then when he finished his training he was cut off like an addict being denied his drug of choice while simultaneously feeling disillusioned about the reality of the kind of medicine he was forced to practice i think that happens to a lot of doctors they need praise it didnt happen to you how come it did to a degree back when i was an ophthalmologist randolph got dr brown to admit that its due to the competitive way medical training is structured but when i was a student i wasnt as monomaniacal as craig i had other interests than just medicine i only got an aminus in my thirdyear internalmedicine rotation jack started when his phone began to vibrate in his pocket hed taken it off the ring mode frantically he tried to get it out of his pocket for reasons he couldnt fathom the phone always startled him is something bothering you alexis asked eyeing his contortions hed slid his pelvis forward to straighten himself out the damn phone jack explained at last he was able to pull it free he glanced at the lcd it was a area code meaning boston then he remembered the number it was the funeral home ill be right back jack said he got up and quickly moved out of the row once again he was conscious of francos stare but jack did not return it instead he headed out of the courtroom only then did he answer the call unfortunately the reception was bad so he disconnected he quickly took the elevator down to the first floor and then out the door he used his receivedcalls function to retrieve the number a moment later he had harold on the phone and jack apologized for the poor connection earlier no problem harold said i have good news the paperwork is done the permits have been granted and everything is arranged terrific jack said when this afternoon no that would have been a miracle it will be tomorrow midmorning its the very best i could do both the vault truck and the backhoe are fully committed today disappointed a miracle had not been forthcoming jack thanked the director and hung up he stood for a few minutes debating whether to call laurie to let her know about the autopsy timing although he knew calling was appropriate he was less than enthusiastic about doing it since he had little doubt what her response would be then he had a cowardly idea instead of calling her landline at the office where hed probably get her he had the idea of calling her cell phone and just leaving a message on her voicemail since she rarely turned on her cell phone during the day in that way hed avoid her immediate response and give her a chance to adjust before he phoned her that night as the call went through he was relieved to hear the recorded message with that mildly unpleasant task out of the way jack returned to his seat next to alexis jordan stanhope was in the witness box and tony was at the podium but no one was talking tony was busy with his papers what did i miss jack whispered to alexis nothing jordan was just sworn and hes about to begin testifying the autopsy is on for sometime tomorrow the body is to be exhumed in the morning thats good alexis said but her reaction was not what jack had expected youre not sounding very enthusiastic how can i be as craig said at lunch tomorrow might be too late jack shrugged he was doing the best he could i know this is difficult for you tony called out in an empathetic voice so everyone in the courtroom could hear i will try to make this as short and painless as possible but the jury needs to hear your testimony jordan nodded appreciatively instead of the erect posture he had been maintaining at the plaintiffs table he now had his shoulders hunched over and instead of his previously neutral facial expression he now had the corners of his mouth turned down in a look of despondency and despair he was dressed in a black silk suit white shirt and black tie peeking from his breast pocket was a barely visible black pocket square i suppose you miss your wife tony said she was a wonderful passionate cultured woman who loved life wasnt she good grief jack moaned in a whisper to alexis having visited the man this is going to make me sick and im surprised at randolph im not a lawyer but thats certainly a leading question why doesnt he object he told me that the testimony of the widow or widower is always the most problematic for the defense he says that the best strategy is to get them off the stand as soon as possible which means giving the plaintiff attorney rather free rein jack nodded the pain of losing a family member was an emotion that resonated with everyone as a fundamental human experience jordan proceeded to wax cloyingly sentimental about patience how wonderful she was how storybook their life together was and how much he loved her tony asked additional leading questions whenever jordan faltered as this stage of jordan s testimony tediously proceeded jack turned his head and searched the spectator gallery he saw franco but the man was watching the witness which was a minor relief jack hoped bygones would remain bygones he was looking for someone else and he found her in the back row it was charlene the woman looked quite fetching in her black mourning outfit jack shook his head there were times when he truly couldnt believe the degeneracy of which humans were capable even if just for appearances she shouldnt have been there as the eulogy dragged on jack began to get progressively antsy there was no need for him to listen to the drivel the phony jordan was offering he glanced at the back of craigs head craig was motionless as if in a trance jack tried to imagine what it would be like if he were ensnared in such a nightmare jack hazarded a quick glance in alexiss direction she was concentrating intensely with her eyes slightly narrowed he wished the best for her and was sorry there wasnt more he could do just when jack had decided he could not listen to another word of jordan s testimony tony switched gears now lets talk about september eighth tony said i guess your wife wasnt feeling so well that day could you tell us in your own words what happened jordan cleared his throat he pulled his shoulders back and sat up straight it was midmorning when i was first aware she was not feeling well she called to me to come into her bedroom i found her in great distress what was she complaining about pain in her abdomen gas and congestion she said she was coughing more than usual she said shed not slept all night and she couldnt take it any longer she told me to call dr bowman she said she wanted him to come right over she said she would not be able to go to the office were there any other symptoms she said she had a headache and she felt hot so that was it as far as the symptoms were concerned abdominal pain gas coughing headache and feeling hot essentially yes i mean she always had a lot of complaints but those were the main ones poor woman tony said and it was hard on you too i presume we did our best to cope jordan said stiffly now you called the doctor and he did come over yes he did and what happened dr bowman examined her and recommended that she take the medication hed already prescribed for her digestive system he also recommended she get out of bed and cut down on her smoking he also told her he thought she was more anxious than usual and suggested she try a small dose of an antidepressant medication which she was to take at bedtime he said he thought it was worth trying was patience satisfied with these recommendations no she wanted an antibiotic but dr bowman refused he said she didnt need one did she follow the doctors recommendations i dont know what medications she took but she did eventually get out of bed i thought she was doing quite a bit better then around five she said she was going back to bed did she complain of anything at that point not really i mean she always had a few complaints which is why she was going back to bed what happened next she suddenly called me sometime around seven to come to her bedroom she wanted me to call the doctor again because she felt terribly did she have the same complaints as that morning no they were completely different what were they now tony asked she had chest pain that shed had for an hour which was different from the abdominal pain she had in the morning completely different what else she was weak and she said she had vomited a little she could barely sit up and she said she was numb and had a feeling as if she were floating and she said she was having difficulty breathing she was very ill it sounds like a very serious circumstance it must have been frightening i felt very upset and worried so tony intoned for dramatic effect you called the doctor and what did you say i told him patience was very sick and she should go to the hospital and how did dr bowman respond to your urgent request to go to the hospital immediately he wanted me to describe her symptoms and you did you told him what you told us today almost word for word and what was dr bowmans response did he tell you to call an ambulance and say hed meet you at the hospital no he kept asking me more questions such that i had to go back to patience and ask her let me make sure i understand you told him your wife was in this terrible condition and he had you going back to her multiple times to ask specific details is that what you are saying thats precisely what i am saying during this questionandanswer period while valuable time was passing did you again mention your belief she should go directly to the hospital without delay yes i did i was terrified and you should have been terrified since your wife was dying before your eyes objection randolph said argumentative and prejudicial and move to strike sustained judge davidson said he looked at the jury you will disregard that last statement by mr fasano and it should play no part in your consideration of this case he then switched his attention to tony i warn you counsel i will not tolerate any more comments like that i apologize to the court tony said my emotions overcame my better judgment it wont happen again alexis leaned toward jack tony fasano scares me he is slick he knew what he was doing jack nodded in agreement it was like watching a street fighter in a noholdsbarred brawl tony fasano went to the plaintiffs table for a drink out of the view of the judge jack caught him give a wink to his associate renee relf back at the podium tony returned to the narrative during your telephone conversation with dr bowman while your wife was gravely ill did he mention the word heart attack yes he did did he say she was having a heart attack yes he said that was what he was thinking jack noticed craig lean over and whisper something to randolph randolph nodded now tony continued when dr bowman arrived at your house and saw patience he acted differently than he had on the phone is that correct objection randolph said leading sustained judge davidson said mr stanhope would you tell us what happened when dr bowman arrived at your home the night of september eighth of this past year he was shocked at patiences condition and told me to call an ambulance immediately had patiences condition changed dramatically between your telephone conversation with dr bowman and his arrival no it had not did dr bowman say anything to you at that point that you found inappropriate yes he blamed me for not having described patiences condition adequately did that surprise you of course it surprised me i had told him how bad she was and i had urged more than once that she should be taken directly to the hospital thank you mr stanhope i appreciate your testimony about this tragic event i have one more question when dr bowman arrived that fateful night what was he wearing can you remember objection randolph said immaterial judge davidson twirled his pen and looked at tony is this relevant or mere embellishment very relevant your honor tony said as will be clear with testimony from the very next plaintiff witness objection overruled judge davidson said witness may answer the question dr bowman arrived in a tuxedo with a young woman in a lowcut dress some of the jurors exchanged glances with their immediate neighbors as if wondering what he or she was thinking did you recognize the young woman yes i had seen her at dr bowmans office and he said she was his secretary did their formal attire strike you as odd or significant both jordan said it was odd because it suggested they were en route to a social function and i knew dr bowman was married and significant because i wondered if their attire had anything to do with dr bowmans decision to come to the house rather than meet us at the hospital thank you mr stanhope tony said gathering his papers no more questions mr bingham judge davidson said nodding in randolph s direction randolph hesitated for a moment it was clear he was in deep thought even when he stood up and approached the podium he seemed to be moving by reflex rather than by conscious intention the courtroom was hushed in attentive expectancy mr stanhope randolph began i will ask you only a few questions all of us at the defense table including dr bowman are saddened by your loss and can appreciate how difficult it is for you to revisit that fateful evening so i will be brief let us go back to the telephone conversation you had with dr bowman do you recall telling dr bowman that it was your recollection that patience had never complained of chest pain before im not certain i was very upset and yet with mr fasano your memory of the same telephone conversation seemed impressively complete i might have said shed never had chest pain im just not sure i should remind you that in your deposition you did so state should i read it to you no if it is there then it is true and now that you remind me i believe i did say shed never had chest pain it was eight months ago and i was under duress the deposition was much closer to the event i can appreciate that mr stanhope but id like you to search your memory for dr bowmans response do you recall what he said i dont believe i do he corrected you and reminded you she had had chest pain on several previous occasions for which he came to the house maybe he did so it seems that your memory of what was said during this phone conversation is not as clear as we were led to believe just a few minutes ago the phone conversation was eight months ago and i was frantic at the time i dont think its unreasonable it is certainly not unreasonable yet you are certain dr bowman specifically said patience was having a heart attack he said that it had to be ruled out your choice of words suggests that dr bowman was not the one who brought up the subject i brought up the subject i asked him if that was what he was thinking i guessed from the questions he was asking me to ask patience saying it has to be ruled out is a lot different than stating patience was having a heart attack would it surprise you if i told you dr bowman never used the words heart attack in your conversation we talked about it that i remember you brought it up he merely said it has to be ruled out he never even said the term maybe that is the way it happened but what difference does it make i believe it makes a lot of difference do you believe that whenever someone has chest pain like yourself for instance and a doctor is on call he or she thinks a heart attack has to be ruled out i assume so so when you told dr bowman patience had chest pain it is not surprising that dr bowman would think it had to be ruled out even if the chances were very very small i suppose not and on those previous house calls dr bowman made to see patience in response to a complaint of chest pain what was the ultimate diagnosis on each occasion it was assumed to be intestinal gas correct intestinal gas in the splenic flexure of the colon to be exact it was not heart attacks or heart pain since ecgs and enzymes were normal and stayed normal on subsequent examinations they were not heart attacks dr bowman made a lot of house calls to attend to patience in fact the records show a rate of visitation approximately once per week over an eightmonth interval is that consistent with your recollection jordan nodded which brought an admonition from the judge the witness will speak up for the benefit of the court reporter and the record yes jordan called out was it patiences preference to be seen at home yes she did not like to go to the doctors office was she fond of hospitals she was terrified of hospitals so by making house calls dr bowman was catering to your wifes needs and wishes yes he was since you are semiretired and spent a good deal of your time at home you had a lot of opportunity to interact with dr bowman with his making so many house calls indeed jordan agreed we spoke on each visit and were quite congenial i assume you were always in attendance when dr bowman attended patience either i or our maid during any of these conversations with dr bowman which i assume dealt primarily with patience did the term hypochondriasis come up jordan s eyes darted to tonys and then back to randolph yes it did and i assume you know the definition of the term jordan shrugged i suppose its applied to an individual who has a preoccupation with normal sensations and functions and believes them to be indicative of severe problems needing medical attention is that generally your understanding of the term i would not have been able to define it quite like that but yes thats my understanding did dr bowman ever apply that term to patience he did did he use the term in a derogatory context no he did not he said that it was always important to remember that hypochondriacs could have real illnesses as well as their psychological ones and even if their imaginary illness were not real they still suffered a few moments ago when mr fasano was questioning you you testified that patiences condition did not change dramatically between your telephone conversation and dr bowmans arrival thats correct during your conversation you told dr bowman that you believed patience was having some difficulty breathing do you remember that yes i do you also said you believed she appeared rather blue do you remember that as well i dont know if those were my exact words but it is the gist of what i was saying i contend that it was exactly what you said or extremely close in your deposition you agreed it was extremely close would you like to read the relevant portions if i said it was extremely close then it was at this point i dont remember when dr bowman arrived he found patience totally blue and hardly breathing at all would you say that was a big difference from your description over the phone i was trying to do my best in a difficult situation i made it very clear to him she was very ill and that she should be seen at the hospital one further question randolph said straightening his tall lean frame to its sixfootplus limit taking into account patiences long history of hypochondriasis along with a number of previous episodes of chest pain caused by intestinal gas do you believe on the evening of september eighth that dr bowman thought patience stanhope was having a heart attack objection tony cried getting to his feet hearsay sustained judge davidson said the question can be posed to the defendant himself during his testimony no more questions randolph said he strode back toward the defense table do you wish to redirect judge davidson asked tony no your honor tony said as jordan stepped down from the witness box jack turned to alexis he flashed her a thumbsup on randolph s crossexamination but then his eyes went to the jurors they didnt strike him as being nearly as riveted as he had been instead of many of them leaning forward as theyd been earlier they were all leaning back in their chairs arms folded across their chests except for the plumbers assistant he was back to fussing with his nails plaintiff call your next witness judge davidson ordered tony stood up and bellowed ms leona rattner to the stand please boston massachusetts wednesday june pm jack twisted around he had a mildly prurient interest in seeing the nubile hussy turned spurnedlover vixen having read her racy deposition he was sure her testimony was going to be a show leona came through the courtroom door and strode unhesitantly down the courtrooms central aisle in contrast to craigs description of her typically sexy apparel she was now dressed demurely in a dark blue pants suit with a white blouse buttoned to the neck jack assumed it was at tony fasanos suggestion the only hint of her normal style was extrahighheeled sandals that made her walk slightly wobbly although the womans clothing was modest jack could immediately appreciate what had attracted craig her individual features were not special nor was her strawblond obviously dyed hair with its dark roots but her skin was flawless and radiant she was the picture of youthful sensuality brazenly projected leona went through the bar with a saucy shake of her head she knew she was onstage and she loved it jack hazarded a glance in alexiss direction her face was set in stone reflecting a determined expression with her lips pressed firmly together jack had the sense that she was steeling herself for what was coming he thought that was a good selfpreservation ploy having read leonas deposition the court clerk administered the oath while leona held her right hand heavenward do you swear or affirm to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god i do leona said in a slightly nasal voice she glanced modestly at the judge through eyelashes heavy with mascara as she stepped up into the witness box tony took his time getting to the podium and arranging his notes then he hiked one of his tasseled loafers onto the brass rail as was his habit and began the direct first off he established a short biography where she was born revere massachusetts where shed gone to high school revere massachusetts where she was currently living revere massachusetts he asked how long she had worked in dr craig bowmans office more than a year and where she was going to night school three nights a week bunker hill community college as leona answered these neutral initial questions jack had more of an opportunity to observe her he noticed she and tony shared the same accent which to him seemed as much like a brooklyn accent as a boston accent jack could also see more evidence of the personality traits craig had described opinionated highspirited and willful what he had yet to observe was the mercurial petulance now lets talk about your relationship with your boss dr craig bowman tony said objection randolph said immaterial counsels approach the bench judge davidson ordered irritably randolph complied immediately tony motioned to leona to sit tight and followed using his reading glasses similar to the way a person uses a newspaper roll to threaten a dog judge davidson directed his attention to tony this better not be an elaborate sham and i want to be assured again that this social crap is germane to the plaintiffs case otherwise we are going to be dealing with a mistrial and potentially a directed verdict for the doctor its absolutely germane the witness will testify that dr bowman did not consider meeting patience stanhope at the hospital because of their relationship and their evening plans all right im going to give you a lot of rope and i hope you dont hang yourself with it im going to allow the social testimony for the reasons ive already given in the past specifically the assurance that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial value judge davidson waved the glasses in randolph s direction as far as the defense is concerned i will allow you wide latitude on your crossexamination which mr fasano will respect now within this framework i want to move things along between the two of you these interruptions are annoying me to death understood yes your honor both counsels echoed in unison they turned on their heels and returned to their respective spots objection overruled judge davidson called out for the court reporters benefit continue the direct of ms rattner miss rattner tony said could you tell the court about your relationship with dr bowman sure at first i was like just one of the employees but about a year ago i could tell dr bowman was giving me the eye you know what im saying i think i do tony responded go on at first i was embarrassed and everything because i knew he was married with kids and the whole works but then one evening when i was working late he came into the file room where i was working and started talking one thing led to another and we began hanging out with each other i mean it was okay since i found out he had moved out of his house and gotten an apartment in boston was this a platonic affair hell no he was a tiger it was a very physical relationship we even did it on the examination table one afternoon at the office he said his wife didnt like sex and besides shed gained all this weight after shed had her kids and never lost it it was like he was starving and needed a lot of attention so i went out of my way a lot of good it did me your honor this is beyond randolph began rising to his feet sit down mr bingham judge davidson snapped then he looked at tony over his reading glasses mr fasano it is time to establish foundation and it better be convincing of course your honor tony said he made a quick detour to take a sip of water at the plaintiffs table then running his tongue around his lips as if they were dry he returned to the podium and shuffled his papers there was a murmur of expectancy from the spectator area and the jurors appeared more attentive than usual with many leaning forward salacious material never failed to titillate once again jack furtively glanced at alexis out of the corner of his eye shed not moved her grim expression had not changed he couldnt help but feel a tender brotherly compassion for her he hoped her professional psychology training could provide some element of ego protection as humiliating as the situation was miss rattner tony began on the evening of september eighth you were in dr bowmans boston apartment where you were at that time residing thats correct id moved from the dump where id been in somerville because the landlord was an ass judge davidson leaned over toward leona the witness will restrict herself to answering questions and refrain from spontaneous monologues yes your honor leona said meekly through batting eyelashes could you tell the jury in your own words what you and dr bowman were doing that evening what we had planned to do and what we did were two different things we had planned to go to symphony hall for some kind of performance craig i mean dr bowman was on this renaissanceman kick to make up for lost time and he had bought me this terrific pink dress that came down low she traced a deeply concave arc across her chest with her finger we were both excited the most fun was arriving at the symphony hall with all the bustle and excitement i mean the music was pretty good too but walking in was the best part for both of us dr bowman had season tickets and the seats were way down in the front it was like being on stage walking down the aisle which is why he liked me to look real sexy it sounds as if dr bowman liked to show you off something like that leona agreed it was okay with me i thought it was fun but to do this you had to get there on time or maybe a little early thats right if you got there late sometimes you had to wait until intermission to sit down and it wasnt the same what happened on september eighth we were rushing around getting ready to go when dr bowmans cell phone rang i presume it was jordan stanhope tony said it was and it meant the evening was up in the air because dr bowman decided he had to make a house call did you stay at the apartment while dr bowman made the house call no dr bowman told me to come he said if it turned out to be a false alarm we could go directly to the concert from the stanhopes he said the stanhope house was not that far away from symphony hall meaning it was closer than newton memorial hospital objection randolph said lack of foundation the witness said nothing about newton memorial hospital sustained judge davidson said with a tired voice jury will disregard proceed miss rattner tony intoned licked his lips as he was wont to do on the way to the stanhope residence did dr bowman say anything to you about his sense of patience stanhopes condition did he feel the house call he was about to make would be a false alarm objection randolph said hearsay sustained judge davidson said with a sigh the witness will confine herself to dr bowmans actual comments and not offer an opinion as to his mindset i repeat tony said did dr bowman say anything to you about what he thought patience stanhopes condition was leona looked up at the judge im confused hes asking and youre telling me not to answer im not telling you not to answer dear judge davidson said im telling you not to try to imagine what dr bowman was thinking he will be able to tell us that himself mr fasano is asking you what dr bowman specifically said about patiences condition okay leona said finally understanding he said he was scared that the visit was legit meaning that patience stanhope was legitimately sick yes did he say anything about how he felt about patients like patience stanhope the pps or problem patients that night while we were in the car yes that night he said she was a hypochondriac which he could not stand he said hypochondriacs were the same to him as malingerers i remember because i had to look the word up later it means someone who fakes illness to get something they want its pretty bad looking up malingerer is very commendable what motivated you im studying to be a medical lab technician or nursing assistant ive got to know the lingo did dr bowman ever say anything else to you about his feelings toward patience stanhope oh yeah leona said with a fake laugh for emphasis could you explain to the jury when this occurred it was on the evening he was served with the lawsuit we were at sports clubla and what exactly did he say its what he didnt say i mean he ran off at the mouth like you wouldnt believe give the jury some sense of what you are talking about well its hard to remember the whole tirade he said he hated her because she drove everybody crazy including herself he said she drove him crazy because all she ever talked about was her bms and that sometimes shed save it to show it to him he also said she drove him crazy because she never did anything he said he called her a hypochrondriacal clinging excuse for a wife and an entitled bitch that demanded he hold her hand and listen to her complaints he said her passing was a blessing to everybody including herself wow tony said pretending hed heard the testimony for the first time and was shocked so i guess it was your impression that from what dr bowman had said he was glad patience stanhope had died objection randolph said leading sustained judge davidson said jurors will disregard tell us what you thought after dr bowmans tirade i thought he was glad she died hearing such a tirade as you put it you must have thought dr bowman was really upset did he say anything specific about his being sued meaning that his performance and decisionmaking would be reasonably questioned in a court of law yes he said it was an outrage that the oddball bastard jordan stanhope was suing him for loss of consortium when he couldnt imagine mr stanhope having sex or wanting to have sex with such a miserable hag thank you miss rattner tony said collecting his widely spread papers from the lecterns surface no more questions once again jack glanced over at alexis this time she met his eyes well she whispered philosophically what can craig expect he certainly dug his own hole leonas testimony was about as bad as i imagined it would be lets hope you can come up with something on the autopsy maybe randolph can do something on cross and dont forget randolph has yet to start the case for the defense im not forgetting im just being realistic and putting myself in the place of one of the jurors it doesnt look good the testimony is convincingly making craig sound like a completely different person than he is he has his faults but the way he cares about his patients is not one of them im afraid youre right jack said newton massachusetts wednesday june pm let me see the floor plan again renaldo said to manuel they were sitting in a black chevrolet camaro parked on a treelined side street around the corner from the bowmanss residence they were dressed in nondescript brown work clothes on the backseat was a canvas carpetbag similar to those carried by plumbers for tools manuel handed renaldo the plans they crinkled as renaldo unrolled them renaldo was sitting behind the steering wheel he had to fight to get the paper to flatten out enough to look at it heres the door were going in renaldo said pointing you oriented manuel leaned over almost touching renaldos shoulder so the top of the page was pointing away from him he was sitting in the front passenger seat for shit sake renaldo complained its not that complicated im oriented manuel said what we have to do is locate all three of the girls fast so none of them has a chance to alert the others you know what im saying sure so theyll either be here in the family roomkitchen probably watching tv renaldo said pointing to the area on the plans or they will be in their separate bedrooms he struggled to get to the second page the plans wanted to roll back up into their original tight cylinder he ended up tossing the first page into the backseat here are the bedrooms along the back of the house he said when he got the second page flattened and here are the stairs you got it we dont want to be searching and it has to happen fast i understand but theres three of them and only two of us its not going to be hard to scare the shit out of them the only one that might be trouble is the oldest but if we cant handle this were in the wrong business the plan is to tape them up fast i mean really fast i dont want any screaming once we get them taped up with gags then the fun begins okay okay manuel said he straightened you have your gun of course i have my gun he pulled a snubnosed thirtyeight out of his pocket put it away for christs sake renaldo snapped his eyes darted around to make sure there were no strollers the area was quiet everyone was at work the widely spaced houses seemed deserted what about your mask and gloves manuel pulled those out of his other pocket good renaldo said he checked his watch okay this is it lets move it while manuel got out of the car renaldo reached into the backseat and got the canvas bag he joined manuel and they walked back to the intersection turning right they didnt hurry nor did they talk due to the canopy of leaves the street was shaded yet each house blazed in bright sunlight an elderly woman was walking a dog in the distance but she was heading away from them a car approached and passed by without stopping the driver ignored them coming abreast of the bowman property they briefly stopped looking up and down the street looks good renaldo said its a go maintaining a normal gait they crossed the edge of the bowmanss front lawn they appeared like two workmen on a legitimate errand they entered the treeline separating the two neighboring homes and were soon even with the backs of the houses eyeing the back of the bowman house they could see the door they intended to enter it was about forty feet away across a patch of sundrenched lawn okay renaldo said time for the masks and gloves each quickly donned the items masks first gloves second they eyed each other and nodded renaldo snapped open the canvas bag he wanted to be certain he had everything he handed manuel a roll of duct tape which manuel pocketed lets do it reflecting their professionalism they were across the lawn and through the door in a blink of the eye and with almost no sound once inside they hesitated and listened they could hear a tv with canned laughter from the family room renaldo flipped a thumbsup and motioned for manuel to move forward treading lightly and moving quietly they passed through the study and down the central corridor renaldo was in the lead he stopped just shy of the arched entrance to the family room slowly he looked around the edge of the arch seeing an everexpanding view first of the kitchen and then of progressively more of the family room when he saw the girls he pulled himself back he raised two fingers indicating two girls manuel nodded renaldo then used his hand to indicate a wide counterclockwise circle in the air to suggest they move through the kitchen then approach the couch in front of the tv from the rear manuel nodded renaldo brandished his roll of duct tape manuel pulled out his after silently placing the canvas bag on the floor renaldo readied himself he looked at manuel and manuel indicated that he was ready moving quickly but quietly renaldo followed the route hed mapped out the girls heads could just be seen over the back of the brightly colored couch the tv volume which had seemed low when theyd first heard it was not low especially the laughing sequences renaldo and manuel were able to move up directly behind the unsuspecting girls with a nod from renaldo each man sprang around either end of the couch and glommed on to the respective girl the men were rough and decisive grabbing the children by the necks and pressing their faces into the soft pillows of the couch both girls had made feeble reflex squawks but the sounds were immediately muffled using their teeth the men pulled off lengths of duct tape from each of their rolls and keeping their weight on the girls they managed to bind each of their hands behind their backs almost simultaneously they rolled the girls over the girls gasped for breath wideeyed with terror renaldo put his finger over his closed lips to indicate that the girls must remain silent but there was no need both girls did all they could do to satisfy their air hunger and they were frightened to near paralysis wheres your sister renaldo hissed through clenched teeth neither girl spoke watching their captors with unblinking intensity renaldo snapped his fingers at manuel and pointed to meghan who was trembling in his grasp manuel let go of meghan long enough to pull out a square rag which he roughly pressed into her mouth she tried to resist by twisting her head from side to side but it was to no avail manuel slapped a short piece of duct tape over the lower part of the girls face securing the gag rapidly a second piece of tape was added forcing meghan to breathe loudly through her nose seeing what had happened to meghan christina quickly tried to be cooperative shes upstairs taking a shower she cried breathlessly renaldo rewarded her by quickly gagging her in the same fashion as manuel had gagged meghan then both men bound the girls feet before yanking them upright and then together to tape them back to back at that point renaldo gave them a push and they toppled over in an awkward heap both still struggling for breath stay here renaldo growled as he picked up his roll of duct tape moving silently but quickly renaldo ascended the stairs once in the upstairs hallway he could hear the shower it was a distant soft sibilant sound which he followed passing several bedrooms with open doors the third door on the right opened into a bedroom unique in its disarray clothes books shoes and magazines were haphazardly tossed about on the floor and on all horizontal surfaces black thong panties and a bra were draped over the bathrooms marble threshold from within the bathroom clouds of steam billowed out into the room with rising anticipation renaldo quickly traversed the room being careful to avoid the debris he poked his head into the bathroom but could barely see through the dense mist the mirror was completely fogged over it was a small bathroom with a pedestal sink a toilet and a low tub that also served as a shower an opaque white shower curtain with black sea horses hung from a silvercolored rod and it was moving both from the forces of the water and rising steam and also from occasional contact by the showers occupant renaldo briefly debated how best to handle the situation with the other girls already secured it really wasnt a problem in fact knowing the girl was naked was a turnon and that had to be factored in as well he reached out with the roll of duct tape and placed it on the edge of the sink he couldnt help but smile thinking he was being paid to do something he might pay to do he knew the girl in the shower was fifteen going on twentyone with a couple of knockers worth a second look after thinking about a few different alternatives including waiting for the girl to finish and get out of the shower herself renaldo merely grabbed the shower curtain and whipped it back it was a tension rod and the force of renaldos jerk pulled the whole apparatus off the wall and it tumbled onto the floor in a heap at the moment of the shower rod and curtains disappearance tracy had her back to the shower with her head under the torrent forcibly rinsing her thick tresses she hadnt heard the clatter but she must have felt the surge of significantly cooler air because she leaned forward out of the gush of water and opened her eyes as soon as she caught sight of the blackskimasked intruder she screamed renaldo reached in and grabbed a handful of wet hair and yanked tracy from the bathtub her feet tripped on the rim and she fell headlong to the floor renaldo let go of her hair and put a knee into the small of her back while he lunged for her flailing wrists using decisive strength he forced her hands behind her back snatched the duct tape off the sink and as hed done downstairs used his teeth to pull a strip of tape from the roll with rapid movements he wound the tape in and out and around tracy s wrists within only a few seconds her hands were securely bound through this procedure tracy had maintained a scream but it was dampened by the sound of the shower renaldo rolled her over he pulled a square rag from his pocket balled it up and began stuffing it into her mouth tracy was a quantum stronger than christina and she was able to resist until renaldo straddled her and used his knees to secure her head then she succeeded in biting his finger which infuriated him bitch he yelled he slapped her hard splitting her lip she still resisted but he was able to get the gag into her mouth and place several pieces of duct tape to hold it in place then he got up and stared down at the terrified teenager not bad renaldo commented as he took in tracy s nubile figure and the belly button piercing his eyes stopped at a small tattoo of a snake just north of her mons pubis already shaving your snatch and you got a tattoo i wonder if mommy and daddy know that arent you a little ahead of yourself girl renaldo reached down and hooked a hand under one of tracy s armpits and hoisted her roughly to her feet she responded by bolting out of the bathroom catching renaldo off guard he had to race to catch her before she got out of her bedroom not so fast sister renaldo snarled yanking her around to face him if youre smart and cooperative you wont be hurt if youre not i guarantee youll be a very sorry girl read me tracy stared defiantly back at her attacker with fiery eyes feisty thing huh renaldo questioned derisively he glanced down at her breasts which he found considerably more impressive with her upright posture and sexy too how many snakes have you had in that snake den of yours i bet a lot more than your parents think huh he nodded his head knowingly tracy continued to glare at renaldo with her chest heaving from her adrenaline rush let me tell you whats going to happen here you and me are going to march downstairs to the family room for a family reunion with your sisters well tape you girls together so youll be one big happy family unit then im going to tell you a few things i want you to tell your parents then were out of here does that sound like a plan with a push renaldo directed tracy out into the hall he still had ahold of her arm just above the elbow when they came to the stairs he urged her to descend in the family room manuel was dutifully standing over meghan and christina meghan was silently crying as evidenced by her tears and the intermittent trembling of her torso christina was still wideeyed with terror nice work manuel said as the naked tracy was led over to the couch he couldnt help eyeing tracy as renaldo had done sit the two up facing either end of the sofa renaldo commanded manuel yanked the two preteens up and rotated them as renaldo had directed renaldo directed tracy to sit on the sofas edge with her back to her sisters when she was in place he wound tape around all three when he was finished he straightened up and checked his handiwork satisfied he handed the tape to manuel and told him to gather up their stuff listen sweeties renaldo said to the girls but mostly to tracy with whom he made direct eye contact we want you to deliver a message to your parents but first let me ask you something do you know what an autopsy is just nod your head if you do tracy didnt move she didnt even blink renaldo slapped her again further opening her split lip a trickle of blood ran down her chin im not going to ask you again nod or shake your head whatever is appropriate tracy nodded quickly good renaldo said heres the message for mommy and daddy no autopsy you got that no autopsy nod your head if you got it tracy dutifully nodded okay thats the main message no autopsy i could write it for you but i dont think thats wise under the circumstances tell them if they ignore this warning that we will be back to visit you kids and it wont be pretty you know what im saying it will be bad not like this time because this is just a warning it might not be tomorrow and maybe not next week but sometime now i want to know you understand the message so far nod your head if you do tracy nodded some of the brashness had disappeared from her eyes and the last part of the message is just as simple tell your parents to keep the police out of this affair its just between us and your parents if they go to the police im going to have to visit you again somewhere someplace its pretty clear are we on the same page about all this tracy nodded again it was now obvious she was terrified just like her younger sisters great renaldo said then he reached out with his gloved finger and tweaked one of tracy s nipples nice boobs tell your parents not to make me come back after a quick visual sweep around the room renaldo motioned for manuel as quickly as they had come in they left picking up the canvas bag on the way and taking off their masks and gloves they closed the door behind them and followed the same route back to the street en route to the car they passed a couple of kids on bikes but it didnt bother them they were just two handymen returning from having done some work back in the car renaldo looked at his watch the whole exercise had taken less than twenty minutes which wasnt bad for a thousand bucks boston massachusetts wednesday june pm randolph took longer than usual to get up from the defense table organize his notes and situate himself behind the podium even when ostensibly prepared he eyed leona rattner long enough for her to briefly look away randolph could be intimidating with his powerful paternal aura miss rattner randolph said in his refined voice how would you describe your choice of apparel at the office leona laughed uncertainly normal i guess why would you label your usual attire conservative or modest i never thought about it did marlene richardt who is the de facto office manager ever suggest your attire was inappropriate for a moment leona looked like the fox caught in the henhouse her eyes darted from tony to the judge and then back to randolph she said something to that effect how many times how should i know a number of times did she use terms like sexy or provocative i suppose miss rattner you testified that dr bowman was giving you the eye about a year ago thats correct do you think it might have had anything to do with your choice of apparel how am i supposed to know you testified that at first it made you embarrassed because he was married thats true but a year ago dr bowman was officially separated from his wife there were strains in his marriage that were being addressed wasnt that common knowledge in the office maybe it was could it be that you were giving dr bowman the eye rather than vice versa maybe subconsciously hes a goodlooking guy did it ever go through your mind that dr bowman might be susceptible to provocative clothing considering he was living alone i never thought about it miss rattner you testified that on september eighth you were living in dr bowmans boston apartment i was how did that happen did dr bowman invite you to move in not exactly did your moving in ever come up in a conversation so that the benefits and the disadvantages could be discussed not really the reality was that you decided to move in on your own accord is that correct well i was staying there every night why pay rent on two apartments you did not answer the question you moved into dr bowmans apartment without discussing it with him is that correct its not like he complained leona snapped he was getting it every night the question is whether you moved in on your own accord yeah i moved in on my own accord leona spat and he loved it we shall see when dr bowman testifies randolph said consulting his notes miss rattner on the evening of september eighth when the call came in from mr jordan stanhope about his wife patience did dr bowman ever say anything about the newton memorial hospital no he did not he didnt say it would be better to go to the stanhope residence than the hospital because the stanhope residence was closer to symphony hall nope he didnt say anything about the hospital when you and dr bowman arrived at the stanhope residence did you remain in the car no dr bowman wanted me to come inside and help him i understand you were carrying the portable cardiogram thats right and when you got to mrs stanhopes bedroom what happened dr bowman started to work on mrs stanhope did he act concerned at that point he sure did he had mr stanhope call an ambulance right away i understand he had you breathe for the patient while he did what he had to do thats right he showed me how to do it was dr bowman concerned about the patients condition very concerned the patient was very blue and her pupils were big and unreactive i understand the ambulance came quickly to take mrs stanhope to the hospital how did you and dr bowman get to the hospital i drove his car dr bowman went with the ambulance why did he go in the ambulance he said if she has trouble he wants to be there you did not see him again until much later after mrs stanhope had died is that correct it is it was in the emergency room he was all bloodspattered was he discouraged because his patient had died he was pretty down so dr bowman made a strenuous effort to save his patient yes and he was despondent when all his efforts were unsuccessful i guess id say he was depressed but he didnt dwell on it in fact we ended up having a pretty damned good friday night back at the apartment miss rattner allow me to ask you a personal question you strike me as a highspirited young woman have you ever said things you didnt really mean when youve been angry maybe exaggerate your feelings everybody does leona said with a shallow laugh on the night dr bowman was served with the lawsuit did he become upset very upset id never seen him so upset and angry very angry under such circumstances do you believe there was a chance when he quote ran off at the mouth and voiced inappropriate comments about patience stanhope that he was merely blustering especially considering the strenuous effort hed made to resuscitate her on the fateful evening and the weekly house calls hed made during the year leading up to her death randolph paused waiting for leona to answer the witness will answer the question judge davidson said after a period of silence was that a question leona said with apparent befuddlement i didnt get it repeat the question judge davidson said what im suggesting is that dr bowmans comments about patience stanhope on the evening he was served were a reflection of his agitation whereas his true feelings about the patient were accurately demonstrated by his dedicated commitment to attend to her at her home on a weekly basis for almost a year and his strenuous efforts to resuscitate her the night she passed away im asking miss rattner if this sounds plausible to you maybe i dont know maybe you should ask him i believe i will do that randolph said but i first want to ask you if you are still living in dr bowmans rented apartment in boston jack leaned over toward alexis and whispered randolph is getting away with some questions and statements that should have raised objections from tony fasano fasano has always been quick on the trigger before i wonder whats going on maybe it has something to do with that hushed conversation the judge had with the lawyers earlier in leonas testimony theres always a bit of giveandtake for fairness thats a good point jack agreed whatever the reason randolph s making the best of it jack listened while randolph cleverly began questioning leona about her feelings since the malpractice suit began and craig moved back with his family jack knew exactly what randolph was doing he was setting the stage for a spurned love defense where the previous testimony would be rendered suspect as having been motivated by spite jack leaned back toward alexis and whispered let me ask you a question and be truthful would you mind if i slipped out id like to get in some basketball for exercise but if you want me to stay i will i have a sense the worst is over from here on shell just be making herself look bad please alexis said sincerely go get some exercise i appreciate your having been here but im fine now go and enjoy yourself the judge is going to wind things up here momentarily he always does around four you are certain youre okay jack asked absolutely alexis insisted ill eat early with the girls but therell be something for you to eat later take your time but be careful craig always gets hurt when he plays you have your key ive got the key jack said he reached around his sister for a quick hug jack got to his feet and by excusing himself to those people sitting in his row he worked his way to the aisle when he arrived he glanced over at francos typical location jack was surprised the man wasnt in his accustomed seat although jack did not stop he searched among the spectators for the hoodlums familiar silhouette when jack got to the door he turned around and quickly scanned the spectators again no franco using his back to press down the doors lever jack backed out of the courtroom not seeing franco in his usual place gave him pause the thought of running into the man in some difficult location with limited egress such as the underground parking garage passed through his mind although several years previously he wouldnt have given the issue a second thought now that he was getting married in two days he wasnt quite so nonchalant with someone else to think about besides himself he needed to be careful and being careful meant being prepared the idea of getting some pepper spray had occurred to him the previous day but hed failed to act on it he decided to change that the thirdfloor elevator lobby was full of people the doors to one of the four courtrooms were propped open and people were being disgorged a trial was in recess there were clumps of people chatting others hurried to the elevators trying to determine which of the eight elevators would come next jack joined the group and found himself looking around warily and wondering if hed run into franco jack doubted there would be any problem in the courthouse building it was outside that he was concerned about at the security checkpoint at the entrance jack stopped to ask one of the uniformed guards if he knew of a nearby hardware store he was told there was one down on charles street which jack was told was the main drag of neighboring beacon hill jack was assured hed have no trouble finding the street especially since it also bisected the park meaning it was the street jack had used to get into the car park where his rentacar was waiting armed with that information and the advice that he should wander westward down through the maze of beacon hill jack left the courthouse again jack scanned for signs of franco but he was nowhere to be seen and jack chuckled at his paranoia having been told the general direction was opposite the courthouses entrance jack made his way around the courthouse building the streets were narrow and twisty hardly the grid hed become accustomed to in new york following his nose jack found himself on derne street that mysteriously became myrtle the buildings for the most part were modest narrow fourstory brick town houses to his surprise he suddenly came upon a charming toddler playground awash with kids and moms he passed aptly named beacon hill plumbing with a friendly chocolate labrador doing a poor job of guarding the entrance as jack crested the hill and began a slow descent he asked a passerby if he was going in the right direction for charles street he was told he was but advised to take a left at the next corner where there was a small convenience store and then a quick right onto pinkney street as the street became progressively steeper he realized that beacon hill was not just a name but a real hill the houses became larger and more elegant although still understated on his left he passed a sunfilled square with a stout wroughtiron fence circling a line of hundredyearold elms and a patch of green grass a few blocks on he came to charles street in comparison with the side streets hed been following charles street was a major boulevard even with parallel parking on either side there was still room for three lanes of traffic lining the street on either side were a wide variety of small shops after stopping one of the many pedestrians and asking for a hardware store jack was directed to charles street supply when he walked into the store he silently questioned if purchasing the pepper spray was necessary away from the courthouse and craigs lawsuit francos threat seemed a distant possibility but he had come that far so he bought the pepper spray from the squarejawed friendly proprietor whose name coincidentally was jack jack had learned this fact by chance when another employee had called out the owners name turning down the offer of a small bag jack slipped the pepper spray into his right jacket pocket as long as he made the effort to buy the narrow canister he wanted to keep it handy thus armed jack strolled the rest of the way along charles street to the boston common and retrieved his hyundai while in the dim dank deserted underground garage jack was glad he had the pepper spray it was in just such a circumstance that he would not like to confront franco but once in his car and on his way to the tollbooth he again laughed at his paranoia and wondered if it was misplaced guilt in retrospect jack knew he should not have kneed the man in stanhopes driveway although there was a lingering thought that had he not done so the situation could have quickly gotten out of hand especially with francos apparent lack of impulse control and penchant for violence as jack pulled out of the murky depths of the garage and into the bright sunshine he made a conscious decision to stop thinking about franco instead he pulled to the side of the road and consulted alexiss city map as he did so he felt his pulse quicken with the thought of a good pickup basketball game what he was searching for was memorial drive and he quickly found it running alongside the charles river basin unfortunately it was in cambridge on the opposite side of the river judging from his boston driving experience he guessed that getting there might be somewhat of a struggle since there were few bridges his concerns were well founded as he was hampered by a confusing interplay of no left turns oneway streets the spottiness of street signs and the overly aggressive boston drivers despite the handicaps jack eventually managed to get on memorial drive and then quickly found the outdoor basketball courts warren s friend david thomas had described jack parked on a small side street got out and raised the trunk of his car pushing aside the autopsy supplies hed gotten from latasha he got out his basketball gear and looked around for a place to change not finding any he climbed back into the car and like a contortionist managed to get out of his clothes and into his shorts without offending any of the multitudes of bicyclists inline skaters and joggers along the banks of the charles river after making sure the car was locked jack jogged back to the basketball courts there were about fifteen men ranging in age from about twenty up at fortysix jack assumed hed be the senior player the game had yet to begin everybody was shooting or showboating with a bit of playground trash talk being exchanged by the courts regulars being wise to the complicated playground etiquette from his many years of experience in a similar environment in new york jack acted nonchalant he began by merely rebounding and passing the balls out to those people whod made their practice shots only later did jack begin shooting and as he expected his accuracy caught the attention of a number of players although nothing was said after fifteen minutes feeling loose jack casually asked for david thomas the person hed asked didnt answer he merely pointed jack approached the man hed been one of the more vociferous of the trashtalkers as jack had surmised he was africanamerican mid to late thirties slightly taller than jack and heavier he had a full beard in fact he had more hair on his face than on the crown of his head but the most distinguishing characteristic was the twinkle of his eye the man was quick to laugh it was evident he enjoyed life when jack approached and introduced himself david unabashedly threw his arms around jack hugged him and then pumped jacks hand any friend of warren wilson is a friend of mine david said enthusiastically and warren says youre a playmaker hey youre running with me okay sure jack said hey aesop david called out to another player its not your night man you aint running with us jack is david gave jack a thump on the back and then added as an aside that boy always has a story thats why we call him aesop the play turned out to be terrific as good as jack had experienced in new york very quickly jack realized hed been lucky to be included on davids pickup team although the games were all close davids team continually triumphed which meant that for jack the play was continuous for more than two hours he david and the three others david had selected for the evenings run did not lose by the time it was over jack was exhausted at the sidelines he looked at his watch it was well after seven you going to come by tomorrow night david asked as jack gathered up his things cant say jack said well be here thanks for letting me run with you hey man you earned it jack walked out of the chainlink fenced court on slightly rubbery legs although hed been drenched with sweat at the end of the play it was already gone from the dry warm breeze wafting in off the river jack walked slowly the exercise had done him a world of good for several hours hed not thought of anything besides the immediate requirements of the game but now reality was setting in he was not looking forward to his conversation with laurie tomorrow was thursday and he didnt even know what time hed be able to start the autopsy much less when it would be over and when hed be able to fly back to new york he knew she was going to be understandably upset and he wasnt sure what he should say jack got to his little creamcolored car unlocked the door and started to open it to his surprise a hand came over his shoulder and slammed it shut jack twisted around and found himself looking into francos deepset eyes and nottoopretty face the first thing that flashed through his mind was that the damn tendollarfortyninecent pepper spray was inside his jacket pocket inside the car weve got some unfinished business franco growled jack was close enough to franco to almost be bowled over by the smell of garlic on his breath correction jack said trying to lean back franco was crowding him against the car i dont believe we have ever had business together so it cant be unfinished jack noticed that behind franco and a little to the side was another man who was also involved in the confrontation wiseass franco muttered whats between us concerns you suckerpunching me in the nuts its not a sucker punch when you hit me first grab him antonio franco ordered while moving back a step jack responded by trying to dart between franco and the car with his sneakers on he thought he could easily outrun the two thugs despite his fatigue from the basketball game but franco lunged forward and managed to get a handful of jacks shirt with his right hand pulling jack up short while at the same time hitting him in the mouth with his left fist antonio grabbed one of jacks arms and tried to get ahold of the other to pin them behind jacks back meanwhile franco cocked his right hand back for a knockout blow but the blow never landed instead a short piece of pipe came down on francos shoulder causing him to cry out in surprise and pain his right arm dropped limply to his side while his left hand shot to his injured shoulder and he hunched over the pipe was pointed at antonio let him go man david said more than a dozen other basketball players had materialized in a threatening u around jack franco and antonio several had tire irons one had a baseball bat antonio let jack go and glared at the newcomers i dont believe you guys are from the neighborhood david commented his voice no longer truculent aesop pat them down aesop stepped forward and quickly removed francos gun franco did not resist the second thug was not armed now i recommend you boys remove yourself from the neighborhood david said taking the gun from aesop this aint over franco muttered to jack as he and antonio walked away the basketball players parted to allow them through warren warned me about you david said to jack he said you were prone to get into trouble and that hed had to save your ass on more than one occasion youre lucky we saw these honkies hanging around while we were playing whats the deal its just a misunderstanding jack said evasively he touched his finger to his lip there was a spot of blood if you need some help you let me know right now you better get some ice for that fat lip and why dont you take this gun you might need it if that asshole shows up on your doorstep jack declined the gun and thanked david and the others before climbing into the car the first thing he did was get the canister of pepper spray out next he looked at himself in the rearview mirror the right side of his upper lip was swollen with a bluish cast a trickle of congealed blood ran down his chin good god he murmured warren was right he did have a penchant for getting himself in compromising circumstances he cleaned off the blood as best he could with the bottom of his tshirt on the way back to the bowmans jack considered fibbing and saying his injury was from basketball bruises were not uncommon with as much as he played and the fact that basketball was a contact sport in his experience the problem was that craig and alexis were going to be downcast after the days testimony and he didnt want to add to their burden he was afraid they might feel inappropriately responsible if he told the truth being as quiet as possible jack used the key alexis had given him to come in the front entrance he was carrying his clothes and shoes in his arms his goal was to slip downstairs and quickly shower before running into anyone he was eager to ice his lip but it had already been long enough since the injury that another fifteen minutes was hardly critical as he silently closed the front door he stopped with his hand on the doorknob his sixth sense was nagging him the house was too quiet every other time hed entered thered been background noise a radio a ringing cell phone childrens chatter or the tv now there was nothing and the silence was foreboding from having seen the lexus in the driveway he was reasonably sure at least the parents were home his immediate concern was that something had gone wrong at the trial continuing to clutch his clothes against his chest jack moved quickly and silently down the hall to the archway leading into the great room he leaned through the opening expecting the room beyond to be deserted to his surprise the whole family was there on the couch with the parents at either end they appeared as if they were watching television but the tv was off from his vantage point jack could not see any faces for a moment he stood still watching and listening no one moved or spoke mystified jack stepped into the room and approached when he got about ten feet away he tentatively called out alexiss name he didnt want to disturb them if it was some family thing but he couldnt seem to walk away either both craigs and alexiss heads shot around craig glared back at jack alexis got to her feet her face was drawn and her eyes were red something was wrong something was very wrong newton massachusetts wednesday june pm so there you have it alexis said shed told jack the story about how she and craig had come home after the trial had been recessed to find their terrified daughters bound and gagged with duct tape shed spoken slowly and deliberately craig had spat out a few gory details like the fact tracy had been dragged from the shower stark naked and rudely struck jack was speechless he was sitting on the coffee table facing his sister and her family as the story unfolded his eyes jumped from alexis who was anxious fearful and concerned to craig who was beside himself with outrage to three children who were shocked and clearly traumatized all three children were sitting silent and immobile tracy had her legs tucked under herself and her arms folded across her chest she was dressed in oversized sweat clothes her hair was frizzed there was no bare midriff christina and meghan both had their arms clutched around their legs with their knees jutting up into the air all three had raw red bands across their lower faces from the duct tape tracy had a split lip are you guys all right jack asked the children it appeared to him that only tracy had been physically abused and thankfully it looked minor they are as well as can be expected alexis said how did the intruders get in they forced the back door craig snapped they were obviously professionals has anything been stolen jack asked his eyes rapidly scanned the room for any damage but everything seemed to be in order not that we can determine alexis said what did they want then jack asked it was to convey a message alexis said they gave tracy a verbal message to give to us what jack asked impatiently when alexis didnt elaborate no autopsy craig snapped the message was no autopsy or theyd be back to hurt the kids jacks eyes rocketed back and forth between craig and alexis he could not believe his offer to help could have caused such a situation this is crazy he blurted this cant be happening tell that to the kids craig challenged im sorry jack said he looked away from the bowmans faces he was crushed hed been the cause of such a disaster he shook his head and looked back particularly at craig and alexis well fine then no autopsy were not sure were ready to give in to this kind of extortion alexis said despite whats happened were not ruling an autopsy out it seems to us that if someone is willing to go to the extent of threatening children to block the autopsy thats all the more reason to do it jack nodded the thought had occurred to him as well but it wasnt for him to put tracy meghan and christina any more at risk besides the only culprit that came to his mind was tony fasano and his motivation could only involve fear of losing his contingency fee jack looked at craig whose anger had seemingly lessened a degree as the conversation progressed if theres any risk at all im not for it craig said but were thinking we can eliminate the risk have you called the police jack asked no we havent alexis said that was the second part of the message no autopsy no police you have to call the police jack said but his words rang hollow since hed not reported either his confrontation with fasano et al the previous day or his confrontation with franco a halfhour earlier were considering our options craig explained weve been talking it over with the girls they are going to stay with their grandparents for a few days until this trial is over my mom and dad live up in lawrence massachusetts and they are on their way down here to pick them up ill probably be going along with them alexis said you dont have to mom tracy said speaking for the first time well be fine with gramps and grandma no one knows where the girls will be craig explained theyll stay out of school at least for the rest of this week and maybe for the year since theres only a few days left theyve promised not to use their cell phones or tell anyone where they are jack nodded but he didnt know what he was agreeing to it seemed to him he was getting mixed messages there was no way the risk for the children could be completely eliminated he was concerned that alexis and craig might not be thinking clearly under the stress of the trial the only thing jack was certain of was that the police had to be notified listen jack said the only person that comes to mind who might be behind this outrage is tony fasano and his cronies we thought the same craig said but it seems almost too venal so were trying to keep an open mind the one thing that has particularly surprised me during my trial is the animosity colleagues feel about my concierge practice it gives some credence to the rhetorical questions you posed last night about a conspiracy jack allotted the idea a quick thought but other than being grist for an avowed conspiracytheory aficionado he gave the chances of such a scenario an extremely low probability even though hed suggested it the previous evening tony fasano and his tag team were a much more likely possibility especially since tony had already threatened him i dont know if youve noticed my fat lip he said gingerly touching the swelling it would be hard to miss alexis said was it from basketball i was going to pass it off as such jack admitted but it was from another runin with tony fasanos franco its becoming a regrettable daily ritual those bastards craig snarled are you okay alexis questioned with concern im better than i would have been had my newly made boston basketball buddies not intervened on my behalf in the nick of time franco had an accomplice oh my god alexis said were sorry to involve you in this i take full responsibility jack said and im not looking for sympathy what im trying to suggest is that fasano et al were probably behind what happened here as well the point is the police have to be notified on both accounts you can call the police about your problem craig said but i dont want to gamble on my childrens safety i dont think theres a damn thing the police can do these people that came here were professionals with ski masks nondescript workers uniforms and gloves and the newton police force is not accustomed to this kind of thing its just a suburban town i disagree jack said i bet your local police have seen a lot more than you imagine and forensics is a powerful tool you have no idea what they could find they could associate this event with others they can surely increase surveillance one of the problems if you dont report it is that you are playing into the hands of whoever did this you are allowing yourselves to be extorted of course were being extorted craig yelled loud enough for the kids to jump good god man you think were stupid easy craig alexis advised she put her arms around tracy who was sitting next to her i have a suggestion jack said i have a very good friend in new york who is a senior detective with the new york city police department i can call him and just get the benefit of his expertise and experience we can ask him what you should do i dont want to be coerced craig said no one is going to coerce you jack said i guarantee it i think jack should call his friend alexis said we hadnt decided for sure about the police fine craig said throwing up his hands what do i know jack went through the pockets of his jacket and located his phone he flipped it open and speeddialed lou soldano at home it was a little after eight pm which was probably the best time to catch the detective but he wasnt home jack left a message on his voicemail next he tried lous cell phone and got the detective in his car on his way out to a homicide in queens while the bowmans listened jack gave lou a thumbnail sketch of what hed been doing and what had happened in boston he concluded by saying he was sitting with his sister her husband and the children at that very minute and the question was should they notify the police or not theres no question lou said without hesitating they have to notify the police they are concerned the newton police might not be experienced enough to justify the risk you say they are right there with you yes right across from me put me on speakerphone jack did as lou requested and held the phone out in front of himself lou formally introduced himself expressed his sympathies for their ordeal and then said i have a very very good friend who is my counterpart with the boston police department we were in the service together aeons ago he is very experienced in every kind of crime including what you people are victims of ill be happy to call him and ask him to personally become involved he lives either in your town or west newton its newton something im sure he knows the guys on the newton force its up to you i can call him right away his name is liam flanagan hes a terrific guy and let me tell you something your kids are at more risk if you dont report the incident than if you do i know that for a fact alexis looked at craig i think we should take him up on his offer all right craig said with some reluctance did you hear that jack asked i did lou said ill get right on it hang on lou jack said he took him off speakerphone excused himself from the bowmans and walked into the hall out of earshot lou when you talk to flanagan see if he could get me a gun a gun lou questioned thats a tall order see if its possible im feeling more vulnerable than usual is your permit current yes for new york i went through the formal training and everything youre the one who pushed me to do it i just never got the gun ill see what i can do as jack flipped his phone closed the front doorbell chimed alexis came hurrying past it must be grandma and gramps she said but she was wrong it was randolph bingham dressed casually but as elegantly as usual is craig ready for his rehearsal randolph inquired noticing alexiss surprise hes expecting me alexis acted confused for a beat after having been so certain it was craigs parents at the door rehearsal she questioned yes craig will be testifying in the morning and we agreed some rehearsal was in order come in alexis said embarrassed at her hesitation randolph took note of jacks shorts and soiled bloodstained tshirt but said nothing as alexis led him down the hall and into the family room randolph was next to be apprised of what had happened that afternoon at the bowman home as the story unfolded his expression changed from his normal mildly condescending aloofness to one of concern have the girls been seen by a doctor he asked not other than craig alexis responded we didnt call their pediatrician randolph looked at craig i could make a motion for a continuance of your case if youd like what are the chances of the judge granting it craig asked theres no way to know it would be entirely at judge davidsons discretion to be honest with you i think id rather get this nightmare trial over with craig said and its probably the safest for the kids as you wish randolph said i assume you have contacted the police alexis and craig exchanged a glance then alexis looked over at jack whod come back into the room thats in the process jack said he then quickly outlined the plan when he finished he went on to explain their belief that tony fasano had something to do with the episode using tonys very specific threat to jack that he would be history if jack carried out the autopsy that is clearly assault randolph said you could bring charges the episode is a little more complicated jack said the only witness was fasanos thug who i ended up striking after he struck me the bottom line is that i personally have no intention of pressing charges is there any proof whatsoever tony fasano was behind todays criminal acts randolph asked if there is im certain i could get a mistrial no proof craig said my daughters said they might be able to recognize a voice but they are not at all certain perhaps the police will have more luck randolph said what about the autopsy is that going to be done or not were trying to decide alexis said obviously it is the girls safety that is the issue craig said if it were to be done when would it be the body is scheduled to be exhumed in the morning jack said ill do the autopsy immediately but the initial results will only involve gross pathology thats very late in the course of events randolph said perhaps its not worth the effort or the risk tomorrow after dr bowman testifies im certain the judge will rule that the plaintiff has met his burden i will then present the defense which will be the testimony of our experts that means friday morning will be closing arguments jacks phone rang he still had it in his hand and it startled him he quickly left the room before answering it was lou i got ahold of liam and i told him the story and gave him the address hes going to be right over with some of the newton police hes a good guy did you ask about the gun i did he was not excited about the idea but i gave him glowing reports about your integrity and all that bullshit well whats the bottom line is he going to come through or what if all goes well theyll be digging up the body in the morning and thanks to all these threats ill feel like a sitting duck he said hed fix you up but hes going to hold me responsible what does that mean i assume hes going to give you a gun so be careful with the damn thing thanks for the advice dad jack said ill try my damnedest to shoot as few people as possible jack returned to the family room craig alexis and randolph were still discussing the autopsy issues the consensus had tripped in favor of still doing it despite the time constraint the main argument from randolph was the possibility of using any potentially significant findings to help with the appeal process if an appeal became necessary either to vacate the verdict to obtain a new trial or to allocate the award according to contributory negligence randolph called to everyones attention that the records clearly documented that patience stanhope refused on several occasions against medical advice to have any more cardiac evaluation after her questionable ecg stress test when a break came in the conversation jack informed the group that detective lieutenant liam flanagan was on his way we want you to do the autopsy if you are still willing alexis said to jack seemingly ignoring his statement i gathered as much he said im happy to do it if thats what you people want he looked at craig craig shrugged im not going to go against the grain craig said with all the stress im under i dont trust my judgment fair enough jack said once again jack felt craig was demonstrating unexpected insight the doorbell rang again and again alexis ran to get it saying it must be the grandparents but for the second time she was wrong standing at the door were five policemen two of which were in newton police department uniforms alexis invited them into the house and led them to the great room i am detective lieutenant liam flanagan the big redfaced irishman said in a booming voice he had bright babyblue eyes and a smattering of freckles across his flat prizefighters nose he proceeded to introduce the others who included detective greg skolar officers sean orourke and david shapiro and crimescene investigator derek williams as liam made the introductions jack studied him there was something familiar as if jack had met the man sometime in the past yet he thought that unlikely suddenly it came to him when he had a chance to introduce himself to liam he asked did i see you at the medical examiners office this morning yes you did liam said effusively he laughed now i remember you you went into the autopsy room after getting a brief overview of the incident at the bowman residence the crimescene investigator and the two uniformed officers went off to check out the yard while there was still a little daylight the sun had set but it was not yet completely dark the two detectives were mostly interested in the children and the children responded to being the center of attention while that was going on randolph asked craig if he was up to the rehearsal theyd planned for the following days testimony how necessary do you think it is craig protested he was understandably preoccupied id say exceedingly crucial randolph commented perhaps you should recall your performance during your deposition it would be calamitous to repeat it in front of the jurors it has become apparent that the opposing sides stratagem is to present you as an arrogant uncaring md who was more interested in getting to symphony hall on time with your trophy girlfriend than your seriously ill patients welfare we must prevent you from presenting yourself in any way that substantiates such allegations the only way is to rehearse you are a good doctor but you are a poor witness chastened by randolph s lessthanflattering assessment craig docilely agreed to a practice session he interrupted the detectives long enough to tell the children hed just be in the library suddenly jack and alexis found themselves regarding each other at first they had been listening intently to the childrens description of their ordeal but when it became repetitious as the detectives diligently searched for any possible missed but significant information their interest waned in order to talk they stepped back into the kitchen area i want to say again how sorry i am about everything that has happened jack offered my intentions were good but ive been more of a hindrance than a help none of this could have been anticipated alexis said you neednt apologize you have been an enormous help to me moralewise and also to craig hes been a different man since youve been here in fact im still shocked at the insight he expressed at lunch i hope its lasting insight what about the girls how do you see them reacting to this experience im not sure alexis admitted theyre pretty together kids despite their father generally not having been available as theyve been growing up on the other hand ive been very close to each one theres good communication well just have to take it day by day and let them voice their feelings and concerns do you have any specific plans for them mainly to get them to their grandparents they adore their grandmother they all have to sleep in the same room which they usually complain about but under the circumstances i think it will be good for them are you going that had been what we were discussing when you came in my inclination is to go its a way of acknowledging that their fears are legitimate which is important the last thing that should be done is to offer them platitudes that theyll be fine and they shouldnt have to be afraid they should be afraid it was obviously a very traumatizing ordeal i thank god they werent physically injured more than they were how are you going to make your decision whether to go or not im probably going the reason there was a question was because craig voiced some interest in my staying and because tracy said she didnt want me to go you heard her but i think its teenage bluster and as much as im concerned about craig and his needs if it comes down to an eitheror decision the kids win hands down do you think theyll need professional help like some sort of therapy i dont think so only if their fearfulness is prolonged or blows out of proportion i suppose ultimately it will be a judgment call luckily i have some colleagues at work who i can exploit for an opinion if need be ive been thinking jack said since my presence has caused so much trouble maybe it would be best for everyone if i move into a hotel in town absolutely not alexis said i wont hear of it youre here and you are saying here are you sure i wont take it personally im positively sure lets not even discuss it the front doorbell chimed yet again this has to be the grandparents alexis said categorically pushing off from the kitchen counter where shed been leaning jack glanced back toward the sitting area where the detectives and children were it appeared that their interview was coming to an end the two uniformed policemen and the crimescene technician had returned to the great room and were dealing with the ducttape strips that had bound the children a few minutes later alexis brought in the elder bowmans leonard was a thick pasty man with a twoday growth of beard an oldfashioned crew cut and an expansive gut suggesting he spent far too much time drinking beer in his favorite recliner in front of the tv when jack was introduced to him jack learned something even more idiosyncratically distinctive leonard was a man of few words who would have put the laconic spartans to shame when jack shook hands with the man he merely grunted rose bowman was the antipode when she appeared and the children rushed her she bubbled with delight and concern she was a short stocky woman with frizzed white hair bright eyes and yellow teeth as the children dragged their grandmother to the couch jack found himself momentarily isolated with leonard in an effort to make conversation jack commented on how much the kids liked their grandmother all jack got in return was another muffled grunt with the police doing their thing the kids involved with the grandmother alexis busy packing for the kids and herself and craig sequestered with randolph in the library jack was stuck with leonard after a few more vain attempts to wring words out of the retirees mouth jack gave up he checked with liam flanagan to be sure he would be there for at least another thirty minutes picked up his pile of clothes and shoes from where hed stacked them on the hearth found alexis who was up in one of the kids rooms and told her he was going to shower and went downstairs to his room as he was showering he guiltily remembered hed not yet called laurie as he got out of the shower he glanced at himself in the mirror and winced hed completely forgotten about the ice and his lip was still swollen and blue combining that with the left side of his face which was still red he looked as if hed been in a barroom brawl he considered getting some ice from the refrigerator hed seen in the basement proper but decided it would have minimal effect since too much time had elapsed so he passed on the idea instead he dressed and got out his cell phone with the signal strength almost nonexistent jack gave up on the phone idea as well he climbed the stairs and met alexis the girls and the grandparents in the main hall alexis had finished packing and had already put the luggage in the station wagon the girls were pleading with rose to ride with them but rose said she had to go with gramps it was then that jack heard leonards only words come on rose he said grimly drawing the words out it was an order not a request dutifully rose detached herself from the children and hurried after her husband whod stepped out the front door will i see you in court tomorrow alexis asked jack as she herded the children toward the door to the garage the girls had already said their goodbyes to craig who was still working in the library with randolph at some point jack said i honestly dont know what to expect the schedule to be its out of my hands all at once alexis spun around her expression reflecting a sudden realization oh my gosh she exclaimed i just remembered you are getting married on friday tomorrow is already thursday ive been so preoccupied ive completely forgotten im sorry your wifetobe must hate me for dragging you up here and keeping you hostage she knows me well enough to know where to assign blame if shes inclined so youll do the autopsy and then head back to new york thats the plan at the door to the garage alexis told the girls to say goodbye to their uncle each gave jack an obedient hug only christina spoke she whispered in jacks ear that she was sorry his daughters had burnt up in the plane the totally unexpected comment took jack by such surprise that it undermined his emotional equilibrium and he had to choke back a tear when alexis gave him a hug she sensed his new emotion and pulled back to look him in the eyes mistaking its origin hey she said were fine the kids are going to be fine trust me jack nodded and found his voice ill see you sometime tomorrow and i hope to hell to have something to offer that will make this all worthwhile me too alexis said she climbed into the station wagon and activated the garage door which rolled up with a fearful clanking it was at that point that jack realized he had to move his car it was parked next to craigs lexus and blocking the driveway jack sprinted past alexis motioning her to wait he backed his hyundai into the street and waited while alexis did the same with a beep and a wave she drove off into the night as jack pulled back into the driveway he glanced at the two newton police patrol cars and the two other nondescript dark sedans belonging to the two detectives parked along the street he wondered how close to finishing they were since he was eager to talk to them in private particularly liam flanagan in answer to his question all five police officers emerged from the bowmans front door as jack climbed from his car excuse me jack called he jogged in their direction catching up to them midway on the bowmans serpentine front walk dr stapleton liam said we were looking for you have you finished checking out the scene jack asked for the moment any luck the duct tape will be analyzed at the crime lab as will some fibers from the kids bathroom there wasnt a lot we did find something on the grounds that im not at liberty to divulge which could be promising but all in all it was obviously a professional job what about the autopsy thats at the center of this extortion attempt detective greg skolar asked is it going to happen or what if the exhumation happens then the autopsy will happen jack said ill be doing it as soon as the body is available strange to have such an incident over an autopsy detective skolar said are you expecting some shocking revelations we dont know what to expect all we know for certain is the patient had a heart attack obviously this has heightened our curiosity weird detective skolar said for your peace of mind as well as the bowmans well have the house under twentyfourhour surveillance for a few days im sure the bowmans will be appreciative i know it will make me sleep better keep us informed of any new developments detective skolar said he handed jack a business card before shaking his hand the other three uniformed officers shook his hand as well can i speak to you for a few minutes jack asked liam by all means liam replied i was about to ask you the same question jack and liam said goodbye to the newton police and the police drove off in their respective vehicles which were rapidly swallowed by the inky darkness night had fallen reluctantly but now the transition was complete the only light in the neighborhood was from the bowmans front windows and from a lonely streetlamp in the opposite direction the police had gone above in the dark sky a narrow scimitarshaped sliver of a moon peeked through the leafy canopy of the trees lining the street want to sit in my limo liam asked as they reached his bottomoftheline ford actually its beautiful outside jack said it had cooled from the day and the temperature was invigorating with both men leaning against the vehicle jack told the story of his confrontation with tony fasano the threat hed received and his two fisticuffs with his crony franco liam listened intently im acquainted with tony fasano liam responded hes an individual whos going in a lot of different directions including personal injury litigation and now medical malpractice hes even done some criminal work defending a handful of lowlevel nasties which is how i am aware of him i have to say hes more clever than you might initially give him credit for ive had the same impression do you think hes behind this professional but crude extortion attempt with the people hes in bed with hes got the contacts it stands to reason considering the way he threatened me but then again it seems almost too simple and too stupid considering how clever he apparently is do you have anyone else you suspect not really jack said he briefly considered bringing up the conspiracy idea but he thought the chances the notion had any validity were so infinitesimally small he was embarrassed to mention it ill check into the fasano angle liam said his office is in the north end so he falls under our jurisdiction but with no evidence at least so far there is little we can do especially in the short run i know jack said listen i appreciate your taking the time to come out here tonight and get involved i was afraid the bowmans might not have reported the episode im always willing to do a favor for my old buddy lou soldano i got the impression you guys are really tight jack nodded and smiled inwardly hed originally met lou when both of them were pursuing laurie he felt it was a tribute to lous personality that when lous chances with laurie dimmed by his own doing he was gracious enough to become jacks advocate which turned out to be key jacks pursuit of laurie had not been without its bumps thanks to jacks psychological baggage which brings me to the final issue liam said he unlocked his car and rummaged in a duffel bag on the front seat he turned to jack and handed him a snubnose smith and wessen youd better be tight with him because this is something i dont usually do jack turned over the revolver in his hand it glistened in the darkness reflecting the light coming from the bowmans windows youd better have one hundred ten percent good reason to use this thing liam said and i hope to hell you dont rest assured it would have to be life or death jack said but with the girls not here maybe i dont need it he extended the revolver back toward liam liam held up his hand palm out keep it youve been smacked a couple of times this franco sounds like hes got a couple of screws loose just be sure i get it back when are you leaving sometime tomorrow which is all the more reason i shouldnt take it take it liam insisted he handed jack his business card before walking around the car and opening the driversside door we can hook up when you leave or you can drop it by headquarters in a bag with my name on it dont go advertising what it is ill be sure to be subtle jack said then he added humorously its my middle name not according to lou liam laughed but he said you were an enormously responsible guy and thats what i am counting on with a final goodbye liam climbed into his car and quickly disappeared in the same direction as the newton police jack handled the gun in the darkness it felt deceptively innocent like the toy guns he had as a child yet as a medical examiner he knew its destructive potential hed traced more bullet tracks in cadavers than hed care to admit always marveling at the degree of trauma putting the gun in one pocket jack took out his cell from another he had understandable ambivalence about calling laurie because he knew she would be justly upset and angry over his remaining in boston from her perspective his returning home thursday maybe even thursday might with the wedding at pm on friday was ludicrous unreasonable and even hurtful yet he felt powerless hed become ensnared in a quicksand of circumstance after all that had happened some of it his doing there was no way he could just abandon alexis and craig moreover he was genuinely intrigued because someone for some reason seriously did not want an autopsy and as this reality tumbled around inside his brain something new occurred to him what about the hospital could something have happened at the hospital the night patience stanhope had been brought in that needed to be covered up he hadnt thought about that angle and even though it was unlikely it seemed a hell of a lot more likely than the outlandish conciergemedicine conspiracy idea with trepidation and just about every neuron in his brain associated with feeling guilty firing jack speeddialed lauries cell phone newton massachusetts wednesday june pm its about time laurie said curtly jack winced her greeting was degrees from the night before heralding the kind of conversation he feared its almost ten oclock laurie complained why havent you called its been eight hours since your cowardly message on my voicemail im sorry jack said as contritely as he could its been a rather strange evening although such a comment was a deliberate understatement it was hardly the kind of sarcastic humor that jack was capable of he was making a conscious effort to resist the tendency that had become reflex with his devilmaycare approach to life after his family tragedy being careful with his vocabulary and as succinctly as possible jack told laurie about the breakin the terrorizing of the children and the visit by the police made possible by lous timely intercession jack then told her about tony fasano and his threat as well as about franco including the previous days episode which he had not mentioned to her the evening before this is incredible laurie said after a pause most of the anger had gone out of her voice are you all right ive got a swollen lip and a few busted capillaries over a cheekbone but ive had worse from basketball im okay im nervous about this franco he sounds like a lunatic hes been on my mind as well jack said he thought about mentioning the gun but decided it might make her more nervous im gathering you believe tony fasano is behind the episode with the children jack repeated some of the conversation hed had with liam flanagan how are the children they seem remarkably poised considering what theyve been through maybe it has something to do with their mother being a psychologist alexis is terrific with them she took them to their grandparents craigs parents for a few days to give you an idea the littlest one was together enough to empathize with me about my kids when they were saying goodbye it took me completely by surprise she sounds precociously selfpossessed laurie said thats a blessing for the bowmans now lets talk about us whats the bottom line about you coming back here worst case is tomorrow evening jack said ill do the autopsy write up the results whatever they turn out to be and give them to craigs lawyer even if i wanted to he doesnt think he could get me on the stand as a witness so thats not an issue you are cutting this mighty close laurie said if i end up being the bride left at the altar ill never forgive you i just want you to know that i said worst case maybe ill be there in the middle of the afternoon promise me youre not going to do anything foolish jack could think of a lot of great retorts for that setup but he resisted instead he said ill be careful then he added to make her even more comfortable the newton police have promised extra surveillance confident laurie was reasonably assuaged jack extended some appropriate endearments and then said goodbye he then made two other quick calls he spoke briefly to lou to explain what had happened with liam flanagan and to thank him for his help he told him hed see him at the church on friday next he called warren and told him that not only was david a good bball player but hed also saved jacks ass jack had to hold the phone away from his ear when warren responded jack told him hed see him at the church also with all his calls out of the way jack once again took in the peaceful scene the concave snippet of moon had moved a little higher in the sky and had cleared the black silhouettes of the trees a few stars even twinkled in the sky despite the general nighttime glow sent heavenward from the entire boston metropolitan area jack took in a big lungful of the cool fresh air it was bracing in the distance a dog barked the serenity made him wonder what the morrow would bring would there be violence at the exhumation he didnt know but the thought made him glad liam had insisted he keep the gun he patted it in his pocket its weighty solidness made him feel more secure even though he knew statistics suggested the opposite with a sense of fatalism that whatever was going to happen would happen no matter what he did jack shrugged turned and headed into the house without alexis and the children at home jack felt somewhat like an intruder after he closed the front door the silence of the house was almost palpable even though he could hear craigs and randolph s muffled voices from the library he walked into the great room and went to the refrigerator there were plenty of fixings and he quickly made a sandwich he popped open a beer and took both over to the couch careful to keep the sound low he turned on the tv and after rapidly scanning the channels he found a news broadcast still feeling like a stranger in a strange land he sat back and ate by the time he had finished the food and most of the beer he heard raised voices coming from the library it was obviously a disagreement jack quickly turned up the tv to keep from hearing it made him feel similar to when hed almost been caught snooping into craigs doctors bag a few minutes later the front door to the house slammed hard enough for jack to feel the vibration a few minutes after that craig came into the great room it was apparent he was fuming from the way he acted particularly the way he threw ice cubes into an oldfashioned glass and slammed shut the glassfront cabinet door he helped himself to a healthy dollop of scotch then brought the drink and bottle over to the couch do you mind craig asked motioning to the couch where jack was sitting not at all jack said wondering why he bothered to ask jack moved closer to the opposite end he turned off the tv and twisted around to face his host whod plopped down still holding both bottle and glass craig took a large slug of his scotch and swished it around in his mouth before swallowing he was staring into the empty fireplace how did the rehearsal go jack asked he felt obligated to try to have a conversation craig merely laughed scornfully do you feel prepared jack persisted i suppose im as ready as ill ever be but thats not saying a whole bunch what was randolph s advice craig forced another laugh you know the usual im not supposed to pick my nose fart too loudly or laugh at the judge im serious jack said id like to know craig regarded jack a bit of the tenseness that had been so apparent drained from his face the usual admonitions like i mentioned at lunch and maybe a few more im supposed to avoid stuttering and inappropriate laughter can you believe that tony fasano is going to verbally attack me and im supposed to calmly let it happen if anything im supposed to look hurt and not angry so the jury will sympathize with me can you imagine i think it sounds reasonable craigs eyes narrowed as he looked at jack maybe to you but not to me i couldnt help but hear raised voices i mean i couldnt hear what it was about did you and randolph disagree on something not really craig said he just pissed me off of course that was what he was trying to do he was playacting as if he were fasano you see the problem is that when im on the stand im sworn whereas tony fasano wont be that means he can make up and say whatever allegation he wants and im supposed to have thick skin but i dont i even got mad at randolph im hopeless jack watched as craig drained his glass and then poured another drink he knew that often the personality traits of really good clinicians like craig made them susceptible to malpractice suits and the same traits made them poor witnesses in their own defense he also knew that the opposite was true really bad doctors made an effort at bedside manner to make up for their professional deficiencies and avoid suits and the same doctors if they were sued could often offer oscarworthy performances on their behalf its just not looking good craig continued more sullen than angry and im still worried randolph is not the right guy despite his experience hes so damn pretentious as slimy as tony fasano is he has the jurors eating out of his hands juries have a surprising way of eventually seeing through the fog jack said the other thing that really pisses me off about randolph is he keeps talking about the appeal craig said as if hed not heard jack that was what put me over the top right at the end of our session i couldnt believe hed bring it up at that point of course i know i have to think about it just like i have to think about what ill be doing with the rest of my life if i lose im sure as hell not going to stay in practice thats a double tragedy jack said the profession cannot afford to lose its best clinicians nor can your patients if i lose this case im never going to be able to look at a patient without worrying about being sued and having to go through this kind of experience again this has been the worst eight months of my life but what would you do if you dont practice youve got a young family craig shrugged probably work for big pharma in some capacity there are lots of opportunities i know several people who have gone that route the other possibility is managing somehow to do my research fulltime could you really do that sodiumchannel work fulltime and be content jack questioned absolutely its exciting stuff its basic science yet has immediate clinical application i suppose big pharma is interested in that arena without doubt switching subjects jack said while i was outside saying goodbye to everyone i had a thought that i wanted to run by you about what about patience stanhope ive got the whole case file which ive read over several times it includes all your records but the only thing from the hospital is the emergencyroom sheet thats all there was she was never admitted i know that but theres no labwork other than what is mentioned in the notes and no order sheet what im wondering is whether a major mistake could have occurred at the hospital like the wrong drug given or a large overdose if so whoever was responsible could be desperate about covering up their tracks and be more than happy you are set up to take the fall i know its a theory somewhere out there in left field but its not as far out as the conspiracy idea whats your take i mean its clear from what happened here this afternoon to your children that someone is very very against my doing an autopsy and if fasano is not to blame the reason has to involve something other than money craig stared off for a minute mulling over the idea its another wild but interesting thought i assume that during discovery all the pertinent records from the hospital were obtained i believe so craig said and an argument against such a theory is that i was there with the patient the whole time i would have sensed something like that if theres a major overdose or the wrong drug theres usually a marked change in the patients status there wasnt from the time i first saw her at the stanhope residence until she was pronounced she just faded away unresponsive to anything we did right jack said but maybe the idea is something to be kept in mind when i get to do the autopsy i was planning on a toxicology screen regardless but if theres a chance of an overdose or the wrong drug its more critical what does a toxicology screen pick up the usual drugs and even some unusual ones if they have high enough concentrations craig polished off his second drink eyed the scotch bottle and thought better of pouring a third he stood up sorry not to be a better host but i have a date with my favorite hypnotic agent its bad news mixing alcohol with sleeping pills really craig questioned superciliously i never knew that see you in the morning jack said he felt craigs provocative comment did not deserve a response are you worried about the bad guys coming back craig asked in a taunting tone im not jack said me neither at least not until after the autopsy is done are you having second thoughts jack asked of course im having second thoughts especially with you telling me the chances of finding something relevant are small and randolph saying its not going to influence the trial irrespective of whats found because it wont be admissible i said the chances of finding something were small before someone broke into your house warning you not to allow me to do it but this isnt an argument its up to you and alexis shes set on it well its up to you guys you have to tell me craig do you want me to do it i dont know what to think especially after two double scotches why dont you just give me your final word in the morning jack said he was losing patience craig was not the easiest guy to like even without two double scotches what kind of person would be willing to terrorize three young girls to make a point craig asked jack shrugged it was the kind of question that didnt need an answer he said good night and craig did the same before walking unsteadily out of the room while staying on the sofa but leaning his head way back and hyperextending himself jack could just catch a glimpse of craig slowly mounting the stairs it seemed to him craig was already evidencing a touch of alcoholinduced dyskinesia as though he didnt quite know where his feet were always the doctor jack wondered if he should check on craig in the middle of the night it was a question with no easy answer since craig would not take kindly to such solicitousness with its implication of neediness an anathema to him jack got himself up and stretched he could feel the weight of the revolver and it was comforting even though he was not concerned about any intruders he looked at his watch it was too early to try to fall asleep he looked at the blank tv no interest there for lack of a better plan he went to get craigs case file and carried it to the study as a man of habit he sat in the same chair hed occupied on previous occasions after turning on the floor lamp he searched through the file for the hospital er record pulling out the sheet jack settled back hed skimmed through it before particularly the part about the cyanosis now he wanted to read every word but as he was doing so he became distracted his eyes had drifted to craigs oldfashioned doctors bag all of a sudden a new thought occurred to him he wondered what the incidence of false positives was with the bedside biomarker kit first jack went to the door to determine whether if he could hear craig moving about upstairs even though craig had implied he didnt care if jack looked in his bag jack still felt uncomfortable but when he was convinced all was quiet he pulled the leather doctors bag from its shelf opened it and got out the biomarker kit opening up the product insert he read that the technology was based on monoclonal antibodies which are highly specific meaning the chance of a false positive was probably close to zero oh well jack said out loud the insert went back in the box and the box went back to its location in the very bottom of the bag among the three discarded vials and the bag went back on the shelf so much for another clever idea he thought jack returned to the reading chair and to the er sheet unfortunately there was nothing even remotely suspicious and as hed noticed on the first reading the cyanosis notation was the most interesting part all of a sudden the two phones on the two desks sprang to life simultaneously the raucous ring shocked jack in the otherwise silent house the insistent ring continued and jack counted them after the fifth ring he began to believe craig might not be hearing it and jack heaved himself out of the reading chair turning on the lamp on alexiss desk he looked at the caller id the name was leonard bowman after the seventh ring jack was certain it was not going to be answered so he lifted the handset as he suspected it was alexis thanks for picking up she said after jacks hello i was waiting on craig but i guess his combination nightcap has him in dreamland is everything okay there alexis asked peaches and cream jack said how are things there quite well all things considered the girls are doing terrific christina and meghan are already asleep tracy is watching an old movie on tv we all have to sleep in the same room but i think thats a good idea craig is having second thoughts about my doing the autopsy why i thought that was all decided hes having the jitters for the girls sake but it was after hed had two double scotches hes going to let me know tomorrow ill call him in the morning i think it should be done all the more so because of todays threat i mean thats one of the reasons the girls and i came out here plan on doing it ill bring him around after some final small talk including that they would see each other in the courtroom they both hung up back in the reading chair jack tried to concentrate on the case file but he couldnt he kept marveling about how much was going to happen in the next few days and wondering whether there would be any surprises little did he know newton massachusetts thursday june am the unease that jack had experienced after alexis and the kids left the evening before was magnified in the morning jack didnt know if craigs mindset was from the stress of his upcoming testimony or a hangover from his alcohol and sleeping pills but he had reverted to his silent brooding sullenness similar to how hed been on jacks first morning at the bowman residence back then alexis and the children had made the situation sufferable but without them it was decidedly unpleasant jack had tried to be upbeat when hed first emerged from his basement lair but had received a cold stare for his efforts it was only after jack had gotten himself some cereal and milk that craig had said anything i got a call from alexis craig said in a husky forlorn voice she said you two had spoken last night anyway the message is the autopsy is on fine jack responded simply as bad a mood as craig seemed to be in jack couldnt help but wonder what he would say if jack owned up to having gone upstairs in the middle of the night to take a look at him and listen to his breathing everything had seemed normal enough so jack had not tried to wake him which had been his original plan it was a good thing he hadnt considering craigs current disposition without the intrusion and reminder of his neediness after craig was ready to leave he partially compensated for his behavior by coming over to jack who was at the dining table drinking coffee and glancing at the newspaper im sorry for being a lousy host craig said in a more normal voice devoid of either superciliousness or sarcasm this isnt my shining moment out of respect jack pushed back his chair and stood up i understand what you are going through ive never experienced a malpractice suit but several of my friends did back in my ophthalmology days i know its awful and as bad as divorce it sucks craig said then craig did something totally unexpected he gave jack an awkward hug then immediately let go before jack had had a chance to react he avoided looking jack in the eyes while he adjusted his suit jacket for what its worth i appreciate you coming up here thanks for your efforts and im sorry you had to take a couple of whacks for me im glad to have done it jack said struggling to avoid sarcastically saying my pleasure he hated being less than truthful but hed been caught off guard by the switch in craigs behavior will i see you in the courtroom at some point all right see you then jack watched craig leave once again hed underestimated the man jack went down to his basement guest room and put his belongings in his carryon bag he didnt know what to do about the bed linens he ended up stripping them off the bed and leaving them and the towels in a heap he folded the blankets there was a notepad by the phone he wrote a short thankyou note and put it on the blankets he debated about the front door key but decided to keep it and give it back in person when he returned the case file to alexis he wanted to keep the case file until after the autopsy in case the autopsy raised questions that the case file could shed light on or answer he pulled on his jacket he could feel the gun in one side and his cell phone on the other with the bulging manila envelope under one arm and his carryon in the other hand jack climbed the stairs and opened the front door although the weather had been terrific since hed been in boston it had taken a decided turn for the worse it was darkly overcast and raining jack eyed his hyundai it was about fifty soggy feet away just to the side of the door was an umbrella stand jack pulled one out that said ritzcarlton there was no reason he couldnt give it to alexis when he returned the other things with the umbrella it took several trips leaping over puddles to get his things in the car when all was ready he started the engine turned on the wipers and cleared away the windshields mist with the side of his hand he then backed out of the driveway waved to the policeman sitting in his cruiser apparently watching the house and accelerated down the street he had to use his hand to clear the windshield mist again after only a short distance with one eye on the road he used the other to locate the defrost button once the defrost got up to speed the mist problem abated to help jack cracked the driversside window as jack wound his way through the suburban streets traffic gradually increased due to the dark low cloud cover many cars had their lights on when he got to the entrance to the massachusetts turnpike where he had to wait for a traffic light he was reminded it was rush hour ahead the toll road was swarming with racing autos buses and trucks creating a swirling vaporous mist jack girded himself to enter the fray as he waited for the light to turn green he was aware he was not a particularly good driver especially since he rarely drove after moving to new york city a decade ago jack much preferred his beloved mountain bike even though most people thought it dangerous to bike in city traffic the next thing jack knew something crashed into his cars rear causing his head to bounce off his headrest the moment he had recovered enough he twisted in his seat to look out the waterstreaked back window he couldnt see much other than a large black vehicle pressed up against the rear of his it was at this point that jack realized his car was moving forward despite his foot continuing to compress the brake pedal twisting back around to face forward jacks heart skipped a beat he was being pushed through the red light outside he could hear the horrid grating noise of his locked wheels against the pebblestrewn macadam as well as the growl of the powerful engine propelling him the next thing jack was aware of was a headlight bearing down on him from his left and a car horn blaring a dire warning then came a harrowing screeching sound of rubber against pavement followed by the glaring headlights being diverted ahead reflexively jacks eyes closed expecting an impact into his cars left side when it came it was more of a brush than a crash and jack became aware of the waterblurred image of a car pressed sideways against his hyundai alongside his driversside door there was a scraping of metal against metal jack lifted his foot from the brake thinking the brake was not working and needed to be pumped the second he did so his car shot forward toward the press of racing cars on the turnpike jack jammed his foot back down on the brake pedal he could feel his wheels lock and the grating sound of his tires against the roads surface reoccurred but his forward speed did not lessen jack glanced behind him again the large black car was ineluctably pushing him toward the dangerous toll road that was less than fifty feet away just before spinning his head around to face forward yet again he caught sight of the pushing cars hood ornament although the fleeting image was indistinct in the fog and drizzle jack saw that it consisted of two crescentshaped sprigs bordering a coat of arms he instantly made the association it was the hood ornament of a cadillac and in jacks mind a black cadillac meant franco until proven otherwise since the brake was useless against the cadillacs excessive horsepower jack released it and stomped on the accelerator instead the accent responded nimbly there was another agonizing sound of metal against metal and with a perceptible pop the hyundai managed to detach itself from its bullying fellow automobile gripping the steering wheel in desperation jack merged into the four lanes of speeding highway traffic like hed never merged before at the last second he actually closed his eyes since there was no shoulder on that part of the road so there was no choice but to join the stream of cars in the far righthand lane although the boston drivers had seemed overly aggressive to jack during his previous driving experiences he had to give them credit for being alert and for having rapid reflexes despite a cacophony of horn blowing and screeching tires jacks car managed to merge into the traffic when he blinked his eyes open he found himself compressed between two vehicles with no more than six feet in front and seemingly inches behind unfortunately the car behind was an intimidating hummer and it stayed where it was suggesting the driver was venomously angry jack tried to adjust his speed exactly equal to the car in front despite feeling it was much too fast for the weather he felt he had little choice he was reluctant to slow down for fear the hummer would ram him in a similar fashion as the black cadillac had meanwhile he frantically tried to search for the cadillac in his side and rearview mirrors but it wasnt easy it required taking his eyes off the car in front which was nothing but a hazy blur despite the windshield wipers working at top speed jack didnt see the cadillac but he did catch glimpses of the hummer driver alternately shaking his fist and giving him the finger when he sensed jack was looking in his direction the need to concentrate on driving was not the only handicap in the search for his vehicular assailant whirling eddies of fog and water vapor were whipped up into a frenzy by the rushing vehicles particularly the trucks whose eighteen wheels each almost the size of jacks car flailed against the wet pavement sending billows of mist into the air around the edges of their mud flaps suddenly to jacks right a short stretch of shoulder appeared as a turnout for disabled vehicles he had to make a snap decision since the length of the turnout was not long and at the speed his car and the others were traveling the opportunity would soon be lost impulsively jack veered to the right out of the line of traffic jammed on the brake then fought against the cars tendency to skid first one way then the other with great relief jack was able to bring the car to a stop but he didnt get a moment to rest in the rearview mirror he caught sight of the black cadillac pulling out of the lines of traffic exactly as he had jack sucked in a chestful of air gripped the steering wheel with white knuckles and stomped the accelerator to the floor the acceleration wasnt necksnapping but it was still impressive ahead the fenced end of the pullout rapidly loomed forcing jack again to merge abruptly into the traffic this time it wasnt blind but it caused the same fury in the driver behind yet with the cadillac obviously still in pursuit jack didnt concern himself in fact there was a good side the man continued to express his anger by riding jacks tail under normal circumstances jack would have considered such a situation dangerous and irritating but now it meant that there was no room for the cadillac which would have been far worse than a mere irate driver jack knew that coming ahead some miles down the road was his turnoff that surprisingly forked from the far left lane not too far beyond that were tollbooths marking the end of the toll road jack tried to reason which was better the tollbooths meant staff and maybe even state troopers which was good but it also meant long lines which was bad although david thomas had relieved franco of his gun jack knew the man undoubtedly had access to others if franco was crazy enough to ram him in an attempt to push him out into traffic jack felt hed have little qualms about shooting at him the exit road had less staff and no troopers which was bad but no lines particularly in two fast lanes which was good as jack was weighing these possibilities hed been vaguely aware that some distance beyond the buildings spanning the toll road a true shoulder appeared hed not thought much about it since he had no intention of pulling out of the traffic for a second time what hed not considered was the cadillac using the breakdown lane to catch up it wasnt until the cadillac pulled alongside that jack caught sight of it and when he did he saw that its driversside window was down more important franco was driving with one hand in his other hand was a gun which he proceeded to stick out the window jack touched his brakes and simultaneously his passengerside window shattered into a million pieces and a bullet hole appeared in the plastic cover over the windshield support to jacks immediate left the man behind jack was back to blowing his horn continuously in utter exasperation jack could fully understand his agitation he was also impressed the man had been able to avoid a collision making jack vow never to complain about boston drivers ever again the next instant after jack had touched his brake he pressed the accelerator to the floor and used his newly developed merging technique to move laterally across several lanes of traffic now everybody around him was beeping to beat the band jack couldnt rest on his laurels since franco had pulled an even greater merging feat and was now in the same lane as jack with only one vehicle between them ahead jack saw the sign for his turnoff allstoncambridge left lane rapidly approach and then whip by impulsively he made a snap decision that depended on his agile compact accent being able to make a tighter highspeed turn than francos boatlike vintage cadillac franco cooperated by remaining in lane presumably avoiding using the relatively empty farleft lane to overtake jack for fear of being forced off the road by the swiftly approaching exit jacks entire body tensed as he fixed his eyes on his goal what he wanted to do was execute a left turn as sharp as he could into the exit without rolling the car and clear a triangle of barrelsized yellow plastic containers placed to cushion any vehicles destined to hit the concrete exit abutment what he hoped was that franco would have to sail on past at what he hoped was the proper instant jack whipped the steering wheel counterclockwise he heard the tires screech in protest and felt the powerful centrifugal force attempting to fishtail the car or cause it to flip tentatively he touched the brake not knowing if it helped or hindered for a second it felt as if the car was on two wheels but it straightened itself and agilely missed the protective canisters with several feet to spare rapidly throwing the steering wheel in the opposite direction jack straightened the car on the exit heading for the line of tollbooths directly ahead he began to brake at that point he glanced into the mirror just in time to see franco slam sideways into the apex of yellow barrels what was most impressive was that the cadillac was already upside down ostensibly having immediately rolled when franco tried to follow jack jack winced at the force of the impact which threw tires and other debris into the air he found himself marveling at the degree of francos anger which had obviously trumped any rationality as jack approached the line of tollbooths the two attendants leapt out from their stations abandoning the drivers waiting to pay their tolls one of the attendants was carrying a fire extinguisher jack checked his rearview mirror he now saw tendrils of fire licking up the side of the upended vehicle with the reassurance that there was little he could do jack drove off as he put some distance between himself and the whole episode beginning with franco slamming into the back of his car he got progressively more anxious to the point that he was noticeably shaking in some respects such a response surprised him more than the experience itself had it hadnt been that many years ago that he would have relished such a happening now he felt more responsible laurie was depending on him to stay alive and be at riverside church at one thirty the very next day when jack pulled into the langleypeerson funeral home twenty minutes later hed recovered enough to recognize he had a responsibility to report what he knew about francos accident although he didnt want to take time to go to the boston police remaining in the car he got out his phone and liam flanagans business card which had his cell number jack placed the call when liam answered jack could hear a babble of voices in the background am i calling at a bad time jack asked hell no im in line in starbucks to get my mocha latte whats up jack told the story of his latest runin with franco from its beginning to its dramatic and decisive conclusion ive got one question liam said did you return fire with my gun of course not jack said it was hardly the question he expected to tell the truth the idea never even occurred to me liam told jack hed relay the information to the state troopers who patrol the turnpike and if there were any questions hed have them call jack directly pleased that the reporting job was as easy as it had been jack leaned forward and examined the bullet hole in the cars plastic interior trim knowing hertz was not going to be happy it was relatively neatly punched out as hed frequently seen with entrance wounds in victims skulls jack inwardly shuddered at the thought of how close it had been to being his skull which made him wonder if francos attacking him with his vehicle had been plan b plan a could have been either waiting for jack to come out of the bowmans house or worse yet breaking into the house during the night maybe the police surveillance had been the deterrent making jack shudder anew at how sure hed felt the previous night that there would be no intruders ignorance was bliss making a conscious decision not to dwell on what ifs jack got the umbrella from the backseat and went into the funeral home with no services apparently scheduled the establishment was back to its silent sepulchral serenity save for the barely audible gregorian chants jack had to find his own way back to harolds heavily curtained office dr stapleton harold said seeing jack in his doorway im afraid i have bad news please jack urged dont say that ive already had a bumpy difficult morning i got a call from percy gallaudet the backhoe operator the cemetery has him on another job then hes going offsite to dig out someones sewer line he said he wont be able to get to your job until tomorrow jack took a breath and looked away for a moment to calm himself harolds unctuous manner made this new hurdle that much more difficult to bear okay jack said slowly how about we get another backhoe there must be more than one in the area there are a lot but only one is currently acceptable to walter strasser the superintendent of the park meadow cemetery are there kickbacks involved jack said more as a statement than a question only one backhoe operator smelled suspiciously like smalltown graft heaven knows but the reality is that we are stuck with percy gallaudet shit jack exclaimed there wasnt any way he could do the autopsy in the morning and still be at the riverside church at one thirty in the afternoon theres another problem harold said the vault companys truck is not available tomorrow and i had to call them and tell them we were not going to use them today wonderful jack commented sarcastically he took another breath lets go over this carefully so we know what our options are is there some way we can accomplish this without the vault company absolutely not harold said indignantly it would mean leaving the vault in the ground hey i dont mind if the vault stays put why do you have to take it out anyway thats the way it is done it is a topoftheline vault stipulated by the late mr stanhope the onepiece lid has to be removed with care couldnt the lid be removed without lifting the whole vault it could i suppose but it might crack so what difference would that make jack questioned losing patience he felt that burial practices in general were bizarre and was a fan of cremation all someone had to do was look at mummies of egyptian pharaohs gruesomely on display to realize allowing ones earthly remains to hang around was not necessarily a good idea a crack could compromise the seal harold said with renewed indignation im getting the picture the vault can be left in the ground jack said ill take responsibility if the lid cracks we can get a new one im certain that would please the vault company i suppose harold said moderating his stance im going to go and personally speak to percy and walter and see if i can resolve this impasse as you wish just keep me informed i must be present if and when the vault is opened ill be sure to do that jack said can you give me directions to the park meadow jack walked out of the funeral home in a different frame of mind than he was when he had gone in he was now irritated as well as overstimulated three things that never failed to rile him were bureaucracy incompetence and stupidity especially when they occurred together which they often did getting patience stanhope out of the ground was proving to be more arduous than he had expected when he first insouciantly suggested doing a postmortem when he got to the car he looked at it critically for the first time since the turnpike ordeal besides the broken window and the bullet in the windshield post the whole left side was scraped and dented and the rear was pushed in the back was so damaged he feared he might not be able to open the trunk luckily his fears were unfounded when he was able to pop the lid he wanted to be certain hed have access to the autopsy materials latasha had given him what hertzs reaction was going to be to all the damage he didnt want to think about although he was happy hed opted for full insurance once inside the car he got out the map and combining it with harolds directions he was able to plot his route the cemetery wasnt far and he found it without much effort or incident it dominated a hill within sight of an impressive religious institution that looked similar to a college with numerous separate buildings the cemetery was quite pleasant even in the rain and looked like a park with headstones the main gate was an elaborate stone structure that spanned the entrance road and bristled with statuary of the prophets the individual gates were black castiron grates and would have been forbidding except that they were permanently propped open the entire cemetery was encircled with a fence that matched the entranceway gates just beyond the portal and tucked behind it was a gothic building comprising an office and multibay garage it stood on a cobblestoned area from which roads led up into the cemetery proper jack parked his car and walked through the open door of the office there were two people at two desks the rest of the furniture included several old fourdrawer metal filing cabinets and a library table with captains chairs on the wall was a large map of the cemetery depicting all the separate plots can i help you a dowdy woman asked she was neither friendly nor unfriendly as she gave jack an appraising look it was a deportment jack was beginning to associate with new england im looking for walter strasser jack said the woman pointed toward the man without looking at him or back at jack she had already returned her attention to her monitor screen jack stepped over to the mans desk he was of indeterminate late middle age and corpulent enough to suggest he indulged in his share of the seven deadly sins particularly gluttony and sloth he was sitting stolidly at the desk with his hands clasped over his impressive girth his full face was red like an apple are you mr strasser jack asked when the man made no attempt to speak or move i am jack made a rapid introduction that included flashing his official me badge he went on to explain his need to examine the late patience stanhope to help with a civil lawsuit and that the required permits had been obtained for the exhumation he said all he needed was the corpse mr harold langley has spoken to me about this issue at length walter said thanks for telling me straight off jack thought but did not say instead he asked did he also mention theres a scheduling problem we had planned on the exhumation happening today mr gallaudet has a conflict i told him to call mr langley this morning and explain the situation i got the message why i came over here in person is to see if some small extra consideration for your efforts and for mr gallaudets could get the exhumation back on todays schedule im afraid i must leave town this evening jack trailed off with his vague offer of a bribe hoping that covetousness was as much a part of walters foibles as gluttony seemed to be what kind of extra consideration walter asked to jacks gratification the mans eyes flicked warily toward the woman suggesting she was not to be party to his shenanigans i was thinking of double the usual fee in cash theres no problem from this end walter said but youll have to talk with percy how about another backhoe walter chewed on the suggestion for a moment then declined sorry percy has a long association with park meadow he knows and respects our rules and regulations i understand jack said agreeably while guessing percys long association most likely had more to do with kickbacks than with rules and regulations but jack was not going to belabor the issue unless he struck out with percy word is that mr gallaudet is doing work onsite as we speak hes up by the big maple tree with enrique and cesar preparing for a noontime burial who are enrique and cesar they are our caretakers can i drive up there by all means as jack drove up the hill the rain lessened and then conveniently stopped he was relieved since he was driving without a passengerside window thanks to franco jack turned off the windshield wipers as he rose he got a progressively better view of the surrounding area to the west near the horizon was a band of clear sky promising better weather in the near future jack found percy and the others near the crest of the hill percy was in the glassenclosed cab of his backhoe scooping out a grave while the two caretakers looked on leaning on longhandled shovels percy had the backhoes scoop down in the deep trench and the vehicles diesel engine was straining to draw it near and then up and out the fresh soil was piled in a cone on a large waterproof tarpaulin a white pickup truck with the cemeterys name stenciled on the door was pulled to the side jack parked his car and walked over to the backhoe he tried to get percys attention by shouting his name but the roar of the diesel drowned him out it wasnt until he rapped on the glass of the cab that percy became aware he was being accosted percy immediately eased up on the controls and the diesels roar became a more bearable purr percy opened the cabs door whats up he yelled as if the backhoes engine was still making considerable racket i need to talk to you about a job jack yelled back percy bounced out of the cab he was a short squirrelly man who moved in sudden quick jerks and had a perpetually questioning expression on his face with fixed raised eyebrows and a furrowed forehead his hair was short but spiked and both forearms were heavily tattooed what kind of job percy asked jack went through an even more elaborate introduction and explanation than he had used with walter strasser in hope of evoking whatever pathos percy might have possessed in order to reschedule patience stanhopes resurrection for that day unfortunately it didnt work sorry man percy said after this job i got a buddy with a backedup sewer and newborn twins i heard you were busy jack said but as i told mr strasser im willing to pay double the fee in cash to get it done today and what did mr strasser say he said there was no problem from his end percys eyebrows hiked up a smidgen as he mulled over jacks offer so you are willing to pay twice the cemetery fee and twice my fee only if it gets done today i still have to dig out my buddy percy said it would have to be after that so what time would you be able to do it percy pursed his lips and nodded his head as he pondered he checked his watch for sure it would be after two but it will get done jack questioned he had to be certain itll get done percy promised i just dont know what im going to run into with my buddys sewer if that goes fast i could be back here around two if theres a problem then its anybodys guess but youll still do it even if it is late in the afternoon absolutely percy said for twice my usual fee jack stuck out his hand percy gave it a quick shake while jack returned to his beatup car percy climbed back into his backhoes cab before jack started the engine he called harold langley heres the story jack said in a voice that implied there was no room for discussion were back on for digging up patience sometime after two this afternoon you dont have a more precise time its going to be after mr gallaudet finishes what he has scheduled thats all i can tell you at the moment i only need a halfhours notice harold said ill meet you graveside fine jack said he struggled to keep the sarcasm out of his voice considering the fee he would be paying the langleypeerson funeral home he felt harold should be the one out running around and strongarming walter strasser and percy gallaudet with the sound of percys backhoe grinding away jack tried to think of what else he had to do he checked his watch it was close to ten thirty the way things were going jacks intuition told him that hed be lucky to get patience stanhope back to the langleypeerson home in the mid to late afternoon which meant that dr latasha wylie might be available he wasnt sure her offer to help was entirely sincere but he thought hed give her the benefit of the doubt with help the case would go faster and hed have someone to bounce ideas off of and to offer opinions he also wanted the bone saw she offered to bring although he didnt think that the brain would be important in this particular case jack hated to do anything halfassed more important he thought there might be a chance he would want to use a microscope or a dissecting scope and latashas presence would make that a viable possibility most important was her bosss offer of help with toxicology which latasha would be able to make happen now that jack had the idea of an overdose or a wrong medication given at the hospital he definitely wanted a toxicology screen and hed need it done immediately for it to be included in the report such thoughts made jack concede a distinct possibility that he had been unconsciously avoiding namely that there was a good chance he might not make the last shuttle flight from boston to new york meaning hed be forced to fly in the morning since he knew the first flights were at the crack of dawn there was no worry about making the one thirty church service even with a stop at the apartment for his tuxedo the concern was telling laurie acknowledging that he was not up to such a conversation and rationalizing that he didnt know for sure he wouldnt make the flight that evening jack opted not to try to phone at that time he rationalized further that it would be far better to speak to her when he had definitive information leaning to the side to facilitate getting his wallet from his back pocket jack got out latasha wylies card and dialed her cell number considering the time he wasnt surprised he got her voicemail undoubtedly she was in the autopsy room the message he left was simple the exhumation was delayed so the autopsy would be late in the afternoon and hed love to have help if she was inclined he left his cell phone number with his telephoning out of the way jack switched his attention to a practical problem thanks to his amateurish bribing of walter and percy in which hed obviously offered too much considering how rapidly they had accepted he was now obligated to come up with the promised cash the twenty or thirty dollars he normally carried in his wallet wasnt going to get him far but cash wasnt a problem thanks to his credit card all he needed was an atm and there had to be plenty in the city when jack had done everything he could think of he resigned himself to going back to the courtroom he wasnt excited about the idea hed seen quite enough of his sister being humiliated and the initial slight twinge of schadenfreude hed felt but barely admitted to himself at craigs comeuppance had long since disappeared jack had come to have strong empathy for both individuals and found it distasteful to witness them being skewered and their relationship debased by the likes of tony fasano for his venal selfinterest on the other hand jack had promised both individuals hed show up and both had in their own ways expressed appreciation for his being there with these thoughts in mind jack started his rentacar managed a threepoint turn and drove out of the cemetery just outside the elaborate statueencrusted gate he pulled to the side of the road to glance at the map it was a good thing because he immediately discerned there was a much better way to get into boston proper than retracing the route back past the funeral home once under way jack found himself smiling he wasnt quite laughing but he was suddenly amused hed been to boston for two and a half days had been racking his brain over a senseless medical malpractice lawsuit had been slapped and punched had been shot at and had been terrorized by a thug in a black cadillac and yet had in reality accomplished nothing there was a kind of comic irony to the whole affair that appealed to his admittedly warped sense of humor then another thought occurred to him hed become progressively concerned about lauries response to his being delayed in boston to the point that he had become progressively reluctant to talk with her for fear of her response but he wasnt concerned about the delay itself if doing the autopsy forced him to fly to new york in the morning he had to acknowledge that he might not make the wedding even though the chances were small that that would be the case since there was a flight scheduled every thirty minutes from six thirty am on the probability was not zero yet it didnt bother him and the fact that it didnt bother him made him question his unconscious motivations he loved laurie of that he was certain and he believed he wanted to remarry so why wasnt he more concerned jack had no answers other than a concession that life was more complicated than his usual devilmaycare attitude would suggest he apparently functioned on multiple levels some of which were guarded if not actively suppressed with no cars chasing him no misty fog to negotiate and no rushhour traffic jack made excellent time driving into downtown boston even though he was approaching from a new direction he was able to stumble onto the boston public garden and the boston common where the two were bisected by charles street and once he found that hed also found the underground garage hed previously used after parking the car jack walked back to the attendant and asked about an atm he was directed to the commercial section of charles street and found the machine across from the hardware store where hed purchased the unused pepper spray with the upper limit of cash he could withdraw in hand jack followed his previous days route in reverse he walked up beacon hill enjoying the neighborly ambience of the handsome town houses many with carefully cultivated window boxes overflowing with flowers the recent rain had washed the streets and the bricked sidewalks the overcast sky made him aware of something hed not noticed in the sunlight the day before the nineteenthcentury gas lamps were all ablaze apparently day in day out pushing into the courtroom jack hesitated by the exit superficially the scene looked exactly as hed left it the afternoon before except that craig was on the stand instead of leona there was the same cast of characters mirroring the same attitudes the jurors were impassive as if they were cutout figures save for the plumbers assistant who made examining his nails a continuous endeavor the judge was preoccupied with the papers on his desk similar to the day before and the spectators were contrarily attentive as jacks eyes scanned the spectators he saw alexis in her usual spot with a seat next to her apparently saved for him on the opposite side of the spectator gallery in the spot normally occupied by franco sat antonio he was a smaller version of franco but significantly more handsome he was now wearing the fasano team apparel gray suit black shirt and black tie although jack had been reasonably confident franco would be out of the picture for a few days he wondered if hed have trouble with antonio he also wondered if either franco or antonio or both had anything to do with the assault on craigs children appropriately excusing himself craig moved into the aisle where alexis was sitting at the very end the closest seat to the jury box she saw him coming and flashed a quick nervous smile jack didnt take it as auspicious she gathered up her belongings so he could sit they gripped hands briefly before he sat hows it going jack whispered leaning toward her better now that randolph is doing the cross what happened with tony fasano on the direct alexis cast a fleeting glance at jack betraying her anxiousness her facial muscles were tense and her eyes were more wide open than usual she had her hands tightly clasped in her lap not good jack questioned it was terrible alexis admitted the only positive thing that could be said was that craigs testimony was consistent with his deposition in no way did he contradict himself dont tell me he got angry not after all that rehearsal he got furious after only an hour or so and it was downhill from there tony knew his buttons and he pressed every one the worst part was when craig told tony he had no right to criticize nor question doctors who were sacrificing their lives to take care of their patients craig then went on to call tony a despicable ambulancechaser not good jack said even if it is true it got worse alexis said forcibly raising her voice excuse me a voice said from behind someone had tapped jack on the shoulder we cant hear the testimony the spectator complained sorry jack said he turned back to alexis want to step out into the hall for a moment alexis nodded she obviously needed a break they stood up alexis left her things they worked their way to the main aisle jack opened the heavy courtroom door as quietly as possible in the elevator lobby they sat on a leathercovered bench hunched over elbows on knees for the life of me alexis muttered i dont see what all those voyeurs get out of watching this damn trial have you ever heard the term schadenfreude jack asked marveling hed just been musing about it a halfhour previously in relation to his initial reaction to craigs imbroglio remind me alexis suggested its german it refers to when people exult over someone elses problems and difficulties id forgotten the german term alexis said but the concept im well aware of as prevalent as it is we should have a word for it in english hell its what sells tabloids anyway i actually know why people are in there watching craigs ordeal they see doctors as powerful successful people so dont listen to me when i carp do you feel all right other than a headache im okay what about the children apparently theyre doing fine they think theyre on vacation skipping school and staying at grandmas there have been no calls on my cell each of them knows the number by heart and i would have heard if there was a problem of any sort ive had an eventful morning really whats going on with the autopsy were in the market for a miracle jack told the story of his mornings ordeal on the massachusetts turnpike which alexis listened to with a progressive drooping of her lower jaw she was equally astounded and alarmed i should be asking you if you are all right she said when jack described francos final spectacular upsidedown crash im fine the rentacar is worse for wear i know francos hurting hes probably in a hospital somewhere i wouldnt be surprised if hes also under arrest i reported the incident to the same boston detective that came to the house last night i would assume the authorities would take a dim view of discharging firearms on the massachusetts turnpike my god alexis said sympathetically im sorry all this has happened to you i cant help but feel responsible no need im afraid i have a penchant for trouble its all my own doing but ill tell you everything thats happened has done nothing but fan my determination to do this damn autopsy what is the status jack described his machinations with harold langley walter strasser and percy gallaudet my gosh alexis said after all this effort i hope it shows something significant you and me both are you okay with possibly putting off flying to new york to tomorrow morning what has to be has to be jack said with a shrug he wasnt about to get into that personally thorny issue what about with your wifetobe laurie i havent told her yet jack admitted good lord alexis commented this is not a good way for me to start out a relationship with a new sisterinlaw lets get back to whats going on in the trial jack said to change the subject you were about to tell me how craigs testimony got worse after he castigated tony for being a despicable ambulancechaser he took it upon himself to lecture the jury that they were not his peers he said they were incapable of judging his actions since theyd never had to try to save someone like he tried to save patience stanhope jack slapped a hand to his forehead in stupefaction what was randolph doing during this everything he could he was jumping up and down objecting but to no avail he tried to get the judge to recess but the judge asked craig if he needed a rest and craig said no so on it went jack shook his head craig is his own worst enemy although although what alexis questioned craig has a point in some respects hes speaking for all us doctors i bet most every physician whos gone through the hell of a medical malpractice trial feels the same way its just that they would have the sense not to say it well he sure as hell shouldnt have said it if i were a juror fulfilling my civic responsibility and got that kind of rebuke id be incensed and much more apt to buy into tonys interpretation of events was that the worst part there were many parts that qualified for being the worst tony got craig to admit hed had some concern that the fateful house call was for a legitimate emergency as leona had testified and also that a heart attack was on his list of possible diagnoses he also got craig to admit that driving from the stanhope residence to symphony hall would take a shorter time than from the newton memorial hospital and that he was eager to get to the concert before it began to show off his trophy girlfriend and perhaps particularly incriminating he got craig to admit hed said all those unflattering things about patience stanhope to the tart leona including that patiences passing was a blessing for everyone whoa jack said with yet another shake of his head not good not good at all craig managed to present himself as an arrogant uncaring md who was more interested in getting to symphony hall on time with his sex object than doing what was right for his patient it was exactly what randolph told him not to do jack sat up straight so what is randolph doing on crossexamination attempted damage control would be the best description hes trying to rehabilitate craig on each individual issue from the pp problem patient designation all the way to the events that happened on the night patience stanhope died when you came in craig was testifying to the difference between patiences condition when he arrived at the home and the description hed gotten from jordan stanhope on the phone randolph had already made sure that craig told the jury that he did not say patience stanhope was having a heart attack when he was speaking with jordan but rather it was something that had to be ruled out of course that was in contradiction to what jordan had said during his testimony did you get any sense of how the jury was responding to craigs testimony during the cross as compared with the direct they seem more impassive now than before but that may be just my pessimistic perception im not optimistic after craigs performance on direct randolph has a real uphill struggle ahead of him he told me this morning that hes going to ask craig to tell his lifes story to counter tonys character assassination why not jack said even though he wasnt all that enthusiastic he felt a rekindling of sympathy for alexis and wanted to be supportive as they returned to their seats in the courtroom he wondered how a finding for the plaintiff would affect alexiss relationship with craig jack had never championed their union from the first time hed met craig some sixteen years previously craig and alexis had met while in training at the boston memorial hospital and had come as houseguests to jacks home while they were engaged jack had found craig insufferably selfcentered and onedimensionally oriented toward medicine but now that jack had had a chance to see them together in their own environment despite the current difficult circumstance he could see that they complemented each other alexiss very mildly histrionic and dependent character which had been much more apparent as a child melded well with craigs more serious narcissism in a lot of ways from jacks perspective they complemented each other jack settled back and got himself as comfortable as he could under the circumstances randolph was standing stiffly erect at the podium exuding his normal blueblooded resplendence craig was in the witness box leaning slightly forward his shoulders rounded randolph s voice was crisply articulate melodic and slightly sibilant craigs was vapid as if hed been in an argument and was now exhausted jack felt alexiss hand insinuate itself between his elbow and his side and then move forward to grab his hand he squeezed in return and they exchanged a fleeting smile dr bowman randolph intoned youve wanted to be a doctor since you were given a toy doctors kit at age four and proceeded to administer to your parents and older brother but i understand there was a particular event in your childhood that especially firmed this altruistic career choice would you tell the court about this episode craig cleared his throat i was fifteen years old and in tenth grade i was a manager for the football team id tried to make the team but didnt which was a big disappointment for my father since my older brother had been a star player so i was the manager which was nothing more than the water boy during the timeouts i ran onto the field with a bucket ladle and paper cups during a home game one of our players was hurt and a timeout was called i dashed onto the field with the bucket but as i drew near i could see the injured player was a friend of mine instead of carrying my bucket to the huddle of players i ran to my friend i was the first one from the sidelines to get to him and what i confronted was disturbing he had badly broken his leg such that his cleated foot stuck off in a markedly abnormal direction and he was writhing in agony i was so struck by his need and my inability to help him that i decided on the spot that not only did i want to become a doctor i had to become a doctor that is a heartrending story randolph said and stirring because of your immediate compassionate impulse and the fact that it motivated you to follow what was to be a difficult path becoming a doctor was not easy for you dr bowman and that altruistic urge you so eloquently described had to be strong indeed to propel you over the obstacles you faced could you tell the court something of your inspiring horatio alger story craig perceptively straightened in the witness chair objection tony shouted getting to his feet immaterial judge davidson took off his reading glasses counsels approach the bench dutifully randolph and tony congregated to the judges right listen judge davidson said pointing his glasses at tony you made character a centerpiece of the plaintiffs case i allowed that over mr binghams objection with the proviso you established foundation which i believe you did whats good for the goose is good for the gander the jury has every right to hear about dr bowmans motivations and training do i make myself clear yes your honor tony said and furthermore i dont want to hear a flurry of objections in this regard i understand your honor tony said tony and randolph retreated to their original spots with tony at the plaintiffs table and randolph at the podium objection overruled judge davidson called out for the court recorders benefit witness may proceed to answer the question do you recall the question randolph asked i should hope so craig said where should i begin at the beginning would be appropriate randolph said i understand you did not get parental support at least not from my father and he ruled the house with an iron fist he was resentful of us kids particularly me since i wasnt the football or hockey prodigy like my older brother leonard junior my father thought i was a candy ass and told me so on multiple occasions when my browbeaten mother let it slip that i wanted to be a doctor he said it would be over his dead body did he use those exact terms absolutely my father was a plumber who was dismissive of all professionals which he labeled as a collective bunch of thieves there was no way he wanted a son of his to become part of such a world especially since he never finished high school in fact to the best of my knowledge no one in my family on either side went to college including my own brother who ended up taking over my fathers plumbing business so your father wasnt supportive of your academic interests craig laughed mirthlessly i was a closet reader as a youngster i had to be there were occasions on which my father whacked me around when he caught me reading instead of doing things around the house when i got report cards i had to hide them from my father and have my mother sign them secretly because i got all as with most of my friends it was the other way around was it easier when you got to college in some ways yes and some ways no he was disgusted with me and instead of calling me a candy ass i became a highfalutin ass he was embarrassed to talk about me to his friends the biggest problem was that he refused to fill out the financial forms necessary to apply for a scholarship and of course refused to contribute a cent how were you able to pay for college i relied on a combination of loans scholastic awards and every type of job i could manage to get and still keep a fourpointoh grade point average the first couple of years it was mostly restaurant work washing dishes and waiting tables during the last two i was able to work in a variety of science labs during summers i worked in the hospital at any job they would give me also my brother helped me a little although he couldnt do much since hed already started a family did your goal of medicine and your desire to help people support you during these difficult years absolutely especially the summer work in the hospital i worshipped the doctors and the nurses particularly the residents i could not wait to become one of them what happened when you got to medical school were your financial difficulties worse or less severe much worse the expenses were greater and the curriculum required more hours essentially all day every day in contrast to college how did you manage i borrowed as much as i was allowed the rest i had to earn with a myriad of jobs all around the medical center luckily jobs abounded how did you find the time medical school is considered a fulltime occupation and then some i went without sleep well not totally since that is physically impossible i learned to sleep in short snatches even during the day it was difficult but at least in medical school the goal was in sight which made it easier to endure what kind of jobs did you do all the usual medical center jobs like drawing blood type and crossmatching blood cleaning animal cages anything and everything that could be done at night i even worked in the medical center kitchen then during the second year i landed a terrific job with a researcher studying sodium ion channels in nerve and muscle cells ive even kept up that work today with such a busy schedule in medical school how were your grades excellent i was in the top ten percent of my class and a member of the alpha omega alpha honorary scholastic society what do you consider your biggest sacrifice was it the chronic lack of sleep no it was the lack of any time for social contact my classmates had time to interact and discuss the experience medical school is quite intense during my third year i was conflicted about whether to go into academicbasicscience medicine or clinical medicine i would have loved to debate the pros and cons and have the benefit of others opinions i had to make the decision myself and how did you make the decision i realized i liked taking care of people there was an immediate gratification that i savored so it was the contact with individuals that you found enjoyable and rewarding yes and the challenge of coming up with the differential diagnoses as well as the paradigm for narrowing the field but it was the contact with the people and helping them that you cherished objection tony said he had been progressively fidgeting repetitious sustained judge davidson said with a tired voice no need to belabor the point mr bingham i am confident the jury has gotten it tell us about your residency training randolph said that was a joy craig said he was now sitting up straight with his shoulders back because of my grade point average i was accepted to train at the prestigious boston memorial hospital it was a wonderful learning environment and suddenly i was being paid not a lot of money but some equally important i was no longer paying tuition so i could begin to pay off the shocking debt id assumed from college and medical school did you continue to enjoy the necessarily close bonds that had to form between you and your patients absolutely that was by far the most rewarding part now tell us about your practice i understand there were some disappointments not at first initially my practice was everything i had dreamed it would be i was busy and stimulated i enjoyed going in each and every day my patients were challenging intellectually and appreciative but then the insurance companies began to withhold payments often needlessly challenging certain charges making it progressively difficult to do what was best for my patients receipts began to fall while costs continued to rise in order to keep the doors open i had to increase productivity which is a euphemism for seeing more patients per hour i was able to do this but as it continued i became progressively concerned about quality i understand that your style of practice changed at that point it changed dramatically i was approached by an older revered physician who was practicing concierge medicine but who was having health issues he offered me a partnership excuse me for interrupting randolph said perhaps you could refresh for the jurors the meaning of the term concierge medicine its a practice style in which the physician agrees to limit the practice size to offer extraordinary accessibility for an annual retainer fee does extraordinary accessibility include house calls it can its up to the doctor and the patient what you are saying is that with concierge medicine the doctor can tailor the service to the needs of the patient is that correct it is two fundamental principles of good patient care are the principle of patient welfare and the principle of patient autonomy seeing too many patients per hour threatens to violate these principles since everything is rushed when the doctor is pressed for time the interview has to be forced and when that happens the patients narrative is lost which is tragic since it is often within the narrative that the critical facts of the case are hidden in a concierge practice like mine i can vary the time i spend with the patient and the location of the service according to the patients needs and wishes dr bowman is the practice of medicine an art or a science it is definitely an art but it is based on a bedrock of proven science can medicine be appropriately practiced from a book no it cannot there are no two people alike in the world medicine has to be tailored for each patient individually also books are invariably outdated by the time they come on the market medical knowledge is expanding at an exponential rate does judgment play a role in the practice of medicine absolutely in every medical decision judgment is paramount was it your medical judgment that patience stanhope was best served by your making a visit to her home on the evening of september eighth yes it was can you explain to the jury why your judgment led you to believe this was the best course of action she detested the hospital i was even reluctant to send her to the hospital for routine tests visits to the hospital inevitably exacerbated her symptoms and general anxiety she much preferred for me to come to her home which i had been doing almost once a week for eight months each time it had been a false alarm even on those occasions when i was told by jordan stanhope that she believed she was dying on the evening of september eighth i was not told she thought she was dying i was confident the visit would be a false alarm like all the others yet as a doctor i could not ignore the possibility she was truly ill the best way to do that was to go directly to her home ms rattner testified that you told her en route that you thought her complaints might be legitimate is that true it is true but i didnt say that i considered the chances to be extremely small i said i was concerned because i noted slightly more concern than usual in mr stanhopes voice did you tell mr stanhope on the phone that you believed mrs stanhope had had a heart attack no i did not i told him that it would have to be ruled out with any complaint of chest pain but mrs stanhope had had chest pain in the past that had proved to be insignificant did mrs stanhope have a heart condition i had done a stress test several months previous to her demise that was equivocal it wasnt enough to say she had a heart condition but i felt strongly that she should have more definitive cardiac studies by a cardiologist at the hospital did you recommend that to the patient i strongly recommended it but she refused particularly since it involved going to the hospital one last question doctor randolph said in relation to your offices pp or problem patient designation did that signify the patient got more attention or less attention considerably more attention the problem with patients so designated was that i could not relieve their symptoms whether real or imagined as a doctor i found that a continual problem hence the terminology thank you doctor randolph said as he gathered up his notes no more questions mr fasano judge davidson called do you wish to redirect absolutely your honor tony barked he jumped to his feet and rushed to the podium like a hound after a rabbit dr bowman in relation to your pp patients did you not say to your then livein girlfriend while riding in your new red porsche on the way to the stanhope home on september eighth that you couldnt stand such patients and that you thought hypochondriacs were as bad as malingerers there was a pause as craig fixed tony with his eyes as if they were weapons doctor tony asked cat got your tongue as we used to say in elementary school i dont remember craig said finally dont remember tony questioned with exaggerated disbelief oh please doctor thats a too convenient excuse especially from someone who has excelled throughout his training at remembering trivial details ms rattner certainly remembered as she testified perhaps you can remember telling ms rattner on the evening you were served your summons for this lawsuit that you hated patience stanhope and that her passing was a blessing for everyone is that possibly something you can recall tony leaned forward over the podium as much as his short stature would allow and raised his eyebrows questioningly i said something to that effect craig reluctantly admitted i was angry of course you were angry tony exclaimed you were outraged that someone like my bereaved client could possibly have the gall to question whether your judgment was in keeping with the standard of care objection randolph said argumentative sustained judge davidson said he glared at tony we are all impressed with your ragstoriches story tony said maintaining his disdain but im not sure what that means now especially considering the lifestyle your patients have provided you over the years what is the current market value of your home objection randolph said irrelevant and immaterial your honor tony complained the defense presented economic testimony to attest to the defendants commitment to become a physician it is only reasonable for the jury to hear what economic rewards have accrued judge davidson pondered for a moment before saying objection overruled the witness may answer the question tony redirected his attention at craig well craig shrugged two or three million but we didnt pay that i would now like to ask you a few questions about your concierge practice tony said gripping the sides of the podium tightly do you believe that demanding an annual upfront payment of thousands of dollars is beyond some patients means of course craig snapped what happened to those beloved patients of yours who either could not or did not for whatever reason come up with the retainer fee that was financing your new porsche and your sex den on beacon hill objection randolph said he stood up argumentative and prejudicial sustained judge davidson barked counsel will restrict his questions to elicit appropriate factual information and will not word his questions to float theories or arguments better left for summation this is my last warning im sorry your honor tony said before turning back to craig what happened to those beloved patients whom you had been caring for over the years they had to find new doctors which im afraid is often easier said than done did you help with this chore we offered names and numbers did you just get them out of the yellow pages they were local physicians with whom my staff and i were acquainted did you call these physicians in some cases which means in some cases you did not call dr bowman did it not bother you to abandon your supposedly cherished patients who were desperate looking to you for their health needs i didnt abandon them craig spat indignantly i gave them choices no more questions tony said he rolled his eyes on the way back to the plaintiffs table judge davidson looked over his glasses at randolph does the defense wish to recross no your honor randolph said half rising out of his chair the witness may step down judge davidson said craig stood and with a deliberate step walked back to the defense table the judge turned his attention to tony mr fasano tony stood plaintiff rests your honor he said confidently before retaking his seat the judges eyes swept back to randolph on cue randolph stood up to his full patrician height based on the inadequacy of the plaintiffs case and lack of evidence thereof the defense moves to dismiss overruled judge davidson said crisply the evidence presented is sufficient for us to go forward when court reconvenes after a lunch break you may call your first witness mr bingham he then brought his gavel down sharply and the sound echoed like a gunshot recess for lunch you are admonished again not to discuss the case among yourselves or with anyone and to withhold any opinions until the conclusion of the testimony all rise the court officer called out jack and alexis got to their feet along with everyone else in the courtroom as the judge stepped down from the bench and disappeared through the paneled side door what did you think jack asked while the jury was ushered out im continually amazed at the level of craigs apparent inner anger at these proceedings that he has such little selfcontrol over his behavior with you being the inhouse expert im surprised youre surprised isnt it consistent with his narcissism it is but i was hoping that with the insight he expressed yesterday at lunch hed be able to control himself better when tony merely stood up even before he started his questions i could see craigs expression change actually i was asking your opinion of how randolph orchestrated the part of the crossexamination we heard unfortunately i dont think it was as effective as i would have hoped it made craig sound too preachy like he was giving a lecture i would have preferred the whole cross to have been punchy and direct like it was at the end i thought randolph s cross was pretty effective jack said i never realized craig was such a selfmade man working as hard as he did at gainful employment while going to medical school and still getting the grades he did is very impressive but youre a doctor not a juror and you didnt hear tonys direct craig might have struggled as a student but from the jurors perspective its hard to have sympathy now that craig and i are living in what is probably closer to being a fourmilliondollar home and tony was very clever on his redirect the way he brought back craigs negative feelings about the patient the red porsche the girlfriend and the fact that he had to forsake many of his old patients jack reluctantly nodded he had been struggling to look on the bright side for alexiss benefit he tried a different tack well now its randolph s turn in the sun its time for the defense to shine im afraid theres not going to be much sunshine all randolph is going to do is present two or three expert witnesses none of whom are from boston he said hell be finished this afternoon tomorrow will be the summations alexis shook her head dejectedly under the circumstances i dont see how he could turn this thing around hes an experienced malpractice attorney jack said attempting to generate enthusiasm he didnt feel experience generally prevails in the final analysis who knows maybe he has a surprise up his sleeve jack didnt realize he was halfright there was to be a surprise but it wasnt going to come from randolph s sleeve boston massachusetts thursday june pm magazines the waiflike young woman questioned jack thought she was no more than ninety pounds yet she was walking a half dozen dogs ranging in size from a gray great dane down to a small bichon frise a clutch of clear plastic poop bags stuck out of her jeans back pocket jack had stopped her after following his established route back down through the beacon hill neighborhood he had it in his mind to buy some reading material in case the wait for the backhoe operator turned out to be overly protracted lets see the woman said scrunching her face in thought theres a couple of places on charles street one would be fine jack said theres gary drug on the corner of charles and mount vernon street am i going in the right direction jack questioned at the moment he was on charles street heading toward the park area and the parking garage you are the drugstore is a block down on this side of the street jack thanked the woman who was pulled away by her impatient canines the shop was a true maandpoptype store with an oldfashioned cluttered but welcoming ambience the whole shebang was about the size of the shampoo section in a generic chain drugstore yet it was a true emporium products that ranged from vitamins to cold remedies to notebooks were tucked into shelving that went from floor to ceiling along the single aisle at the far end near the pharmacy counter was a surprisingly wide selection of magazines and newspapers jack had mistakenly agreed to lunch with alexis and craig it turned out to be like being invited to a wake where you were expected to converse with the deceased craig was furious at the system as he called it at tony fasano at jordan stanhope and mostly at himself he knew hed done a terrible job despite the hours of practice hed been through with randolph the night before when alexis tried to get him to talk about why he had so little control of his emotions knowing full well it was in his best interest to do so he flew off the handle and he and alexis had a short but nasty exchange but mostly craig just sat for the hour in sullen withdrawal alexis and jack had tried to talk but the intensity of craigs irritation gave off vibes that were difficult to ignore at the end of lunch alexis was hoping jack would return to the courtroom but jack had begged off with the excuse that he wanted to get to the cemetery by two in hopes that percy gallaudet had made short work of his contribution in rectifying his buddys sewer system at that point craig had angrily told jack just to give up that the die had been cast so jack neednt bother jack had responded that hed gone too far involving too many people to abandon the idea with several magazines and a new york times under his arm jack proceeded on to the parking garage got his sadlooking accent out into the daylight and headed west he had a bit of trouble finding the route that had brought him into the city that morning but he eventually recognized a few landmarks that indicated he was on the correct road jack pulled into the park meadow cemetery at two ten and parked next to a dodge minivan in front of the office building going inside he found the frumpy woman and walter strasser exactly as hed left them in the morning the woman was typing into a monitor and walter was sitting impassively at his desk with his hands still clasped over his paunch jack wondered if he ever did any work since there was nothing on his desk surface to suggest it both people looked in jacks direction but the woman immediately went back to her work without a word jack proceeded over to walter who followed him with his eyes any sign of percy jack asked not since he left this morning any word jack asked he marveled that the only way he could tell walter was conscious was the rare blink and the moving mouth when he spoke nope is there any way to contact him im supposed to meet him here sometime after two hes agreed to dig out patience stanhope this afternoon if he said hed do it hell be here does he have a cell phone i failed to ask him nope we contact him by email then he comes by the office jack put one of his business cards on walters desk if you could contact him to find out when hes going to get to patience stanhope id be much obliged you can call me on my cell phone meanwhile ill head up to the grave site if you can tell me where it is gertrude show the doctor the stanhope plot on the map the wheels on gertrudes desk chair squeaked as she pushed away from her desk as a woman of few words she merely tapped an arthritic index finger at the appropriate spot jack glanced at the site thanks to the contour lines he could see it was on the very crest of the hill best view in the park meadow walter commented ill wait there jack said he started for the car doctor walter called since the grave is scheduled to be opened theres the issue of the fee which must be settled before digging commences after parting with a significant number of twentydollar bills from his bulky stash jack returned to the rentacar and drove up the hill he found a small turnout with an arbor shading a park bench he left his car there and walked over to where he guessed the stanhope plot was located it was on the very crown of the hill there were three identical rather plain granite headstones he found patiences and glanced briefly at the incised inscription getting the magazines and newspaper out of the car jack went over to the bench and made himself comfortable the weather had improved dramatically from the morning bright sun beat down with a ferocity that it hadnt had on previous days as if to remind everyone that summer was just around the corner jack was glad to have the shade from the ivycovered arbor because it was tropically hot jack glanced at his watch it seemed hard to believe that in less than twentyfour hours he would be married that is he admitted unless there was some unforeseen disaster such as his not getting there on time he thought about that for a minute while a blue jay angrily scolded him from a nearby dogwood tree jack shook off the idea of not getting to the church on time with a shake of his head there was no way it could happen but the thought was an unpleasant reminder of his need to call laurie yet with the reality of not knowing when he would get patiences corpse he was once again able to put it off it had been longer than jack could remember since hed spent solitary idle time hed found that keeping himself frantically busy whether at work or at play was the best way to keep his demons at bay it had been laurie whod patiently coaxed him out of the habit over the last few years but that was when they were together this was different since he was alone yet he felt no urge to dwell on the past and what could have been he was content to think about what was going to be unless jack shook off the idea for the second time instead he picked up the newspaper and started reading it was a good feeling being al fresco in the sunshine enjoying the news with birds singing in the background the fact that he was sitting in the middle of a cemetery didnt bother him one iota in fact thanks to his ironic sense of humor it added to his pleasure finishing the newspaper jack turned to the magazines after he read several rather long but interesting articles in the new yorker jacks contentment began to wane especially when he found himself in direct sunlight he checked his watch and cursed it was a quarter to four he stood up stretched and gathered the newspaper and magazines one way or the other he was going to find percy and pin him down for a start time knowing that the last shuttle flight to new york was somewhere around nine he admitted he would not make it unless he drove the rentacar to new york which he was not excited about doing for multiple reasons he would have to stay in boston for one more night the idea of staying at the hotel hed seen at the airport occurred to him because he had no intention of going back to the bowmans without alexis and the kids being there as much as he sympathized with craig hed had quite enough of his funk at lunch the newspapers and magazines went into the hyundai through the missing passengerside window jack was halfway around the car when he heard the sound of the backhoe shielding his eyes from the sun and peering down through the trees jack saw percys yellow vehicle start up the cemeterys sinuous roadway it had its scoop folded up against its rear like a grasshoppers leg jack quickly called harold langley its almost four harold complained when jack told him the exhumation was about to get under way its the best i could do jack said i even had to bribe the man as it is jack didnt say hed also bribed walter strasser all right harold said with resignation ill be over in a halfhour i need to make certain things are ready here if im a little late do not open the vault until i am onsite i repeat do not try to take the lid off the vault until i am there to see it happen i have to identify the coffin and certify it was in that particular vault i understand jack said before percy arrived the park meadow pickup truck drove up enrique and cesar climbed out and unloaded equipment from the trucks bed with commendable efficiency and minimal conversation they staked out patiences grave site spread out a waterproof tarpaulin like the one jack had seen that morning at the grave that was being dug cut and removed the sod and stacked the rolled lengths on the tarpaulins periphery by the time percy rolled onto the scene the site was ready for the backhoe although percy gave jack a quick wave he didnt get out of his cab until hed positioned the excavating machine to his liking only then did he leap out to position his outriggers sorry i was delayed percy called to jack jack merely waved he wasnt interested in conversation all he wanted to do was get the damn coffin out of the ground when percy thought all was in order he went to work the scoop dug deeply into the relatively loose soil the backhoes diesel roared when the scoop was drawn inward then lifted percy swung the boom around and began piling the dirt on the tarp percy proved skillful at what he was doing and within a short time a wide trench with sharply perpendicular walls began to form by the time he was down approximately four feet harold langley arrived with the langleypeerson hearse he did a threepoint turn and backed the vehicle up alongside the deepening trench with his hands on his hips he inspected the progress youre getting close harold yelled to percy so ease up whether percy couldnt hear harold or chose to ignore him jack couldnt tell whatever the reason he continued digging as if harold wasnt there after a short time there was a jarring hollow sound as the scoops teeth clunked against the vaults concrete top a foot or so beneath the soil at the bottom of the pit harold went berserk i told you to ease up he yelled frantically waving his hands in an attempt to get percy to lift the scoop out of the hole jack had to smile harold looked completely out of place outside the funeral home in the sunshine with his somber black suit and pastycolored skin like a parody of a punk rocker spikes of darkly dyed hair which had been carefully combed and pomaded over his bald crown angled off from the side of his head percy continued to ignore harolds increasingly frenzied gestures instead he drew in the scoop creating a scraping screeching noise as the scoops metal teeth dragged along the vaults concrete lid in desperation harold dashed to the backhoes cab and pounded on the glass only then did the scoop stop and the roar of the diesel abate percy opened the door and looked at the livid funeral director with an innocent questioning expression youre going to break the vaults lid or tear off the eyehooks you harold yelled unable to come up with a sufficiently vulgar descriptive noun to express what he thought of percy his anger had him tonguetied content to let the professionals sort out their differences jack climbed into his car he wanted to use his phone and he thought the car would shield him from the noise of the backhoes diesel when percy recommenced digging the missing passengerside window faced away from the action jack called dr latasha wylie this time he got her directly i got your message earlier latasha admitted sorry i didnt get back to you thursdays are our grand rounds conference no problem jack said im calling now because they are finally digging up the body as we speak if all goes smoothly which i have no reason to suspect considering the obstacles ive had to deal with to get this far im looking at doing the case between six and seven at the langleypeerson funeral home you offered to help is that still a possibility the timing couldnt be better latasha said count me in ive got the bone saw packed and ready to go i hope im not taking you away from something more fun the pope was coming in for dinner but ill tell him we have to reschedule jack smiled latasha had a sense of humor akin to his ill plan to meet you at the home around six thirty latasha continued if thats not appropriate for whatever reason give me a call sounds like a plan can i offer you dinner after all the fun and games if its not too late a girl needs her beauty sleep jack disconnected as hed been speaking enrique and cesar had disappeared into the pit and shovelfuls of dirt had begun flying up into the air meanwhile percy had started rigging steel cables from the scoops teeth harold had returned to the edge of the pit staring down into its depths with his hands on his hips jack was pleased that he was taking such personal interest switching his attention to his phone jack considered calling laurie he now knew that hed missed even what hed called the worstcase scenario on the phone the night before getting home that evening events had inexorably pushed his departure until tomorrow morning the day of the wedding although his cowardly side tried to talk him into putting off the call until after the autopsy he knew he had to make the call now but that wasnt the only conundrum what to tell her about the mornings demolition derby on the mass pike was another issue after a moments thought he decided to come clean he felt the sympathy factor trumped the worry factor since he could say he was reasonably confident franco had to be convalescing at least for a few days and wouldnt be apt to pop up again of course that didnt exclude antonio whoever he was jack could recall an image of the man standing behind and to the side of franco at the memorial drive basketball court confrontation as well as his sitting in court that morning jack had no idea how he fit in with the fasano team but the fact that he existed had passed through jacks mind when percy had started digging patiences grave unconsciously jack had touched the revolver in his pocket at the time just to reassure himself it was there considering the seriousness of the threat communicated to the girls it wasnt a wild leap of imagination to think of someone showing up and contesting the exhumation taking a fortifying breath jack speeddialed lauries number there was always the hope hed get her voicemail unfortunately that didnt happen laurie answered quickly where are you she demanded with no preliminaries the bad news is that im in a cemetery in boston the good news is that im not one of the residents this is no time for jokes sorry i couldnt help myself i am in a cemetery the grave is being opened at this moment there was an uncomfortable pause i know you are disappointed jack said ive done everything i could to speed up the process id hoped to be on my way home at this time its not been easy jack went on to describe the mornings runin with franco he told her everything that had happened including the bullet lodging in the rentacars windshield support laurie listened in stunned silence until jack finished his monologue which had included the need to bribe both the cemetery superintendent and the backhoe operator he also had mentioned that craigs testimony had been a disaster it pisses me off that now i dont know whether to be angry or sympathetic if you are asking my opinion id lean in the direction of sympathy please jack no jokes this is serious after i finish the autopsy ill surely have missed the last shuttle flight tonight ill stay in a hotel at the airport flights start sometime around six thirty laurie sighed audibly im going over to my parents early to get ready so ill miss you here at the apartment no problem i think ill be able to get into my tuxedo without any help will you come to the church with warren thats my intention hes inventive the way he always finds parking for his ride all right jack see you at the church she disconnected abruptly jack sighed and flipped his phone shut laurie wasnt happy but at least hed gotten the unpleasant chore out of the way for a moment he marveled that there was nothing in life that was simple and straightforward slipping his phone into his pocket jack climbed out of the car as hed been talking with laurie things seemed to be coming to a head at graveside percy was back inside the backhoes cab and had the diesel engine cranking the scoop was poised over the excavation with attached steel cables stretching downward into the depths it was apparent the backhoe was putting significant tension on the cables jack walked to the edge of the hole to join harold looking down he could see that the cables were attached to eyehooks embedded in the vaults lid whats happening jack yelled over the diesel roar were trying to break the seal harold yelled back its not easy its an asphaltlike material thats used to make it waterproof the backhoe grunted and strained and then eased off only to begin anew what will we do if the seal holds jack questioned wed have to come back another day with the vault company people jack cursed but not audibly suddenly there was a lowpitched popping noise and a brief sucking sound well hallelujah harold said as he motioned for percy to slow down by flapping his hand the vault lid rose up when it got up to the edge of the pit enrique and cesar grabbed it to keep it steady while percy swung it away from the grave carefully he set it down on the grass percy then climbed out of the cab harold peered into the vault the lining was mirrorlike stainless steel resting inside was the whitegold metallic coffin there was a good two feet of clearance all around isnt she a beauty harold said with near religious veneration thats a huntington industries perpetual repose i dont sell many of those its really a sight to behold jack was more interested in the fact that the interior of the vault was as dry as a bone how do we get the coffin out he asked no sooner had jack posed the question than enrique and cesar climbed down into the vault and passed wide cloth straps under the coffin and then through the four side handles with the diesel back up to power percy swung the scoop back over the pit and lowered it so the straps could be attached harold opened the back of the hearse twenty minutes later the coffin was safely inside the hearse and harold closed the door will i be seeing you back at the home straight away harold asked jack absolutely i want to do the autopsy immediately also theres going to be another medical examiner involved her name is dr latasha wylie very well harold said he got into the hearses drivers seat backed out into the roadway and accelerated down the hill jack settled up with percy giving him the bulk of his wad of twentydollar bills he also gave a couple to enrique and cesar before getting into his car and beginning to head down the hill as he drove he couldnt help but feel pleased after all the leadup problems he was surprised that the exhumation itself had gone so easily in particular no fasano and no antonio and certainly no franco had shown up to spoil the party now all he had to do was the autopsy brighton massachusetts thursday june pm to jacks gratification things continued to go smoothly he drove from the park meadow to the langleypeerson home without incident as did harold with the coffin when jack had arrived latasha was already there waiting she had arrived only five minutes earlier so the timing was nearly perfect immediately on his arrival harold had had two of his beefy employees slide the perpetual repose coffin out of the hearse and onto a dolly the dolly had been rolled into the embalming room where it now stood heres the plan harold said he was standing next to the coffin with a bony hand resting on its gleaming metallic surface thanks to the bright bluewhite fluorescent light in the embalming room any lifelike color he had was washed out and he looked as if he should have been inside one of the perpetual reposes himself jack and latasha were standing a few feet away near the embalming table which was going to substitute as the autopsy table both had pulled on tyvek protective jumpsuits that latasha had thoughtfully brought from the medical examiners office along with gloves plastic face screens and a collection of autopsy tools also in the room were bill barton a kindly senior gentleman whom harold had described as his most trusted employee and tyrone vich a robust africanamerican man twice bill bartons size both had kindly volunteered to stay late and would assist jack and latasha in any way needed well now open the casket harold continued i will certify that it indeed contains the remains of the late patience stanhope bill and tyrone will remove the clothing and put the body on the embalming table for the autopsy once you have finished bill and tyrone will take over to redress the body and return it to the coffin so that it can be reinterred in the morning will you remain on the premises jack asked i dont think that is necessary harold said but i live nearby and bill or tyrone can call me if there are any questions sounds like a plan to me jack said enthusiastically rubbing his gloved hands together lets get the show on the road taking a crank from bill harold inserted its business end into a flush housing at one end of the metal coffin seated it and tried to turn it the effort brought a fleeting bit of color to his face but failed to turn the locking mechanism harold gestured toward tyrone who changed places with the director tyrones muscles bulged beneath his cotton scrub shirt and with an abrupt torturous screech the lid began to open a moment later there was a short hiss jack looked at harold is that hissing sound good or bad jack asked he hoped it was not indicative of gaseous decomposition neither good nor bad harold said it speaks to the perpetual reposes superb seal which is not surprising since its a topoftheline highengineered product harold directed tyrone to the opposite end of the casket where he repeated the process with the crank that should be it harold said when tyrone was finished he put his fingers under the edge of the coffin and had tyrone do the same at the other end then in a coordinated fashion they lifted the lid and allowed light to wash in over patience stanhope the interior of the casket was lined in white satin and patience was clothed in a simple white taffeta dress in keeping with the decor her exposed face forearms and hands were covered with a white cottony fluff of fungus beneath the mold her skin was marmoreal gray without a shred of doubt this is patience stanhope harold said piously she looks terrific jack said all decked out and ready for the prom harold cast a disapproving glance in jacks direction but kept his thin lips pressed together okay bill and tyrone jack said enthusiastically slip her out of her party duds and well get to work i will leave you now harold said with a hint of reprimand as if talking to a naughty child i hope you find this exercise worthwhile what about your fee jack questioned he suddenly realized hed not made any arrangement i have your business card doctor we will bill you perfect jack said thanks for your help our pleasure harold said tongue in cheek his funeraldirector sensibilities had been offended by jacks disrespectful language jack pulled over a stainlesssteel table on casters and put out paper and a pen he had no recording device and he wanted to write down his findings as he went along then he helped latasha arrange specimen bottles and the instruments although harold had laid out some of the embalming tools latasha had brought the more typical pathology knife scalpels scissors and bone clippers along with the bone saw your thoughtfulness in bringing all this equipment is going to make this a thousand times easier jack said as he attached a new scalpel blade to a scalpel handle i was planning on making do with whatever they had here which in hindsight was not a good idea it was no trouble latasha said glancing around the room i didnt know what to expect ive never seen an embalming room frankly im impressed the facility was about the same size as her autopsy room at the medical examiners office but had only a single central stainless steel table giving the impression of wideopen space the floor and walls were light green ceramic there were no windows instead there were areas of glass block that let in outside light jacks eyes followed latashas around the room this is palatial he said when i first conceived of doing this autopsy i imagined myself using someones kitchen table yuck latasha responded she glanced over at bill and tyrone who were busily disrobing the corpse you told me the story about patience stanhope and your internist friend on tuesday when you stopped by unfortunately ive forgotten the details could you give me a quick synopsis jack did better than that he told the whole story which included his relationship to craig as well as the threats hed received and craigs children had received about the autopsy issue he even told her about the incident that morning on the massachusetts turnpike latasha was shocked and her expression reflected it i suppose i should have told you this sooner jack said maybe you wouldnt have agreed so readily to get involved but my feeling is that if there was to be trouble at this point it would have happened before patience stanhope came out of the ground i agree with that latasha said recovering to a degree now trouble if its going to happen might depend on what we find you have a point jack agreed maybe it would be best if you dont help if anybody is going to be a target in any form or fashion i want it to be me what latasha questioned with an exaggerated expression and let you boys have all the fun no thanks thats never been my style lets see what we find and then decide how best to proceed jack smiled he admired and liked this woman she had smarts pluck and drive bill and tyrone lifted the corpse out of the casket carried it over to the embalming table and heaved it up onto the surface with a bucket of water and a sponge bill gently rinsed away the mold like an autopsy table the embalming table had lips around its periphery and a drain at the end to catch any wayward fluid jack moved over to be on patiences right while latasha was on her left both had donned their protective face and head gear tyrone excused himself to do his nightly security check bill retreated to the sidelines to be available if needed the bodys in fantastic shape latasha commented harold might be a tad stuffy but he apparently knows his trade both jack and latasha did their own silent external exam when latasha was finished she straightened up i dont see anything i wouldnt have expected she said i mean she went through a resuscitation attempt and an embalming and theres plenty of evidence of that i agree jack said hed been looking at some minor lacerations inside her mouth which were consistent with having been intubated during the resuscitation so far theres no suggestion of strangulation or burking but smothering without chest compression still has to be kept in mind it would be way low on my list latasha said the history pretty much rules it out you know what im saying im with you jack said he handed latasha a scalpel how about you do the honors latasha made the typical y incision from the points of the shoulders to the midline and then down to the pubis the tissue was dry like an overcooked turkey with a grayishtan color there was no putrefaction so the smell was fusty but not offensive working quickly and in tandem jack and latasha had the internal organs exposed the intestines had been completely evacuated with the embalming cannula jack lifted the firm edge of the liver beneath and affixed to its underside was the gallbladder he palpated it with his fingers we have bile he said happily that will help with the toxicology weve got vitreous as well latasha said palpating the eyes through the closed lids i think we should also take a sample of that absolutely jack said and urine too if we can get it from either the bladder or kidneys each took syringes and took the samples jack labeled his while latasha did the same with hers lets see if theres an obvious righttoleft shunt jack said i keep thinking the cyanosis issue is going to prove important carefully jack eased away the friable lungs to get a look at the great vessels after a careful palpation he shook his head everything looks normal the pathology is going to be in the heart latasha said with conviction i think you are right jack agreed he called bill over and asked if there were any stainless pans or bowls they could use for the organs bill produced several from a cabinet below the embalmingroom sink proceeding as if they were accustomed to working together jack and latasha removed the heart and lungs en bloc while she held the pan jack lifted the specimen out of the chest and placed it inside she put the pan down on the table beyond patiences feet lungs look normal jack said he rubbed his fingers over the lungs surface they feel normal too latasha said as she gently prodded them in a few locations too bad we dont have a scale jack called bill over and asked if a scale was available but it wasnt the weight feels normal to me jack said hefting the block of tissue latasha tried it but shook her head im not good at judging weights im eager to get to the heart but maybe we should first do the rest what do you say work first play later is that your motto something like that jack said lets divide the job to speed things up one of us could do the abdominal organs while the other does the neck dissection for completeness sake i want to make sure the hyoid bone is intact even though neither of us thinks strangulation was involved if you are giving me a choice ill do the neck youre on for the next halfhour they worked silently in their respective areas jack used the sink to wash out the intestines it was in the large intestine that he found the first significant pathology he called latasha over and pointed it was a cancer in the ascending colon its small but it looks like it penetrated the wall latasha said i think it has jack agreed and some of the abdominal nodes are enlarged this is dramatic proof that hypochondriacs do get sick would that have been picked up by a bowel study undoubtedly if shed had one its in craigs records that she continually refused his recommendation to do it so it would have killed her if she didnt have the heart attack eventually jack said how are you doing with the neck im about done the hyoid is intact good why dont you get the brain out while i finish up with the abdomen were making excellent time jack glanced up at the wall clock it was closing in on eight pm and his stomach was growling are you going to take me up on the dinner offer he called to latasha who was on her way back to the table lets see what time it is when we finish she called back over he shoulder jack found a number of polyps throughout patiences large intestine when he was finished with the gut he returned it to the abdominal cavity i do have to give harold langley credit his job with patience stanhope would have made an ancient egyptian embalmer proud i dont have much experience with embalmed bodies but the condition of this one is better than i expected latasha said as she plugged in the bone saw it was a vibrating device designed to cut through hard bone but not soft tissue she gave it a try it produced a highpitched whirring noise she positioned herself at the head of the table and went to work on the cranium which she had previously exposed by reflecting patiences scalp down over her face relatively immune to the racket jack palpated the liver looking for metastases from the cancer in the colon not finding any he made a series of slices through the organ but it was seemingly clear he knew that he might find some microscopically but that would have to be at a later date twenty minutes later after the brain had been cleared of gross abnormality and a number of specimens from various organs were taken the two pathologists turned their attention to the heart jack had cut away the lungs so it was sitting in the pan by itself its like saving the best present for last jack said while gazing eagerly and intriguingly at the organ and wondering what secrets it was about to reveal the size was about that of a large orange the color of the muscle tissue was gray but the greasy cap of adipose tissue was light tan its going to be like dessert latasha said with equal enthusiasm standing here looking at this heart reminds me of a case i did about half a year ago it was a woman who collapsed in bloomingdales and whose heart couldnt be paced by an external pacemaker just like patience stanhope what did you find on that case a marked developmental narrowing of the posterior descending coronary artery apparently a small thrombosis knocked out a good portion of the hearts conduction system in one fell swoop is that what you expect to find on this case its high on my list jack said but i also think there is going to be some kind of septal defect causing a righttoleft shunt to account for the cyanosis then he added parenthetically what its not going to tell us im afraid is why someone was so intent on us not finding out whatever it is we are about to learn i think were going to find widespread coronary disease and evidence of a number of previous small asymptomatic heart attacks so that her conduction system was particularly at risk prior to the final event but not compromised enough to show up on a standard ecg thats an interesting thought jack said he glanced across the table at latasha who continued to stare at the exposed heart his respect for her kept growing he just wished she didnt look nineteen it made him feel over the hill remember postmenopausal women have recently been shown to have different symptomatology than equivalent males when it comes to coronary heart disease the case you just described is evidence of that stop making me feel ancient and uninformed jack complained latasha made a gesture of dismissal with her gloved hand yeah sure she intoned with a chuckle how about we make a little wager since neither one of us is in our home office where such activity is frowned upon i say its going to be congenital and you say degenerative im willing to put up five bucks in support of my idea whoa big spender latasha teased five is a lot of cash but ill double you to ten youre on jack said after turning the heart over he picked up a pair of fine forceps and scissors and went to work latasha supported the organ as jack carefully traced and then opened the right coronary artery concentrating on the posterior descending branch when hed traced it as far as the instruments would allow he straightened up and stretched his back no narrowing he said with a combination of surprise and disappointment although he usually maintained an open mind diagnostically for fear of being blinded by the positive finding in this case hed been quite certain of the pathology hed encounter it was the right coronary artery that supplied blood to most of the hearts conduction system which had been knocked out by patience stanhopes heart attack dont despair yet latasha said the ten dollars is still in the balance theres no narrowing but i dont see any atheromatous deposits either youre right its perfectly clean jack agreed he couldnt quite believe it the entire vessel was grossly normal jack turned his attention to the left coronary artery and its branches but after a few minutes of dissection it was apparent the left was the same as the right it was devoid of plaque and stricture he was mystified and chagrined after all hed been through it seemed a personal affront that there was no apparent coronary abnormality either developmental or degenerative the pathology has to be on the inside of the heart latasha said maybe well see some vegetations on the mitral or aortic valve that could have thrown off a shower of thrombi that then cleared jack nodded but he was mulling over the probability of sudden cardiac death from a heart attack with no coronary artery disease he thought it was extremely small certainly less than ten percent but obviously possible as evidenced by the case in front of him one thing about forensic pathology that he could always count on was seeing and learning something new latasha handed jack a longbladed knife waking him from a mini trance come on lets see the interior jack opened each of the hearts four chambers and made serial slices through the muscular walls he and latasha inspected the valves the septa between the right and left sides of the heart and the cut surfaces of the muscles they worked silently checking each structure individually and methodically when they were finished their eyes met across the table the bright side is that neither of us is out ten dollars jack said trying to salvage humor from the situation the dark side is that patience stanhope is keeping her secrets to herself she was reputed to be less than cooperative in life and shes staying in character in death after hearing the history im shocked that this heart appears so normal latasha said ive never seen this i guess the answers are going to have to wait for the microscope maybe there was some kind of capillary disease process that involved only the smallest vessels of the coronary system ive never heard of such a thing neither have i latasha admitted but she died of a heart attack that had to have been massive we have to see pathology other than a small asymptomatic colon cancer wait a second whats that eponymous syndrome where the coronary arteries go into spasm she motioned to jack as if she were playing charades wanting him to come up with the name i honestly have no idea now dont spout some trivia thats going to make me feel inadequate prinzmetal thats it latasha said triumphantly prinzmetal angina never heard of it jack admitted now youre reminding me of my brotherinlaw whos the victim in this disaster hed know it for sure can the spasm cause massive heart attacks thats the question it cant be prinzmetal latasha said suddenly with a wave of dismissal even in that syndrome the spasm is associated with some stenoses of the vessel nearby meaning there would be visible pathology which we dont see im relieved jack said we have to figure this out one way or the other thats my intention but not seeing any cardiac pathology has me fooled and even embarrassed considering all the fuss ive caused to do this autopsy i have an idea latasha said lets take all the samples back to my office we can examine the heart under the stereo dissecting microscope and even do some frozen sections of the heart tissue to look at capillaries the rest of the specimens will have to be processed normally maybe we should just go have some dinner jack said suddenly wanting to wash his hands of the whole affair ill pick up some pizza on the way back to the office come on well make it a party theres one hell of a mystery here lets see if we cant solve it we can even get a toxicology screen tonight i happen to know the night supervisor at the lab at the university he and i were an item a while back things didnt work out but were still acquaintances jacks ears pricked up run that by me again he said with disbelief we could get a toxicology screen done tonight back in new york at the ocme jack was lucky to get one in a week the answer is yes but well have to wait until after eleven when allan smitham begins his shift whos allan smitham jack asked the possibility of an immediate toxicology screen opened up another whole dimension of inquiry we met in college we took a lot of chem and bio classes together then i went to med school and he went to grad school now we work a few blocks apart what about your beauty rest ill worry about that tomorrow night you have me hooked on this case we have to save your brotherinlaw from the evil lawyers newton massachusetts thursday june pm alexis answered on the fourth ring jack had called her number and put his phone on speaker before placing it on the rentacars front passenger seat he was on his way from the langleypeerson funeral home to the newton memorial hospital hed decided to make a short visit before the threetoeleven shift left for the day in hopes of catching matt gilbert and georgina okeefe it had been an impulsive decision when he and latasha left the funeral home after finishing up with the autopsy she had said she was going to stop at her apartment briefly to feed the dog drop off the fluid samples at the toxicology lab with a message for allan to call as soon as he got in and pick up a couple of pizzas at an allnight joint before meeting him in the parking lot of the medical examiners office she had given jack the opportunity to tag along but the window of opportunity had made him decide to stop at the hospital instead i was hoping it was you alexis said when she heard jacks voice can you hear me okay jack asked were on my speaker phone i can hear you fine where are you im always asking myself that same question jack joked his mood had flipflopped from its nadir brought on by finding nothing relevant in patiences autopsy to a near high he had been energized by latashas enthusiasm and the prospect of getting the assistance of a toxicologist and his mind had been picking up speed like an oldfashioned steam locomotive now ideas were flapping around inside his head like a flock of excited sparrows you are in a rare mood whats going on im in my rentacar on the way to the newton memorial are you all right im fine im just going to duck in and ask a couple of questions to the er people who handled patience stanhope did you do the exhumation and the autopsy i did what did you find other than a nonrelevant from our perspective cancer of the colon i found nothing nothing alexis questioned the disappointment in her voice was apparent i know what you are thinking because i thought the same i was depressed but now i think it was an unexpected gift how so if id found generic gardenvariety coronary disease which is what i actually expected to find rather than something dramatic which is what id hope to find i would have left it at that she had heart disease and had a heart attack end of story but the fact that she had no heart disease begs for an explanation i mean there is a slight chance that she had some fatal cardiac event that were not going to be able to diagnose eight months after the fact but now i believe the possibility is in our favor that there was something else involved especially considering the resistance fasano expressed about my doing the autopsy and franco trying to run me off the goddamn road and more significantly the threat expressed to your children how are they by the way theyre fine they act very secure and theyre having a ball here at grandmas shes spoiling them as she always does but back to your point what are you really trying to say i dont know exactly but heres some of my thoughts whatever they are worth patience stanhopes death and the resistance to my doing an autopsy could be two completely separate circumstances fasano and crew could be behind the threats and purely for venal reasons but somehow that doesnt make sense to me why would he go to the extent of breaking into your house and then blithely let me do the exhumation it seems to me that the three events are separate and not connected fasano threatened me for the reasons he gave franco has this ego problem after i whacked him in the nuts so my problems with franco have nothing to do with patience stanhope that leaves the breakin at your house unexplained this is too complicated alexis complained if tony fasano wasnt behind terrorizing my children then who was i have no idea but i asked myself what the motivation might have been if it didnt involve fasano and money its pretty clear that it would be an attempt to keep me from learning something and what could be learned from an autopsy one thing would be an overdose of medication or the wrong medication patience stanhope might have gotten at the hospital hospitals are big organizations with lots of stockholders involving lots of money thats crazy alexis said without hesitation the hospital wasnt behind my kids being victimized alexis you wanted me to come up here to boston and think out of the box and thats what im doing but the hospital she questioned with a whine is that why you are on your way there now it is jack confessed i think of myself as a reasonable judge of character i was impressed by the two er people i spoke with tuesday theyre forthright and devoid of artifice i want to talk to them again what are you going to do alexis asked scornfully ask them if they made some huge mistake that the hospital has to send people out to brutalize my children to try to cover up thats ridiculous when you put it that way it does sound farfetched but im going to do it anyway the autopsy is not over i mean the gross dissection is over but were now going to see what toxicology can come up with and also look at the microscopic i also want to corroborate exactly what medication patience stanhope was given so i can tell the toxicologist well that sounds more reasonable than accusing the hospital of some ridiculous coverup the thought of an overdose or wrong medication is not my only idea do you want to hear it im listening but i hope this next idea is more sane than your first jack thought of some witty sarcastic comebacks but he controlled himself the hospital idea was predicated on patience stanhopes heart attack and the opposition to the autopsy being two separate although related circumstances what if both involved the same person there was a deliberate pause while jack let this comment sink in im not sure im following you alexis said finally are you talking about someone causing patience stanhopes heart attack and then trying to prevent an autopsy to keep from being discovered thats exactly what im suggesting i dont know jack that sounds almost as crazy i suppose you are talking about jordan jordan is the first person that comes to mind craig said jordan and patience were hardly a loving couple and jordan is the big winner with her death he certainly didnt waste any time in mourning for all we know he and his girlfriend were carrying on while patience was still in the picture how can someone cause a heart attack in someone on purpose digitalis could do it i dont know alexis said dubiously this seems equally farfetched if jordan was at all guilty he certainly wouldnt initiate a malpractice suit and he absolutely wouldnt have signed the exhumation authorization ive thought of that jack said as he pulled into the parking area for the newton memorial hospital i agree it doesnt seem rational but maybe were not dealing with a rational person maybe jordan is getting a charge out of all this thinking it is showing how much smarter he is than the rest of us but this kind of supposition is jumping the gun first some kind of drug has to be found by toxicology if we find something then well have to work backwards thats the second time youve said we are you just using that as a figure of speech or what one of the medical examiners from the boston medical examiners office is generously helping i trust youve spoken to laurie alexis said is she okay with you still being here shes not the happiest camper but shes doing okay i cant believe you are getting married tomorrow nor can i jack said he nosed into a parking space overlooking the pond his headlights illuminated a flock of bobbing waterfowl what happened at the trial this afternoon randolph called two expert witnesses one from yale and one from columbia both were credible but hardly exciting best of all they were not at all phased by tony who tried to rattle them i think tony was hoping randolph would call craig back on the stand but randolph wisely didnt instead randolph rested that was it tomorrow morning will be the summations with randolph leading off has your intuition changed any about what you think the final outcome will be not really the defense witnesses were good but they were from out of town since boston is such a medical mecca i dont think the fact that they came from distant universities resonated well with the jurors tonys experts had more of an impact you probably have a point im sorry to say if by some slim chance you do discover some criminality in regard to patience stanhope it would probably save the day for craig dont think for a moment that such a thought isnt in my mind to be honest its my main motivation how is craigs mindset despondent as usual maybe even a little worse i worry a little with him home alone when do you think youll get back there i just dont know jack said suddenly feeling guilty about not wanting to return to the bowman home maybe you could check on him when you do i dont like that alcoholsleeping pill combination okay ill do that jack said im at the hospital now and i have to run no matter what happens i truly appreciate all your efforts jack youll never know how much your support has meant to me these last few days you still feel that way even though my meddling was responsible for what happened to the girls i dont hold that against you in the slightest after a few more sibling endearments that might have brought a tear to jacks eye had they continued they said goodbye jack flipped his phone closed and sat in the car for a minute thinking about relationships and how they changed over time it gave him a warm feeling to know that he and his sister were back to a semblance of their previous closeness despite the years of separation while hed struggled with his own despondency as jack climbed out of the car the zeal that latasha had generated came back in a rush alexiss comments had been a bit of a downer but he didnt need her to tell him his ideas were preposterous he was as he had explained thinking out of the box with a bunch of facts that were themselves seemingly implausible in contrast to his first visit the emergency room was hopping the waiting room was full with almost every seat taken a few people were standing outside on the ambulancereceiving dock it was a warm humid almost summer night jack had to wait in line at the admitting desk behind a woman holding a feverish infant in her arms the child stared at jack over the mothers shoulder with glazed eyes and a blank expression as jack moved up to the counter and was about to ask for dr matt gilbert the doctor appeared he tossed a completed er admission note attached to a clipboard onto the desk when he locked eyes with jack i know you he said pointing at jack he was obviously searching for the name dr jack stapleton right the medical examiner interested in the failed resuscitation case good memory jack commented its the main talent i picked up in medical school what can we do for you i need two minutes of your time hopefully with georgina okeefe is she here tonight she runs the show the admitting clerk said with a laugh shes here i know this is not the best time jack said but we exhumed the body and i just did an autopsy i thought you might like to know what was found absolutely matt said and this isnt a bad time were busy but its all routine stuff that should have been seen in the outpatient clinic or a doctors office theres no critical emergencies at the moment come on back into the lounge ill snare georgina for a few minutes jack sat by himself he used the time to look back over the two pages that constituted a record of patiences er visit hed pulled them from the case file while hed been talking to alexis welcome back georgina bubbled as she swept into the room matt came in after her both were dressed in white jackets over green scrub clothes matt said you dug up mrs stanhope and did an autopsy cool what did you find i mean no one has ever given us this kind of feedback the interesting thing was that her heart appeared entirely normal with no degenerative changes whatsoever georgina thrust the backs of her hands onto her hips with her elbows out her mouth formed a disappointed wry smile i thought we were going to hear something startling its startling in its own way jack said its rare with sudden cardiac death not to find pathology you came all the way over here to tell us you found nothing georgina questioned with disbelief she looked at matt for support actually i came to ask you if there was any chance she could have been given an overdose of any medication or maybe the wrong medication what kind of medication are you talking about georgina asked her smile faded replaced by a wary confusion anything jack said particularly any of the newer fibrinolytic or antithrombotic agents i dont know are you people involved in any randomized studies involving heart attack patients im just curious theres nothing like what im talking about on the order sheet jack handed the two pages over to georgina who glanced at them matt looked over her shoulder everything we gave her is on here georgina said holding up the order sheet she looked at matt for confirmation thats it matt agreed she was in extremis when she arrived with practically a flatline on the cardiac monitor all we tried to do was resuscitate her we didnt try to treat her mi what was the point she didnt get anything like digitalis no matt said we couldnt even get a heartbeat even with dualchamber sequential pacing her heart was completely unresponsive jack looked from georgina to matt and back again so much for the overdose or wrong medication idea the only laboratory reports on the er notes are blood gases were any other tests done when we draw blood for blood gases we routinely also order the usual blood count plus electrolytes and with heart attacks we order biomarkers if they were ordered how come theres no mention of it on the order sheet and why arent the results on the er note the blood gases are there matt took the sheets from georgina and quickly looked them over he shrugged i dont know maybe because they normally go in the hospital record but since she died so quickly she never got a hospital record he shrugged again i suppose they are not on the order sheet because its a standing order for all myocardial infarction suspects i did mention sodium and potassium were normal in my note so someone called the results to the er desk this isnt a bigcity er georgina explained its rare to have a death here usually people get admitted even those in bad shape could we call the lab and see if they could possibly locate the results jack asked he did not quite know what to make of this serendipitous discovery or whether it would have any meaning but he felt obligated to see where the lead would take him sure matt said well have the clerk call up there meanwhile weve got to get back to work thanks for coming by its strange you didnt find any pathology but its nice to know we didnt miss anything that could have saved her five minutes later jack found himself in the tiny windowless office of the evening laboratory supervisor he was a large heavyset man with heavily lidded eyes that gave him a sleepdeprived appearance he was staring at his computer monitor with his head tilted back his nametag read hi im wayne marsh i dont see anything under patience stanhope wayne said he had been very obliging when the er had called and invited jack up to his office hed been impressed with jacks credentials and if hed noticed the badge said new york rather than massachusetts he didnt mention it i need a unit number wayne explained but if she wasnt admitted then she didnt get one what about through billing jack suggested somebody had to pay for the tests nobodys in billing at this hour wayne said but didnt you mention you have a copy of the er record that will have an er accession number i can try that jack handed over the er notes wayne typed in the number here we go he said as a record flashed up on the screen dr gilbert was right we did a full blood count with platelets electrolytes and the usual cardiac biomarkers which ones we do ckmb and cardiacspecific troponin t on arrival at the er with repeats at six hours postadmission and twelve hours postadmission was everything normal depends on your definition of normal wayne said he twisted his monitor screen in its base so jack could see it he pointed to the bloodcount section theres a mild to moderate rise in the white count which is expected with a heart attack his finger then went to the electrolytes the potassium is at the upper edge of normal had she lived we would have wanted to check that for obvious reasons jack inwardly shuddered at the mention of potassium the frightening episode with lauries potassium during her ectopic pregnancy emergency was still fresh in his mind despite its being over a year ago then his eyes happened to notice the biomarker results to his surprise the tests were negative and he immediately called it to wayne s attention jacks pulse ratcheted up had he stumbled onto something significant thats not unusual wayne said with improved response times to nineoneone calls we often get our heart attack victims into the er within the three to fourhour interval it takes for the biomarkers to rise thats one of the reasons we routinely repeat the test at six hours jack nodded as he tried to sort out the discrepancy this new information provided he didnt know whether hed forgotten or never knew there was such a delay before biomarkers become positive not wishing to appear overly uninformed he worded his next questions carefully does it surprise you that an earlier bedside biomarker assay was positive not really wayne said why not there are a lot of variables first off theres about a four percent false negative result as well as a three percent false positive the tests are based on highly specific monoclonal antibodies but they are not infallible secondly the bedside kits are based on troponin i not t and theres a lot of bedside kits on the market was the bedside assay for troponin i alone or with myoglobin i dont know jack admitted he tried to remember what was written on the box in craigs doctors bag but he couldnt visualize it that would be important the myoglobin component becomes positive faster often within as little as two hours whats the time frame on this case he picked up the er note and read aloud patients husband states chest pain and other symptoms developed between five and six pm probably closer to six wayne looked up at jack she arrived in the er close to eight so the time frame is about right as far as our results are concerned since it was less than four hours do you know when the bedside assay was done i dont jack said but if i had to guess it would be somewhere around seven thirty well that does seem marginal but as i said the bedside tests are made by a host of companies with widely differing sensitivities the kits also should be carefully stored and i believe theres an expiration date frankly thats why we dont use them we much prefer the troponin t since its made by only one company we get very reproducible results with a short turnaround time would you like to see our abbott analyzer its a beauty it measures absorbance spectrophotometrically at four hundred fifty nanometers its right across the lab if you want to take a gander thank you but i think ill pass jack said he was getting in technically way over his head and his visit at the hospital had already been twice as long as he had planned he certainly didnt want to keep latasha waiting he thanked wayne for his help and returned quickly to the elevator as he rode down to the first floor he couldnt help but wonder if craigs bedside biomarker assay kit had somehow been defective either from improper storage or from being out of date and had given a false positive what if patience stanhope did not have a myocardial infarction all at once yet another dimension was opening up particularly with the services of a toxicologist available there were a lot more drugs that deleteriously affected the heart than those capable of simulating a heart attack jack jumped into the car and quickly dialed latashas number as hed done with his call to alexis he put his phone on speaker and placed it on the passenger seat by the time he was driving out of the hospital parking lot latasha answered where are you she asked im here in my office i got two hot pizzas and two large cokes where are you at im just leaving the hospital im sorry it has taken as long as it has but i learned something possibly important patience stanhopes biomarker test was negative when it was read by the hospital analyzer but you told me it was positive that was from a bedside biomarker kit jack said he carefully explained what hed learned from the lab supervisor what it all comes down to latasha said when jack was finished is that now were not sure she had a heart attack which would be consistent with what we found during the post precisely and if that is the case the toxicology is going to be key i already dropped the samples off at the toxicology lab with a note for allan to give me a call perfect jack said he couldnt help but marvel at how lucky he was to have latasha helping him if it hadnt been for her he might have given up after finding nothing in the heart i guess this puts the mourning husband in the crosshairs latasha added there are still some inconsistencies jack said remembering alexiss points against jordan s being the bad guy but generally i agree as trite and venal as it sounds when will you be here as soon as i can im coming up to route nine youre probably a better judge than i why dont you start on the pizza while its hot ill wait latasha said ive got myself busy making us some frozen sections of the heart im not sure ill be eating much jack said ive gotten myself psyched i feel like ive had ten cups of coffee when jack flipped his phone shut he checked the time it was almost ten thirty which meant latashas friend would soon be arriving at the toxicology lab jack hoped hed have a lot of free time since jack could imagine keeping him busy most of the night jack had no illusions about the power of toxicology to detect poisons it was not as easy a process as it was often portrayed in the popular media for large concentrations of the usual drugs there usually was no problem but for trace amounts of more toxic and lethal compounds that could kill a person in very small dosages it was like finding the proverbial needle in a haystack jack stopped at a traffic light and impatiently drummed his fingers on the steering wheel the warm soft humid june air wafted in through the missing window he was glad hed taken the time to visit the hospital although he now felt embarrassed about the idea of a hospital coverup nonetheless he rationalized that the idea had indirectly led to his questioning whether patience stanhope had suffered a heart attack the light turned green and he moved on the problem was she still might have had a heart attack wayne had admitted that even with his vaunted absorbance analyzer the rate of false negatives was higher than false positives jack sighed there was nothing about this case that was simple and straightforward patience stanhope was proving to be a problem patient even in death which reminded him of his favorite lawyer joke whats the difference between a lawyer and a prostitute the prostitute stops screwing you when you die from jacks perspective patience was assuming some annoying lawyerlike qualities as jack drove he mulled over his promise to check in on craig who was probably at that time already in a deep drugandalcoholinduced slumber jack wasnt excited about the idea and thought it unnecessary since in his estimation craig was not suicidal in the slightest and as an intelligent physician craig was well aware of the power of the medications he was taking on the other hand the good side of making such a visit would be a chance for jack to check what kind of biomarker kit craig used and whether it was outdated until he had that information he couldnt intelligently decide whether or not there was a higher than usual chance the result had been a false positive boston massachusetts friday june am for almost five minutes jack had watched the hands of the institutional wall clock as they implacably jumped staccatofashion toward one thirty am with the final leap of the minute hand jack took a breath he hadnt realized hed not been breathing for the final seconds since the time was a minimilestone exactly twelve hours hence he would be married and all the years hed avoided the issue would be history it seemed inconceivable except for the relatively recent past hed practically institutionalized being by himself was he capable of marriage and thinking of two people instead of one he didnt really know are you all right latasha asked yanking jack back to reality by reaching out and briefly gripping his forearm fine im fine jack blurted shed startled him i thought you were having an absence seizure you didnt move a muscle for the last few minutes you didnt even blink what on earth were you thinking that had you so mesmerized despite being an intensely private person jack almost told latasha what had been on his mind to get a fresh viewpoint such a reaction surprised him even though he acknowledged having developed a strong affinity toward the woman except for his detour to the newton memorial hospital they had been closely working together for some six hours and had fallen into a natural familiarity when jack had arrived at the boston medical examiners office theyd taken over what was supposed to be the library but the shelves were mostly empty in hope of future funding the rooms major asset was a large library table onto which jack had spread the contents of craigs malpractice file and organized them so hed be able to find anything in particular if there was a need at the far end of the table were several open pizza boxes paper plates and large cups neither had eaten much both had been consumed by the conundrum of patience stanhope they had also carried in the dualheaded stereodissecting microscope and sitting on opposite sides of the table had spent several hours opening and tracing all the coronary arteries like their larger and more proximal brethren all the distal vessels were normal and clear jack and latasha had paid particular attention to those branches serving the hearts conduction system the last stage of examining the heart was to be the microscopic theyd taken specimens from all areas of the heart but again concentrated in and around the conduction system before jack had arrived latasha had made a series of frozen sections from a small sampling and the very first thing they had done on his arrival was to stain them and then put them out to dry at the moment they were in the wings waiting for their cue just after theyd finished staining the slides allan smitham had called he apparently had been pleased to hear from latasha at least it seemed so to jack from the side of the rather personal conversation he was forced to hear even though he was trying not to he felt uncomfortable that he was intruding but the good news was that allan was eager to help and would run the toxicology screen immediately i didnt come up with any new ideas jack said in response to latashas question about what was on his mind back when his eyes had strayed to the clock and its staccato movement had hypnotized him into thoughts of his intimidatingly imminent marriage he was supposed to have been trying to think up new theories about patience hed related to latasha all his old theories by essentially repeating what hed told alexis on the phone en route to the hospital throwing all pretenses of selfrespect to the wind he included the drug overdosewrong drug idea even though in hindsight it sounded inane almost dimwitted and latasha had responded appropriately i didnt have any eureka moment either latasha admitted i might have laughed at some of your ideas but i have to give you credit for creativity i cant come up with nothing you know what im saying jack smiled maybe if you combined what ive told you with some of this material you would jack said he gestured at the casefile material on the table theres quite a cast of characters theres depositions here of four times the number of witnesses actually called id be happy to read some if you could tell me which you think would be potentially the most helpful if you were to read any read craig bowmans and jordan stanhopes as defendant and plaintiff they occupy center stage actually i want to reread both their recollections of patiences symptoms for sake of argument if she had been poisoned as were considering subtle symptoms would be crucial you know as well as i that some poisons are nigh impossible to find in the complicated soup of chemicals that make up a human being more than likely well have to tell allan what to look for in order for him to find it where are dr bowmans and mr stanhopes depositions jack picked them up he had placed them in their own stack both were thick he reached across and gave them to latasha holy shit she exclaimed feeling their weight what is this war and peace how many pages do we have here craig bowmans deposition went on for days the court reporter has to take down every word im not sure im up to this at nearly two am latasha said she let the volumes thump down on the table in front of her its all dialogue with lots of spacing its actually easy to breeze through them for the most part what are these scientific reprints doing here latasha said picking up the small stack of scientific publications dr bowman is the lead author in most of them and a contributing author in the rest craigs lawyer had considered introducing them as supporting evidence of craigs commitment to medicine as a way of blunting the plaintiffs stratagem of character assassination i remember this one when it came out in the journal latasha said holding up craigs seminal article in the new englandjournal of medicine once again jack was duly impressed you find time to read such esoterica this isnt esoteric stuff latasha said with a disapproving chuckle membrane physiology is key in just about every field of medicine these days particularly pharmacology and immunology even infectious disease and cancer okay okay jack said holding up his hands as if to protect himself i take back what i said my problem is that i went to medical school in the last century thats a lame excuse latasha said she flipped through the pages of craigs paper sodium channel function is the basis of muscle and nerve function if they dont work nothing works all right already jack said you made your point ill bone up on it latashas cell phone suddenly sprang to life in the silence it made both of them jump latasha snatched it up glanced at the lcd screen and then flipped it open whats happening she said without preamble pressing the phone to her ear jack tried to hear the voice on the other end but couldnt he assumed and hoped it was allan the conversation was pointedly short latasha merely said you got it and flipped her phone shut she stood up who was it jack asked allan latasha said he wants us to pay him a visit in his lab which is just around the corner i believe its worth the effort if were thinking of keeping him busy with our stuff are you game are you kidding jack questioned rhetorically he pushed his chair back and got to his feet jack hadnt realized that the boston medical examiners office was on the periphery of the vast boston city hospital medical center complex despite the hour they passed a number of medicalcenter employees including several medical students walking between various buildings no one seemed in a hurry despite the hour everyone was enjoying the warmth and silky texture of the air although technically still spring it felt like a summer night the toxicology lab was a mere two short blocks walk in a new eightstory glassandsteel structure in the elevator on the way up to the sixth floor jack looked over at latasha her dark eyes were riveted on the floor indicator display and her face was reflecting her rightful fatigue i apologize in advance if i say anything inappropriate jack said but i have the sense that this special effort allan smitham is willing to devote to this case is because of unrequited feelings he has for you maybe latasha said equivocally i hope that accepting his aid doesnt put you in an uncomfortable position i think i can handle it latasha said in a tone that proclaimed end of discussion the lab was stateoftheart and almost deserted in addition to allan there were only two other people there both lab technicians who were busily engaged at the far side of the generoussized room there were three aisles of benches groaning under the weight of gleaming new equipment allan was a strikinglooking african american with a closely trimmed mustache and goatee that gave him an intimidatingly mephistophelean air adding to his imposing appearance was a heavily muscular frame barely concealed by a white lab coat with rolledup sleeves over a formfitting black tshirt his skin was a burnished mahogany a shade or two darker than latashas his eyes were bright and fixated on his old college friend latasha introduced jack who rated only a quick but firm handshake and a rapid appraising glance allan was unabashedly interested in latasha whom he lavished with a broad smile filled with startlingly white teeth you shouldnt make yourself such a stranger girl allan said as he gestured toward his tiny utilitarian office he ended up sitting at his desk while latasha and jack took two straight chairs in his line of sight you have an impressive lab jack said hooking a thumb over his shoulder seems lean on staff though just for this shift allan said he was still smiling at latasha in terms of the number of employees the difference between us and the day shift is like night and day he laughed at his own joke jack had the feeling he wasnt lacking selfesteem or humor what did you find with our samples latasha asked cutting to the chase ah yes allan said steepling his fingers while his elbows rested on the desk you gave me a little background in your note which id like to go over to make sure i understand the patient died of a heart attack approximately eight months ago she was embalmed interred and recently exhumed what you want to do is rule out drug involvement lets put it more succinctly latasha said her manner of death was assumed to be natural we want to be sure it wasnt homicide okay allan intoned as if mulling over what he wanted to say next what was the result of the screen latasha asked impatiently why are you dragging this out jack inwardly cringed at latashas tone it made him uncomfortable that she was being less than gracious with allan who was doing them an enormous favor for jack it was becoming progressively clear there was something between them that he didnt know and didnt want to know i want to be sure you interpret the findings correctly allan said defensively were both medical examiners latasha shot back i think we are relatively informed about the limitations of a toxicology screen informed enough to know the predictive value of a negative test is only about forty percent allan questioned eyebrows raised and that is with a recently deceased not embalmed corpse so you are saying the toxicology screen was negative i am allan said it was definitely negative my god its like pulling teeth latasha complained she rolled her eyes and flapped her arms impetuously what drugs constitute your screen jack asked is digitalis included digitalis is included allan said as he halfstood to hand jack the labs toxicology screen drug list jack scanned the sheet he was impressed with the number of drugs included what methods do you use we use a combination of chromatography and enzyme immunoassay for our screens do you have gas chromatographymass spectrometry jack asked bet your ass we got massspec allan said proudly but if you want me to use the artillery youre going to have to give me an idea of what im looking for we can give you only a general idea at the moment jack said according to the symptoms the patient was reported to have had if drugs or poisons were involved we would be looking for something capable of producing a markedly slow heart rate unresponsive to all attempts at pacing and a respiratory depressant since she was also described as being cyanotic youre still talking about a shitload of potential drugs and poisons allan said without more specifics youre asking me for a miracle i know jack admitted but latasha and i are going to go back and brainstorm to see if we can come up with some likely candidates youd better allan said otherwise this is probably going to be a fruitless exercise first i have to figure out what to ignore with all the embalming fluid on board i know jack repeated why are you even considering homicide allan asked if you dont mind my asking jack and latasha exchanged a glance unsure of how much to say we just did the post a few hours ago latasha said we didnt find diddlysquat there was no cardiac pathology which doesnt make sense considering the history interesting allan said pensively he locked eyes with latasha let me get this straight you want me to do all this work take up my whole night and do it on the sly to boot is that what you are saying of course we want you to do it latasha snapped whats the matter with you why else would we be sitting here i dont mean you and the doc here allan said gesturing toward jack he then pointed at latasha i mean you personally yeah i want you to do it okay latasha said she stood up okay allan said there was a trace of a satisfied smile on his face latasha walked out of the office surprised at the sudden ending of the meeting jack got up and fumbled for one of his cards just in case you want to ask me something he said as he put it on allans desk he helped himself to one of allans from a small plexiglas holder i appreciate your help thank you no problem allan said the lingering smirk was still apparent jack caught up to latasha at the elevator he didnt say anything until they were on their way down that was a rather precipitous ending jack said he pretended not to look at latasha by watching the floor indicator yeah well he was getting on my nerves hes such a cocky bastard i sensed he didnt have a selfesteem problem latasha laughed and perceptively relaxed a degree they walked out into the night it was going on three but there were still people on the street as they neared the medical examiners office latasha spoke up i suppose you wondered why i appeared somewhat rude it crossed my mind jack admitted allan and i were tight the last year of college but then something happened that gave me insight into his personality that i didnt like she keyed open the front door and waved to the security person as they started up the single flight of stairs she continued i got a scare that i was pregnant when i told him his response was to ditch me i couldnt even get a call back so i wrote him off the irony is that i wasnt pregnant during the last year or so when he found out i was here at the me office hes tried to get us to connect up but im not interested im sorry if it was uncomfortable back there in his office no need to apologize jack said as i said on the way over i hope accepting his help wont cause a problem with as many years as there have been id thought id handle myself better than i did but just seeing him made me pissed about the episode all over again youd think i would have gotten over it they walked into the library the clutter was exactly as theyd left it how about we take a look at the slides we stained latasha suggested maybe you should go home and get some shuteye jack said theres no reason for you to pull an allnighter i mean i love the help and the company but this is asking way too much youre not getting rid of me that easy latasha said with a coy smile i learned back in medical school that for me when its this late its better to just stay up plus id love to solve this case well i think im going to take a drive out to newton back to the hospital nope back to the bowmans house i told my sister id look in on her husband to make sure hes not in a coma thanks to his depression hes been mixing alcohol in the form of a singlemalt scotch with some sort of sleeping pill yikes latasha said ive had to post several people like that truthfully with him i dont think its much of a worry jack said he thinks far too much of himself i doubt id even go if checking on him was the only reason what im also going to do is check the biomarker assay kit he used with patience to see if there is any reasonable reason to suspect he got a false positive if it were a false positive the possibility goes way up that the manner of death was not natural what about suicide latasha questioned youve never mentioned suicide even as a wildly remote possibility how come jack absently scratched the back of his head it was true that hed not thought about suicide and he wondered why he let out a small chuckle remembering how many cases hed been involved with over the years where the apparent manner of death was ultimately not the correct manner the last such case had involved the wife of the iranian diplomat that was supposed to be suicide but had been homicide i dont know why i havent given even a passing thought about suicide jack said especially considering some of my other equally unlikely ideas the little youve told me about the woman suggests she wasnt terribly happy thats probably true jack admitted but thats the only thing the idea of suicide has going for it well keep it in mind along with my hospital conspiracy idea but now im going to head out to newton of course youre welcome to come but i cant imagine why youd want to ill stay latasha said she pulled over craigs and jordans deposition transcripts to a position in front of one of the chairs and sat down ill do some background reading while youre gone where are the medical records jack reached for the correct pile and pushed it over against craigs and jordans depositions latasha picked up a short run of ecg that was sticking out of the stack whats this its a recording dr bowman made when he first got to patiences house unfortunately its almost useless he couldnt even remember the lead he had to give up doing the ecg because she was in such dire straits and rapidly worsening has anyone looked at it all the experts looked at it but without knowing the lead and not being able to figure it out they couldnt say much they all agreed the marked bradycardia suggested an av block with that and other suggestive conduction abnormalities they all felt it was at least consistent with a heart attack someplace in the heart too bad theres not more latasha said im out of here so i can get back jack said my cell phone is on if you have a eureka moment or if allan is able to pull off a miracle see you when you get back latasha said she was already speedreading craigs deposition at three oclock in the morning it was finally easy for jack to drive in boston at some of the traffic lights on massachusetts avenue jacks accent was the only vehicle waiting on several occasions he debated ignoring the light when there also wasnt any crosstraffic but he never did jack didnt have a problem breaking rules he judged ridiculous but traffic lights didnt fall into that category the massachusetts turnpike was another story it wasnt crowded but there was more traffic than he expected and it wasnt all trucks it made him wonder with amazement what so many people were doing out and about at such an hour the short drive to newton gave jack a chance to calm down from the near mania latasha had unleashed when she said she had access to a toxicologist just at the point jack was ready to throw in the towel in a more relaxed state of mind he was able to think about the whole situation considerably more rationally and when he did so it was clear what the most probable outcome was going to be first he was going to decide from lack of proof to the contrary that patience stanhope most likely died of a massive heart attack despite there being no obvious pathology and second that fasano et al were most likely behind the despicable assault on craig and alexiss children for trite economic reasons fasano had been unambiguously clear about the rationale when he directly threatened jack jacks mild mania had devolved into a tepid despondency by the time he arrived at the bowmans house he found himself again wondering if the reason he was still in boston and imagining outofthebox conspiracies had more to do with halfconscious fears of getting married in ten hours than trying to help his sister and brotherinlaw jack climbed out of the car clutching the umbrella he had the presence of mind to rescue from the backseat he was parked next to craigs lexus walking back to the street he looked up and down for the police cruiser that had been there that morning it was nowhere to be seen so much for the surveillance turning back to the house jack trudged up the front walk his fatigue was catching up to him the house was dark save for a little light filtering through the sidelights bordering the front door tilting his head back as he approached the front stoop jack checked the secondfloor dormer windows there were as black as onyx reflecting back the light from a distant streetlamp being relatively quiet jack slipped the key into the lock he wasnt trying to be secretive but at the same time he preferred not to wake craig if at all possible it was at that point jack remembered the alarm system with the key in the lock he tried to remember the code as tired as his mind was it took him a minute to recall it then he wondered if he was supposed to hit another button after the code he didnt know when he was as prepared as possible he turned the key the mechanism seemed loud in the nighttime stillness quickly stepping inside in a minor panic jack gazed at the alarm keypad luckily the warning buzz hed been expecting didnt sound but he waited to be certain the alarm was disarmed a bright green dot of light suggested all was well jack closed the front door quietly it was then that he became aware of the muted sound of the television coming from the direction of the great room from the same direction came a small amount of light spilling down the otherwise dark main hallway imagining that craig might still be up or possibly asleep in front of the tv jack descended the corridor and walked into the great room there was no craig the tv over the fireplace was turned to a cable news network and the lights were on in that section whereas the kitchen and the dining area were both dark on the coffee table in front of the couch stood craigs nearly empty scotch bottle an oldfashioned glass and the tv remote by force of habit jack walked over picked up the remote and turned the tv off he then went back out in the hall he looked up the stairs into the darkness and then down the length of the corridor to the study a tiny bit of light was coming through the studys bow window from the streetlights so it wasnt completely dark jack debated what to do first check craig or check the biomarker assay kit it wasnt a hard decision when faced with a choice jack generally did the less desirable chore or errand first and in this instance that was certainly the one involving craig it wasnt that he thought it would be difficult but he knew by going to his room he risked waking the man which he did not want to do for a variety of reasons the most important one was that he was convinced craig would not consider jacks presence a favor in fact the implication of neediness would most likely offend and irritate him jack looked back up into the darkness hed never been on the second floor and had no idea where the master bedroom would be not willing to turn on any lights jack retreated to the kitchen it was his experience that most families had a gadget drawer and most gadget drawers had flashlights as it turned out he was halfright there was a flashlight in the gadget drawer but the bowmans gadget drawer was in the laundry not the kitchen in keeping with the rest of the house and its contents the flashlight was an impressive footlong maglite that cast a serious and concentrated beam when jack turned it on believing he could put his hand over the lens and vary the amount of light jack returned with it to the stairs and started up reaching the top jack let enough light escape through his fingers to see down the upstairs hallway first in one direction and then the other multiple doors led off the hall on both sides and as luck would have it most of them were closed trying to decide where to start jack checked both directions again and determined the right hallway was half the length of the left unsure of why jack started to his right picking a door at random he silently opened it and pushed it ajar enough to step across the threshold slowly he let light spread around the room it certainly wasnt the master it was one of the girls bedrooms and from the posters photos knickknacks and clothes strewn about jack could tell it was tracy s back in the hall jack proceeded to the next door he was about to open it when he noticed the doors at the very end of the hall facing him were double since all the other doors were single it seemed a good bet that hed found the master keeping the flashlight mostly covered jack walked down to the double doors he pressed the flashlight lens against his abdomen to block the light as he opened the righthand door it swung inward as he slipped into the room he could tell he was in the master suite for certain he had stepped into deeppile walltowall carpet for a moment he didnt move he strained to hear craigs breathing but the room was silent slowly angling the flashlight progressively more light extended deeper into the room out of the gloom emerged a kingsize bed craig was lying on the side of the bed farthest from jack for a moment jack stood still debating what he was going to do to make sure craig was not comatose up until that moment he hadnt given it much thought but now that he was in the room he had to although waking craig would be definitive it was not an option ultimately jack thought hed just walk over and listen to craigs breathing if that sounded normal jack was willing to accept it as positive proof the man was okay despite it being far from scientific reducing the light again jack started across the room moving more from memory than visually a meager amount of ambient light was managing to finger its way through the dormer window from the street it was enough to give jack a vague outline of the larger pieces of furniture reaching the foot of the bed jack stopped and strained to hear the intermittent sibilant sounds of sleep the room was deathly quiet jack felt a rush of adrenaline to his horror there was no sound of respiration craig was not breathing newton massachusetts friday june am the next few seconds were a blur for jack the instant he realized his brotherinlaw was not breathing he lunged forward with the intention of rounding the corner of the bed to get to craigs side in the shortest possible time there he would whip back the covers rapidly evaluate the mans status and begin cpr if it was appropriate the sudden sideward movement possibly saved jacks life in the next instant jack realized that he was not alone in the room there was another figure clad in black making him all but invisible who streaked out of the open bathroom doorway the individual was brandishing a large club that he swung in a wide arc at the spot where jacks head had been although the blow missed jacks head it did hit his left shoulder luckily it was a glancing blow that did not impact with its full force still it sent a shooting searing pain into the core of jacks body weakening his knees in the process jack was still clutching the flashlight the beam of which raced haphazardly around the room as he scrambled past the end of the bed avoiding going alongside it he did not want to be trapped by the intruder more by instinct than vision he knew that another blow with the club was coming as the figure leapt at him in pursuit jack ducked down low to the floor and believing offense the best defense threw himself forward meeting his attacker with the point of his right shoulder as if he intended to tackle him jack had the man around the upper thighs and with continued pumping of his legs strengthened by all his bicycle riding he was able to drive the man backward before both fell to the floor in close proximity jack felt he had the advantage by using the footlong heavy maglite as a weapon the longer club wielded by the attacker was at a distinct disadvantage letting go of the mans thighs jack grabbed a handful of shirt and rapidly lifted the flashlight alongside his head with full intention of striking the mans forehead but as he raised the flashlight its beam had illuminated the mans face luckily before jack struck his mind quickly fired the right neurons and recognized the man it was craig craig jack shouted in disbelief he swiftly brought the light down from its threatening position and shined it on craigs face just to be certain jack craig sputtered in return he raised his free hand to shield his eyes from the blinding light good god jack voiced he let go of craigs shirt directed the flashlight away from craigs face and got to his feet craig got to his feet as well he went to a wall switch and turned on the light what the hell are you doing here sneaking around in my house at whatever the hell time it is he looked over at the bedside clock three thirty in the goddamn morning i can explain jack said he winced at a stab of shoulder pain tentatively he touched the area finding a point of tenderness at the juncture of his collarbone and shoulder good grief craig complained he tossed what turned out to be a baseball bat onto the bed he came over to jack god im sorry i freakin hit you i could have killed you are you all right ive had worse jack said he glanced over at the bed what hed thought had been craig was merely pillows and bedcovers can i check it craig asked solicitously sure i guess craig took hold of jacks arm and gently put his hand on jacks shoulder he rotated jacks arm in its shoulder socket then raised it slowly any pain a little but the movement doesnt make it worse i dont think anything is broken but an xray wouldnt hurt i could drive you over to the newton memorial if youd like i think ill put some ice on it for now jack said good ideal come on down to the kitchen ill put some ice in a ziploc bag as they walked along the upper hallway craig said my heart is going a mile a minute i thought you were one of these guys whod broken in and manhandled my daughters who was back to carry out his threat i was ready to knock you into the next county i suppose i thought you were one of those guys as well jack said he noticed that craig was wearing a darkcolored bathrobe and not the black ninja outfit jack had creatively imagined he also felt the gun in his jacket pocket knocking against him hed not thought of it in the fury of the moment and it was a good thing craig got jack set up with an ice bag jack was sitting at one end of the couch holding the cold pack against the point of his shoulder craig collapsed at the other end holding a hand against his forehead ill get out of here so you can get back to sleep jack said but i owe you an explanation im listening craig said before i went to bed i went downstairs to check the apartment youd pulled the linens off the bed i certainly didnt expect you and especially at this hour and especially not sneaking around upstairs i promised alexis id check on you did you talk with her tonight i did but not until quite late frankly shes worried about your mixing alcohol and sleeping pills and she should be worried ive autopsied a few people thanks to that combination i dont need your advice fair enough jack said nonetheless she asked me to check on you to be honest i didnt think it was necessary the reason i was seemingly sneaking was because i was afraid to wake you for fear youd be angry i was there craig took his hand away from his face and gazed at jack youre right about that im sorry if i offended you i did it for alexis she was afraid you might be more upset than usual after what happened at the trial at least youre honest craig said i suppose i should see it as a favor its just hard with whats going on im being forced to see myself in an unflatteringly different light i was a miserable ridiculous selfdefeating witness today when i think about it in retrospect im embarrassed how do you think the afternoon went with the defense experts it was reasonable it was nice to hear some positive words for a change but i dont think it was enough unless randolph pulls off an oscarwinning performance with his summation tomorrow which i personally believe hes incapable of i think the jury is going to find for that bastard jordan craig sighed despondently he was staring at the blank tv screen i had another reason for coming out here at this late hour jack said oh and what was that craig asked he turned to look at jack his eyes were glazed as if he was ready to cry but too embarrassed to do so you havent told me about the autopsy did you do it i did jack said he went on to tell craig a truncated version of the days events starting with the exhumation and ending with the meeting with the toxicologist he didnt tell craig as much as hed told alexis but the gist was the same as jack spoke craig became progressively riveted especially about the toxicologist and the possibility of the involvement of criminality if the toxicologist could find some drug or poison it would be the end of this malpractice nonsense craig said he sat up straighter no doubt jack said but it is a very very long shot as i explained yet if patience did not have a heart attack it opens up the possibility of many more potential agents the other reason i came out here tonight was to look at the box of bedside biomarker assay devices in your doctors bag is there any reason you can think of that your result could have been a false positive craig raised his eyebrows for a moment while he mulled the question i cant think of any he said at length i wish i could but i cant the lab supervisor at the hospital asked me if the one you used tested for both troponin i and myoglobin or just troponin i its the one with the myoglobin i chose to stock that one for the reason the lab supervisor mentioned namely it gives a result in as little as two hours is there a shelf life for those devices not that i know of then i guess well just have to limit the possible agents to those capable of causing a heart attack what about digitalis craig suggested i thought of digitalis for sure and it was part of the screen so digitalis was not involved i wish i could help more craig said one of the worst parts of being sued is you feel so helpless you could help if you could think of any cardiotoxic drugs patience or jordan might have had access to she had quite a pharmacopoeia in her medicine cabinet thanks to my absent partner ethan cohen but all those records were turned over in discovery ive been through those jack said he got to his feet relaxing for a few minutes seemed to make his legs feel heavy and sluggish it was obvious he was going to need some coffee before the night was over i better get back and see if the toxicologist has had any luck and you better get back to bed he started for the door are you going to work all night craig asked accompanying jack it looks like that jack said after everything thats happened i wish i could be certain of some positive result but its not looking likely i dont know what to say other than thanks for all your effort youre welcome jack said and its been positive despite the problems ive caused and the whacks ive taken it has been nice to hook back up with alexis they reached the front door craig pointed down toward the study should i run and grab my doctors bag so you can look at the biomarker assay box im sure its the same box after this fiasco im not making many house calls jack shook his head im good you told me what i needed to know will we see you in court tomorrow i dont think so ive got some pressing personal plans that are dictating i take the first shuttle back to the big apple so let me say good luck jack and craig shook hands having become if not friends a bit more knowledgeable and appreciative of each other the ride back into the city a little after four am was a mirror of the ride out there was traffic on the mass pike but very little once in the city along mass ave it took jack less than twenty minutes to get all the way to the medical examiners office he parked right on the side of the building in a reserved space but since he would be leaving at such an early hour he didnt think it would matter security recognized him and let him in as he climbed the stairs he looked at his watch it was coming down to the wire in less than two hours hed be on the plane taxiing away from the terminal walking into the library jack did a double take the place was in considerably greater disarray than when he had left latasha looked as if she were cramming to take her medical specialty boards there were numerous large books that shed gathered from around the office lying open on the tabletop jack recognized most they included standard internalmedicine textbooks physiology books toxicology books and pharmacology books the case file material that jack had organized was now randomly spread out at least according to his eye what the hell jack questioned with a laugh latashas head popped up from an open textbook welcome back stranger jack flipped the covers back on a couple of the books he didnt recognize after he saw the titles he reopened the books to where latasha had them he took a seat opposite her what happened to your shoulder jack was continuing to press the ziploc bag against his bruise by now the bag contained mostly water but it was still cool enough to be of some benefit he told her what had happened and she was appropriately sympathetic for him and inappropriately critical of craig it wasnt his fault jack insisted ive been so consumed by this case for a variety of reasons that i never stopped to think of what a harebrained idea it was for me to go sneaking into his house i mean this is after someone else had broken into it and terrorized his kids to give him a message that theyd be back if i did an autopsy and i just did the autopsy for chrissake what was i thinking but you were a houseguest youd think hed make sure who he was hitting with a baseball bat i wasnt a houseguest any longer but lets drop it thank god no one got hurt any more than a shoulder contusion at least i think it is just a contusion i might have to get my clavicle xrayed look on the positive side latasha said you certainly made sure he wasnt comatose you know what im saying jack had to smile in spite of himself what about the biomarker assay kit did you find out anything nothing that raised the possibility hed gotten a false positive i think we have to assume it was a legitimate result i suppose thats good latasha said it eliminates a lot of potential lethal agents her eyes swept over the books she had arranged around her it looks like youve been busy you have no idea i got my second wind with the help of a few diet cokes its been like a great review course in toxicology i havent studied this stuff since forensic boards what about allan has he called you several times to be exact but its good the more i hear his voice the easier it is not to drag up old memories and get pissed has he had any luck nope not at all apparently hes trying to impress me and you know something hes not doing such a bad job i mean i knew he was smart and all back in college with his majoring in chem math and physics but i didnt know hed gone on to get a phd at mit i know that takes a few more brains than medical school where perseverance is the major requirement did he say what kinds of things hes ruled out most of the more common cardiotoxic agents that were not on the screen he also explained to me some of the tricks hes using the embalming chemicals are making it much harder with the tissue samples like from the heart and liver so hes concentrating on the fluids where theres been less contamination so whats with all these textbooks i started by reviewing cardiotoxic agents a lot of which i learned could cause heart attacks or at least enough damage to the cardiac muscle so that clinically it would present as one even though there was no occlusion of cardiac vessels i mean thats what weve found from the autopsy its also what i found on the frozen sections we stained i took a peek at a couple of the slides while you were gone the capillaries look normal i left the slide in the microscope in my office if youd like to take a peek ill take your word for it jack said i didnt expect wed see anything as clear as the gross was now ive expanded from purely cardiotoxic agents to neurotoxic agents since a lot of them do both i tell you its fascinating stuff especially how it dovetails with bioterrorism did you read the depositions jack asked he wanted to keep the conversation on track hey you werent gone that long i think ive gotten a lot done give me a break we are running out of time we have to stay focused im focused man latasha scoffed im not out driving around learning something i essentially already knew and getting beat on in the process jack rubbed his face briskly with both hands in an attempt to dispel the cobwebs of fatigue that were interfering with his cognition and emotion being at all critical of latasha was surely not his intent where are those diet cokes i could use a blast of caffeine latasha pointed toward the door to the hall theres a vending machine in the lunchroom down on the left when the can of soda thudded down into the vending machines opening it was loud enough in the buildings silence to make jack jump he was tired but he was also tense and he wasnt entirely sure why it could have been because time was running out as far as the case was concerned but it also could have been anxiety about returning to new york and all that it entailed after flipping open the can of soda jack hesitated was caffeine advisable if he was already mildly uptight throwing caution to the wind he downed the can then burped he rationalized that he needed his wits to be sharp and for that caffeine was what the doctor ordered feeling a slight buzz since caffeine was not one of his vices jack reclaimed the seat across from latasha and cherrypicked craigs and jordans deposition transcripts from the debris around latasha i didnt read those depositions cover to cover latasha said but i did kinda breeze through them to make a list of patiences symptoms really jack questioned with interest thats what i was just about to do i guessed as much since thats what you suggested before your illfated drive out to the suburbs where is it jack asked latasha scrunched up her features in concentration while she riffled through some of the material in front of her eventually she came up with a yellow legal pad she handed it across to jack jack settled back in his chair there was no order to the symptoms other than their being divided into two major groups the morning of september eighth and the late afternoon and early evening the morning group included abdominal pain increased productive cough hot flashes nasal congestion insomnia headache flatulence and general anxiety the late afternoonearly evening group comprised chest pain cyanosis inability to talk headache difficulty walking difficulty sitting up numbness a sensation of floating nausea with a little vomiting and generalized weakness is this all jack asked waving the pad in the air you dont think thats enough she sounds like most of my patients in thirdyear medical school i just wanted to make sure its all the symptoms mentioned in the depositions its all the ones i could find did you find any mention of diaphoresis no i didnt and i looked for it specifically i did too jack said sweating is so typical of a heart attack i couldnt believe it when i didnt see it on my first reading im glad you didnt see it either because i thought maybe id just missed it jack glanced back at the list the trouble was that most of the entries had no modifiers and the ones that did had modifiers that were too general and not descriptive enough it was as if all the symptoms were equally important which made it difficult to weigh each symptoms contribution to patiences clinical state numbness for instance had little meaning without a description of location extent and duration and whether it meant no feeling whatsoever or paresthesia more commonly known as pins and needles in such a circumstance it was impossible for jack to decide if the numbness was of neural or cardiovascular origin you know what i find most interesting about this toxicology stuff latasha said looking up from a large textbook no what jack said vaguely he was preoccupied in deciding he would need to go back through the depositions himself and see what qualifiers existed for the symptoms mentioned reptiles latasha said its a wonder how all their venoms evolved and why there is such a difference in potency it is curious jack said as he opened jordan s deposition and began rapidly flipping through the pages to get to the section involving the events of september eighth there are a couple of snakes whose venom contains a powerful specific cardiotoxin capable of causing direct myocardial necrosis can you imagine what that would do to the level of cardiac biomarkers really jack questioned with sudden interest what kind of snakes latasha cleared a trench through the material on the desk and after turning the textbook around she pushed it over in front of jack she used her index finger to point to the names of two types of snakes on a table comparing snake venom virulence the mojave rattlesnake and the southern pacific rattlesnake jack glanced at the table the two snakes she pointed out were among the most poisonous of those listed very interesting jack said his interest faded as quickly as it had arisen he pushed the book back however we are not dealing with an envenomation patience wasnt bitten by a rattlesnake i know latasha said taking the book back im only reading about venom to get ideas for various classes of compounds to consider i mean we are looking for a cardiotoxin uhhuh jack said he had already gone back to the deposition and found the part he was looking for he began to read more closely actually the most interesting venomous animals are a group of amphibians of all things latasha said really jack said without actually hearing hed come across the mention of abdominal pain in the deposition jordan testified it was lower abdominal pain more on the left than the right jack amended latashas entry on the yellow legal pad its the colombian poison dart frogs that take the cake latasha said flipping the pages in the textbook until she came to the right section really jack repeated he skipped ahead in jordan s deposition until he got to where jordan was talking about the evening symptoms jack was particularly looking for the section where jordan talked about the numbness patience had experienced their skin secretions contain some of the most toxic substances known to man latasha said and they have an immediate toxic affect on heart muscle are you familiar with batrachotoxin vaguely jack said he found the reference to numbness and it was apparent from jordan s description that it was paresthesia not the absence of feeling and it involved her arms and legs jack wrote the information on the yellow pad it is the worst toxin of all when batrachotoxin comes in contact with heart muscle it stops all activity immediately latasha snapped her fingers in vitro one minute cardiac myocytes are pumping away and the next instant after exposure to a few molecules of batrachotoxin they are completely stopped can you believe that its hard to believe jack agreed he found jordan s reference to floating and interestingly it was associated with the paresthesia and had nothing to do with being in liquid it was a sensation of not being grounded and floating in air jack wrote the information on the yellow pad the poison is a steroidal alkaloid rather than a polypeptide for whatever thats worth its found in several frog species but the one that has the highest concentration is called phyllobates terribilis its aptly named since one tiny frog has enough batrachotoxin to kill a hundred people its mindboggling jack found the section where jordan discussed patiences weakness which it turns out didnt refer to a diminution of any particular muscle group rather the weakness was a more global problem it started with difficulty walking and progressed to difficulty sitting up in short order jack added the information to the yellow pad theres something else you should know about batrachotoxin if you dont already its molecular mode of action is to depolarize electrical membranes like heart muscle and nerves and do you know how it does it it does it by affecting sodium transport something you thought was esoterica remember what was that about sodium jack asked as latashas comments penetrated his concentration when jack was thinking hard about something he often could be oblivious to his surroundings as latasha had experienced batrachotoxin latches onto nerve and muscle cells and causes the sodium ion channels to lock in the open position meaning the involved nerves and muscles stop functioning sodium jack repeated as if in a daze yes latasha said remember we were speaking all of a sudden jack leaped to his feet and scrabbled madly through the litter spread around the table where are those papers he demanded in a minor frenzy what papers latasha questioned she had stopped speaking in midsentence and had leaned back in her chair surprised by jacks abrupt impetuosity in his haste he was knocking deposition transcripts off the table you know he blurted struggling to come up with the right word those those papers weve got a lot of papers here big guy god how many diet cokes did you drink anyway screw it jack sputtered he gave up on his search instead he reached out toward latasha let me see that toxicology text he demanded rashly sure latasha said mystified at his transformation she watched as he riffled through the pages of the massive tome to get to the index once there he hastily ran his fingers down the columns until he found what he was looking for then he went back to rapidly leafing through the book so fast that latasha had a fear for its integrity he found the correct page and was silent would it be asking too much for you to tell me what you are doing latasha scoffed i think ive had what you would call a eureka moment and i would call an epiphany jack muttered while continuing to read yes he cried after a few moments raising a triumphant fist in the air he slammed the book closed and looked across the table at latasha i have an idea of what to ask allan to look for its weird and if it is present it might not fit all the facts as we know them but it fits some of the most important ones and it would prove craig bowman did not commit medical negligence like what latasha demanded she couldnt help but feel some irritation that jack was being so coy she was in no mood for games at almost five oclock in the morning check out this strange symptom you wrote jack said he reached over with the yellow pad and pointed to the notation sensation of floating now thats not your runofthemill complaint of even the most dedicated hypochondriac that suggests something truly weird was going on and if allan is able to find what im thinking there would be the suggestion that patience stanhope was either a diehard sushi fan or a crazed devotee of haitian voodoo but were going to know differently jack latasha said irritably im too tired for this kind of joking im sorry jack said this apparent teasing is because im afraid i might be right this is one of those situations despite the effort involved where id rather be wrong he reached out for her come on ill tell it to you straight while we hurry over to allans lab this is going to go right down to the wire boston massachusetts friday june am jack nosed his worseforwear hyundai to the curb behind a brown ups truck it was a loading area on busy cambridge street in front of a long arcaded curved building facing boston city hall jack thought the chances of getting a parking ticket even though he was planning on being as fast as he could were close to one hundred percent he was hoping the car wouldnt be towed but in case it was he took his carryon bag with him along with a large envelope with the return address of the office of the chief medical examiner printed in the upperlefthand corner he charged up a flight of stairs that penetrated the building and emerged into the courtyard fronting the suffolk county superior court wasting no time jack sprinted over to the entrance he was slowed down by security and the need for his carryon envelope and cell phone to go through the xray machine at the elevators he made sure he pushed into the very next car as the elevator rose jack managed to glance at his watch the fact that he was to be married in four hours wasnt lost on him and the fact that he was in the wrong city gave him considerable anxiety when the elevator arrived on the third floor jack tried to be as polite as he could as he struggled to get off if he didnt know better he would have thought the other passengers were deliberately impeding him although on previous occasions jack had tried to be as quiet as possible while entering the courtroom on this day he just burst in his feeling was the more of a scene he created the better as he walked deliberately down the aisle toward the gate separating the bar area from the spectator area most of the spectators turned to look at him including alexis in the first row jack nodded to her the court officer was in his box reading something out of sight on his desktop and did not look up the jury was in the jury box as impassive as ever and was focusing on randolph who was at the podium apparently just beginning his closing statement the judge was at his bench looking at papers on his desktop both the court reporter and the clerk were busy at their stations at the defense table jack saw the back of craigs head and that of randolph s assistant at the plaintiffs table jack could see the backs of the heads of tony jordan and tonys assistant all was in order like an oldfashioned steam locomotive the wheels of justice were slowly implacably picking up speed and rolling to a conclusion it was jacks intention to hijack the train he didnt want to derail it but wanted to stop it and let it take a different track he reached the bar and stopped he could see the jurors eyes swing toward him without so much as a dent in their acquired impassivity randolph was continuing to speak in his cultured mellifluous voice his words were golden like the shafts of latespring sunlight that skirted the blinds on the high windows and knifed down through the motefilled air excuse me jack said excuse me he said louder when randolph had continued to speak jack was not in his line of sight but randolph turned in jacks direction when jack called out the second time his arcticblue eyes reflected a mixture of confusion and vexation the court officer who had also missed jacks first utterance definitely heard the second he got to his feet security in the courtroom was his bailiwick i need to talk with you this very instant jack said loud enough for everyone in the otherwisesilent courtroom to hear i know its rather inconvenient but it is of vital importance if you are interested in avoiding a miscarriage of justice counselor what the devil is going on judge davidson demanded he was tipping his head down to see over the top of his halfglasses he motioned for the court officer to stay in his box still bewildered but calling on years of litigation experience randolph quickly reverted to his signature refined neutrality he cast a glance in the judges direction before redirecting his attention to jack i wouldnt be doing this if it werent crucial jack added lowering his voice he could see that the occupants of both the defense and plaintiffs tables had swung around in jacks direction jack was interested in only two craig and jordan of the two jordan was the more surprised and seemingly disturbed at jacks disruptive arrival randolph turned to the judge your honor may i indulge the courts patience for just a moment two minutes judge davidson said petulantly he would allow randolph to speak with jack but only to get rid of him it was painfully clear that the judge was unhappy with an interruption in his courtroom randolph moved over to the bar and gave jack an imperious glance he spoke sotto voce this is highly irregular i do this all the time jack whispered reverting to his old sarcastic style you have to put me on the stand i cannot put you on the stand ive already explained why and im giving my closing statement for heavens sake i did the autopsy and i can provide evidence corroborated by affidavits from a massachusetts medical examiner and a massachusetts toxicologist that dr bowman did not commit medical negligence for the first time jack detected a tiny crack in the shell of equanimity within which randolph operated it was his eyes that betrayed him as they rapidly and nervously flicked back and forth between the judge and jack there was little time for reflection much less debate mr bingham judge davidson called out impatiently your two minutes are up ill see what i can do randolph whispered to jack before returning to the podium your honor may i approach the bench if you must judge davidson said none too pleased tony leaped his feet and joined randolph at the sidebar what in tarnation is going on judge davidson whispered forcibly who is this man his eyes briefly whipped over to jack standing at the gate like a supplicant although jack had put down his carryon he was still holding the envelope his name is dr jack stapleton randolph said he is a boardcertified medical examiner from the office of the chief medical examiner in new york ive been informed he is very well regarded professionally judge davidson looked at tony do you know him ive met him tony admitted without elaboration what the hell does he want barging in here like this this is highly irregular to say the least i expressed the same sentiments randolph reported he wants to be put on the stand he cant be put on the stand tony snapped hes not been on a witness list and hes not been deposed this is an outrageous suggestion tame your indignation judge davidson said to tony as if he were speaking to an unruly child and why is he asking to be put on the stand he claims he can offer exculpatory testimony that proves dr bowman did not commit medical malpractice he further claims he has corroboration in the form of affidavits by a massachusetts medical examiner and a massachusetts toxicologist this is insane tony sputtered the defense cannot bring in a lastminute surprise witness it violates every rule in the book since the signing of the magna carta stop your moaning and groaning counselor judge davidson barked tony controlled himself with effort but his suppressed ire and frustration were clearly evident when his heavylipped mouth formed an inverted u do you have any idea of how he has come across the information hes willing to testify to he mentioned that he autopsied patience stanhope if this autopsy is potentially exculpatory why wasnt it done sooner so that it could have been a subject of proper discovery there was no reason to suspect that an autopsy would have any probative value im certain mr fasano would agree the clinical facts in this case have never been in dispute mr fasano did you know about this autopsy only to the extent it was being considered damn judge davidson intoned this puts me between a rock and a hard place your honor tony said unable to keep still if hes allowed to testify i will i dont want to hear your threats counselor im perfectly aware dr stapleton cannot waltz in here and take the stand thats not on the table i suppose i could order a continuance and dr stapleton and his findings could be subjected to normal discovery but the trouble with that is that it shoots my calendar to hell i hate to do that but i also hate to have my cases reversed on appeal and if this testimony is as dramatic as dr stapleton seems to feel it makes such a reversal a real possibility what about you hearing the evidence dr stapleton has randolph suggested that would make your decisionmaking considerably easier judge davidson nodded as he contemplated the idea to save time you could do it in your chambers randolph said taking a witness into my chambers is in itself irregular but not unheard of randolph offered but the witness could go to the papers and claim whatever i dont like that idea take in the court reporter randolph said let it be part of the record the point is that the jury will not hear it if you decide its not relevant and material i can just restart my summation if you decide it is relevant and material youll have more information to help you make a decision about how to proceed judge davidson mulled over the idea he nodded his head i like it ill call a short recess but ill keep the jury where they are well make this fast are you all right with this plan mr fasano i think it sucks tony growled do you have an alternative suggestion judge davidson asked tony shook his head he was furious he was counting on winning his first malpractice case and now within hours of the goal a major screwup was brewing despite everything hed done he walked back to the plaintiffs table and poured himself a glass of water his mouth was dry and his throat was parched randolph went back to jack and opened the gate for him to step into the bar area you cant take the stand randolph whispered but it is arranged for you essentially to testify for the judge which will determine if you get to testify in front of the jury at a later date it will take place in the judges chambers hes willing to give you only a few minutes so youd best be concise and to the point understood jack nodded he was tempted to tell randolph he had only a few minutes to offer but he refrained he looked at jordan who was nervously trying to get tony to explain what was happening since the judge had announced there was to be a short recess although he wanted the jury to stay put among the spectators there was a general buzz as people tried to figure out what was happening and who jack was jack looked over at craig and craig smiled jack nodded in return all rise the court officer called out as the judge got to his feet and swiftly descended from the bench in a blink of the eye he was through the paneled door and out of sight although he left the door invitingly ajar behind him the court reporter followed a few steps behind are you ready randolph asked jack jack nodded again and as he did so he happened to lock eyes with tony if looks could kill id be dead jack thought the man was plainly incensed jack followed randolph and tony joined them as they walked past the empty witness stand and the clerks desk jack inwardly smiled as he wondered what tonys reaction would be if jack inquired about francos wellbeing since franco was nowhere to be seen jack was disappointed in the judges chambers hed conjured up an image of highly polished dark wood leather furniture and the aroma of expensive cigars like an exclusive mens club instead it was decidedly seedy with walls in need of paint and governmentissue furniture over all hung a miasma of cigarette smoke the only high point was a massive victorianstyle desk behind which judge davidson sat in a highbacked chair he was leaning back with his hands clasped behind his head in relative repose jack randolph and tony sat in lowslung vinylcovered chairs such that their line of sight was well below that of judge davidson jack assumed it was a deliberate ploy on the part of the judge who liked to keep himself on a higher plane the court reporter sat at a small table off to the side dr stapleton judge davidson began after a brief introduction mr bingham tells me you have in this eleventh hour exculpatory evidence in the defendants favor that is not entirely true jack said my words were that i can provide corroborated evidence that proves dr bowman did not commit medical malpractice as defined by statute there was no negligence is that not exculpatory are we playing some sort of word game here hardly a game jack said in this circumstance it is exculpatory on one hand and incriminating on the other i think youd better explain judge davidson said he brought his hands down onto his desktop and leaned forward jack had captured his full attention getting his finger under the flap of his envelope jack opened it and extracted three documents he leaned forward and slid the top one across the desk to the judge this first affidavit is signed by a licensed massachusetts undertaker and it affirms that the body autopsied was indeed the late patience stanhope jack slid the second paper across this affidavit confirms that dr latasha wylie a licensed massachusetts medical examiner participated in the autopsy aided in obtaining all specimens and transported the specimens to the university toxicology laboratory where she duly transferred them to dr allan smitham judge davidson had picked up each affidavit and scanned it id say this is a commendable chain of custody he said he looked up and whats the final affidavit this is what dr smitham found jack said are you familiar with fugu poisoning judge davidson treated his guests to a brief wry smile i think you better get to the point son he said patronizingly ive got a jury out there twiddling their thumbs and eager to haul ass its a kind of oftenlethal poisoning people get from eating sushi made from puffer fish understandably it is seen almost exclusively in japan dont tell me you are suggesting patience stanhope died from eating sushi judge davidson said i wish that were the case jack responded the poison involved is called tetrodotoxin and it is an extremely interesting compound it is extraordinarily toxic to give you an idea it is up to one hundred times more lethal than black widow spider venom and ten times more deadly than the venom of the manybanded krait one of the most venomous snakes of southeast asia a microscopic amount taken by mouth will cause rapid death jack leaned forward and slid the final paper toward the judge this last affidavit signed by dr allan smitham explains that tetrodotoxin was found in all of the specimens obtained from patience stanhope that he tested at levels suggesting her initial dose was a hundred times greater than what would have been adequate to kill her judge davidson scanned the document then extended it to randolph you might ask how reliable are the tests for tetrodotoxin jack continued the answer is extremely reliable the chance of a false positive is close to zero especially since dr smitham used two entirely separate methods one was highpressure liquid chromatography followed by mass spectrometry the other was radioimmunoassay using a specific antibody to the tetrodotoxin molecule the results are conclusive and reproducible randolph offered the affidavit to tony who snatched it away irritably he was well aware of its implication so are you saying the deceased did not die of a heart attack judge davidson said she did not die of a heart attack she died of overwhelming tetrodotoxin poisoning since there is no treatment available the time of her arrival at the hospital was entirely immaterial essentially from the moment she swallowed the poison she was doomed a loud knock on the judges door reverberated around the room the judge bellowed for whoever it was to enter the court officer poked his head in and said the jury is requesting a coffee break what should i tell them let them have their coffee break the judge said with a wave of dismissal he drilled jack with his dark gunbarrel eyes so thats the exculpatory part whats the incriminating part jack sat back in his chair this was the part he found the most troubling because of its striking toxicity tetrodotoxin is a highly controlled substance especially in this day and age but the compound has a curious redeeming quality the same molecular mechanism responsible for its toxicity makes it an outstanding tool to study sodium channels in nerve and muscle how does that impact the case at hand dr craig bowmans published and ongoing research concerns the study of sodium channels he uses tetrodotoxin extensively a heavy silence hung over the room as jack and judge davidson stared at one another across the judges desk the other two men looked on for a full minute no one spoke finally the judge cleared his throat and said other than this circumstantial evidence of access to the toxin is there anything else that associates dr bowman with the actual act there is jack said reluctantly the moment tetrodotoxin was determined to be present i returned to the bowman residence where i had been a houseguest i had known there was a small vial of pills dr bowman had given to the deceased the day she died i took the vial back to the toxicology lab dr smitham did a rapid check and the interior of the vial was positive for tetrodotoxin he is doing the full definitive test as we speak okay judge davidson said he rubbed his hands together briskly and looked over at the court reporter hold up on the record until we get back into the courtroom he then sat back causing his aged chair to squeak hed assumed a grim but thoughtful expression i could order a continuance of this trial so all this new information could go through the discovery process but there is not much point this is not civil negligence it is murder ill tell you what im going to do gentlemen im going to declare a mistrial this case needs to be turned over to the district attorney any questions he looked over his audience stopping at tony dont look so glum counselor you can bask in the realization that justice prevails and your client can still sue for wrongful death the trouble is the insurance company will be off the hook tony snorted the judge looked at jack that was an admirable investigation doctor jack merely nodded to acknowledge the compliment but he didnt feel deserving having to report the shocking findings caused him anguish for what it was going to do to alexis and her girls they would now have to suffer through a protracted investigation and a new trial with horrific consequences it was a tragedy for everyone concerned especially craig jack was shocked at the depth of the mans narcissism and apparent lack of conscience yet at the same time he sensed that craig had been victimized by the highly competitive academic medical system that touted altruism and compassion yet rewarded the opposite one never became chief resident by being kind and sympathetic to patients with craigs perennial necessity of gainful employment during the early portion of his medical training he had been denied the normal social interaction that would have blunted such a contradictory message all right gentlemen judge davidson said lets wrap up this fiasco he stood and the others did as well he then skirted around his desk and headed for the door jack followed behind the two lawyers and the court reporter came behind jack ahead within the courtroom jack heard the court officer yell for everyone to rise when jack emerged from the judges chambers the judge was taking his seat on the bench while randolph and tony were approaching their respective tables jack noticed that craig was momentarily not present and jack shuddered to think what the mans reaction was going to be when he learned that his secret had been unraveled jack quietly crossed the well behind him he heard the judge ask the court officer to bring back the jury jack opened the gate he caught alexiss eye she was looking at him with an understandably questioning confused yet hopeful expression jack politely worked his way toward her and took the neighboring seat he squeezed her hand he noticed she had rescued his carryon bag that hed left at the gate before going into the judges chambers mr bingham judge davidson called out i notice the defendant is not presently at the defendants table my assistant mr cavendish tells me he requested to use the mens room randolph said partially rising out of his chair i see judge davidson responded the jury was then led into the courtroom and they filed into the jury box whats going on alexis questioned did you find something criminal i found more than i bargained for jack confessed perhaps someone should let dr bowman know we are back in session judge davidson said it is important for him to witness these proceedings jack gave alexiss hand another squeeze before getting to his feet ill get dr bowman he said as he moved back down the aisle he motioned to randolph s assistant whod gotten up presumably to get craig that he would fetch the defendant jack pushed out through the door to the hall there were the usual clumps of people engaging in hushed conversations sprinkled around the hallway and the elevator lobby jack made a beeline for the mens room he glanced at his watch it was a quarter past ten he yanked open the door and entered a man of asian ancestry was washing his hands at the sink the area around the urinals was empty jack continued to the stalls and bent down at the waist to look under the walls only the last stall was occupied jack walked down to the door and debated whether to wait or call out as late as it was he decided to call out craig jack questioned the toilet flushed and a moment later the locking mechanism of the door clicked the door opened inwardly and a young hispanic man emerged he gave jack a quizzical look before brushing past on his way to the sink surprised at not having had to face craig after building up his courage to do so jack bent over again to make sure all the stalls were empty and they were except for the two men at the sink there was no one else in the bathroom craig was nowhere to be seen intuitively jack knew he was gone boston massachusetts friday june am after returning to the courtroom where craig had failed to reappear jack had taken alexis aside as quickly and humanely as possible he had related everything that had happened since hed spoken with her the night before she had listened with initial disbelief and consternation until she learned the extent of the proof of craigs apparent guilt at that point shed allowed her professional persona take over enabling her to analyze the situation clinically in that frame of mind she not jack had been the one to bring up the time issue and that jack had to make tracks if he hoped to get to the church on time with a promise to call that afternoon jack had grabbed his carryon and dashed for the elevators running headlong jack traversed the courtyard in front of the courthouse and descended the two short flights of steps to the street to his relief the battered accent was where hed left it although a parking ticket was stuck beneath the windshield wiper the first order of business was to get the paper bag containing the gun from the trunk anticipating needing to return the firearm on his way to the airport jack had gotten the directions to police headquarters that morning from latasha the police station was right around the corner from where jack was parked although it required him to do a uturn over a median jack looked in his rearview mirror for pursuing squad cars after pulling off the stunt jack had learned from sore experience that when you missed your turn while driving in boston it was frequently impossible to loop back the stop at the police station was accomplished expeditiously the bag had liam flanagans name on it and the duty officer was willing to accept it with no comment whatsoever glad that chore was out of the way jack ran out to the car which was doubleparked with the engine running the signage to the airport was superior to the signage in the rest of the city and jack soon found himself in a tunnel thankfully the distance from downtown boston to the airport was short and jack got there surprisingly quickly following the signs for the rentacar company he drove onto the hertz lot a few minutes later jack pulled into one of the carreturn lanes there were some instructions of what to do when dropping off a vehicle but jack just ignored them as he ignored the agents who were roaming around assisting customers the last thing jack wanted to do was get into an extended discussion about the damaged vehicle he was confident hed hear from hertz he grabbed his carryon and ran for the bus to the terminal when he boarded the bus he thought it was about to leave but instead it sat there with its motor idling and no driver jack nervously eyed the time it was a little after eleven he knew he had to catch the eleven thirty delta shuttle or all was lost finally the driver appeared he cracked a few jokes as he asked which terminals people wanted jack was happy to learn that delta was the first stop the next aggravation was getting a ticket luckily the shuttle had its own section after that came the security line but even that was not too problematic it was eleven twenty when jack shoved his feet back into his shoes and sprinted down the concourse toward the shuttle gate jack was not the last person on board but it was close the planes door was closed behind the individual whod boarded right after him jack took the first seat available to facilitate deplaning in new york unfortunately it was a middle seat between a scruffy student with an ipod so loud jack could hear every note and a pinstriped businessman with a laptop and a blackberry the businessman treated jack to a disapproving glare when jack indicated he wanted to occupy the middle seat it required the businessman to move his carryon from where hed stowed it and to pick up his jacket and briefcase which hed placed on the seat once seated with his carryon at his feet jack put his head back against the headrest and closed his eyes despite his boneweary exhaustion there was no chance he could fall asleep and not just because of his neighbors ipod he kept replaying the too short and unsatisfactory conversation hed had with alexis and the belated realization that hed not apologized for being the one who had uncovered craigs perfidy not only to the profession but also to his family even the rationalization that alexis and the children might be better off knowing the truth did not make jack feel any better the chances of the family hanging together in the face of what was coming were unfortunately slim and that thought underlined for jack how deceptive appearances could be from the outside the bowmans seemingly had it all professional parents beautiful children and a storybook house yet on the inside there was a kind of cancer undermining it all may i have your attention please a voice cracked over the planes intercom this is the captain speaking weve just been informed from ground control that we have a gate hold situation theres a thunderstorm passing through the new york area we are hoping this will not be long and we will keep you informed shit jack exclaimed to himself he gripped his forehead with his right hand using the balls of his fingers to massage his temples the anxiety and lack of sleep were conspiring to give him a headache as a realist he began to contemplate what would happen if he did not make the wedding laurie had given him more than a hint shed said shed never forgive him and he believed her laurie was frugal with promises and when she made one she kept it knowing that again begged the question in jacks mind whether hed stayed in boston as long as he had more from an unconscious wish to avoid getting married than to solve the patience stanhope mystery jack took a deep breath he didnt believe that was true nor did he want it to be true but he didnt know for sure what he did know was that he wanted to get to the church on time then as if in response to his thoughts the intercom came back to life this is the captain again ground control has reversed themselves we are ready to push back we should have you at the gate in new york on schedule the next thing jack knew was that he was jarred awake by the planes wheels touching down at laguardia airport to his utter surprise he had fallen asleep despite his anxiety and to his embarrassment he had drooled a little he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand scraping against the stubble on his chin in the process with the same hand he felt the rest of his face he was in need of a shave and even worse for a shower but a glance at his watch suggested that neither was possible it was twentyfive after twelve shaking himself like a dog to get his circulation going jack ran his hands through his hair this activity evoked a questioning expression from the businessman who was plainly leaning into the aisle away from jack jack wondered if that was ostensibly additional evidence of his need for a shower although hed donned tyvek protective coveralls jack was aware hed not showered since hed done an autopsy on an eightmonthold corpse jack suddenly realized that hed been tapping his foot at a frenzied frequency even when he put his hand on his knee it was hard to keep his leg still jack could not remember ever being quite so agitated what made it difficult was having to sit still he would have preferred to be out on the tarmac running alongside the plane it seemed to take forever for the plane to taxi to the terminal and then agonizingly slowly ease into the gate when the chime sounded jack was up out of his seat pushing past the businessman who was getting a bag from the overhead bin garnered jack yet another disapproving scowl jack couldnt have cared less excusing himself he managed to worm up to the front of the plane when the door finally opened after what seemed like an interminable wait he was the third one off jack ran up the jetway pushing past the two people whod deplaned before him once in the terminal he ran toward baggage claim and out on to the street which was steaming from a recent downpour by being the first passenger from the boston new york shuttle hed hoped the taxi line would be nonexistent unfortunately that was not the case the washington dc new york shuttle had landed ten minutes earlier and a portion of its passengers were waiting for cabs unabashed at his assertiveness he cut to the front of the line im a medical doctor and im in an emergency jack called out rationalizing that both were true just not related the people in the line wordlessly regarded him with a touch of irritation but no one offered any challenge jack jumped into the first cab the driver was from india or pakistan jack couldnt tell which and was on his cell phone jack barked out his address on th street and the taxi accelerated away from the curb jack checked his watch it was now eighteen minutes before one oclock meaning he had only fortyeight minutes before he was due at the riverside church he sat back and tried vainly to relax but it was impossible to make things worse they hit every traffic light just getting out of the airport jack looked at his watch again it seemed to him unfair that the second hand was sweeping around the dial more quickly than usual it was already a quarter before the hour jack began to question nervously if he should go directly to the church and forgo the pit stop at home the benefit would be hed be on time the disadvantage was that he was dressed a step below casual and needed a shave and a shower when the taxi driver was finally finished with his cell phone call and before he made another jack leaned forward i dont know whether it would make much difference but im in a hurry he said then he added if you would be willing to wait at the address i gave you there would be an extra twentydollar tip ill wait if youd like the driver said agreeably with the typical charming indian subcontinent accent jack sat back and reattached his seat belt it was now ten minutes before one the next bottleneck was the toll on the triborough bridge apparently someone without a fast lane pass was in the fast lane and couldnt back up because of the line of cars behind him after a horrendous cacophony of car horns and shouted expletives the problem was sorted out but not before another five minutes was lost by the time jack reached the island of manhattan it was one oclock the only benefit from jacks mounting anxiety was that it effectively stopped his obsessing about alexis and craig and the disaster that was about to begin a malpractice trial was bad a murder trial was godawful it was going to put the entire family in an unrelenting manyyearlong torment with little possibility of a happy outcome to the drivers credit he managed to get across town rapidly by knowing a relatively quiet street through harlem when he pulled up in front of jacks building it was quarter after one jack had the taxi door open before the vehicle came to a complete stop jack ran up the front steps and dashed through the front door surprising some workmen with the building under total renovation the dust was an unmitigated disaster as jack ran down the hall to the apartment he and laurie were temporarily occupying during the construction billows of it rose from the debrisstrewn floor jack keyed open his apartment door and was about to enter when the construction supervisor caught sight of him from several floors above and yelled that he needed to talk about a plumbing problem jack yelled back that he couldnt at the moment once inside jack tossed his carryon onto the couch and began stripping off his clothes he left a trail of apparel en route to the bathroom first he took a glimpse of himself in the mirror and winced heavy stubble blackened his cheeks and chin like smudges of soot and his eyes were redrimmed and sunken after a quick internal debate of a shave or a shower since he hardly had time for both he decided on the shower leaning into the tub he turned on both faucets fullblast unfortunately only a few drips emerged the plumbing problem was obviously global to the building jack turned off the faucets and after splashing himself liberally with cologne ran out of the bathroom and into the bedroom he pulled on underwear then put on his formal shirt next came the tuxedo pants and jacket he grabbed the studs and cuff links and jammed them into his pants pocket the black pretied bow tie went into the other pocket after jamming his feet into formal shoes his wallet into his back pants pocket and his cell phone into his jacket pocket he ran back out into the hall slowing enough to keep the dust to a minimum he was again spotted by the construction supervisor who again yelled that it was critical for them to talk jack didnt even bother to answer outside the taxi was still waiting jack crossed the street and jumped in riverside church jack yelled do you know what cross street the driver asked looking at jack in the rearview mirror one hundred twentysecond jack clipped he began struggling with his studs dropping one on the seat where it quickly disappeared into a black hole between the seat and the seat back jack tried to get his hand into the crack but couldnt and quickly gave up instead he used the studs he had leaving the lowest buttonhole empty are you getting married the driver asked continuing to glimpse at jack in the mirror i hope so jack said he then turned to the cufflink challenge he tried to recall the last time he had donned a tux as he finished with the first cuff link and began on the second he couldnt remember although it had to have been back in his previous life when he was an ophthalmologist after the cuff links jack bent down and tied his shoes and dusted himself the final job was buttoning the top button of his shirt and hooking the bow tie behind his neck you look fine the driver said with a broad smile ill bet jack said with his usual sarcasm he leaned forward and extracted his wallet looking at the taxi meter he got out enough twenty dollar bills to cover it plus two extra he dumped the money into the front seat through the plexiglas partition as the driver turned onto riverside drive ahead the riverside church s sandcolored belfry came into view it towered over its neighboring structures and stood out with its gothic architecture in front of the church were several black limousines except for the drivers who were out of their vehicles leaning against the sides there were no people jack looked at his watch it was one thirtythree he was three minutes late jack again had the taxi door open before the car was completely stopped he yelled a thankyou to the driver over his shoulder as he leaped out into the street buttoning his jacket he took the churchs front steps two at a time ahead in the open doorway laurie suddenly appeared like a mirage she was gowned magnificently in a white wedding dress from behind her issued forth powerful organ music jack stopped to take in the scene he had to admit she looked more lovely than ever truly radiant the only slight detraction was her hands which were balled into fists and planted defiantly on her hips there was also her father dr montgomery who looked regal but not amused jack laurie intoned in a voice hovering between anger and relief you are late hey jack called back spreading his hands at least im here laurie broke into a smile in spite of herself get yourself into the church she ordered playfully jack climbed the rest of the way up the stairs laurie reached out with her hand and jack took it she then leaned close and looked at him appraisingly with a touch of concern god you look awful you shouldnt flatter me so jack said with feigned bashfulness you havent even shaved there are worse secrets he confessed hoping she couldnt tell hed not showered for more than thirty hours i dont know what im getting myself into laurie said with her smile returning my mothers friends are going to be appalled and indeed they should be laurie smiled wryly at jacks humor you are never going to change i disagree i can tell ive changed i might be a tad late but im glad im here will you marry me lauries smile broadened yes of course thats been my intention for more years than i care to admit i cant tell you how thankful i am that you were willing to wait i suppose you have some elaborate explanation for this anxious downtothewire arrival im looking forward to telling you frankly the denouement in boston has me stunned its a story you are not going to believe im looking forward to hearing it laurie said but now youd better get into the church and up onto that altar your best man warren is fit to be tied fifteen minutes ago he was out here and said he was quote going to whip your ass laurie propelled jack forward into the interior of the church where he was engulfed by the organ music for a moment he hesitated looking down the length of the impressive nave he was overwhelmingly intimidated the right side of the church was packed with hardly a seat available whereas the left was nearly empty although jack saw lou soldano and chet ahead at the altar stood the priest or reverend or pastor or rabbi or imam jack didnt know and didnt care he was not thrilled by organized religion and did not feel one was any better than another next to the clergyman stood warren and even from a distance he looked impressive in his tuxedo jack took a deep breath for fortitude and started forward into a whole new life the rest of the ceremony was a blur for jack he had to be pushed and nudged in this direction or that or whispered to in an attempt to get him to do what was required because of his being in boston hed missed the rehearsal so from his perspective it was all ad lib the part he liked the best was running out of the church because it meant the ordeal was over once in the car he had a rest but it was much too short the drive from the church to tavern on the green and the reception was only a quarter of an hour the reception was less intimidating than the wedding and in different circumstances of being less exhausted he almost would have found it enjoyable particularly after a heavy meal including wine and some obligatory dancing jack was beginning to fade but before he did so he needed to make a call excusing himself from his table he found a relatively quiet spot at the restaurants entrance he punched in alexiss cell phone number and was pleased when she answered are you married alexis asked as soon as she knew it was jack i am congratulations i think its wonderful and im very happy for you thank you sister jack said i particularly wanted to call to apologize for my role in creating more turmoil in your life you invited me to boston to help craig and thereby help you and i ended up doing the opposite im terribly sorry i feel complicit thank you for apologizing alexis said i surely dont hold you responsible for craigs behavior and for it being exposed i truly believe it would have eventually and to be entirely honest im glad to know it will make my decisionmaking much easier did craig reappear in court no he didnt and i still have no idea where he is there is a warrant for his arrest and the police have already appeared at the house with a search warrant they have confiscated all his papers including his passport so hes not going far wherever he is hes just putting off the inevitable surprisingly enough i feel sorry for him jack said i feel sorry for him as well has he tried to see the children or call no he hasnt although that doesnt surprise me hes never been close to the children i dont think hes ever been close to anyone except maybe you in retrospect i dont think he was even close to me its a tragedy and i personally believe his father shares a portion of the blame please keep me posted jack said were heading out on our honeymoon but ill have my cell phone i did learn something else disturbing this afternoon a week ago craig had refinanced our house taking out several million dollars could he do that without your signature he could back when we bought the house he insisted it be in his name only he gave me some excuse about taxes and insurance but at the time i didnt care did he take it in cash jack questioned no ive been told it was wired to a numbered offshore account if you need cash let me know i have more than ive ever had thanks to not spending even a pittance of my salary for the last decade thank you brother ill keep that in mind well make out fine although i might have to augment my salary with some private practice after a few endearments jack disconnected he did not return to the party immediately instead he thought about the unfairness and capriciousness of life while he was looking forward to a honeymoon with laurie and a promising future alexis and the children were staring at uncertainty and emotional pain it was enough jack thought to make someone an epicurean or very religious one extreme or the other jack stood up he opted for the former and was interested in getting laurie home epilogue havana cuba monday june pm jack had wanted to take laurie to someplace unique and off the beaten path for their honeymoon hed thought of someplace in africa but decided it was too far hed thought of india but that was worse as far as distance was concerned then someone suggested cuba at first jack had dismissed the idea because he thought it couldnt be done but going on the internet he soon learned he was wrong a number of people but not too many were going to cuba either through canada mexico or the bahamas jack had chosen the bahamas the flight from new york to nassau on saturday the day after the wedding had been hohum but the one from nassau to havana on cubana airlines had been livelier and entertaining and had given them an early taste of the cuban mentality jack had arranged for a suite in the hotel nacional de cuba sensing it would have a hint of old cuban charm they hadnt been disappointed it was sited on the malecon in the vedado section of old havana although some of the amenities were dated the original art deco splendor shone through best of all the service was a joy contrary to what jack might have thought the cubans were a happy people thankfully laurie had yet to insist on more sightseeing than relaxing walks through the old central section of havana which had been restored for the most part several of their strolls had taken them beyond the restored area and into sections where the buildings were in a sad state of disrepair yet still with a vague hint of their original grandeur for the most part both jack and laurie had been content to sleep and eat and lie in the sun such a schedule had given jack adequate time to tell laurie the details of what had happened in boston as well as to discuss the situation at length laurie was sympathetic to everyone including jack shed called it an american medical tragedy hed agreed how about we arrange for a tour into the countryside laurie suggested suddenly breaking into jacks rejuvenating mindless repose jack shielded his eyes from the sun and turned to look at his new wife both were reclining poolside on white lounge chairs both were clad in bathing suits and mutually slathered in spf fortyfive sunblock laurie was regarding him with eyebrows raised he could just see them over the top of her sunglasses do you really want to sacrifice this wonderfully indolent life jack questioned if its this hot seaside it will be like an oven in the countryside im not saying we have to do it today or even tomorrow just someday before we leave it would be a shame to come all this way and not get a flavor of the island outside of this touristy area i suppose jack said without a lot of enthusiasm just thinking about the heat of the islands interior made him feel thirsty he sat up im going to get something to drink want me to bring you back something are you going to have one of those mojitos im tempted jack said you really are on vacation laurie said all right if youre game i am too i just might have to nap this afternoon nothing wrong with that jack said he got to his feet and stretched what he really needed to do was rent a bike and go for a serious ride but that thought stayed with him only halfway to the bar lazily he decided hed look into it tomorrow catching the eye of one of the bartenders jack ordered the two drinks it was exceptional for him to drink at all much less in the afternoon but hed been encouraged to try it the day before and hed enjoyed the utterly relaxed feeling the alcohol had given him while he waited jacks eyes wandered around the pool area there were a few women with worldclass figures that encouraged a brief appreciative glance his eyes then wandered out to the broad expanse of the caribbean sea there was a slight silky breeze your drinks sir the bartender said catching jacks attention jack signed the check and picked up his drinks as he started to turn back toward the pool his eyes caught the face of a man across the peninsulashaped bar jack did a double take he leaned forward and unabashedly stared the mans eyes briefly engaged jacks but without recognition and were soon redirected to the handsome latin woman sitting next to him jack watched him laugh with easy grace jack shrugged turned again and started back to his lounge chair but he got only a few steps before he turned again making up his mind to get a closer look jack walked around the bar and approached the man from the rear he advanced until he was directly behind the individual he could hear him speaking it was passable spanish certainly better than jack could muster craig jack said loud enough for the man to hear but the individual did not turn around craig bowman jack said a tad louder still there was no response jack looked down at the two drinks he was holding which were restricting his options after another short debate jack leaned into the bar on the side of the man opposite his companion jack put one of the drinks on the bar and tapped the man on the shoulder the man swung around and met jacks gaze there was no recognition only a question with eyebrows raised and forehead furrowed can i help you the man questioned in english craig jack questioned watching the mans eyes as a former ophthalmologist jack tended to look at peoples eyes the same way they often gave hints of general illness they could give hints of emotion jack saw no change the pupils remained exactly the same size i believe you have me confused with someone else my name is ralph landrum sorry jack said i didnt mean to be a pest no problem ralph said whats your name jack stapleton where are you from boston originally how about yourself new york city jack said are you staying here at the nacional no ralph said ive rented a house just out of town im involved in the cigar business how about yourself im a medical doctor ralph leaned back so jack could see his lady friend this is toya jack shook hands with toya across the front of ralph nice to meet you both jack said after stumbling through a little spanish for toyas benefit he picked up his drink sorry to be intrusive hey no problem ralph said this is cuba people expect you to talk with them with a final nod jack took his leave he skirted the bar and returned to laurie she pushed herself up on one elbow and took one of the drinks it took you long enough she said jokingly jack sat down on his lounge chair and shook his head have you ever run across someone and you are sure they are someone you know a few times laurie said taking a sip of her drink why do you ask because it just happened to me jack said can you see that man talking with that buxom woman in red on the other side of the bar jack pointed toward the couple laurie pulled her feet around sat up and looked yeah i can see them i was sure that was craig bowman jack said with a short laugh he looks enough like him to be his twin i thought you said craig bowman had sandycolored hair similar to yours that fellow has dark hair well except for the hair jack said its incredible it makes me question my impressions laurie turned back to jack why is it so incredible cuba would be a good place for someone like craig to go there is certainly no extradition treaty with the united states maybe it is craig bowman no its not jack said i had the nerve to ask him and watch his response well dont let it worry you laurie said she regained her reclining position drink in hand its not going to worry me jack said he too lay back on his chair but he couldnt get the coincidence out of his mind all at once he had an idea sitting up he fumbled in the pocket of his robe and pulled out his cell phone laurie had sensed his sudden motion and opened one eye who are you calling alexis jack said she answered but told jack she couldnt talk and that she was between sessions i just have a quick question jack said do you by any chance know a ralph landrum from boston i did alexis said listen jack i really have to go ill call you in a couple of hours why did you put it in the past tense jack asked because he died alexis said he was one of craigs patients who died of a lymphoma about a year ago authors note concierge medicine also known as retainer medicine or boutique medicine or luxury primary care is a relatively new phenomenon that first appeared in seattle as described in crisis it is a style of primarycare medical practice that requires an annual membership fee that varies from hundreds to many thousands of dollars per person the median being about and the maximum about in order for this fee not to be construed as a healthinsurance premium which would be against regulations the patient is offered a laundry list of specified medical attention or services not covered by health insurance for example elaborate yearly physicals preventive care nutrition counseling and individually tailored wellness programs to name a few but the real perk stems from the physicians guarantee to limit enrollment in the practice to a number far less than usual making possible special amenities and special access to standard medical services but not payment which remains the responsibility of the patient either through health insurance or out of pocket the amenities might include a very personal doctorpatient relationship unhurried appointments that are as long as needed nicer and uncrowded reception areas not called waiting rooms since as an amenity waiting is to be avoided house calls or patient office visits if appropriate and desirable facilitation of appointments to needed specialists and immediate consultation and even possible travel by the doctor to distant locales if the patient becomes ill or injured on a trip special access includes sameday appointments if needed or certainly within just a day or so and twentyfourhour doctor accessibility with the doctors cell phone home phone and email address there have been a few articles about concierge medicine in professional journals as well as in the new york times and other mass media publications but for the most part the slowly burgeoning practice style has gone unnoticed by the vast majority of the public i believe this will and should change because concierge medicine is yet another subtle but significant symptom of a healthcare system that is out of whack since good patientoriented medicine used to be available and should be available without a considerable upfront fee more important it is common knowledge there are already significant inequities involving healthcare access worldwide and one doesnt have to be the proverbial rocket scientist to understand that concierge medicine will make a bad situation only that much worse those doctors practicing in this style will by definition see far fewer patients and all those patients who do not come up with the retainer fee for whatever reason will face less choice in a further constrained system indeed a handful of us senators officially complained to the department of health and human services about the phenomenons potential impact on limiting the ability of medicare recipients to find a primarycare physician in response the government accountability office issued a report in august of suggesting that concierge medicine was not yet a problem but that the trend would be monitored the implication was that there will be a problem as the practice style mushrooms unfortunately i can personally attest that it has already reached this situation in naples florida where concierge medicine has taken root currently in naples it is difficult for a new medicare patient to find a physician without anteing up the requisite concierge retainer or paying an exorbitant outofpocket yearly physical fee or opting out of medicare altogether although naples is admittedly a unique community economically i believe it is a harbinger of what is to come in other communities both in the us and internationally as well although there have been articles about concierge medicine none that i have read have truly addressed the question of why this phenomenon has emerged at this particular time what is usually offered are economic explanations revolving around the idea that concierge medicine makes sense from a marketing perspective after all provided he or she can afford it who wouldnt want the promised amenities considering what the experience of going to the doctor is like all too often in todays world and what physician wouldnt prefer to have financial security right out of the starting gate and to be able to practice the unhurried medicine they learned in medical school unfortunately this superficial answer doesnt explain why the phenomenon makes sense now and didnt say twenty years ago it is my belief that the real answer is that concierge medicine is a direct result of the dire unprecedented state of disarray in current healthcare on a worldwide basis in fact there are those who evoke the metaphor of the perfect storm to describe the current situation particularly in the united states there have been a number of problems plaguing medical practice over the last quartercentury or so but never have there been so many all converging at the same time concurrently we are seeing aggressive medical cost containment personnel and equipment shortages expanding technology strenuous and appropriate efforts at medical error reduction soaring litigiousness and settlement awards rising ancillary costs a bewildering multiplication of healthinsurance products including managed care with its associated intrusion into medical decisionmaking and even the changing role of hospitals all of these forces have contributed to making the bedrock of medicine the practice of primary care a nightmare if not impossible for a primarycare physician to stay in business meaning earning enough to keep the doors open and the lights on or staying employed in a managedcare environment he or she must see patients at an extraordinary rate with an entirely predictable result dissatisfaction on the part of both the doctor and the patient and ironically enough increased utilization and cost and rising litigation consider the following example a patient with some mild ongoing medical conditions for example high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol visits his primarycare physician with new complaints of shoulder pain and abdominal discomfort in the current practice environment the doctor has a mere fifteen minutes to deal with everything including basic social civilities understandably the conditions the doctor had previously taken responsibility for would take precedence the high blood pressure and cholesterol level only then would the new symptoms be addressed with the clock ticking and a waiting room full of disgruntled patients because the schedule was thrown off by an earlier minor emergency an almost daily occurrence the doctor resorts to the most expeditious approach for example ordering an mri or a cat scan for the shoulder and referring the patient to a gastroenterologist for the abdominal discomfort with the pressure to meet the practice overhead there is no time for the doctor to investigate each complaint properly with a careful history and examination the result is a tendency for overutilization and inconvenience for the patient much higher cost and less than satisfaction for both the patient and the doctor the doctor is forced by circumstance to function more like a triage assistant than a fully trained physician this is especially true if the doctor is a boardcertified internist many of whom practice primary care getting back to the question of why concierge medicine has evolved now and not in the past it is my belief that it is a direct result of the perfect storm in healthcare and the resultant physician disillusionment and dissatisfaction with medical practice which is reaching epidemic proportions as indicated by numerous polls doctors are unhappy particularly primarycare doctors in this light concierge medicine is a reactionary movement rather than a mere marketing stratagem it is an attempt to rectify the disconnects physicians have come to face between the medicine they learned in the academic setting and had hoped to practice and the medicine they are forced to practice whether constrained by bureaucracy government or managed care or poverty no equipment or facilities and between the expectations of patients and the reality of what the physicians are actually providing ftnref zuger a dissatisfaction with medical practice nejm concierge medicine has started in the united states but because current physician disillusionment and dissatisfaction is a worldwide phenomenon it will spread if it hasnt already to other countries intellectually i have trouble with the concept of concierge medicine for the same reasons dr herman brown offers during his testimony for the plaintiff in crisis in short concierge medicine flies in the face of traditional concepts of altruistic medicine indeed it is a direct violation of the principle of social justice which is one of the three underpinnings of the newly defined medical professionalism requiring physicians to work to eliminate discrimination in healthcare whether based on race gender socioeconomic status italics mine ethnicity religion or any other social category ftnref a physician charter american board of internal medicine foundation american college of physicians foundation european federation of internal medicine but there is a problem at the same time that i am philosophically against concierge medicine i am also for it which makes me feel decidedly hypocritical i fully admit that if i were a practicing primarycare physician in todays world i would certainly want to have a concierge practice rather than a standard practice my excuse would be that i would prefer to take care of one person well rather than ten people poorly unfortunately it would be a rationalization and a rather poor one instead perhaps id say i have a right to practice medicine the way i want to practice medicine unfortunately that would be denying the fact that a lot of public money is spent training all doctors including me which comes with an obligation to take care of all comers not just those capable of upfront fees maybe then id say that concierge medicine is akin to private school and that patients with means have the right to pay for more service unfortunately that misses the point that those people who send their kids to private school also have to pay for public school through their taxes it also misses the point that medical service even basic medical service is inequitably distributed and id be adding to that inequality ultimately id have to admit to myself that the reason i wanted to practice concierge medicine was probably more because it provided me with daytoday professional satisfaction even though deep down id lament that id become a doctor different from the one i had started out to be such an admission means that i dont fault mds practicing concierge medicine but rather the system that has forced them to do so it is always easier to be a critic than a problem solver yet in regard to concierge medicine i do think there is a solution to limit its growth and its a rather simple one it involves merely changing the mechanism of reimbursement for primary care which today is based on a simple flat rate of slightly more than fifty dollars per visit as determined by medicare medicare serves as the de facto trendsetter for health policy primary care is as i have mentioned the bedrock of healthcare and accordingly this low flatrate reimbursement is counterintuitive as evidenced by the example i gave patients and illnesses vary considerably and if the patient needs fifteen minutes thirty minutes forty minutes or even an hour the physician should be paid accordingly in other words the reimbursement for primary care should be predicated on time and should include phone and email time it should also be on a sliding scale depending on the level of training of the physician it is only reasonable if primary care was reimbursed in such a rational fashion quality care would be encouraged significant autonomy would be appropriately returned to the primarycare physician and satisfaction of both the physician and patient would go up as a corollary the impetus toward concierge medicine would go down i also believe such a reimbursement scheme would have the paradoxical effect of lowering overall healthcare costs by lowering utilization of subspecialty services to help in this regard reimbursement should be tipped away from procedurebased specialty care which is the case today and toward primary care some people might worry that basing reimbursement on time would throw open the door to the kind of abuse that is seen in those professions where charges are based on time but i disagree i think abuse would be the exception rather than the rule especially with the strong movement afoot to reassert medical professionalism with the newly promulgated physician charter on a final note i want to say something about medical malpractice when i finished my long medical training in the s and opened a small private practice i was welcomed into the throes of the first medical malpractice crisis which had been provoked by a surge in litigation and plaintiff victories what i experienced like many other physicians was a difficulty in obtaining coverage since a number of the major malpractice insurers suddenly abandoned the market luckily things settled down with the creation of alternative methods for physicians to find malpractice insurance and everything was fine until the s when a second medical malpractice crisis loomed again there was a sudden upswing in malpractice suits as well as a marked increase in the size of awards resulting in a sharp and unsettling increase in insurance premiums during these two crises the healthcare system was resilient enough to absorb the increased costs mainly by ultimately passing them on to patients and the government through medicare as a result the system didnt suffer any huge disruption other than a marked hardening of the medical professions dislike for the legal profession particularly what they considered the greedy malpractice plaintiff attorneys i can remember the time well and i shared the feelings with my close association with academic medicine it seemed to me that only the good doctors who were willing to take on the difficult cases got sued consequently i was fervently behind what most doctors thought was the solution namely tort reform such as capping noneconomic rewards capping attorneys fees adjusting certain statutes of limitations and eliminating joint and several liability unfortunately there is now a new malpractice crisis and although its origins are similar namely another significant bump in litigation with even higher awards it is different from the two previous crises and far worse the new crisis involves both problems of coverage and soaring premiums but more important it is occurring during the perfect storm that is wracking the healthcare system indeed it is one of its causes secondary to a number of factors some of which i have mentioned the increased costs the crisis is engendering cannot be passed on beleaguered physicians are weathering the full force of the gale adding immeasurably to their dissatisfaction and disillusionment consequently it is affecting access to healthcare in certain areas with doctors moving or leaving practice and various highrisk services being curtailed beyond the economic woes being sued is a terrible experience for a doctor as crisis clearly illustrates even if the doctor is ultimately vindicated which most are since this new medical malpractice crisis is occurring despite a number of states having passed elements of tort reform and because new information about the extent of iatrogenic injury has surfaced i have changed my position i no longer see tort reform as the solution also i no longer myopically see the problem as a confrontation between the good guys and the bad guys with altruistic doctors pitted against greedy lawyers as the storyline of crisis suggests im now convinced theres blame on both sides of the equation with good and bad in both camps such that i am embarrassed about my original naive assessment global issues of patient safety and appropriate compensation for all patients who suffer adverse outcomes are more important than assigning blame and more important than providing windfall settlements in a kind of lawsuit lottery for a few patients there are better ways of dealing with the problem and the public should demand it over the objections of the current shareholders organized medicine and the personalinjury malpractice trial bar the fact is that the tort approach to medical malpractice is not working studies have shown that in the current system the vast majority of claims are not meritorious the vast majority of cases that are meritorious are not filed and payments are often made with little evidence of substandard care such an outcome is hardly a commendable record in short the present method of dealing with malpractice is failing in its supposed dual goals of compensating patients with adverse outcomes and providing effective deterrence to medical negligence on the positive side there is plenty of money available for a better stratagem with malpractice premiums doctors and hospitals are forced to pay currently very little of this money ends up in the hands of patients and those who do get some all too frequently dont get it until far down the road after a bitter struggle we need a system that takes the money and gives it to injured patients without delay while at the same time openly investigates the reason for the injury to ensure that it doesnt happen to the next patient there have been many suggestions for such a system ranging from a kind of nofault insurance to something akin to workers compensation to methods of
