jo clayton shadowplay chapter fun and games in a transit mall shadith shadow to her friends ignored a determined holoa singing its jingee in her ear flashing its busy images in her face and glanced at the stretch of plate glass that fronted the shop the loa was trying to entice her into hes still there the canted glass reflected the heavy dark figure of the transit guard leaning on a fauxstone wall half hidden by the leaves of the young willow growing from the squat ceramic tub beside him flickering in and out of the electric blues acid greens and hot pinks of the wandering holoas that drifted like feathers along the walkways and fell in slow spirals down the vast cavern of the atrium their pitches silent confined to color glyph and image until proximity to a warm body triggered their tunes and jingees and whispered enticements in and out bare and veiled the guard was there always there every time he looks at me his eyes leave prints like dirty hands inchling stinkard if i smashed you slug the air would turn so foul wed all die of it leave me alone leave me alone leave me alone angry and upset she eeled through a pack of bigeyed froskans playing etherial patticake with a loa singing the praises of a sensaroo for nocturnals ducked under the lower elbows of a pair of threemeter bawangs stilling along ignoring with angular dignity noise and color adhesive loas and intrusive shoppers picked her way through a family swarm of arachnoid menaviddans dressed mainly in stiff black hair and multiple loops of the shimmering translucent monofilament they were famous for edged by a clove matriarch with her gaggle of sycophantic attendants and stopped in the middle of a crowd of nayids kakerans and assorted though less spectacular bipeds belonging to the cousin races gathered about a troupe of xhenagoa acrobats moving to the beat of tenor drums and flutes and the pulsing color flows of a szimszim mixmaster wheeling about and about slowly shifting jugglers contorting their bodies through impossible curves to pass from hand to foot to hand to head in all possible combinations small glass bowls filled with water and brightcolored fish for a moment she felt secure surrounded by so many beings veiled from sight by layer on layer of glimmering loan then his breath was in her hair his hands were brushing over her body pushing between her legs queasy with loathing she slid away from him and hurried on gods its going to take sandblasting to make me feel clean if he touches me again ill vomit on him what a mess how do i get myself out of this trap the mall was closed off from the rest of the transfer station access to it tightly controlled one way in one way out shed already tried to leave but he was leaning against one of the twisted pillars framing the gate thumbs hooked over his weapon belt the three fingers and a stub on his left hand tapping on the ugly black rod of the popper he didnt say anything he didnt need to this was a place of flux and strangers where travelers without local connections or powerful guarantors had no rights no recourse against transity authority actions shed passed through here a dozen times at leastnot in this body no she was a pattern in a node of the rmoahl diadem then looking out through aleytys eyes as the hunter went undisturbed about her business no one in his right mind would fool with hunters incbut she was on her own now as long as aleytys was insplitting back to wolff she might as well be dead for all the help shed be no way to reach her anyway she forgot me the minute she dropped me here pregnant and playing the happy homebody she wont be noticing anything until she starts getting bored if shed just stayed a while she smiled at the image of aleytys at her most imperious raising hell all over the station then shook her head ahlahlah if i have to yell for help to take care of a shitbag like that im feeble and futile and deserve what i get shed have to stand on her own feet no options even swardheld was out of touch he was on his way back to tairanna visions of rosepearls dancing in his head be a year before he returned with cargo and a load of tall tales him and his crazy crew besides even if she tried she couldnt get a message out the guard wasnt about to let her near a skipcom box if she made a fuss or fought him hed pop her full of comealong and that would be that shes seen itoh yessitting in aleytys head shed seen it once twice a dozen times a small flurry starts and is erased before its more than a flutter in the corner of an eye what id be oh gods thats what i would be a flutter in the corner of a cousins eye she glanced back at him yes he could do her any time but he seemed to be enjoying himself too much to end the chase before he had to rot and ruin name me species dumbiensis boneheadis hes licking me like i was a lollypop connoisseur of terror hunh none of the travelers around her would move a finger claw tentacle whatever to help her not even the spotchallix up for a days browsing in the duty free shops it was their place but not their responsibility why should they care the guards wouldnt attack or harass them they walked about cocooned in spotchala lawwhich didnt apply to outsiders on the ground it would no doubt be different people take a certain pride in the civility of their worlds but up here no such assumption existed this was not home and there was no need for pride in anything but the glittering surface and travelers knew better than to interfere in spotchala affairs they were here for a few hours they had their own vulnerabilities with rare exceptions kind supported kind and let the rest of the zoo take care of itself she glared at a tetrad of inoffensive jajes whisper whisper whispering in the shadows metsoftcoal eyes filled with startled reproach and turned away shamed and annoyed all right all right its not their fault its me little red ryderhood all alone babymeat sar she was a slender coltish girl a kaffolay sprite with hair like an explosion of browngold watchsprings a sixteener body that looked fourteen or younger an unarmed young girl her knives her stunner her other weapons sealed in her luggage by the customs agent she watched the guard grin and flip a finger at another of his kind lounging against a beerhall facade i thought so hes done this a lot they know whats going on if i went to one of those pimping bastards and complained hed probably hold me down for him then take his turn at me she shivered with rage stupid stupid stupid she felt the transit guard coming up behind her again gritted her teeth and went into a boutique whose holoa has been whispering at her for the past several minutes a delicate little pticapteeri in postfertile plumage came rushing forward with musical twitters and a flutter of pale blue crestfeathers she stopped in front of shadith black eyes bright with practiced pleasure singing a lovely soaring interrogatory let me see something for the evening shadith said after a moments thought something simple but ele gant she presented her credit bracelet let the pteroid inspect it fluting her pleasure at the request or the credit balance or both the pticapteeri led her to a viewing booth shadith sat in polyresponsive pulochair leg bent ankle on her knee fingers on a sensor pad as a holo of her body turned and strutted in one garment after another she thought fleetingly about asking the pteroid for help to hide her to get her out of here but she didnt bother trying it she knew better shed be turned from the shop before she got three words out ejected by droid bouncers the guard was outside the shop waiting he knew all that his gloat oozed over her much more of his slobber gets on me and sandblasting wont do it dont let pride make you stupid shadow maybe i can handle him maybe i cant if he does me i want to make it cost i want him dead and i want him to know its coming she called up the service menu smiled grimly as she saw the option the loa had murmured in her ear any garment purchased here could be delivered anywhere in the known universe the purchaser specified if she was willing to pay the price delivery by register circuit drone security guaranteed itd take two months to reach wolff but itd sures hell get there the guard couldnt stop the drone or interfere with it even the head hoofta of the guard service couldnt touch a drone or its contents youre one smart little bint shadow old girl yeaaah she scowled at the holo the image was turning to show the back of a narrow gown a green and gold sheath of botareel spider silk ill take this she said box it and send it by register circuit drone to wolff for aleytys of wolff hunter no other designation required i wish to enclose a card with a handwritten personal message her image bowed a tentacle of the station kephalos spoke to her through its mouth understood a drone is available and has been placed at your service despina do you wish a stylus provided with the card i have mine it is permitted provide a sample of the ink shadith groped in her shoulderbag found her stylus and scribbled a line across the test sheet extruded from the slot above the panel acceptable the stylus is permitted time limit for thirty spotchala zurst the drone will be held available for one hour standard ten minutes will be sufficient how much half zurst confirm the option cost to wolff two thousand zurst confirm the option dispatch the drone the moment the card is received i will also require a fax tiket with details of the transaction printed out it will be provided time starts now shadith leaned forward plucked the card from its slot laid it on the tray the pulochair extruded for her convenience she chewed on her lip as she thought over what she wanted to say then she took up the stylus and wrote using her birthlangue she was the last weaver of shayalin and shed died the first time over twenty thousand years ago aleytys could read shallana weave so could harskari and swardheld but no one else particularly not the station kephalos which had to be recording what she wrote she laid out her problem described the guard finished if i dont message you from university within a few days after this reaches you lee it means im either dead or in deep shit come along and raise all kinds of hell in my memory dear friend make this slime sorry he was born she slid the card back in its slot pressed her credit bracelet to the stripper and tore off the fax tiket that arrived half a tick later she looked at it smiled if you get your hands on me ill shove this in your face read it and know youre a dead man walking she slid the tiket into her shoulderbag and left the booth almost dancing in a triumph that drained from her when she stepped through the portal and saw him standing in her way buy ya drink bait he reached for her she shied away from him stumbled into the entourage of the clovel matriarch shed seen on a lower level swearing at her stupidity angry and afraid she went scurrying off with the guards laughter and the screeches of the matriarch ringing in her ears moving as fast as she could without actually running she went up and up until she reached the highest level and there was nowhere left to go there was a salt taste on her tongueshed bitten her lip hard enough to draw blood acid in her throat and knots in her belly and her head wasnt working futile and feeble come on shadow get it together decorticate the bastard eviscerate him ahlahlah grand words why dont you stop spinning words and do something not a good idea to go straight at him he had reach on her muscle enough to overwhelm her speed the body she had now was strong for its size quick and sure shed trained it to fight and was satisfied with the results but there was no way she could face him without some sort of edge she looked over her shoulder he was just standing there watching her a sudden attack might do it get him set up take him in a rush and flip him over the rail then run for the gate some hope and if i had my stunner even more futile i cant fight the whole damn guard force she pulled her hand nervously across her mouth that was the real trouble it wasnt just him it was the rest of the guard force the usagainstthem bonding of the guards shed seen it in their faces as she passed them sometimes mixed with distaste sometimes with pleasure mostly with indifference she was the outsider the stranger the predestined victim he could play with her then clean up after himself by tossing what was left of her down the nearest garbage chute and they wouldnt do anything but if she beat the odds and it was him went down the chute theyd forget indifference and come for her a table with a semiblanked privacy shield drifted past her following dozens of others that floated like dandelion fluff in wide slow spirals down and around the immense atrium in and out of the shimmering holoas down and down and down until they came to rest for a few minutes in the park below shed seen them but hadnt really noticed them until now like the loas they were so much a part of the background they were invisible with a pot of tea and a pile of lacy honeywafers the privacy shield tucked tight about her and tension dropping away for a while she rode her table away from the platform and the guard who stood lounging against the aeriestaurants facewall grinning as if he got pleasure from her temporary success in evading him it was temporary she knew but she was going to enjoy it while she had it she sipped at the tea and watched the mall flow past ive got to take him somewhere out of sight where the guards arent around to notice what happens to him hope the kephalos wont be watching or the censors wont lock on the scene before im out of here she twisted her mouth into a humorless smile some chance well shadow its the only chance might as well grab it she rubbed her thumb along her belt there was one weapon even the customs scanner hadnt spotted a garrotte menaviddan monfilament let her get that around his neck and her knee in his back and it wouldnt matter how strong he was shed slice his head off thats no good unless i can get behind him without him spotting me wont be easy hes creepy but i doubt hes a fool some kind of distraction what a flicker of gray caught her eye a large rat darted across a stretch of pale sand along a stream cutting through the park below her a housekeeping bot no larger than her hand speared the rat scooped up the body and vanished under the trees she laughed and slapped her hand on the table sheep muttonhead lardbrain distraction nothing ive got me an army she leaned back and sipped at the tea her bones felt like they were melting with the relief that swept through her she had no more doubts this place was old old old ten centuries at least there had to be more vermin in the walls than people on the walkways my army she caroled my armys going to get you creep as the table swung through the last curl of its downspiral she extended her mindride talent and began teasing together rats and hunting spiders poisontailed kapaweys scavenger ddabs with teeth capable of reducing bone to paste and whatever else she found roaming that section of the innerways when the table settled onto the grass beside the crescent of sand she took off before the guard had a chance to push away from the tree he was leaning against she dashed across the park and plunged into the office sector beyond a place where privacy would be easy to find the offices were apt to be snoop shielded and what business went on there was done by appointment with clerk bots left to hold house between visits she slowed and moved at an easy lope down brightlylit pastel corridors past offices and agencies and factory outlets ignoring the stares of the two or three traders she came on she could hear the clickclack of the guards bootheels behind her he wasnt hurrying but she could feel his growing triumph he was preparing himself for the end of the chase at intervals along the corridors she passed rectangles set in the walls hatches meant to let station engineers into the repairwayswhere her army was now she pulled that army with her as she ran thinking of the moment when the furry horde would pour from a hatch onto him rats biting spiders spitting their digestive sprays kapaweys plunging their poison tails into him ddabs gnawing at him and so on it was an ugly image and she smiled with pleasure at it all she needed now was a dark and quiet place with a hatch nearby she turned a corner found herself in the middle of a kidnapping chapter from one frying pan into another frying pan before she had time to react one of the kidnappers had an arm wrapped around her and a slicer against her temple move and youre dead he whispered his breath was hot on her ear she was pressed hard against him he wasnt much taller or wider than she was but she kept thinking of steel traps and sword blades and other hard and lethal things lethal yeh he wanted to kill her so badly she could smell it like body odor she went stone still in the ensuing silence the sound of the guards bootheels was shockingly loud he was strolling along a few turns back not hurrying but hed be here in a couple of breaths she could feel her captor tensing please she whispered hes no friend of mine get me away from him another of the kidnappers was hunched over the lock on an office mot he straightened and stepped back as the door slid open the two blacksacked captives were shoved inside the three men controlling them close on their heels the man holding shadith pushed her away from him so she could walk but kept a punishing grip on her arm she went into the office with him beside her the locksmith followed them in pulled the door shut unhurried calm as a rock he walked to the desk tilted up the sensor pad and tapped on the snooplock he folded his arms frowned at her you know who that is he had a round unmemorable face no it was a flesh mask they all wore flesh masks good ones it took the harsh toplight in the office to show her what they were this shift had knocked her offbalance but she wasnt as frightened as she had been these were professionals not about to start slaughtering indiscriminatelyor raping gods be blessedeven that psycho with the deathgrip on her arm her head was getting addled trying to keep hold of her vermin army iwas hard to talk or think so she let them go running off if she needed them she could always round up another horde transit guard she said when the grip on her arm tightened yet more she added hastily hes a veal hound with the hots forme i was trying to get away from him tension made her voice husky the bossman lifted his hand muted by the thickness of the wall she heard the guard moving past the office his footsteps quicker he hurried on down the hall she shivered sweat crawled down her neck itd be a good idea to set that lock again hell be back to try these doors once hes sure he lost me and in a rancid mood you better believe why do you warn us because he makes my skin crawl she licked her lips id rather your lot than him he nodded she could feel he was pleased with her a dusty creaky sort of pleasure it locks automatically he said sit down on the desk here child lute let go of her arm please he waited until she was settled then went on we will stay here until that beast is finished with his explorations would he dare use the guard scanner to satisfy his lusts is the authority here so corrupt they allow the gratuitous seduction of children corrupt gratuitous seduction pedantic prissy kidnapper shadith bit her lip winced as her teeth hit the cut that guards been harrying me back and forth across the mall for the past hour under the noses of the other guards they knew what was going on and didnt give a shit his eyes went blank at the word the crazy streak in him popped out like a distended vein but he didnt say anything uhoh keep it clean shadow even if it werent so she went on im sure i could think up a dozen good reasons to scan the station for someone you could too sir couldnt you i see lute move the screen there get ready to open the wall but do not do it yet we will wait until the beast leaves the area before we cut through child sit where you are and answer questions when you are asked and keep quiet otherwise i would rather not feed you comealong and put you with them he indicated the silent slumped captives with a quick gesture of a hand like a collection of sticks be calm we will do you no harm we do not sully innocence after that astonishing speech he crossed to the bright orange chairs arranged in a rigid row along the wall sat with his hands resting on his meager thighs his tarcolored eyes shining dully as he contemplated his captives then turned to shadith what is your name child shadith sir and your family where are they shadith looked down at her hands they were trembling she pressed them together all dead i see your homeworld a place called ibex out back of beyond you wont have heard of it she rubbed thumb against thumb nervously amused by the prevarication in a way it was the truth ibex was where she acquired this body he accepted the answer without comment where are you going university sir why to learn more about music ancient songs and antique instruments bossman went very still then he smiled at his second my luck he said reverently lute lifted the slicer as if he raised a glass to toast the lady oh yes sir what a coup the singer landing in your lap shadith swallowed stroked her throat the room suddenly stank of craziness lute was riding a wave of something high as the hips on a bawang her mindride fluttered with the fervor of his belief in his leaders luck bossizan clicked his tongue annoyed at losing her attention he spoke sharply what ship when does it leave her fmgers jerked she dropped her hand one of the ji freighters paepyol hayyun ji they told me the shuttle starts loading sixteen fortyfive the guard out there how did you catch his eye i didnt do anything i didnt even look at him if i could get at you bastard id rearrange your organs how dare you imply it was my fault that slime went after me cool it shadow you dont know whats going on here he keeps calling you child be one it couldnt hurt he kept coming up behind me she said letting the words rush out as if she werent taking time to think what she was saying and and touching me yukh it was horrible i thought if i could just keep away from him until the shuttle was ready everything would be all right but he wouldnt leave me alone he kept pushing me until he chased me down here i see you have baggage yes sir i left it at customs in a locker what are you going to do with me protect you child now be quiet and let me think he leaned back folded his arms across his chest and dosed his eyes shadith ran her tongue back and forth over the cut inside her lip and tried to figure out what shed got herself into she couldnt tell much about the prisoners the blacksacks were cinched in at their waists covering arms and hands as well as head and torso they were both male bipeds legtobody ratio about the same they both wore the sort of trousers most travelers favored male and female alike the kind she was wearing tough wrinkleproof material with a number of zippered pockets one was a lot broader and taller than the other but that didnt mean much because she didnt know their ages she tasted at them with her talent but the comealong blocked her the drug smothered everything individual about them if bossman booted her out now she wouldnt have a clue to the species of the captives let alone their specific identities bossman prissyface he wasnt much taller than her a meager man all thin bone and stringy muscle firmly in charge of the operation deft hand with locks and alarms she stole a look at him and found it hard to picture him as a prowler he was a bookkeeper waiting for a bus a prim little bookkeeper who was in no hurry to get where he was going a cool man but weird he handled her sudden appearance without a blink just folded her in and went on she kept probing at him using her talent like a snakes tongue tasting his reactions to her so she could figure out how to trick him into leaving an opening she could use to get out of this mess he was opaque as a boulder and seemed about as responsive but there was something srary the way he handled his crew the way he kept control of them all with so little effort no feeling in him at least none that she could discover something walk on your toes round this one shadow dont jump till you know how longs his reach she edged around so she could see the man who jumped her lute was that his name or short for lieutenant not something you make music from no indeed sleek as a seal and fast sail he was fast could be a heavyworlder though he wasnt built like the ones she knew could be some kind of freak good name for himfreak he killed for the pleasure of it she could smell it on him see it in the wet gleam of his eyes he was watching her now doing her over and over in his head she did not touch him with her talent yukh bossman had him firmly under thumb thank whatever the other three squatting silently and patiently beside the captives they were obviously mercs hired for the job and waiting for the boss to get on with it she touched them read selfsatisfaction and hot pride men with reps and fiercely protective of them holding themselves higher than the scays and jacks competing with them for jobs they reeked contentment which told her they had a leader they liked who did things the way they liked them done she glanced at her ringchron around an hour before the ji shuttle started loading there wasnt all that much time for maneuvering she sneaked another look at lute not much chance either she heard a rattleand some thumps next office over then the clickclack of the guards heels the door shook in its slot the latch rattled as he tried it get out of here you creep the lock held and he moved on bossman sat listening intently until the sounds outside faded one minute crept past another go lute he said number one have your men prepare the avatars shadith blinked avatars lute walked a hand along the back wall like a polypodal measuring worm then made four swift sweeps of the slicer hed held against shadiths head the cuts were only a few molecules wide visible if you stuck your nose against the wallboard otherwise not he laid the slicer on the desk gave shadith a hard look that told her to keep her hands to herself took twinned suction cups from his shouldertote set them against the board slapped the lever down with the heel of his hand and eased the cutaway section from the wall opening a long narrow hole that exposed the steel lattice of a repairway he leaned the panel against the desk collected the slicer and stood waiting while lute was opening the wall the mere answering to number one got to his feet made a quick hand sign to two and three watched as they shrugged off equipment packs took out ag units and leashes they belted the units to the captives stretched the men horizontally on the lift fields and whipped the leashes about them then they got to their feet and stood holding the leash handles the bagged men floating waist high like oddly shaped balloons bossman rose take them out he waited until the mercs had tugged the captives through the hole shadith yes shadith tensed on your feet child we are leaving she slipped hastily off the desk stood with her eyes wide and beseeching her arms stiff at her sides her hands knotted into fists playing terrified child with everything in herand underneath the play trying to convince herself she wasnt as scared as she felt all right shadow virgin baby pull out the stops and hit him hard let me go please i wont say anything ill be gone in an hour or so you saved me from him i owe you i promise i wont say anything he produced a benign smile with no benignity behind it not a trace of empathy or sympathy as if they came from an organ hed had excised or maybe was born without he brushed her words away like wind noises or something with even less meaning number one leash the girl take her out the burly chief merc clipped a leash around shadiths waist slapped her behind and pointed at the opening asshole keep your hands to yourself she was fuming as she climbed through and swung over the rail onto the catwalk what would you do oinkoid if i went weeping to bossman prissface and said you promised he wouldnt sully poor little virgin me she started to giggle clapped her hand over her mouth sucked in her cheeks as the giggles threatened to burst out of her bossman was coming through and she had a strong feeling he wouldnt approve still fizzing with suppressed giggles she watched lute back onto the catwalk and pull the cutout section of wallboard into place after him he wiggled the panel until he was satisfied with the fit slapped glue patches around the cut waited until they were set then tripped the lever on the vacuum cups and caught them as they fell away he tucked them into his shouldertote and stood waiting all desire to laugh drained out of her it wasnt funny not funny at all bossman stepped from the shadows go he said lute nodded came loping past shadith edged by the two mercs and their drifting captives and went off down the catwalk the meres followed him towing the floating avatars behind them the bodies banging against the rails awkward unhandy burdens dragging back on them as they ran number one waggled shadiths leash geeup he said gritting her teeth shadith started after them loping over the knitted steel mesh it rattled and gave a little under their boots made silence impossible they didnt seem to mind the noise no point in yelling for help thats clear following lute who seemed to be sniffing the route from the air itself they ran without hesitation along the narrow ways bending low when a walk overhead came zooming down until even shadith couldnt stand upright turning corners so acute the mercs with the captives had to rotate the bodies until they were vertical and muscle them into the other walkway they passed half a hundred crossings shifted through dozens of direction changes went down ramps and up ramps on and on through a dusty gray twilight take away the leash and she probably could have jerked free if she moved suddenly enoughand her dismay at the thought of lute sniffing after her through that murky twilight beyond whatever restraints bossman put on himand she might have darted off down one of those sideways counting on speed and agility to keep her loose long enough to find her way back into the station proper she didnt try it she could sense feral things scrambling through the dark around them if she wanted to reassemble her horde she could do it in a gasp and a half she didnt try it at times they ran through ragged veils of old web choked with dust there were spiders like clots of darkness stirring in the shadows hating and fearing them heavy with poison it wouldnt take much pushing to goad them into an attack if she extended herself shecould control hundreds of them could bring them scuttling along the upper ways and launch them at the men when time and circumstance seemed optimum she didnt try that either partly it was the lute who stopped her the memory of his quickness and strength his murderous efficiency partly it was the mercs and their weapons it was also bossman precise pernickety priss she didnt know what he was armed with or how he might react and there were other reasons little things that weighed on the side of a temporary passivity bossmans cryptic remark about his luck when he learned of her interest in music and the trouble he was taking to bring her along suggested she had some value to hint and wouldnt be swatted when he got around to dealing with her and she was itching to find out what was going on catcurious thats what aleytys called her when she was especially annoyed at something shadith had done you keep sticking your nose in things none of your business itll get cut off one of these days shadith wrinkled her nose as she ran aleytys is turning positively stodgy going conservative on me how dull dull im dull duh duh duh dull bad as the vrya who get so bored with living they dive into the nearest sun she loathed being dependent on aleytys and swardheld didnt matter they were closer than most blood kin and willing she wanted to support herself and her ship trouble was a starship was a worse drain on the pocket than a drug habit what with maintenance docking fees fuel registrationif she wanted to go that route freetraders mostly didnt bother with registrationand got their ships confiscated if they stepped on the dignity of some local potenpot same thing she faced with that creepy guard no she wanted her ship registered out of helvetia there was a name with clout there was a name that cost they ran on and on it seemed to her they were going to run forever it was swardhelds idea she go to university for a few years that would give her body time to mature and bring her contacts she could use whatever she decided to do hed worked for several departments there and had connections all over the place people who knew the mechanisms behind the facade but she couldnt dredge up much enthusiasm for the idea university made her nervous shed never been to schoolnot on her own shed got her education first from her family then as apprentice to a series of extraordinary masters as she loped through the darkness she had very mixed feelings about university even a touch of gratitude to bossman prissface trotting along at the tail of this parade he was an excuse to put off something shed rather not have to deal with none of which meant she wouldnt jump at the first good chance to escape the catwalk widened the mercs ahead slowed to an easy amble she followed them round a sharp corner and stopped she was at the back end of a stubby offshoot with a steel door in the far wall bossman brushed past her and crouched over the latch as he had over the lock on the office door in seconds he had it open with no sign hed triggered any alarms hmp clever arent you little man through the opening she saw a familiar cicatrice on the far wall of the corridor outside the heavy round iris of a chute portal shuttle berth hmm i was afraid this was where we were going alert wary but doing her best to hide both as her situation got shakier by the minute she followed the bobbing bodies through the door along a short stretch of wide corridor and through an umbilical chute into a small shuttle the mercs took their captives into the back section a miniature cargo hold ratcheted them to the floor and shut off the ag units yawning and relaxed they dropped onto padded wall benches and sat with their legs stretched out feet propped on the bodies if theyd shouted it they couldnt haie made it clearer they considered the job done lute waited in the lock his eyes on shadith same to you butcherboy if you think im dumb enough to jump your bossman you got ivory between your ears bossman leaned over the console touched a sensor and dropped a barrier field between them and the mercs blocking sound and solid objects he swung the pilots seat around and lowered himself into it sit down child there were three rows of seats on each side of the cabin section two seats in each row he pointed to the front row on the left there the inside seat lute bring me her shoulderbag please he took things from the bag one by one looked them over and dropped anything he found uninteresting to the floor beside the chair comb tissues a halfempty box of lemon drops a printed book songs of ancient elyziehe flipped through it dropped it her stylus her antique fountain pen that she kept in a plastic wrap because it leaked he unwrapped it took it apart dropped the pieces and the wrapping she fumed silently it was her favorite poempen facepaint when she felt festive she painted feathers on the hawk outline acidetched on her cheek mirror hair clips rubberbands bits of this and that he flipped through her notebook read a few pages of her scribbles notes and observations lines of poems jotted down as they occurred to her he set the notebook aside and unsnapped her coinpurse he inspected each of the coins inside as if he suspected they were small bombs when he was finished with that he set the purse on the notebook and opened out another section of the bag he found the boarding pass for the paepyols shuttle read front and back dropped it on the floor i think it would be best to ignore this booking we would draw attention by canceling it and gain nothing if the child does not show up ji will mark it and forget it she could have changed her mind it happens all the time yes sir your luck will smooth it over bossman dipped again brought up the metal check from the customs locker now this is different i think he touched the timer on read the display yes something less than an hour left before the alarm goes and triggers a station scan along with a check on memory that we do not want take this lute fetch the girls luggage here he blanked the display tossed the check to his second please wait until i have finished with the bag before you leave he brought out a letterpak unsealed it and ran the message shadith was furious at this intrusion but found swardhelds voice comforting right then aslan aid adlaaruniversityinstitute of xenoethnology aslanwho gives you this is a friend of mine by name shadith she plays a mean harp introduce her to all the ancient songs you

perhaps we can find a way to pass sometime should you be agreeable to this leave a message with my housekeep see you swar qualecluales nesttelfferll bossman dropped the spent pak on the floor who is

polite doing me a favor because my guardian asked him to will this aslan be expecting you no she was running on instinct there was no time to think out her lies and she couldnt have explained to

leaving messages about he says his business is his businessand he wants to keep it that way too many snoops around reading other peoples mail i trust you are not referring to me child shaddith put a stubborn look on her face and said nothing he didnt push it in fact he seemed pleased with her shed guessed right this time but the need to watch every word every act was putting knots in her gut he felt around the smallest of the compartments and jo clayton found the tiket from the shop frowned as he read it sent to aleytys of wolff hunter how do you come to know her aleytys is my guardian and guarantor shadith tapped the credit bracelet it was her dropped me off here he inspected the tiket again a personal message enclosed he smiled that was clever of you child clever what do you mean you understand me very well shadith reknotted her fingers all right i wrote her about the guard who was after me i was angry sir scared too if i couldnt get away from him i wanted her to come here and erase the slime shes fond of me and shes very loyal to people shes fond of she doesnt like people who mess with people shes fond of and those people end up very sorry for themselves if theyre still alive to feel sorry ah yes child he was amused at her clumsy threat but it was no time to get complacent just because shed been sliding her lies past him without being called on it didnt mean that old monster was any kind of fool he lifted the coinpurse put the tiket under it set the purse back with a prim finality that was probably some kind of parable meant for her enlightenment yes that does make complications which we had better deal with immediately shadith describe the beast please shadith wiped her palms on her trousers she could feel sweat gathering in her hair again and trickling down her neck i dont like to think about him describe him for us now child and you wont ever have to think of him again riiight so much for the creep she wriggled in the chair wondering if she were laying it on too thick it seemed to be working so she stopped worrying for the moment and let the words gush out well hes a guard an ordinary guard not an officer or anything theres nothing different about his clothes and hes pretty average size all of them are about the same size i suppose they have to be to get hired dark hair sort of medium skin his face is just oh just a face face nothing special about it urn he he looked kind of i dont know kind of soft doughy the way some men get when they lie around a lot there was this wobble over his belt he wasnt even close to fat but you could see he might be in a few years he was he was thick in the shoulders front to back and side to side long arms kind of extra long i think he was maybe ashamed of them because he hooked his thumbs in his belt a lot even when he was walking around um that reminds me on his left hand he only has three fingers a thumb and three fingers i mean his pointing finger is the one thats gone thats all i can remember i think that will be sufficient lute lute drew his thumb along the side of his face in an arc that followed the boneline he smiled a tight anticipatory gesture of a mouth with the clean curves of a wooden angel despite the muffling of the flesh mask itll do we do not want that beast in a position to give information to the hunter when she comes looking for her ward do we lute certainly not sir it would be a service to everyone to cleanse the station of that sink of evil it would also be well to bear in mind lute that however noble our ends they are susceptible to misinterpretation be quick and be discreet i am always discreet sir jo clayton of course you are one minute he touched off the barrier field number one go with lute and bring the childs baggage back number two take out your neural whip please and point it at the girl use it if she seems inclined to give trouble shadith let her surprise show but hoped her dismay was pushed too deep for him to catch she could swear shed fooled him tip to top that he really did see her as a helpless girichild so what was he doing treating her like some deathandglory terrorist that old viper he doubleknots everything how do you fight someone like that wonder how far hed go if he knew what i really am when lute and the merc were gone bossman looked at her then said now now child there is nothing for you to worry yourself about sit and be patient like the good little girl you are blast the man if he were trying he couldnt do a better job of provoking me gods maybe he is maybe hes been leading me by the nose all this time when she touched at him she read satisfaction like dusty dried flowers and a general complacency no i couldnt be that wrong she squeezed her hands into fists then forced them open and stared into her palms ive got to do something transit authority keeps the gnats away from the condors this shuttle its one of the small ones lees was about the same size we couldnt be far from where she dropped me off there was a jit park just around the bend what bend who the hell knows five minutes to the freighter tikkaboro if i pick the right turn five minutes to dead if i dont she used her thumb to push the ringchron around so she could read it without turning her hand over sixteen twentyfive twenty minutes all right shadow lets see what you can finesse she lifted her head may i may i have my things please his little birdclaw hand taptapping on the thick scarred leather of her shoulderbag bossman chewed that over after several minutes of heavy silence still without saying anything to her he dropped the bag on the floor swung round and darked the console tied it off and slid from the chair he crossed to the lock stood where lute had been on your feet child but do not move until i tell you she stood up struggling with a sense of futility that came close to despair to get out of here shed have to go through him his hands were empty his tunic hung smooth and unwrinkled over his skinny body no sign of a weapon anywhere but she wouldnt trust that old viper an antiquated inch with his overvalue of his withered hide hed be bound to have something nasty to put down threats go down on your hands and knees he said yes that is correct now proceed to the chair stop when you get there stay on your knees do not touch anything as she crawled across the gritty stained carpet she put anger and fear on hold and settled to a grim waiting there was no point in regretting lost opportunitieswhich were most likely illusion anyway fly in a spiderweb the more you struggle the tighter the strands wrap round you wait keep your head down wait your time will come he hasnt a notion what you are what you can do wait you may begin he said touch only your own things she picked up the bag turned the flap back found her comb and dropped it in working slowly deliberately keeping her movements unmistakably innocent she collected her belongings and put them in the bag when she was finished she sat on her heels and waited bossman contemplated her his tar eyes gone dull go back to your chair young shadith no do not stand go on your hands and knees yes he waited until she was seated then took his place at the console bringing it up again over his shoulder he said number two come sit behind the girl use your whip if she thinks of moving we will not wait for lute or number one they are taking longer than i am comfortable with i will send you back with the shuttle later shadith sat with her hands folded her eyes down wait nothing ever goes exactly like anyone plans it noteven his schemes old monster theres always a breakdown somewhere wait and watch your time will come be patient not like a good little girl meek and obedient never like a cat at a mousehole wait chapter riding the flying spiderweb the door whooshed closed behind bossman expanding as it moved to fill the whole space of the opening as if it erased itself to underline the futility of trying to escape the cell hands clasped behind her shadith scowled at the seamless wall mashak dafta your soul smells like dogshit there was no response she didnt really expect one and shrugged off her depression as she began inspecting her new homefromhome four walls and a floor with warts all thecomforts of hell sari she kicked at a wart stretched out on the cot that unfolded from the wall and contemplated the gray monotony of the place if prissface left her in here too long with nothing to do hallucinations would be the least of it time in the diadem she was essentially immortal shed abandoned all that when she had aleytys decant her into this body i must have been out of my alleged mind that struck her as funny and she giggled but the spurt of humor was quickly dissipated time meant more now in a century or two she was going to die shed accepted that but the idea of wasting any part of those counted hours in a hole like this with nothing to see nothing to do made her wild she spent some hot passionate moments loathing bossman and all his satellites then she took another minute to curse the transit guards disembodied soullute had tove shucked him from his body by now if it hadnt been for him she wouldnt be in this mess still muttering imprecations and incantations she fished in her bag and pulled out the battered book but when she tried to read she found the light in the cell so se and dim it was like looking through a frosted screen it made her eyes burn her head ache there were poems that book shed read over and over sucking the flavor from them one by one as if they were the sweets she was far too fond of but when she looked at a page this time she couldnt make sense of the marks on it besides she was too upset to concentrate especially on multilayered poetry in outmoded and esoteric word forms she gave up dropped the book beside the cot and began searching through the bag for her box of lemon drops no box she must have missed it when she collected her things she swore threw her bag across the cell glared at it as it bounced off and plopped onto the floor she rubbed at her eyes got herself calmed down all right shadow lets not sit round whining well lie around funny why should whining sound worse lying down than sitting up she folded her hands over her stomach wriggled around until she was as comfortable as she could get on that narrow cot then she closed her eyes and reached searching for other eyes single or compound large or small anything she could look through somewhere somehow bossman must have left a crack she could worry at until it was big enough to let her crawl out of this she touched down looked through one set of eyes moved on to another then on and on through a bewildering progression of sense structures insect compounds arachnid multiples vertibrate biand tripolar vision her brain struggling to adjust to and make sense of the data pulsing into it from such wildly varying sources in a small second hold she found the two captives that bossman called avatars of what for what not knowing gave her an hitch in the psyche they were lying prone on tatty mattresses and tethered to the wall by thin almost invisible cables of menaviddan monofilament she slipped from a spider weaving a web beneath a catwalk into the body of a small furry like a rat but not a rat that was nosing at the big mans foot the furry nibbled at a boot but didnt like the taste of polish he spat out the fragment of leather scrubbed at his tongue with supple forepaws ears twisting like radar dishes he moved along the man nipping at him sniffing at him put off by the tough cloth of his trousers and tunic the mans hand was far more interesting the furry patted a forepaw at short silky hair that ran in a vee up the back of the hand pale hair like wood ash in his eyeshis vision was sharp at short distances but he saw mainly in shades of gray with a few stark patches of black or white the mans palm was broad the fingers long and tapering with stiff curved claws rather than the fiat nails more common to bipeds the furry darted away when a finger twitched edged warily back and nipped at the thumb a thready beam of light shot from a lens set some two meters high on the nearest wall tapped the furry on the nose he squealed and scuttled away heat flaring through his body he wasnt hurt but he was startled enough to keep away from the captives after that the big man had large semimobile pointed ears that twitched continually even though he was sodden with comealong his hair was thick and rather coarse a dreadlocked mane that reached his shoulders middlish brown as far as she could judge several shades darker than his skin his eyebrows were darker yet extravagantly tangled angular arcs with a few white hairs shining in the brown his mustache was dark as his brows like them threaded with white it hid most of his upper lip and drooped in long thin tails at the corners of his wide mouth he had broad shoulders long sleek muscles his sleeves were rolled up showing thick wrists and powerful hairy forearms a dyslaeror and an alpha at least ciocan maybe pippon on a crab tippy muh toesies in a ocean o shit bossman oooeeehhh hes coot crazy and sliding for hell no sane being would play games with the dyslaera they had a history of blood feuds that went back over a thousand years they werent a hasty people they didnt take umbrage lightly but family bonds were strong and they never gave up till they got whoever injured one of theirs especially the females never gave up the dyslaerin if bossman loped off so casually with an alpha male a ciocan the chosen mate of a toerfeles a clanmother well that didnt say much for shadiths chances of surviving this game of his whatever it was or of getting away from him she gathered less about the other man because the local life walked wide around him they didnt like the way he smelled there was something dangerous about it he was short and slight with a smooth pebbly skin she thought it was a dusty graygreen but it was hard to be sure it might be memory overlaying present image he reminded her of the small busy lizards that ran about her mothers garden his tabard was made from coarse thread the color of clean sand thread almost thick enough to qualify as cord knotted rather than woven into a complex pattern whose flowing textures had a subtle beauty that intrigued her a design that resonated with her soul in ways she couldnt put into words despite her cultivated facility she didnt recognize his species and the comealong was still smothering his mindpatterns so she couldnt get a feel for who he was that wayexcept for a fugitive impression of a strangeness unlike anything shed come across before odder even than the vegetative sikkul paem doublet kinokkahat who lived in swardhelds ship and worshiped the stardrives shed stayed away from the bridge until shed prospected the rest of the ship now she went jumping from mind to mind until she ended inside the head of a small simi chained to the high back of the immense captains chair his was the most intelligent of the animal brains she hitched a ride on that day he was also nearsighted and badtempered he chattered noisily as she tried to shifthis head went into an angry dance back and forth along his perch she loosened her grip afraid bossman would notice his pets agitation have one of his unpre dictable flashes of insight and shut her down before she knew what was happening the pet gibbered some more then he folded his long skinny arms and gloomed at the woman seated on his right she was a small dark woman wiry athletic she wore a black allbody shipsuit and a loose vest that fell in graceful folds about her black suede soft and supple as silkvelvet with black zippers everywhere she sat at the pilot station legs crossed one foot swinging as she flipped through the pages of a magazine the reader on her knee her thumb dancing on the jak button the swinging foot bounced now and then as she came across something that interested her orpasionally she read a snippet aloud to bossman who was sitting at a com station on the far side of the bridge pulling up data on a screen he ignored her except for a meaningless mouth noise he produced at irregular intervals before shadith had time to get bored lute came in the pet fidgeted nervously and kept a wary myopic eye on the slight tigerish figure number one was just behind lute hauling the harpcase and her travelpouch the mere dumped his load on the floor beside the pilot and left immediately lute dropped into the cos seat to the left of the chair and waited for bossman to acknowledge his presence bossman finished his task at the sensor board frowned at what he saw on the screen swung round to face the lute well puk couldnt help it ginny that kaak was chargin around like his tail on fire and maybe it was he had a herd of his lodge bros huntin with him took me a time to get him off by himself i blew a leech on his neck and soons he was out of it i tipped him down the nearest incinerator chute hes sludge brick by now no trouble showin when me and the merc connected but i got a feelin we sled leave soonest what you think your instincts are infallible my friend ajeri tiszteh is it possible the pilot lifted her eyes from her magazine we have a window in half an hour then one after that every fifteen minutes for the next hour you name it you got it we will leave soonest as puk suggests when you have completed the necessary arrangements jeri i would like you to look through the girls baggage ajeri the pilot set the magazine reader aside thumbed the sensor that sent the prerecorded message she waited for the acknowledgment then looked around what for ginny shes just a kid i wonder she was quite calm when she did not think someone was watching her and there is that association with the hunter puk the lute stirred playin games he growled ajeri slid from the chair went to poke at the travelpouch with her boot toe over her shoulder she said some of the cousins look like babes until they turn into little old people whats memory tell you ginny the lbexines like that i do not believe so he glanced at the screen turned back to the pilot although there is very little information available about ibex except for the trade enclave yastroo it is a closed world you think the girls been feeding you lies ajeri was squatting beside the harpcase she looked up raised her brows puk stirred sure she was they drop from the womb women lie the first breath they take they lie its their thing ginny the bossman ignored him and answered the pilot not exactly jeri tiszt i think it more likely that she is not telling the whole truth that sent chills through shadith because it was too close to what shed actually been doing he kept having them those flashes of insight spooky and frustrating it was impossible to fight because you never knew when it would strike and undo all your plotting he had an exalted view of his luck and maybe he was right to have it ajeri had the harpcase open shadith winced as the pilot plucked the loosened strings at random then heavyhanded a muddled arpeggio maybe you ought to dump her ginny she sounds like trouble we dont need no jeri she is a gift from my luck to throw her away would be a stupidity and dangerous would luck stay if i rejected her and her gifts think of it my friend without my looking or seeking the girl came to me a musician who knows old songs old music a child virginal and pure she is the last ingredient in the mix jeri the third in the holy triad nataminaho the hunter opalekismimo the holy dancer and now nikamooskinin the virgin singer we can proceed immediately to kiskai inject them into the mix and let it ferment there is more time for the news of their arrival to spread and stir the people up it will have a wider impactand we will have time to extend the drama to an explosion of blood and rage at the culmination of the pakoseo think of the intensity we can get jeri what a grand finale ahhhhh we will burn our candles to luck this night my dear we will he stopped and pulled himself together jeri tiszt the harp seems harmless enough please continue looking through the girls impedimenta and tell me if you find anything that troubles you puk the lute sat up with a jerk ginny we need more of a buffer i think you should get hold of betalli and turn him lose on makin fuckin damn sure we cant be traced backward forward up down any which way i dont like that hunter bein involved with the girl shell be nosin after every ship that leaves here around the time the little bitch disappeared spotchals i knew it was goin to be trouble they a herd of needlenosed assholes wind you up so tight with their fuckin rules you strangle yself were not deep enough covered boss luck or no luck thats the truth and you know it puk ive told you before i will not have language in my ears you will be penitent tonight in our praisesong yeh yeh i hear you when ginny scowled puk got hold of his impatience and spoke more soberly i apologize sir but i must respectfully remind you of the gist of what i said buffer sir betalli sir hunters inc sir i will consider the matter puk and your apology is accepted i understand you spoke from the heat of your anxiety but courtesy is a virtue that must be assiduously cultivated cultivate my friend cultivate ajeri tiszteh have you finished is there anything in that pouch that i should see only that the girls hauling along a young arsenal seems an odd lot to be carrying to university of all places makes me wonder what she was thinking theres a stunnertype ive never seen before looks handbuilt and this she held up a tiny needier it almost disappeared in the palm of her hand id swear its a paao special i know the paao teely dont make weapons for everyone and they charge an arm and a leg but shes got such highpowered friends it probably is can i keep it ginny its a beautiful thing we are not thieves ajeri tiszteh put the needier away mumbling under her breath the pilot tucked the weapon back where shed found it i tell you again ginny singer or no virgin or whatever i think you should dump her i will not so question my luck ajeri tiszteh you displease me by your lack of faith you will join puk as penitent do you accept yes sir i acknowledge my failing but remember dear sir it is grounded in my affection for you and my respect for the artistry of your productions in her cell shadith blinked so startled that she temporarily lost touch with the pets brain she finally decided it was some kind of game they were playing weird shortly after that she felt the ship come alive and knew they were on their way chapter crazy in a can it was a small oval room womblike warm almost claustrophobic shadith saw it through the pets eyes they seemed to work better in semidarknessas if his brain reconfigured the shape of his retinas to eliminate his myopia once the sun went down the curved walls were a matte black that sucked up light with an avid hunger even the ghastly bluepurple glow from lusotorches programmed to sink near extinction at random intervals then flame up into a painful glare all the while producing gouts of illusory gray black cottoncandy smoke without stink or sting incense wafted about on programmed drafts pungent and not quite pleasant when a drift came his way the pet sneezed and scrubbed at his nose with his forepaws the small sounds he made were lost in swelling sonorous music that set shadiths teeth on edge and made him fold his ears tight against his head bossman knelt in the center of an elaborate mandala lines of silver laid into the tarblack floor raying outward from a silver disk with words and obscene drawings written in silver wire between the rays shimmering alive and sinking into murk once more as the torchlight shifted he chanted in a high thin voice supported by ajeri the pilot who knelt at his right hand and puk the lute who kept at his left the pet was chained high on a wall beside one of the flambeaux between attacks of incense the beast sank into a lethargy that came from too much familiarity with the room and the goings on there shadith had to keep pinching at him to wake him up so she could look through his eyes and follow what was happening the chant went on and on but the music changed the smoke spun into dancersslender childlike female forms hidden and revealed by drifting draperies of black gauze flinging themselves through a turgidly erotic dance they dipped and bowed leaped turned and twisted round and round the mandala for some time shadith couldnt see their faces when she did she gasped they had her face all of them they were her deliberately her holoshapes programmed to repeat her over and over called into being by that that obscenity of a man he was using her using her body her face for for she writhed on the cot then forced herself to calm she was losing the link with the pet it wasnt because of their eroticism that she found the dance and dancers so deeply disturbing reacquiring the capacity for sensual pleasure of all sorts and degrees was one of her strongest reasons for abandoning disembodied immortality no the dance and the dancers were troubling because theireroticism was so distorted ginny bossman puk the lute ajeri the pilot they shaped the dance and the dancers bled their own lubricity into the smoke their passions were there under the surface seething and burgeoningand distorted and denied denied denied in their hatred and fear of those passions watching simulacrums with her face and body jo clayton moving through that dance made her sick yet she couldnt look away she couldnt bring herself to break the connection with the pet the dance grew more and more intense the lusotorches blew out more gouts of smoke thickening the dark the light sank to a vague purple glow and stayed low for several minutesthen flared in a blast of harsh brilliance that seared the pets eyes and started him whimpering puk and ajeri were bound face inward to a pair of xshaped bodyframes ginny bossman threw off his robe and stood naked in blinding bluepurple light that turned his skin corpse white his lips black and sunk his eyes into bottomless holes the flesh mask stripped off he had a gaunt deeply lined face the lines were wounds the shadow in them a harsh black like dried blood he stripped fauxskin from his left hand baring the metal beneath twisted his thumb and extruded razor claws the music swelled the dancers sang a wordless howling song and pressed in on the mandala tumescent and sweating ginny walked with heavy slow steps to the xframes he sank his claws into the black cloth of the pilots robe and tore it away exposing her narrow back drawing lines of black blood on the pallid waxy flesh he dropped the swatch took a step to one side and repeated with the lutes robe praise her he cried out suddenly his voice a strident screech he manipulated the metal arm just above the wrist a limber metalcored whip at least two meters long unreeled from inside the arm he closed his metal fingers about the stock swung the whip up praise her he cried again and opened a long cut in the pilots back praise her he flicked the tip across the lutes hard taut shoulders the dancers had whips in their hands lines of light force lines each time ginny cut at puk and ajeri they laid into him back and belly thigh and shoulder the holowhips raising real welts on his body when the dancers with shadiths face and form beat him it was as if she beat him for a few minutes she laughed and cheered them on then she understood what was really happening in there and the elation drained out of her her smoke clones were pleasuring him whores of pain she broke away deeply dismayed by her reaction to that ceremony and insulted by bossmans use of herand she was frightened by the implications of what she was seeing whats he mean to do with me he said something about drama if thats his idea of drama that that thing gods theres no way m going to kiskai ive never heard of it i suppose its another of those out the back of beyond places where they grow weirdness like a cash crop im supposed to be something called the nikamooskinin the virgin singer virgin talk about your wasted opportunities i shouldve teased swar into well its too late for that now besides that gorbellied old goat doesnt really give a shit about a meensy flap of flesh its my bodyage thats got him dizzy that blasted twitch hes got about girls you better watch your feet woman it could be you in that blackroom playing the penitent if he gets snarky about something you do penitent gods her mind in turmoil it was several hours before she managed to sleep chapter crazy in a can day slid into day and no one came to the cell every eight hours a red light blinked a pleasant run of chimes broke the humming stifling silence and a tray arrived in the slot above the extensitable the meals were ample but bland dull monotonous the same four meals in the same order over and over and over she still couldnt read the lighting seemed designed to prevent it when she tried nose an inch from the page the strain brought on a roaring headache she couldnt write she tried scribbling words and phrases she couldnt read but seeing what she wrote was so much a part of her way of working she couldnt make anything come out right and that built up so much rage and frustration in her that she screamed and threw the notebook and stylus at the wall flung herself on the cot and beat her fists on the pillow and felt like a fool once she calmed down the cell was gray everything in it was gray even the light was gray she looked at gray until it seeped so deep in her she felt her bone marrow turning gray it was like living in a fog a small fog when everything was folded away the cell was barely six paces wide and seven long at times she plunged round and round for hours driven by the clamor of her body for exercise for some way to vent the restless energy that built up in her day slid into day the ship plowed on through the insplit there was nothing to break the slow passage of the hours transit time was time out from life nothing to do but wait one week slipped away two shadith paced and raged and slept glared at the food with loathing when the trays arrived on their unvarying schedule with their unvarying menus i want someone to talk to she yelled into the slot knowing it was futile i want something to do she kicked at the wall where the door had been hammered at it with the heel of her boot talk to me you turds say something anything the only response she got was the dull thud of leather against unyielding steel and the equally adamantine silence from her captors even mindriding lost its charm there was nothing new to look at no matter how diligently she searchedand more than that not a single crack in bossmans security no hope she could dig her way out of this mess most days bossman ginny was busy at a workstation but the pet was never close enough to let her read the screen and there wasnt a lot of interest in watching a man play with a sensorpad when she couldnt inspect the result when he wasnt at the workstation he sat in the blackroom meditating which was even less interesting she avoided that room during shipnight or any other time when puk or ajeri were in there with ginny she was afraid of it she had enough strains on her sanity without dredging up more of her own darkside after ajeri the pilot went meticulously through her daily check on the ships position and condition she ate a substantial breakfast read her magazines until she con jo clayton sidered the meal sufficiently digested then she shifted to the gym where she ran a series of tests on her body she marked the results on a pressboard pulled up a chart and inspected that then worked her way through interminable exercise programs doing the stretches kicks and the rest with obsessive concentration after the first week shadith got so bored seeing the same thing over and over and over again that she didnt bother tuning in on the pilot and her solitary cavortings except for his daily visits to the hold where he pumped highenergy concentrates into the prisoners and renewed the drugs that kept them unaware of where they were and what was happening to them puk the lute stayed in his quarters wandering through the labyrinths of his mind with the help of a small pharmacopoeia of pidramins after watching him sweat and make faces for a while shadith sighed and left hint to it because his drugfantasies were probably the most interesting things happening on the ship she wished for a moment or two that she could take a walk through them wished that she were one of those rare full range telepathy the universe threw up to make life a bitch for students of psi who swore that true telepathy was a phantasm created from the yearning of the powerless for an ultimate kind of power but she wasnt and she couldnt so she went on searching for some other distraction to boot her out of her growing lethargy the three mercs knew each other too well theyd exhausted the entertainment in old exploits whenever one started up a story the others had heard too many times before they stopped him with howls and thumps the little bit they did talk it was about women she listened now and then but generally tuned out after a short sample either bored to the point of ossification or furious to the point of indigestion she went back a number of times hoping to catch them speculating on the purpose of this expedition but even among themselves they didnt discuss the affairs of their employer their reticence was either principle or prudence or both knowing old doubleknotter ginny like they must they had to suspect their quarters were eyed so they spent their time bragging about their women going over their equipment exercising almost as fanatically as ajeri reading or sleeping she got some amusement out of inspecting their equipment what the welldressed merc was wearing these days but somewhere around the twentieth time she watched a merc break down and polish his needier the last motes of interest were wiped away with the last infinitesimal motes of dust engine crew were a pair of sikkul paem doublets they were passing the insplit rooted out and contemplating whatever they used for a navel so motionless in their dirt beds they might have been stilllife holos nothing nothing nothing gray gray entered her mind and soul gray sucked the life out of her it wasnt something new or wholly unexpected itd happened to her once beforelast year when she was rattling about wolff wondering what she was going to do with her life aleytys recognized her state near its onset and acted immediately without bothering to ask her consent she kicked shadiths feet from under her knelt on her and set her healers hands to work readjusting shadiths metabolism then she shoved her into a flitter and dropped her in the middle of the wildlands to live or die as she chose shadith discovered she wasnt ready to die yet besides she was too irritated with aleytys to give her the satisfaction that irritation and the struggle to survive jolted her loose from the gray doldrums it was heart massage in every sense of the word there was no one to jolt her now on the fortyninth day out from the spotchals transfer station she stopped eating there was no purpose behind it she simply lacked the energy and the will to leave the cot she turned her face to the wall and began shutting down she woke in the sickbay with bossman standing over her looking annoyed what did you think you were doing child weak tears gathered in her eyes and spilled over she stared at him without trying to answer dimly she remembered that she wasnt supposed to know this face whore you she said finally her voice a dryleaf whisper that is not important answer the question please your voice she closed her eyes nothing that is not an adequate response what do you mean she turned her head away how could she explain when she didnt understand it herself you had food a comfortable bed facilities for washing and elimination everything necessary resentment giving her a spurious energy shadith kept her eyes closed and jeered silently at him stupid old wahw dont know ass from eathole what is wrong with you child shadith kept a tight hold on her pride and said nothing her mind told her it was stupid but her body got satisfaction out of silence she went with her body ajeri snorted she came swiftly around the couch caught shadith by the shoulders and shook the breath out of her all that exercising had given the pilot a tigerish strength which she didnt bother trying to con trol stop sulking brat act like a baby and you be treated like one she threw shadith away from her get your little mouth in gear or i give you a spanking you wont forget rage exploding through her struggling to retrieve her selfcontrol shadith lay sprawled and panting where ajeri had flung her careful shadow that miserable ooj that creeping bakbook wait you remember wait that braindead pervert that she they you cant do anything now not in the insplit and not tied to this stupid cot cant do shit till we get where were going fool them pull their rotten strings and make the bastards dance she crammed herself back into the role of child and let the childs words pour out im going crazy in that coffin i need something to do give me my harp give me something bright to look at red or blue or green or yellow all that gray turns me moldy mold growing on my bones mold growing over my eyes and on my tongue ill rot if i have to look at all that gray much longer and fix the light so i can read give me books magazines something to pass the time talk to me what harm would that do you you promised to protect me youre killing me why cant you understand that he rubbed his stick thumb up and down his bony chin as he chewed over what shed said the harsh toplight shadowed his eyes and deepened the lines in his face put a shine on the end of his long nose there was less expression on his naked face than thered been on the flesh mask hed worn before ajeri stood behind him watching skeptically not wholly buying the innocent bit she had more call it connection with others than he did which meant that right now she was more dangerous than he was unless he got one of his insight flashes which the gods forbid he cleared his throat said mildly i put you there for your protection child for your purity you were distressed by the advances of that guard i did not wish you to fear similar treatment here shadith told herself she was too tired to keep gnawing at her resentments she pushed the hair off her face looked vaguely around then sat up im not afraid of men i just dont want to be raped she shrugged who does i mean its not the sort of thing a girl dreams about when she becomes marriageable he nodded i see you will go back to where you were no be quiet and listen i have heard you some of what you have said will be done not all you must not expect that he produced a smile like a wince come he held out his hand waited for her to take it be patient with us we are not very experienced with children well now you know what happens she slid off the couch and let him lead her from the chamber twenty minutes after shadith walked into her cell the dim grayness changed brightened all over while a spota reading lightfocused on the pillow end of the cot she felt herself expanding like a paper flowerbud dropped in water she laughed clapped her hands better better better she caroled oh betttterrr an hour later the chimes bonged the slot slid open instead of food there were six magazine paks and a reader on the tray ajeri stood in the doorway a dark blue blanket draped over her arm shadiths harpcase hanging at her side you wanted it you got it brat hope you satisfied because you ant getting any more she dumped the blanket on the floor slid her arm from the strap and set the harpcase on the blanket then she stepped back and the door slid closed thirtyfour days later eightythree days out of the transfer station shadith lay on her stomach scribbling in her notebook she dropped the stylus and closed the book when she felt the lurch as the ship emerged from the insplit and began droning along sublight her hands were shaking she rubbed them along her trousers pressed them hard against the zippers on her thighpockets the little pain lost in the thunder of her uncertainties all her playacting all her maneuvering hadnt gained a millimeters freedom the most shed achieved was the illusion she had some control over her situation illusion not reality that could change now bossman meant to use her to do that he had to take her out of storage if she couldnt manage something once she was loose she might as well pack it in the vibration stopped orbit shadith was so familiar with the pet now she was looking through his eyes almost as soon as the thought flitted through her head the huge forescreen was lit a blue and white world turned in it the image large enough for the pet to make out most of the detail despite his myopia for the first time she saw bossman ginny sitting in the captains chair the pet looked down at the skim of ashgray ashbrown hair laid across ginnys pale pink skull whenever he needed reassurance which he did fairly often ginnys mix of tension eagerness and triumph made him nervous cool man wasnt so cool any more he drummed fingers on the chair arm clicked his tongue as he scanned readings and peered anxiously at the image of the world they were orbiting kiskai and three months early ajeri tiszteh show me ainairil if you want a direct drop its over the horizon at the moment how long should be coming up round two hours twenty minutes on i can preempt the wapasats recepttime break off the collecting or shift the ship which means wed have to move out of sisipins shadow we will wait you can use the time jeri tiszt to test the functioning of the pickupshunts for all the satellites and start recoding the eyes onboard impatience is a weakness we do not need to encourage moving the ship could be destructive there are too many chart readers down there with a glass on the sky we are vulnerable in the visible spectrum and i have no means of determining what the effect of a new celestial inhabitant would be it might even wash out the pasepawateo mitewastewapal that would leave us without the centerpiece of the production ajeri laughed what a mouthful only you ginny and forty million kiskaids show me the mistiko otcha cicip it should be possible to do that without disturbing anything important the cicip should still be deserted just a patch of trees and some bare rock one sacred playground coming up the pov shifted rapidly swooping down at terrifying speed the pet would not look at the screen it made him dizzy he curled up and licked at his genitals until the scene settled down even with the pets deficiencies of vision shadith could see a vast natural amphitheater the crater of an anciently extinct volcano with grass like short green fur carpeting the interior patches of trees scattered about a rugged upheaval of naked stone a number of small figures worked diligently at the grass mowing it pulling weeds planting turfs wherever the crop looked thin or there was bare ground showing others wooden yokes on their shoulders were going and coming from beneath several broad low arches at the base of the ripplefronted cliff carrying buckets of water and tiles and mortar in buckets full of rubble out cave under there theyre getting it ready for something ginny knows what curses on his pointed head shadith yawned blinked her surprise her head felt so heavy it was hard to keep focused through the pet ginny cleared his throat it seems it is a good thing we are here early jeri tiszt the tapwit priests are already beginning to put the place in order hmm the kihcikistilik island chain is below us now before you start the shunt tests run a pov along it i want to see his voice faded the scene faded shadith plunged fathoms deep into sleep chapter hang your harp on a whisper tree someone was shaking her she came painfully awake looked up into the liquid copper eyes of the lacertine captive she was lying on a floor somewhere and he was kneeling beside her she wasnt tracking too well whatever ginny used to put her out seemed to have pushed the slowbutton in her head she rubbed at her eyes groped around with numb hands wood there was wood all around herfloor walls ceiling it was like being inside a crate no not a crate more like being inside a jewelbox beautifully assembled rectangles of wood grain flowing into grain the joins so tight they were invisible there was a band of carving up near the ceiling she could see shadows shifting across the low relief her eyes blurred when she tried to make out the design no windows but the room was filled with light dancing light dappled with leafshadow thinking about that made her head ache so she stopped door she couldnt see the door probably it was somewhere behind itif there was a door the room seemed to be rocking slowly in time with groans and creaks that crept through the walls at first she thought it was her head playing games with her then she felt the shifting of the floor under her back the pressure and release awawashahiken wepastan she heard what shed just said blinked kekwa the lacertine grinned baring a pair of curved needle fangs and the small sharp chisel teeth between them yes the room is moving youre not off your head and your tongues not gone wild on you give it a minute or two itll come loose from the local langue we been imprinted one of the more useful things our captor did us though i hate to think what else he mightve fiddled with eheh ahhhh she slapped the floor then forgot speech for the moment and pushed up onto her feet shadith she said and held out her hand of nowhere in particular she blinked again he was right the twist of her tongue was gone eyes slitted face contorted with silent laughter he looked at the hand then took it as if it were a precious object and bowed over it with exaggerated grace naiyol hanee late of spotchals born and bred of dunyadzi which you wont have heard of he straightened and shook her hand gravely removed his own and watched with amiable interest as she let her arm drop call me kikun she raised her brows not quite sure how to take him kikun it is hearing a groan behind her she turned the other captive was sitting up clutching at his head wa he roared mishtco mameash olowashish nta kawinosikoo yaiiii she chuckled met a hot yellow gaze i know i know she said my head was sore as a boil too and i was ready to bark like a dog and bite anything that moved yeh kikun said we been imprinted with the local langue my names shadith whore you rohant vohv voallts ciocan of family voallts gazgaort of company voallts korlatch of spotchhelspar i dont know you hed got his tongue untwisted faster than she did no reason you should ive never been down on spotchals surface ginny scooped me up when i came round a corner minding my own business and ran into the lot of you according to him his luck brought me to his hands what i think of my luck is too obscene for mixed company rohant the ciocan went still as a startled yool though only for a moment then his ears twitched twitched again a translucent inner eyelid swept across his eyes snapped down if hed had a tail it would have been switching back and forth in short sharp jerks ginny she shook her head i dont want to talk in here your call csecse he came to his feet with an impressive elasticity given eightythree days under drugs and bloodfeed fists on his hips his mane brushing the ceiling he inspected the room the floor shifted under them what the hell is this place its moving he sounded so indignant that shadith was surprised into a giggle he glanced at her snorted then crossed the room in two long strides slapped his hand against the broad button on the jamb the door opened toward him nearly hit him in the nose he snorted again ducked through the opening shadith blinked as kikun came round her and went out after the ciocan shed forgotten him completely it was as if hed erased himself from her sensesall her senses which was very odd indeed she was always aware of people around her she might not pay any attention to them but she knew they were there slowly thoughtfully she followed kikun and walked into a bare box like the room shed just left though about twice as large and with a few welcome additions her harpcase for one and her travelpouch along with two other smaller pouches sewn from twill she toed a twill pouch yours rohant shrugged if theyre strangers i suppose so courtesy of our captor she opened her case smiled as she touched the instrument inside swardheld had spent months on the harp getting her shape right polishing her wood dark chestnut streaked with umber until it glowed carving her floral cartouches laying in her ivory plates and scrolls of copper and silver wire shadith set her hand flat on the strings a gentle caress meant as much for swardheld as for the harp herself she shut the case clicked the catches home and began looking through her travelpoucheverything in place even her weapon satchel she thumbed the locks on the satchel scowled as nothing happened that bitch she broke my locks she tipped back the lid took out her stunner checked the charge topped up busy little minkhas arent they needier yup clips full juiced up and ready to go cutter prytractor ey es picklocks randread miniprobe knives one two uh hunh all seven with fingerprints all over them she didnt like people handling her things she didnt like it almost as much as she didnt like that creep guard handling her she found a scrap of sham and began polishing the blade of the buwie youre a surprising little kitcat shadith rohant the ciocan wiggled his shaggy brows where you taking all that university she inspected the steel smiled when she saw the fingerprints were gone she slid the buwie into its slot and drew out the crystal stittoe swore at the cloudy marks on the transparent blade and exchanged the sham for a glassrag always struck me as a peaceful sort of place you planning to make war on the professors thats stupid well get along a lot better if you forget what i look like and stop treating me like some vacantbrained nit while im finishing here why dont you she looked around scowled when she saw kikun had gone somewhere shed missed him again that little mans a ghost why dont you follow him and find out what this place is she began working on the stittoes blade very careful around the edges he grunted went stomping off shadith smiled should be used to it old lion what i hear a ciocans toerfeles beats up on him just for the practice she inspected the stittoe slotted it and took up the first of the throwing knives then worked steadily until she had all the blades smooth and gleaming and back in their slots she looked through the rest of her instrumentation gave the surfaces a quick wipe with a dustcover she tried out the latches they snapped home with satisfying chinks the locks were broken but she could clamp the satchel shut and be reasonably certain itd stay closed she rubbed at her nose contemplated its battered simleather sides thinking over what had happened to her wondering where she should go from here id forgot what its like being weak how you have to behave how wary you have to be it sucks having to walk round ready to massacre people words words shadow just words whyd you bring these toys if you didnt plan to use them wrong mindset thats what if youd had one of those shooters back there what would itve got you dumped in a lethal chamber thats all cant fight the fuzz with force youve got to use your head not your gut i suppose so right you should have gone straight for guard headquarters dropping lees name whenever you had a chance you should have flattered them got them to show you around their operation as a courtesy to hunters inc you played the child well enough for ginny why not for that creeps boss tell that high hoofta stories enough about lee to addle his brain if any and tickle his gizzard tease him into escorting you to the shuttle what could the creep do then but your mind wasnt right was it blind and bedamned i suppose so but cleverness doesnt work all the time people can be so sharp they cut themselves i need friends connections backing and in the meantime i need the damn gun she opened the satchel took out the needier clipped it inside her shirt swardheld had pulled a paao teely weaponsmith out of a bad hole last year and got the needier as a thank gift he passed it on to her along with the harp he was a good friend generous and she seriously adored him but she was getting deathly sick of saying thank you thank you for everything she owned she twitched her shoulders and bent over the satchel running her finger along the knife hilts she chose her hideaway knife its hilt and blade molded from the same piece of jaje braincrystal it was flexible as an armsdealers morals and a bitch to use with any skill but it was as close to indetectable as a weapon could get she slipped it into the crystallined sheath in her left boot and stood as in the other room there was a band of carving in low relief about three hands wide around the top of the wall blocky simplified animal forms which incorporated side front and top views in each image along with inside and out a berry vine click on the langue imprint amtapishk twined about them and spread its leaves between them punctuating the spaces with its bumpy fruit there were ventilation slots above the frieze and holes pierced through it among the twists and turns of the amtapishka vine the light coming through those holes was diffuse and unsteady a rustling whisper came with it along with an assortment of muted creaks and groans if she had to guess shed say whoever built the place had mirrors bringing in sunlight from outside she slung the strap of the harpcase over her shoulder and went out the hallway beyond the door ended in a wall on her left to her right she could see several other doors each with a spiral of running felinoids click mioweh in a central cartouche with a white card in the paws of the ursinoid click maskin at the heart of each spiral she turned round there was a card on the door shed just closed behind her with an arrow scrawled across it pointing away down the hall the spoor of the ciocan or is it kikun hmh she took the card put it back blank side out better not leave obvious traces the wind noises got louder the floor moved under her feet all right all right dont have to get snarky about it im going she went round one corner then another following the track of the arrows flipping the cards as she came on them passing several crossways as she had when she was running on a leash inside the station an uncomfortable comparison she put out of her head as soon as it occurred to her she moved faster and faster in her impatience to get out of there the card trail ended at a wide heavy door every inch of it deeply carved into a single beastform maskin male in a threat posture it was less complex than the frieze designs more realistic the maskins massive back was turned to the hallway his snarling muzzle in side view so his teeth and tongue were visible one little squinty eye she closed her hand into a fist banged it against the stud in the center of the iron wristring on the maskins left forepaw there was a low thunk and the door opened a crack she gave it a shove stepped onto a small platform and looked around tree were up a damn tree the house was built over the massive central trunk to her eye it was at least fifty meters wide with wings connected by crosshalls spreading another fifty meters along side branches supported by hundreds of secondary trunks slender leafbearing limbs rose vertically around the perimeter of the building curved inward above the house to form a thick green dome it was pleasantly cool with enough sun filtering through to send leaf shadows dancing she could see motorized mirrors fixed to the rib branches catching that light and shooting it at the roof of the house confirming her earlier guess riiight i am one smart little bint hah if you so smart shadow what you doing here the leaves brushed against each other with a finely nuanced sound that was very much like a room full of whisperers the name drifted into her mind clickclick whisper tree she said aloud yeh she leaned against the rail and looked around where now how does one get to the ground at the left end of this front porch there was a square of a different sort of wood dark blue almost purple with brown streaks in it big enough to hold two of her but a squeeze for the ciocan there was a pillared railing around three sides carved from more of the purplewood a gate of purplewood was swung back against the wall pinned there by a barandmagnet latch about two meters above the square there was a domeshaped canopy carved from the purplewood with two long reels tucked up under it and cables running from each end of each reel to the corners of the railing there was a green leaf caught between the end of the square base and the house platform the sap oozing from it still wet she scowled down through the heavy shadow around the secondary trunks but didnt see any broken bodies on the dirt below thats reassuring i think well if it worked for the ciocan she stepped on the base tugged the gate from the magnet and slammed it shut above her something whirred after a slight hesitation the cables began to unwind and the base went down smoothly swaying a little as the cables lengthened scraping against the secondary trunks that were clustered close about it descending into the stifling green twilight around them it stopped a handspan from the ground she opened the gate and stepped down edged past air roots like straggly white hair that wobbled around her scraped along the harpcase she had slung over her shoulder they brushed against her body her face they tickled her seemed to reach for her eyes yukh why dont they shave the damn things off behind her she heard the soft sounds of the lift retreating upward the brushthunk as the open gate banged against the trunks paranoid little minkhas or maybe its ginny doing his thing i suppose we have to climb the tree to get back in the house i knew i shouldve brought everything with me she worked outward toward the light the supports were wider apart and got smaller as she moved away from the main trunk the air roots were wilder and wispier she emerged into the slanted sunlight of late afternoon and found herself wading through the short curly grass of a mountain meadow half a kilometer across ringed by huge ancient conifers like a scraggly greenblack hedge watcher the immense screen that stretched across the entire front of the bridge was lit from end to end divided into dozens of cells most of them still empty one by one slowly two or three an hour the cells were filling with scenes from the world below them as ajeri kilavez and pukanuk pousli spoke with onpianet agents and deployed ginbiryol seyirshis patheeyes cell at the edge of nighe a raiding party was attacking the bighouse of an estate mostly pellet weapons though some cutterbeams were visible along with a number of slicedanddiced bodies cell in the hot morning sunshine of a market square of a small farm village not far from the ocean three men were tied to whipping posts while a fourth man with his sleeves rolled up to show his massive forearms was laying into the back of one of the prisoners with a twometer long stockwhip hed already drawn blood and was concentrating on the precision of this crisscross cuts the pov lingered on his face then moved to the face of the man being whipped then to the faces of the men waiting their turn for punishment lingering lovingly on them tracking every nuance of expression the villagers watched silently sullenly the local vips sat in shaded comfort in a permanent bleacher affair the older males stem the younger ones wagering on how long each victim would last or anything else that struck their fancy cell a house was burning small thatched roof someone it sounded like a small girl was trapped inside screaming as she died very very slowly a woman was shrieking and struggling in the arms of several men who were themselves cursing and weeping as they kept her from running back into the house cell a young woman pulled herself with furious agility onto the back of the stony riding beast of an equestrian statue stood there declaiming verses in a powerful contralto angry satiric verses that brought cheers from the crowd of listeners drawn by her voice shouts of go go go until blackclad halfarmored guards came raging through the crowd slamming their clubs into any part of anybody within reach the poet jumped from the statue and vanished into the throng before the guards reached her cell singing in a basso drone op pal lan op pal lah tin op pal op pal la tin op pal op pal lah tin adouble line of long haired men in beaded robes hauled sacks of grain beans and other dried foods into a stone pyramid with a massive plank door the pyramid was one of a long line of caches built along a broad unpaved road that stretched from horizon to horizon across a sea of silvergreen grass an endless dramatic sky arching overhead the pov moved on along that broad unchanging track bisecting the plains of kwamitaskwen showing more lines of the tapwit priests provisioning more pyramids as they got ready for the mass march of the people in the pakoseo cell the room was antiseptically clean white tiles on the floor and wall stainless steel appointments smoothy shiny black wires for the electrical equipment the men working there all but one wore surgical garb with gauze masks and black goggles that hid all expression and turned them into vaguely insectile figures the odd man was tall and lean with a handsome lined face and a thick flowing mane of white hair he wore a starched wrinklefree white cassock that brushed against black sandals and a robe beaded with totems and symbols in icon panels down the front around the hem and sleeves in bright jewel colors that might have been garish but werent a naked woman was stretched out on the steel table glaring at them terrified but defiant she looked very much like the rebel poet of cell but was perhaps a few years older she might have been a sister or cousin one of the masked figures bent over her drew a scalpel in a slanting line from the hollow of her throat to the nipple of her right breast she screamed and tried to struggle but she had little leeway for movement she gathered herself and spat in the face of the man bending over her he ignored it and continued with his delicate work the blade barely broke the skin the cut burned a little but that was all give one the names of your cell the robed man said it was a beautiful voice a warm creamy baritone a voice made for caressing the ear just the names all one wishes is to persuade them for good of their souls and their brothers to abandon this foolish rebellion against the order oppalatin decreed for us all you and i child we have our place and function in life it is not good to deny this there are enough terrors and and evils that one has to face from sun to sun why create more give one the names you will you know dont make one hurt you child one doesnt want to hurt you the napriest will remove your skin bit by bit and his assistants will paint pimikot tincture on the wound yes i see you understand tell one child name the names cell each circle was closed about a small bonfire sprinlded with aromatic resins a fire streaked blue and green the matrons sang their caste hymns preparing to receive the blessing of the pasepawateo mitewastewapal each set of hymns counterpointing the other the women were apart yet one parts of a greater whole celebrating oppalatins creative force in ways profoundly traditional and profoundly subversive ignoring the former and incensed by the latter the gospah high priest ayawlt sent his enforcers out and whipped the women from their circles napriests in masks and black leather beat them while their families watched took the malta leader from her circle and the tanak leader from hers and led them to the ma misthakan and the question and so it went violence and destruction present in every scene except those with the tapwits and their provisioning ginbiryol seyirshi examining and testing each of them rejecting some marking others for further exploration selecting the rest for storage there was a film of sweat on his face but no other sign he was affected in any way by what he was seeing in the cells and feeling through the instrument on the ledge before him the one he called a pathecorder he saved the central cell for last the one that was larger than the others the one with his prime actors in this bloody drama he watched with satisfaction then apprehension and anger as they struggled to understand what had happened to them cell a bright green meadow cuddled by pointed peaks and a ring of ragged conifers an immense tree grew in the center of that meadow spreading out over half the open space a larger wicker basket lay on its side and a wicker trunk its top thrown back sat beside the basket shadith stepped from the shadow under the tree and walked toward kikun who stood beside the trunk delicate reptilian hands on his nonexistent hips watching rohant the ciocan wrestling with a pair of large black cats roaring his pleasure at being reunited with them ginbiryol seyirshi made a slight adjustment to the pathecorder then he touched the transfertest sensors and shivered with pleasure as rohants currently uncomplicated joy rolled through him and shadiths anger and kikuns less classifiable emotions he touched his tongue to his lips closed his eyes until hed composed his face into its usual calm then he looked up puk pukanuk pousli put an agent on hold turned his head ginny where is the ambush i do not see the locals and they are not registering on the pathecorder theyre flyin in ginny havin to scramble a bit remember were three months early get them in position as soon as possible i will not tolerate sloppy work he watched the action in the center cell for a moment scowling at shadith whod walked over to join kikun that was a nuisance the girl knowing so much she shouldnt know he snatched a quick look at ajeri and puk theyd both argued against bringing her if they thought luck was leaving him theyd come at him like sharks ready to tear into him the moment he let his guard down that was not comfortable hed have to get rid of them and he didnt want to they were satisfactory subordinates say it and see how they jump yes the girl knows my name puk how does she know my name i do not like that she is too closely connected with the hunter i think we must do something about her pukanuk pousli grinned insensibly reacting to the implication of control reassured for the moment that boss knew best if the final scene works out like youve planned it ginny none of them down theres goin to be a problem not less theres such a thing as a real spirittalker dead is dead and theres nothin quietern that chapter so thats what its all aboutmaybe kikun looked at shadith from some unfathomable distance his narrow lined face blank no recognition in his copper gaze as if her appearance triggered something in him he dropped to a squat moved his arm in wide sweeps over the grass with a frogtongue snap of his hand he trapped something small down among the roots held it between his two cupped palms as if he were tasting it with his handskin he shook his hands she could hear small eeping sounds from inside them smell a sudden stench wafted toward her by the crisp breeze he matched his voice to his tiny captive and sang it from terror to a burring calm slowly carefully he lifted his top hand slid it away a small graygreen lizard lay curled on his palm its color his color so it was almost like a blemish on his skin rather than a separate entity it opened whiteringed yellowbrass eyes and stared into kikuns copper irids it yawned he yawned it stared he stared shadith looked round as rohant the ciocan came ambling over to her his cats walking beside him wreathing round his legs rubbing themselves against him your friend there hes weird kikun tossed the lizard to the wind flung himself flat and began rubbing his face against the grass snuffling and biting at it and the earth it grew from rohant yawned brushed at the shreds of dried grass clinging to his dreadlocks what do you expect from a god incarnate huh what m son says lissorn ran across him on a capture run hired him as a guide and brought him back with the load had his reasons no doubt we havent talked about it kikun seemed to explode off the grass he went running about the meadow with the wild abandon of a cat kept shut up too long if thered been walls hed have been bouncing off them opalekismimo she said holy dancer nanilody he said in his home langue clowndancer god what are you talking about what i heard ginny say she dropped onto the grass settled the harpcase beside her and folded her legs in a lotus knot he lowered himself with the smoothness of movement that kept surprising her in a man as big and bulky as he was the cats curled beside him you ready to talk now she squinted at the sky a large hawk was swinging in slow circles over the meadow yours mine ginny went to a lot of trouble didnt he cats hawk he must have carried them in stasis pods i didnt um and snatching you two keeping you drugged so you wouldnt know who had you why my answer depends on yours i dont like talking about well i suppose were in this together and it doesnt matter all that much what that bnaduk finds out i mindride just animals people are too complicated signals clash give me a headache anyway what i mean is when i want i look through eyes hear through ears not mine kikun came ambling back he dropped on his stomach beside her pulled loose a strand of grass and began chewing on it after a minute he spat out the shreds of fiber reached round the harpcase and began stroking her arm shadith ignored him the man who snatched us hes got this pet a simi he likes to keep it around i used its eyes and ears and picked up a few things names for one ginny the boss puk the lute ajeri the pilot this worlds called kiskai kikun wrapped his hand about her wrist rubbed it against his face smelled at it she tried to pull away but his long slim hands were much stronger than they looked she jerked at her arm glared at him an image bloomed in her head kikun and notkikun painted in black and white stripes head to toe dancing with energy and an oddly attractive awkwardness naked and grossly priapic grinning amiably that friendliness a little frightening another image her original body angular phthistic long throat distended though she couldnt hear the song vague figures behind her her sisters dancing the dreams in that song how she said aloud she glanced at kikun his eyes were closed there was a satisfied smile on his face she shook her head pulled her hand free reserving her questions for later where was i ginny right she thought a minute then laid out what she knew of their captors finished you know who he is what hes doing dont you think so about a year ago there was a man come to voallts korlatch in spotchhelspar we deal in rare beasts train exotics for pets and stock hunting preserves that sort of thing though i say it myself we are the premier traders in the field so we have a lot of scouts out looking for new material and a lot of stock on hand the man he called himself zradit do watts he wanted to buy old records from us worlds we looked into where the beast stock wasnt worth the bother collecting which we explained to him were family property and not for sale at any price then he wanted to buy a pair of ritors offered half again what they were worth dont know if you know the ritor hard to keep captive tend to die on you trying to escape about ten times the size of magimeez here he stroked the sleek black head of the cat pressed against his thigh happens we had a pair but they were already contracted for besides we want to know who were selling to we like to know where the beasts are going and how theyre going to be used so we do background checks on our clients he grinned as he met shadiths skeptical gaze it doesnt cost us csezheri on the contrary very much on the contrary those that can afford what we provide are the kind to run like scalded moggies from any smell of sleaze we dont have to pander to the sickheads which suits us just fine if you say so watts was ginny no agent gobetween i can certainly believe that he likes his skin our ginny right but we didnt have much trouble making the connection watts list wasnt long just slimy with ginbiryol seyirshi perched atop the pile we took a good look at what we found and we said no thank you we dont care to deal why whats wrong with ginny besides him being a murderous kidnapping little bastard i mean he sat rubbing the cat behind its mobile ears and scowling at the sky ginbiryol seyirshi entertainment entrepreneur extraordinaire phah the butabek makes snuffflakes torture milked to the last drop his client lists read like a roll of hmm well say a list of those voallts korlatch will not deal with hunting is one thing but slicing up a beast while some mokkus jerks off thats different hes also got a thing for offing children nice huh shadith frowned that doesnt quite he likes creatures more than people the children all right hes weird about children especially girls dont get your backhair up ciocan i believe you it just means hes more complicated than i thought she moved her shoulders uneasily not happy with that idea then shifted focus to another suggestion you said his agent wanted ritors you think hes planning to exchange you us for them or maybe hes running out of victims and wants the world list you wouldnt give him no im afraid not nothing so simple i think were players in one of his limited editions a snuff job on a grand scale if anything that drunk does could be called grand the hawk came wheeling down lit on the trunk wobbled a little then perched there treading the wicker uneasily his eyes fixed on rohant after staring at the bird for a long moment kikun turned to the meadow in front of him pounced on a tuft of grass and came up with a small rodent he jumped to his feet took it to the trunk and tossed it to the hawk rohant scowled dont do that kikun i dont want sassa taking food from anyone but me he wont kikuns nostrils flared as he watched the bird tear into the rodent you me same thing to him he came back and sat beside shadith slender wiry arms draped over his drawnup knees tell the tale shichei ciocan not much left worth telling wars and massacres plagues and you name it he sits up there recording it he growled then spent some time soothing the cats the anger in his voice made them uneasy the hawk screamed and beat its wings kikun chirrupped at the bird and calmed it though it still stepped nervously from foot to foot shadith scratched at her arm scowled three people thats all hes got up there counting him you cant count the mercs or the paems hes got money and drugs and a talent at twisting people given he locates a place in the right mood thats all he needs rumor says hes depopulated half a dozen worlds for what thats worth he spat his dreadlocks moved out from his scalp they say he boils down the death of a people to the peak moments his definition of peak he spat again wiped his hands on his knees his golden eyes narrowed to threat slits as he contemplated ginnys iniquities they say he does one limited edition about every ten years he makes a thousand copies of the show and charges a worldyear income for each and gets it i think thats why were here i think this world is ready to explode and were detonators we

laughed suddenly hes mad as a wish with its foot in a hole hopping you had better walk very soft shadow our friend shadith blinked mindread you can stretch it that far oh no it just come to me things do that now and then then and now he blinked at her looking for the moment as mindless as the little lizard hed held a while ago what is was will be its all here in me in you twiceborn in this also he pulled a blade of grass loose handed it to her she let the grassblade fall switched her stare to the wide blue stretch of empty cloudless sky then hes watching right now hell always be watching listening to everything we say whatever we try hell know it and can counter it before we can do anything kikun shrugged so so tsoukbaraim rohant chuckled bit it off more anger than humor in the sound i figure that doesnt need translating fill in the blanks she pulled her hand across her mouth any little obscenity you feel fits the occasion i might as well be back at the station with that creep herding me what never mind she made a face out of the fryingpan into the ftyingpan well remembering that the little vipers listening any ideas for getting us out of this you know dyslaer no and even if i did hes got plenty of translation capacity in that ship of his its half kephalos she shook her head at the ciocans skeptical grunt eightythree days is a long time thats the insplit count from the station to here id ve gone crazy sitting there staring at the walls so i went mindwalking round the ship picking up whatever i could you never know before the moment what youre going to need when which reminds me i have a sinking feeling if the locals dont kill us he will hell make sure theres nothing left to tie him with this place hes got enough firepower aboard to ash a small fleet nasty stuff including a worldbanger i think looked like it anyway from what ive read boom kikun said his voice was soft and sad doom some say the world will end in ice ice is nice but fire is surer you have said too much shadow twiceborn i said too much when i named him clowndancer all the rest flows from that she stopped talking because kikun wasnt listening any more he was staring fixedly into the empty sky before she could say anything he went limp giggling to himself in some world she had no access to she turned to rohant the ciocan shrugged dont ask me he gets like that when theres a change in the wind he gave magimeez a last headrub and got to his feet you the only one had a look at the lay of the land shadow he scratched at his mustache smoothed his thumb over the dangling ends dio im tired of dancing around the obvious only way off this world is someone comes and picks us up you know i know the one place were likely to find a skipcom is where ginny has his surrogates running this operation and thatll be in the biggest city around which way do we go shadith flung her arms out let them drop east west i dont know either way we get there the biggest cities i saw were on the two coasts mountains she flicked her fingers at the peaks beyond the tree tops i saw two ranges of them one on each side of this continent both of them run northsouth tell me which one were in ill tell you where we go kikun yawned flipped onto his back backtrack the sun he laced his fingers over his rib cage and smiled amiably at rohant then shadith rohant growled irritated by kikuns deliberate obscurity the wind whipped his mane about his head as he thrust his hands into the pockets of his tunic diol why his face went blank he crumpled to the grass shadith swung around three men stood in the shadow of the whisper tree one of them held a weapon to his shoulder he was bringing it round to her she flung herself to one side diving behind rohants body for its minimal protection while she reached for the hawk meaning to send the bird at them she ran out of time the stunbeam swept over her and she went down and deep watcher on the bridge the scenes in the cells kept changing a mosaic of hate and pain and terror cell wicikinkatim nanipotima the street boys chanted faces blacked with mudfilthy dog murdring houndslings whirring petting with pebbles the kipao street guard who backed away

streetsinger looked carefully around set out her silverbowls adjusted the patch over her empty eyesocked and shoved a fragment of wood against the forward wheel of the skateboard she used to get around since she had her legs crushed under a napriests ground car a few years back she settled the kitskew a stringed instrument like a lute on her stumps and began playing a lively air one meant to draw attention to her she knew better than to stay long in any one spot so shed developed her act to make her impact fast miowee miowee its miowee the urchin shed paid was doing a grand job hed got his friends to help they were dancing and clapping and laughing they probably would have done it without pay because they liked her but she never took advantage of thatwhich was why their enthusiasm

paving and sent her skateboard racing down the bolthole shed laid out for herself before she began her song behind her she heard a child cry out she sobbed with rage but she didnt turn back there was nothing she could do nothing but keep singing out her fury and her condemnation of the way things were maybe someday kipaos wouldnt beat children in the streets cell chanting in the oldlangue the line of kampriests dropped incense into the half circle of bronze braziers kneeling on a totem inlay the kawa totem a group of kawa families with infants wafted for the singingin and the smoke blessing for their children suddenly one woman gasped pointed at the streamers of smoke twisting above the braziers them she cried the three do you see them there nataminaho see see beasts beside him there the bird over him and there opalekismimo and there nikamooskinin as she began there was silence then another and another cried out yes yes i see them eyes widened went dark as pupils expanded even the priests succumbed to the general hysteria and saw cell a line of dancers serpentined through the mean streets of the maka quarter acquiring new dancers with every undulation of its ever lengthening body drummers marched beside them tapping out the heartbeat of the dance the support of the song the ancient street song of the pakoseo attributed to the prophet of the first pilgrimmage children ran with the dancers a mob of street urchins blowing crude whistles or swinging bullroarers dancing with the serpent though not part of it women leaned from upperstory windows in the decaying houses throwing down offerings of grain and bits of cloth and colored paper a rain of prayer for fertility and empowerment bands of napriests and pairs of heavyarmed kipaos watched from side streets waiting for the order to break up this defiant and patently subversive festival it would come they knew it they just had to wait until the edge was off the crowd until the miserable makas had exhausted themselves and their passions cell shadith lay cuddled next to rohant both unconscious the cats were slung across the ciocans legs also out kikun sat beside them watching events with his usual detachment they were in a cage made from limbs the site of a mans arm pointed and pounded into the dirt net over the top ropes pulled taut around them and around knotted and reknotted to each of the uprights the hawk flew in uneasy circles overhead having followed the flier that brought the captives to this clearing in a forest of antediluvian trees forty meters across at the base the smallest a hundred meters tall half a dozen men sat round a fire in the center of the clearing several others were moving in and out of the moonlight busy at obscure tasks tvio men stood arguing in low tones stiff with anger sisipin had set long ago natamin was a faint glow behind the tree tops niskikin was a fingernail crescent directly overhead ginbiryol seyirshi ran his eyes across the cells caressed his pathecorder with the side of his thumb it was all going very well despite the girls unexpected talent he wasnt about to let the others see his satisfaction however they worked best with spurs in the ribs he thought about spurs and began to feel excited praisesong soon must be soon yesss in the meantime ainairil is developing satisfactorily puk the pliciks are frightened they smell the hate growing day by day and everything they do breeds more but the farmers and factory workers out on the plain seem reluctant to rebel against the landlords get hold of that man of yours and set up some incidents to stir the yokels out of their lethargy i do hope it will be accomplished more efficiently than the pickup pukanuk pousli nodded the makh hen needs a boot in sometimes hes got his mind on his own ambitions ill remind him he can be replaced real easy he scratched at his nose truth is ginny we cant do better than the head of the nistams secret police theres no one else with his scope at least no one we can get at wed have to try ayawit and his napriests he giggled suddenly that was a good one nolegs got off aynowit thats him all right mean as a snake but he couldnt find his asshole with a map he saw ginbiryol frown at him went on hastily we could try him but i dont know how far wed get dont be absurd we will obtain whatever services we need puk we always do it is only a matter of correctly assessing the price keep an eye on that legless streetsinger i read her as a developing vortex she evokes powerful emotions even a spark of hope which makes an effective counterpoint to the rage and increases the eventual pain he glanced at cell i think we should permit the avators to escape the question and the na priests it will enhance their value when theyve been loose a day or two guide kiscomaskins forces to them i believe the girl will be especially attracted to him she is at base a disruptor luck was truly with us that day she came to us chapter on salemarked down sssh a hand was cool on her mouth kikun she touched it and when he took it away tried to sit up the pain in her head was so bad she nearly bit through her tongue trying to hold in a groan stun rifles here were effective all right but probably not too safe she sat with her head in her hands wondering with considerable trepidation just how mangled her brain was kikun took hold of her wrist shadow he murmured his mouth close to her ear the cats are waking and rohants still under yahhh she breathed if their heads are like mine can you see what you can do about him she pressed the heels of her hands against her eyes and tried to think were in some kind of cage this isnt the first time theyve held prisoners here this things been around a while ahlahlah its cold pouches in here no if those ddabs junked my harp ill i dont know something smells like rain they going to leave us to catch pneumonia gods im wandering all over the place get your head together shadow before you have to pull it out of a cats mouth preposterous gowks putting those carnivores in with us without bothering to tie them down yayah my heads going to blow apart she thrust her fingers into her hair massaged the back of her head a futile thing to do but the breathy broken growls from the cats the scrabble of their claws across the packed earth of the cage floor sent shivers crawling up her spine and tied knots in her stomach especially since every time she reached for them her brain whited out she scowled at the black figures seated by the fire two of them standing and shivered involuntarily as she heard the two on their feet arguing on and on about something she couldnt make out fragments of words in the seried staccatos of the liquidly rhythmic local langue floated to her on the wind one voice itwewe kiscomaskin ptaw another voice gospah ayawit shpikew omish it was about her and the others she knew that it was like an auction in a way as if they were agents bidding for the contents of the cage she squeezed her eyes shut her head was trying to translate the jumble and not quite making it and generating another humungous headache ahlahlah yaeeh forget that shadow think about getting out of here mmh i wonder yesss she thrust two fingers into her boot smiled as she touched the hideouts hilt and the needler was a cool spot under her breast the locals hadnt bothered to search their catchat least theyd left her alone maybe theyd gone over rohant and kikun that pair being more obviously dangerous sometimes it pays i suppose looking like a child she jumped as magimeez produced a coughing spitting snarl sheesh once they shake off the stun the catsll turn this cage into an abattoir no running room in here hardly big enough for the lot of us ginbiryol seyirshi and his limited editions its a farce hes producing that gormless cretin his godavatar heroes are going to be hamburger before the first act begins behind her she could hear kikun massaging rohant murmuring to him with no response that she could detect she pushed onto her hands and knees but froze in place as magimeez lifted her head shook it her ears flattened against her skull her tail switched back and forth slapping against shadiths left arm beside her nagafog was sheathing and extruding his claws his snarls peaking to squeals as pains like those stabbing into shadiths brain ripped into him she smelled rage rising in both cats as their bodies began to respond magimeez was trying to get to her feet her hindquarters were still numb so she whipped around bit at her own flank gods one breathe two breathe three breathe pussshhhh here we go round the ambury bush ambury lambury diddledee hussshhh out of the cradleendlessly something where did i hear that i know its not mine one breathe two breathe three breathe pussshh turning and turning in a widening something sorrow is a forest of black widows red bellies shining there was a time when i believed in gods all right shadow you can do it reach focused at last she plunged into the hot red brains of the furious hurting cats took hold of them locked them down then spent the next minutes soothing them comforting them working away their pain losing her own pain as she worked rohants hand closed on her shoulder impatient at the interruption she snapped leave me alone five minutes will you she didnt bother lowering her voice she wasnt thinking about the cage only about the cats she continued to work with them until they were relaxed and purring like idling dynamos then she sighed and sat on her heels all right what is it company rohants voice was dry all expression squeezed out of it he was rigid with fury musk rolled off him in clouds pungent and aggressive the kind of aroma that was an assault in itself old lion he doesnt deal well with cages when the bars are round him not one of his beasts cant say i do either company she turned her head a weedy looking reject with a straggly beard and mustache was leering at her through the bars a silver tooth gleaming in a looselipped mouth he wore a big felt hat with round silver medallions linked together for a hatband in fact he had silver hanging all over him linking and tunking in time with his twitches shimmering in the light from the sliver of a moon starting to slip from view behind the trees he had enough knives to supply a knife act was cradling a pellet rifle wore ammo strips over both shoulders the loops decorated with silver wire yukh what a winner if hes got notions he can forget it im not going through that again hmm wonder who that other one is he comes from a different litter thats for sure a second local stood a step behind the silvercreep a solid square man with a hard knotty look and the eyes of a fanatic under shaggy brows that jammed against the heavy vertical crease in his forehead he gazed with contempt at his companion then at shadith and the others his lips pressed into a tight line silvercreep scratched at his jaw taneshinisashoyaakilaam his eyes lingered on shadith but he turned to rohant for an answer when he finished speaking he wanted to know what their names were affronted by his dismissal of her as a person of substance acidly amused by her reaction she decided to keep her mouth shut and let rohant do the talking besides she didnt feel like telling that weed anything his mane brushing the net pulled tight over the top of the cage the ciocan loomed like one of the giant trees over the weed who tried to control his squirming but couldnt quite manage it after a thick silence the dyslaeror spoke in his deepest voice mola i dont know you with the implication i dont want to know you then shadiths mind completed the shift between langues and she started thinking in east kiskaidish or awenakis the indigenes name for the dialect silvercreep snarled hoitytoity beeeg man wont be so big when the gospahs screws get finish with you gospah whos aid head hoofta of the local religion rohant looked at him long and cool then he grinned baring his formidable tearing teeth he folded his arms and looked down his long nose at the man kikun squatted by the ciocans left knee fluttered his hands and giggled with a glare and a spit silvercreep swung round and stalked off the silent one the fanatic stared at the three of them another minute or so and continued to say nothing then he strolled slowly off toward the fire shadith watched him start talking at silvercreep arguing with him continuing the argument shed seen them having before this bit of playacting that was sweet she scratched at the skin between her thumb and forefinger they didnt bother searching me should the occasion arise ive a paao needier with lethal loads and a braincrystal knife what you think one of them belong to ginny dont give a shit rohant wrapped his hands about two of the bars and tried to shift them but they were set solid changing his attack he tested a claw on the heavy rope grunted with satisfaction when he pulled severalthreads loose what i want to know is whats their transport and how do we get hold of it want me to look round his ears twitched in the twin sharp jerks she was beginning to associate with embarrassment obviously hed forgotton aobut her talent he scowled along his shoulder at her do it dont waste my time asking kikun winked at her she felt a flush of warmth almost affection for the little lacertine it startled her and suggested something rather chilling had ginny been running his fingers through her head knotting in ties to keep the three of them bound together she resolved to think about it later when she had time for playing with whatifs she gave magimeez a rub beneath her chin settled with her back against the uprights and closed her eyes there was a complex web of smalllives living around the clearing but most of these were tucked away for the night she extended her reach sweeping through wide arcs finally touched on a bigeyed moth hunting gnats along the dark the broadwing saw in the infrared supplemented by a complex radar system and her tiny brain sorted through the gusts of data she sucked in with surprising efficiency shadith had trouble translating the impressions into something she could use but once the adjustment was made she found the flight so absorbing she almost forgot what she was supposed to be hunting for she went swooping through the dark with the prowling moth in and out among the trees soaring on muffled wings that read the air currents so exquisitely they beat just once or twice a minute only speeding up when she rushed down on a swarm of prey insects after a few minutes the moth swung across a creek that curved about the glade without coming into it there were immense congeries of insects buzzing about the waterweeds and suckerplants growing on the banks she plunged into those swarms feeding avidly a sudden burst of heat drew her like a magnetheat radiating away from the cooling engines of a grounded flit an open flier capable of lifting a score of thinnish males there were some assorted lumps in the back that might be their luggage good to knowif true the moth played in the thermals like a child dancing in wavefroth forgetting her hunger in the exuberance of her tiny joy shadith slid reluctantly from her mountand almost vomited at the reaction as she crashed back into her usual senseset while she was struggling to reorient her brain she heard someone shouting she paid no attention until kikun wrapped his fingers around her arm shook her lightly murmured her name shadow shadow she forced her eyes open shuddered then steadied as the world settled in ordinaryness about her what youre being summoned twiceborn the fanatic was standing by the bars holding the harpcase this is yours girl still dizzy from her moth flight she stepped over the cats and stopped a handspan from the bars to stare at him after a minute she said yes good he shoved the case between two of the bars take it play she caught it as he let go why the crease above his nose deepened his brows squeezed closer persuade me to stop kwantawiyal selling the you to the napriests he produced an angry smile since youre new here maybe you dont know them take my word for it you wont like them she hesitated she had a strong suspicion he was right about the priests but performing for this bunch of she turned to rohant he was stinking like an angry civit eyeing the fanatic as if he were a bloody haunch he was about to take a bite out ofall of which gave her no help kikun touched her arm let her feel the urgency in him all right this puppy wags her tail for you hope you know what youre doing clowndancer she dropped to the ground opened the case when she had the harp the way she wanted she began playing snatches of danceries and balladins shed collected in her wanderings the time twenty millennia ago when she had her first body and was free to go where she would for a while despite the pressure she felt from the listener outside the cage she couldnt settle to anything more but when the fanatic knocked against the bars with the hilt of his knife she pulled herself together and played a uejasoh stomp all the way through then a herkulkana jokesong that was intransigently untranslatable since it consisted entirely of puns that only worked inside haarakiena the music was laughters mother despite his dour expression the fanatic tapped his knife hilt in time with the beat and when she finished he snapped thumb against forefinger hissed his pleasure and asked does that thing have words yes but theres no way i can translate it you satisfied you can play can you sing i dont know any of your songs sing she stiffened once again kikun touched her arm calming her hmm theres a thing i came across on a green world a lot like this a lost world she paused and smiled sweetly at the fanatic to make sure he caught her meaning going wild fast seeding out whatever you want to call it songs called mad maras lament who mara was i have no idea the man who taught me just knew the song and liked it he was a man with a penchant for hurting women she paused again smiled at him again then shook her head now that didnt come out quite right what i mean is he attracted and was attracted by women whod been hurt im going to have to switch langues i cant translate on the spot like some you want to know what it says ill tell you after she checked the tuning played through a verse to catch the mood it was slow and sad lovely in its simplicity then she sang o wild wings fluttered in my head and wild thoughts muttered there in waking dreams i saw you dead your body rent your throat gone red your splendid thighs ripped bare i cannot sleep cruel love memorys my mourning dove cuckoos call out horned maid see your faithless lover fade all oaths broke all hope betrayed o wild wings fluttered in my head and wild thoughts muttered there in waking dreams i felt you near your honey hands the words you said in my willing waiting ear i cannot sleep cruel fair memorys my roan nightmare cuckoos call from everywhere lovers oaths are writ on air o wild wings fluttered in my head and wild thoughts muttered there her voice rose in a final mournfilled cry she broke it off flattened both hands on the strings silencing them for a minute she couldnt speak she cleared her throat forced her mind back into the awenakis said huskily satisfied he wiped his hands down the front of his jacket jerked his head up and back his long fair hair dancing in the wind there was a yeasty excitement in him that she didnt trust a softening almost a change of face youll have to learn kiskaid songs are you a quick study depends upon the material she cleared her throat again and the inducement i see while she was singing silvercreep had walked over to the cage he was leaning against the bars watching her from squinted eyes the fanatic got a grip on his arm and hauled him away to the fire took up the argument again shadith wiped off the harp eased the strings and settled it back in the case after shed snapped the catches home she looked up well she said rohants eyes were red slits his ears were fficking back and forth as if he were fly ridden she smelled the rage on him again part of it was turned on her anooristi he snapped at shadith toh anth wha oh he was back in interlinguewhat did you find where is itthis jumping from langue to langue was starting to scramble her brain which was in no great shape to begin with not since ginny then the locals started booting her head about she glanced round there were a number of locals staring into the cage they looked away rather than meet her eyes but showed no sign of moving off reason enough for caution she rubbed at her brow sighed theres a stream i think um i dont know its difficult i think its over there on the other side of the clearing far enough into the trees that the firelight doesnt reach it theres a flit tucked away in the brush beside that stream i think it was almost impossible to be sure with the kind of eyes i was looking through i think our gear is in there which is good if true case youre interested i can tickle a lock with the best he gave a shout of laughter shook himself university cant know what its missing hmm you think these ddabs are ever going to sleep shouldnt ye stirred them up so much well thaaank you so glad you enjoyed my singing didnt say that he wiggled his heavy brows and smiled at her mouth shut mustache tails liftingnot the grin he gave silvercreep tooth baring was a threatgesture among the dyslaera not a pleasantry he waited another beat i did though youre older than you look i told you that yeh but i didnt believe you its the sort of thing kits always say theyre putting more wood on the fire seems like they plan on staying a while waiting for the highbidder to arrive i suppose could be he looked up produced a peculiar fluttering whistle sassa came swooping down flew over the cage at another whistle he went spiraling up again to perch among the fronds of the tree top good bird i raised him from the egg braincrystal knife hmm should cut through that wood like cheese theyll have a sentry posted what kind of a shot are you adequate for the occasion lots of occasions it seems flattery what do you want he laughed slapped his leg i do like you little cat lovely claws youve got there remind me of miralys when she was a kit toerfeles vanity vanity thy name is woman well true so let me use the needier she caught hold of his hand measured her own against it i dont know its so small you wouldnt even feel it he gave her a smoldering look i can handle little things you think so huh know so all right she yawned im going to snatch some sleep wake me whe she yawned again aahhh when its time chapter fugitives a cold drop splatted into the hollow at her temple trickled into her eye another hit her mouth shadith sputtered sat up sar she reached for the harpcase shifted it until it was standing upright pushed between two bars presenting the minimum area to the wind and the rain swardheld built tight and strong but there was no point in putting unnecessary strain on his work the night was a black felt blanket thrown across the glade the fires light made little impression on it she held her ringchron close to her eyes and clicked her tongue when she saw what it said shed only been sleeping an hour more drops hit her a flurry of them the wind coming through the bars was chill and damp it cut to the bone the locals were running about as if the storm had blown in out of nowhere as if the clouds hadnt been piling up all eveningand they were completely ignoring their prisoners rohant dropped to a squat beside her he was shivering but trying to ignore it he wasnt dressed for the weather and dyslaera were savannah bred used to dry heat and dust his eyes shone red like bits stolen from the embattled fire as they watched shadows chase each other about the glade while the fire sizzled and smoked and threatened to go out and the locals struggled with wind gusts and an unwieldy tarp trying to hoist it over a rope theyd tied to staples driven into two of the trees city boys he snorted like a bunch of ants you kick over their hill more flurries of the icy drops hit shadith in the face went trickling down her neck tsoukbaraim she scraped the wet out of her eyes pulled her shirt together at the collar and glared at silvercreep who was yelling invective at his men while they fought the canvas and the wind and tried to pin the tarps edges to the ground with a handful of wooden pegs after they got the improvised tent anchored solidly the locals went rushing about the glade collecting their blankets and the pile of firewood the rain started coming down steadily the wind driving it at a strong slant shadith thrust two fingers in her mouth and produced a whistle that knifed through the storm noise hey she yelled what about us they ignored her treated the whistle and her screaming like windhowl and forgot it as they built a new fire under shelter of the canvas and left the old one to drown in the rain well that shows what were worth sar bless us three pneumonia and catarrh and misery a few minutes later one of the locals came out a smaller piece of canvas wrapped about him shoulders rounded the wind at his back snatching at him making him unsteady on his feet he crossed the glade to the cage and settled himself on a root of the nearest tree out of reach but close enough to hear them if they moved or spoke rohant leaned down his mouth close to shadiths ear the needier you think itll penetrate that tarp with this wind i dont know to say true ive had it less than a year just took a few practice shots on a calm day she peered at the huddled figure of the sentry a blot barely visible in the rapidly diminishing firelight at about twice that distance a needlell go through an inch of hardwood i never tried it on cloth so i dont know anyway i doubt it would reach him from here its too light to carry well against a blow this strong his fingers beat against his thighs he whistled an irritating twonote dirge he was close enough for her to feel the shiverpulses shaking him we wait he said finally let them get to sleep it shouldnt take long shadith smiled atthe red glint in his narrowed eyes tell you what ro take the cats over with you and you and kikun and them clear out my way and ill operate on a couple those bars it rains much harder you can walk right up to that ddab and tunk him on the head before he knows whats happening shadith stretched out on her stomach and felt at the bars near the ground because she couldnt see much more than black columns barely blacker and more solid than the night they were slick with rain slimy with debris from the slow rotting away of the outer layer of wood she sucked on her teeth and thought about that a minute take it slow shadow old girl or youll be without a hand ahlahlah this mud is ice she pushed up laid her left leg out straight and drew the knife from the bootsheath holding it carefully away from her she eased herself onto her stomach slithered to the chosen bar and set the cutting edge against it wrist resting on her fist so she wouldnt tremble she applied pressure whisper bit by whisper bit a shake at the wrong time or a shift off the horizontal and the blade could whip back on itself and slice her hand off slowly slowly the knife sank into the wood cutting through the bar like a hot wire through butter when the blade was nearly through she let go of the hilt sloshed onto her back and lay massaging her wrist her arms and hands shaking she tucked her hands into her armpits and lay with her eyes closed the rain beating on her face until the worst of the tension was out of her on her stomach again she braced her wrist eased the knife from the wood and stopped her hand immediately one she said aloud she dealt with the second pole in the same way then slid the knife into the wood again before she tried getting to her feet so she could make the second cut in each of the bars two she said she was cold stiff suddenly and desperately tired but she wasnt going to get warmer or more comfortable so she lifted onto her knees then pulled herself all the way up when she felt ready she bent down retrieved the knife and braced herself against the next bar over set the edge against the wood and started the freeing cut three she turned her head called to rohant any interest in us none so far she could barely hear him through the rain she moved cautiously to the second vertical making sure of her footing before she shifted her weight again she braced herself against an intact bar and laid the knife against the wood she closed her eyes a moment before she began this last cut this was the dangerous one this was the time when patience frayed and caution ran out slow and slow the knife moved through the wood slow and slow and slower as it neared the far side she forgot the rain the cold the locals everything but the knife the blade oozed out of the wood she stopped it held it steady for a moment using the bracing bar as a support she sank to her knees eased around until she was sitting in the mud when the knife was finally back in its sheath she started shaking all over she tried to say something but her teeth were chattering too badly and she couldnt talk rohant got to his feet crossed warily to her moving more quickly when he could see that her hands were empty he scooped her up took her to the place where hed been sitting and slid to the ground his back against the bars ive warmed up this patch of mud he said no use wasting the heat he held her until her shaking stopped murmuring the liquid purring nonsense hed used with his children she tilted her head looked up at him its done pressures keeping the sections in place but a kick will knock them out whenever youre ready she yawned murmured drowsily cut the ropes she yawned again when youre ready she nestled against him she didnt want to move she didnt want him to move the rain hissed down a steady soporific drone the wind groaned and moaned through the trees whined across the glade boomed against the canvas of the big tent darkness was a blanket wrapped around her head but she was content to feel the strength and cradling gentleness of the arms wrapped around her she didnt need to see them the minutes slid past the camp settled deeper and deeper into sleep rohant sighed shifted under her time to move he murmured mmmmnnnn not yet staggering a little because his legs had gone to sleep the ciocan surged onto his feet lifting shadith as he rose he shifted his grip on her set her on her feet you dont stand up its mud in the face tsoukbaraim no doubt someday youll have to tell me what that means whatever she reached inside her sodden shirt brought out the needier and thrust it at him here take this you mights well have it wind doesnt seem like its going to calm down for a while yet theres a clip on the butt itll snap onto wherever you want to put it for safekeeping its a present from a friend so dont lose it he snorted but took the weapon without comment a deeper darkness in the darkness of the night his outline shifted as he ran his fingers over the needier the reached inside his tunic and clipped it to the cloth he lifted his head there was still enough light coming from the second fire under the canvas to wake the phosphor in his eyes they shone with a fugitive crimson as he smiled down at her so time is a low whistle came from the darkness shadith started swore shed forgotten kikun again the lacertine was a blot down low against the bars he seemed to be staring toward the guard someones come out of the tent he said hes a little behind the guard now talking to him hanh hard to be sure but i think hes just cut the guards throat hes coming here now huh listen she heard the chains rattling on the cage door someone was there working on the padlock she reached out tasted with her talent the fanatic ahlahlah looks like he lost the bidwar thats one way to recoup steal the prizes yaiii thats bright as soon as the fanatic had the door open hed turned a blinding flare on them obviously not worried about trouble from silvercreep and the men in the tent out he shouted at them his voice was gruff tight the only evidence of his tension the fullmouth tonguedance of the local langue went mushy with the stiffness of his lips dont try games one will kill you before one sees you go to the gospah rohant cleared his throat spat to one side what do you want his deep growl was surprisingly easy to hear through the storm noise which was just as well since he was taking no trouble to be heard the wind whipped the answer back at them one means to take you to someone if you cooperate we can go easy if you want to make it hard hard itll be he backed away from the door but kept the light fixed on them come out now bring the cats with you stop soon as youre out one will tell you where to go then switching to interlingue rohant said if we let him get us away then he broke off as shadith pinched his arm what he understands interlingue i can feel him react to what you just said to what im saying now dio kikun strolled past them went out through the opening and stood waiting for them shadith sighed here we go again plans down the tubes all that work wasted ah well tie a knot and go on wheres that case ah she slid the muddy strap over her shoulder and followed kikun after a minute rohant growled and followed her with the fanatics flare lighting the way they moved quickly through the trees despite the rain and wind and the treacherous thorny canes of the amtapishka vines that sprawled in furious complication between the root gnarls canes the wind whipped about their ankles like sawchains shadith was very glad of her boots and amused despite her predicament by kikuns skipdance as he adroitly and effortlessly avoided the thorns he had even less trouble than the cats who loped along unconcerned though they were still not liking the rain much the flit had its canopy pulled over and one of silvercreeps men was visible through the translucent bubble curled up asleep in the back the fanatic made them crouch down beside it where they couldnt be seen when he was sure rohant had the cats under control he rapped on the canopy ocsipishopasti shadith wrinkled her nose as the click failed to happen and the word stayed a collection of nonsense syllables thats not in the vocab ginny put together for us its either obscene or a password maybe both there was a sleepy grumble then a hatch opened in the canopy and a tousleheaded local looked out the fanatic shot him waggled his gun at rohant you hunter pull him out he snapped move rohant didnt move im going to bring sassa down stay loose will you what is this sassa bird raptor the hawk came dropping through the trees perched on the canopy you see rohant got to his feet hauled the dead local out of the flit and tossed him to the ground arms crossed over his chest he faced the fanatic anything else get the bird away from the flit and keep it away from one if you want it alive he comes with us like the cats the fanatic stared at him his face deeply shadowed illuminated by the dim light coming from inside the canopy and the backleak from the flare i see you and the others move away from the flit take your livestock with you dont make me shoot the noise might bring company none of us would like i repeat i will not allow the gospah to have you ill kill you if i think kwantawiyal is about to get his hands on you expressionless and silent he watched them move away from the flit when he considered they were far enough off he stopped them and backed toward the hatch without taking the gun or the light off them he sat in the opening and drew his legs up then maneuvered himself inside hunter come here climb in and sit at the offseat put your hands on the board and wait he gave rohant no chance to jump him and when the dyslaeror was in place he called shadith then kikun getting them into the flit was tricky and difficult but he managed it without losing control over them which considering the storm and the darkness and the cramped quarters was an impressive feat of juggling hunter call your beasts one humors you for the moment but if you wish them alive and intact dont push rohant snorted staccato whistles repeated in groups of two brought the cats leaping inside he settled them by his chair where they lay grooming each other happier than theyd been anytime since the rain began he had more trouble with sassa had to land him on the rim and walk him inside announcing his disapproval of all this with short sharp cries and ruffled feathers but pleased to be out of the wet sassa let rohant coax him onto one of the seats with no more than a token protest the fanatic pulled the hatch shut and locked it the space under the canopy filled with the smell of wet fur and feathersand the angermusk boiling off rohant singer the husky hoarse voice brought shadiths head around what do you know anything about these machines why me he answered with iron patience being female and a child you are less apt to let pride lead you into foolishness well i can fly this one yes give me a minute to look over the board do it she tapped up the lights nodded to herself export job not much more than three buttons and a lever as foolproof as you can get probably sealed drives unit replacement when something breaks wonder how long its been since anything on this piece of junk has been replaced clicking her tongue with disgust she ran her fingers across the stained and gritty board carefully notthinking about what those smears were made of flicked on the drives and listened to the whine build up louder and louder with an ominous beat in it that set her nerves twanging she started to say something clamped her teeth together at a loud yell from outside two locals came from the trees and rushed at them swearing under her breath she fed in some power and felt the flit wobble as the ragged drives began lifting them slowly too slowly off the ground despite her misgivings when she saw one of the shadowy forms raise his rifle she turned up the feed the pellet ricocheted from the nose of the flit went screaming away then the drives kicked in the lift suddenly accelerated and the flit went surging into the tree tops breath catching in her throat she managed a nervous laugh nothing like a little encouragement she took the flit crashing through the springy fronds as more pellets went whinging off the sides or whistling through the canopyone cut a hot line across her arm sar the lumbering flit was a beast to fly with all the responsiveness and airworthiness of a mud turtle but she wrestled it a bodylength above the fronds and brought it to a precarious hover over her shoulder she said where now you see the compass of course so its corrected for these latitudes and true north so you dont need a deviation chart do exactly as one tells you put the nose on and proceed along that line until one tells you to turn again a lot more than i need to know you makbee minkha deviation is your problem no sweat for me lust give me the line why southwest kikun said we should head east the coast is that way i dont want to go away from the coast we need to get to that city whatd ginny call it ah ainairil someones going to have to do something about this idiot someone i suppose thatll turn out to be me yayah that crease burns got to get a bandage on it when i have a minute im leaking like a dripping faucet blub blub gods who knows what filth is getting into my blood shadith brought the flit around flew for a few minutes longer on manual listening to the laboring of the drives this thing sounds sicker than before you think those ddabs mightve hit something the fanatic settled his gun on the armrest it flies forget the rest there was a throaty purr in his voice he wasnt trusting her an antiquated inch but she thought she could feel him developing a kind of proprietary fondness for her hmp she waggled the lever clicked her tongue as the ottop refused to engage she repeated the shift several times feeling about for the catch it finally kicked in with a lurch and a shriek that made her wince thats the question friend how long its going to keep flying one will deal with that when one cant avoid it any longer she shrugged winced youre pulling the strings right now tell you this if i think its about to blow im not going to ask permission to land im going down i have no desire to end up splattered across a mountainside he clicked his tongue but said nothing she touched the crease looked at her fingers blood lots of it the drip wasnt slowing down any looks like im still getting the backside of ginnys luck hand clasped about her arm she swung the chair around those our pouches back there by your feet why theres a first aid kit in mine id like to get a bandage on my arm before i bleed to death also some antiseptic that bunch back there didnt impress me as any too clean he thought about that a minute i see all right come back slowly and show one everything you touch she grimaced stood up swaying a little as reaction hit her why why do i keep running into these damn doubleknotters he sat brooding as rohant cleaned the wound for her and sprayed a bandage on it why are you here the three of you he said suddenly she looked up what why did you come here we didnt no no its the truth we were thrown here only thing we want to do is get the hell out help us do it and you dont have to worry about us being used who brought you here i dont know how should i know when i dont even know why it happened all i know is someone snatched me and dumped me here i never saw him i dont know who or why she waggled a hand at rohant patient and silent beside her at kikun crosslegged on the floor if you want to know about them ask them i never saw them before we woke up in that tree rohant had left off smelling angry he was amused now probably by the fluency of her lies ahlahlah the things that come out my mouth im going to have no character left at all when this is over i wont even know what the truth is oh well needs must where the devil drives whered that come from something i picked up from lee sounds like the kind of thing phony rustics are wont to spout to each other in bad triddas i see he says that all the time i think it means he hasnt a clue whats happening talking about clues whats all this business about one this and one that i cant figure the rule and theres nothing about it in the imprint local variation hah shadow old girl youre cracking up this is no time for fussing over pronouns when one tells you change course put the nose on thats almost switching ends going right back where we come from not really weve avoided a place its dangerous to fly over a protected area kanaweh wont bother with who we are they dont know us so wed be ash and bone before they thought to ask questions much better to circle round oh northeast it is i hope you know what youre doing one has survived forty years of this i know turn now the flit whined on through the night the drives hiccuping and beating jolting them up and down though the air was smoother as they left the storm behind the winds fell and the sky cleared at the end of the first hour he called out a new course sending the flit directly east at the same time he made her drop it down until it was barely four meters off the ground the three moons were all set by now and the stars were thin in this region with few first magnitudes visible but they gave enough light in the clear sky to make that skimming flight possible without having to turn on the baselights which she was happy enough to do without infected by the tense wariness she felt in the man staying this low with obstacles continually popping up she had to keep corn herself she didnt trust the ottop it was hard her stomach cramped with hunger she hadnt had anythingto eat for she didnt know how long her arm was aching like a sore tooth even her hair felt tired theyd moved into a heavily developed area so the strain never lessened she circled past factories with their attendant villages farms being triplecropped with barracks full of laborers villages snuggling against the walls of the ispisacos the bighouses of the plicik landlords other villages that were huddles of small houses set up at crossroads and on the banks of the three rivers that the flit crossed and recrossed as it labored eastward its course like the trail of a snake with indigestion in addition to the detours forced on her by the topography the fanatic was calling out a change of direction every ten minutes or so working from landmarks and some system he pulled from memory kikun whistled a short sharp sound startled shadith snatched time to look over her shoulder what get us down fast as you can or boom were ash right she glanced ahead frowned at the broad river curving back across their course the village tucked into the bend there were lights coming on in the windows of the small houses though the ispisaco was still dark except for the servant warrens up under the slates there were tangled brakes down near the water and scattered groves on the banks a narrow rutted dirt road ran along the top of the high solid levee on the left side of the river it was deserted now but it looked like it might be heavily traveled during the day patches of fog hugged the ground and drifted above the water complicaring her search for a place to put down where they could stay undercover if they had to she wiped at the sweat trickling into her eyes ro you can see better than i can pick a spot the flit lurched the drivewhine peaked went silent for a second then picked up again listen to that hurry man im ahead of you csecse spotted one already turn south we want to get away from the village theres a broke down wharf couple warehouses some shacks right straight ahead go on on now down when the flit was finally grounded she breathed a quick sigh of relief collapsed the canopy and lowered the powerfeed to a trickle not quite daring to shut it off completely because that might be enough to trigger an explosion she swung round well the fanatic switched on the flare twisted its beam to a thread of light that played on rohants face hunter your companion how accurate are his instincts why ask me a dry chuckle one has the feeling your answer might be more reliable got a point there kikun runs on his own rules from what my son tells me if his lifes on the line hes pretty damn accurate i see over the side hunter take your creatures with you he smiled a weary grimace warm with unexpected charm if you decide to vanish theres not all that much one could do to stop you but then one would have to break the set one would have to kill one or more of your companions one would rather not do that when rohant his hawk and the cats were overside he turned to kikun now you kikun set his hand on the rail gave him a look like a lepidopterist inspecting a substandard moth swung over and went to stand beside the ciocan singer collect your belongings and anything else thats loose whatever you think might be useful and pass it out to your friends when shed finished that he sighed now child come here well go overside together no shadith scrubbed a hand across her face she was so tired her brain was on strike but what she had to say didnt need all that much celebration listen im not playing games this isnt about getting away from you he looked skeptical it was logical enough he had a gun on her how could he believe anything she said never thought id miss ginny the crud he might not have a clue about people but he jumps fast and accurate where his skins involved i like lice by which i mean your secret police who as per usual are not so secreti like them about much as you do i suspect she said i dont want them on my neck when ive got no chance to run and we will have them on our necks unless we get rid of this flit its a beacon saying here we are come get us besides i want it to be somewhere else when it blows i see whatve you got in mind i take the flit up set the ottop ditch myself in the river and swim out you could help by giving me a course so itll do least damage to your people she brought her arm round in a sweep to take in rohant kikun herself and one that will maximize our chances of surviving he got to his feet back along the river set the ottop at about twenty iskals inland theres a royal enclosure the iskota estate if it gets that far without exploding itll be shot down which means the search should be concentrated there its an obvious target for an attack by what they call terrorists the kanaweh if you didnt know those are the nistams security police your lice theyll be out like ants ones contribution to the field of insectile simile swarming round the estate with a little luck well be beyond the bounds one must concede it singer this is a good idea he glanced at the sky theres less than an hour till dawn youd better get started she sweated out the lift got the ottop engaged more by will than skill slapped the go button and went over the side it took her forever to hit the water when she did she wished she hadnt it felt like her ankles broke she went in and down her arm hurt shed forgotten the wound she couldnt get any pull with that arm the current seized hold of her rolled her over and over until she didnt know up from down a blinding light she struggled toward it her head broke surface she gulped in air and water began fighting toward the light she knew what it was now the fanatics flare shadow rohant his arm came under her he was on his back kicking powerfully she collapsed against him let him tow her the current sucked at them it wouldnt let go they were being swept down and down a shout kikun something hard and rough slapped against her started pulling along her body rope she felt rohants body convulse and drop away from her he still gripped her tightly he was dragging her across the current now water was in her eyes her mouth she didnt know what was happening until he managed to find footing and start walking out carrying her chapter myth before breakfast with chill dawn drafts eddying around her like scalpels probing the places where theyd hurt the most despite the dry clothes and the blanket shed pulled around her shadith sat shuddering with depression and fatigue in the corner of the shack she hated her feebleness she felt like some fainting miss falling out at hide n seek but she just couldnt go any more much of the time she stared at the dead smelling dirt of the shack floor dirt she could barely see and wallowed in uselessness but when she was at her most morose she flagellated herself by watching rohant kikun and the fanatic that epithet didnt fit any longer but she had no other label for him bustling about collecting wood for a fire and castoff tree fronds to drape across the rafters and stuff into wall cracks so fliers passing along the river wouldnt spot light leaking through the rotted out places in the roof and walls the fanatic had put his gun away somewhere inside his clothes as if he were embarrassed by it and was toting fronds into the shack with an amiable determination that amazed her it would have amused her if shed had any humor left in her they finished with the fronds and went out pulling the ragged door shut after them leaving her in there with the wind whistling through the cracks in the walls and a young fire in the far corner that flickered and threatened to go out but never did she watched the feeble uncertain flames shiver in the drafts and thought if fires could feel that one had to feel about like her left behind with her sassa perched in the rafters waiting for rohants permission to hunt while the hungry fractious cats stalked about the shack like shadows snatched from the fire rohant brought in an armload of boards torn off the other shacks knelt beside the fire breaking them over his knees and coughing stopping now and then to wipe his nose coming into the river after her had finished off his immunities looked like he was in for a long hard cold she ground her teeth and wallowed in guilt kikun came in with his arms full of fat tubers he used a knife a hefty baynet that hed acquired from somewhere not one of hers to loosen the dirt then he scraped out a hole with a piece of board until it was big enough to hold the tubers he covered them over built a smaller fire on top of them and went trotting out again resilient as a length of graygreen rubber water weariness hunger cold they rolled off his back and left him untouched it was more than depressing it was disgusting the fanatic brought in a dripping can of river water left it by rohant then went to squat in the other corner on shadiths end of the shack looking from her to the dyslaeror with a bemused faintly amused expression on his square face his forearms rested on his knees his hands hung empty before them he seemed tired but content you asked me why were here she said driven by an impulse born out of a growing distaste for her own mentations i think you know more about that than we do rohant sneezed grumped under his breath as he got to his feet he called sassa held the door open for him whistled to the cats and went out with them prowling at his heels the fanatic rose stretched then went to the door and stood looking at the sky i wonder if its blown yet the flit i dont know you said twenty iskals you know interlingue how longs an iskal little over a kilometer say one and a half thirty kilometers she flattened her hand on her leg scowled at the ringchron and more than an hour since i went in the river even if it wasnt shot down it shouldnt ye lasted this long odd we didnt see anything i didnt know maybe it hit ground first she yawned rubbed at her forehead maybe it missed the estate altogether and its still going whatever its not something we have to worry about any more talking about worry why are a clutch of outsiders so important youd kill them before letting them out of your hands he didnt say anything for several minutes then he sucked in a long breath and let it out slowly still saying nothing he turned from the door moved across to the fires and laid wood on each finally he stood with his back to them his face in shadow his hands clasped behind him you ask a difficult question seems simple to me that my dear girl is because you dont know anything about us ignorance is a great simplifier i had a master said that once i poured peppersauce in his tea she giggled sobered so kikun came in with a battered pot hed collected somewhere some heavy wire and an armload of smooth stones which he arranged in a ceeshape at the edge of the larger fire he scraped part of the coals from the fire into the cee and laid the wire across the stones filled the pot from the can and balanced it on the improvised grid setting the water to boil after adding wood and reshaping both fires so they burned more evenly he moved a short distance away dropped to the dirt and sat watching the other two the firelight turning his eyes to orange lava shadith raised the harpcase on end tipped it over so it was leaning against the wall she rearranged herself curling up with her back against the case despite the drafts the fires were beginning to warm the shackand herand shed turned the curve on fatigue passing the point when the need to sleep was overwhelming if she didnt move much or try to push her thoughts too fast she was all right for the next hour or so she yawned blinked at the door kikun had left open a crack the darkness outside had lightened to a steely gray and the sounds of dawn were coming in to her bird twitters a honking bray a motor coughing its sputter muted by distance maybe rohant would be back soon with meat to add to kikuns tubers and brew shed stopped feeling hungry but she knew her lassitude came partly from lack of fuel in her system you should sleep shadow you can eat later i dont want to sleep t m too tired to sleep tired huh im tired of scratching and scrabbling and it making no difference i plan and do and it turns out a waste of time like with the guard and then those bars well you couldnt know that ahead of time and if things hadnt turned out like they did what you did wouldve got you out of a mess i suppose so you cant read the future take a cue from ginny and trust your luck all right all right so see what you can squeeze out of our resident local he can probably tell you something about why ginnys doing this to you and rohant and kikun youre good at not answering questions she said i suppose you dont want to tell me your name but give me something to call you i dislike very much having to say hey you when i want your attention even if its only implied my name is shadith he walked to the door pulled it shut came back and settled onto the dirt beside her shadith he said does it have a meaning its the name my mother gave me it doesnt need a meaning very good at avoiding answers in this place answers kill people sidestepping becomes a habit which one means to keep well honed his eyes drooped halfshut need one say kwantawiyal knew one not a quick flowing gesture his hand sweeping from head level toward the floor i am not so memorable a man as to make recognition immediate however with a wry twist to his mouth he spread his hands dropped them on his knees one is called asteplikota aste for those who prefer less of a mouthful it is ones personal name since ones family has cast one out it is the only name i own aste it is she blinked sleepily at him i did notice that you didnt seem to fit very well with silvercreep and his collection of sweepings im flattered silvercreep he was loaded with it asteplikota chuckled in every sense true well doing it again eh he shook his head ah habit someone i owe a favor wanted an agent he could trust to act for him he said hed heard rumors something important was going to happen and hed bought rights to be in on it from kwantawiyal urn silvercreep one does like that name it catches so nicely the essence of the man a brief smile charming shy his voice was quiet musing a pleasant gravelly tenor its roughness comfortable like a wornout old shirt no one sane and with a modicum of intelligence would trust him to stay bought one was along to keep him honest though hes a lot more frightened of the napriests than he is of us wed only kill him the holy screws well he didnt want one along but he was too greedy to refuse the sponsors gold there you are shadith moved uneasily tsoukbaraim im starting to like the man thats a complication it was easier when all i had to do was lie up a storm and get the hell out its obvious what happened was ginny pulling the strings and making the puppets dance that someone hes talking about hes either ginnys man or in ginnys net somehow what do i tell this aste him knowing about ginny wont change anything ginnys watching us now bastard watching me twist in the wind somebody has to do something about him killing a world to titillate gaah admit it shadow moral indignation isnt in it you want to put the boot where itll hurt because the ddabs leading you around like his pet simi and it kills your pride i hate being helpless i loathe being helpless all right all right all thats given settle down woman informationyou need information cant make a plan till you know the parameters she shifted her legs they were going to sleep on her a hiss came from the fire the water was boiling kikun reached under his tunic brought out a handful of herbs and dropped them into the pot he contemplated them a moment fetched out a dry stick and began stirring them a faint herbal smell drifted over to her she sighed folded her hands across her stomach all right were important why because you mean hope to people who have none and where there is hope there is a will to change present evils for future goods which means those now in power will do anything they can to coopt or kill you but why us were alien even different species whatve we got to do with you and your people one said it was a hard thing to explain try you were jabbing at one about this being a lost world back there at the cage when you sang that song by the way when theres a moment youll have to translate it for one yes yes so we know we were born as a species on this world that we came here as fugitives he looked down pulled a finger along the dirt beside his buttocks funny once upon a time it was a lifetime ago almost one was a teacher a historian and a writer of histories a dangerous occupation these days he straightened his back a distant look came into his eyes this is how it was across the shack kikun took the pot off the grid and set it on the ground he pressed his palms together and leaned forward a matching distance in his gaze as if he followed asteplikota past time into myth in the time before time there was only oppalatin dreaming that he was there was no beginning and no end no time no shape no life only oppalatin dreaming in his dreams he conceived himself and brought himself into being and when it was so he knew that he was alone and being alone conceived the other he contemplated the other then he spoke you are kotakin i have created you and kotakin said you have created me i am notyou and kotakin wept because he was separate and greatly alone oppalatin saw and was grieved oppalatin said i am your uncle you are my nephew go now and lay out worlds for me and make creatures to dwell on those worlds and i will give you the lifebreath to breathe into them let there be a world where i may contemplate myself and dream without disturbance let that world be called yahwihakai which is my glory let there be a world where you kotakin may contemplate my greatness without disturbance where you kotakin may bring such as may please you to make on that world a garden of tranquillity and joy let that world be called nahelikai which is garden of the blessed let there be four lesser worlds for the life to come kotakin went and did this and he returned to oppalatin and said thus and so have i done is this according to your plan oppalatin contemplated the work of kotakin and was pleased he said it is good you have done a great work nephew but your work is not finished go upon the first of the lesser worlds and make a woman and i will put life into her kotakin stood upon the face of the lesser world he said i name you pitamaskai earth drew apart from water sky from ground and the world was solid around him he took clay from the bank of a river and shaped a woman from it when he fin ished he took breath from oppalatin and blew it into her mouth he said i name you nitahwaikis shewhoplants kotakin gave the woman a blanket a white blanket with a thread of black woven through it he told nitahwaikis you will do thus and so nitahwaikis took two lumps of clay from the river bank and lay them upon the land and lay the blanket over them she sang the creation song over them and took the blanket away when she uncovered them two beings twins sat up they sang who are we why are we to the one on her left shewhoplants said you are tahnokipo waposh you sing the world into steadiness it is your duty to see that order and extension remain go now about the world and put your hands on it so it will have substance and shape tahnokipo waposh left her and traveled through the world and through it again singing it into order and extension he sang the mountains into shape sang the courses of the rivers sang the rock into long slow being to the one on her right shewhoplants said you are shapostim mayah you sing the world into movement and change it is your duty to see that the winds blow when it is time and water flows go now about the world and sing without ceasing to wind and water and all things that change shapostim mayah left her and traveled through the world and through it again singing into movement all things that by nature moved from pole to pole pitamaskai resonated to his song wind and water moved and sang the greatness of oppalatin the creator then nitahwaikis moved aboutpitamaskai creating trees and bushes plants and flowers all kinds of seedbearers and nutbearers to clothe the earth giving to each from the breath of oppalatin in the same manner she created all kinds of birds and animalsmolding them out of earth and spittle covering them with the blanket of oppalatin singing the song of creation over them and sharing with them the breath of oppalatin kotakin went to oppalatin and said behold pitamaskai lives oppalatin saw how beautiful it was the land the plants the birds and animals and he was pleased he heard the quick bright song of shapostim mayah the slow dark song of tahnokipo waposh and he was pleased he saw the woman nitahwaikis laid on her face before him worshiping him and he was pleasedhe said it is good it is very good oppalatin said it is time kotakin lie with the woman and make children with her that they may grow and tend the world and be companions for you and worship me kotakin went unto the woman and put his seed in her on the first day the day called payatanwahash or the day of the earth she bore nataminaho the hunter he dropped from her womb fully formed when she put him to her breast to suckle him his teeth tore her flesh and she cast him away crying out in pain he landed in soft warm mud and crawled beneath a shakan bush and slept for two days when he woke he was hungry hecalled out for nitahwaikis but she was not there he stamped the earth in his anger and tahnokipo waposh cried out who is moving what should not be moved nataminaho stopped stamping he considered himself standing without moving for a day and a night he brooded over who it was that stamped hare came hopping past nataminaho smelled the blood in him and remembered his hunger he seized a stone and killed hare and ate him when the bones were bare he looked at them he looked at the stone he cried out i am nataminaho the hunter on the fifth day the day called niyotansahash or day of the winds nitahvvaikis bore opalekismimo the holy dancer he dropped from her womb eyeless and unformed she lifted him and tried to make him suck but he had no mouth he wriggled against her and wept with his body from a hunger he could neither endure nor end day melted into night and night into day and still he wept and still his voiceless hunger grew nitahwaikis laid him on the sacred blanket but he wriggled off she wrapped the blanket about and about him and rocked him in her arms and called out to oppalatin to give him ease kotakin came to her in his left hand he had white clay in his right hand he had black ash nitahwaikis took the blanket from opalekismimo and held him still upon the earth kotakin smoothed white clay over the blindworm baby covering him from end to end with the black ash he drew broad bands around opalekisnino so he was striped black and white where his face should be he drew eyes and a nose a mouth and ears he drew arms and legs fingers and toes nitahwaikis spread the blanket over opalekismimo and sang the creation song when she took the blanket away again opalekismimo jumped to his feet and went dancing and dancing and dancing until the wind shook with his dancing shapostim mayah cried out my winds are shaking out of their courses who is shaking my winds opalekismimo stopped dancing he considered himself he looked at his feet and his hands he touched his mouth and his eyes he flung out his arms and laughed i am opalekismimo and i dance after that he went back to nitahwaikis and suckled like any ordinary baby on the thirteenth day the day called milawehtansahash or day of blessings and coming together nitahwaikis bore nikamooskinin the girl baby dropped from the womb small and neat and fully formed when she touched the earth she tore up fistfuls of it and ate it like it was porridge and when she could eat no more she sang and sang and sang her song resonated with the earth and the earth sang in her her song raptured the winds and they came from the four directions to spin about her and sing their descants with her tahnokipo waposh cried who shakes the stones and the earth who makes the mountains dance when they should be still and seemly shapostim mayah cried who tears my winds from their proper courses and sings them dizzy asteplikota stopped talking when rohant came in carrying a bloody piece of hide with a lump of meat wrapped in it the cats following him looking sleepy and content sassa swept down and landed in the doorway with a small rodent in one talon he shivered his feathers settled his wings and began tearing at his catch rohant sneezed sputtered dropped his burden by the fire and began unwrapping the hide over his shoulder he growled flits going past like swarming blackflies why it took so long to get back we had to duck for cover every second step asteplikota rubbed at the tip of his nose swarming looks like someone wants us a lot rohant began cutting the meat into small chunks and threading them on pointed sticks leaning the sticks against kikuns stones when he finished loading them how come they know its us or do they oh yes how kwantawiyal all he had to do was get into a treelodge and make a conical once he finished describing you whoever he called would be as hungry for you as your cats were a couple hours ago for anything with blood in it mm rohant finished with the meat began scooping coals into the cee and feeding more wood to the fire broken pieces too dry to smoke what kind of detection equipment do your kanaweh use he laid the sticks across the coals scooped water from the tin and washed the blood off his hands bodyheat motionsensors visuals a combination of some or all of those we need to know he wiped his hands on his trousers straightened up asteplikota scraped his hand across the dirt beside his thigh frowning depends on what theyve been able to buy from offworld traders and thats classified information there isnt much leaks out of the kastathats security headquarters last month i heard they hung some poor sotch for talking out of turn we try but its rind squeezings and sludge nothing worth trusting to kikun dug into his pouch brought out collapsed cups memorplas compressed into a dense rod he broke off a section twisted it open dipped the cup into the infusion and carried it across to shadith she looked at the murky liquid looked up at him just what is this supposed to be good for you energy youll need it we moving tastes all right youll see i was still a babe when i learned what goodforyou meant she grinned at him oh all right medicine works best when it tastes bad give it here she sipped at the warm drink grimaced it was about as foul as shed expected but it slithered down her throat and warmed her and swept away the clinging fatigue that weighed her down mind and body the meat was bub bling and charring sending out smells to tempt the dreaming oppalatin and she was suddenly very very hungry ro what he said well think about it shadow standard search grid over the target area sweep along obvious goroutes whats more obvious than a river it shouldnt take kikuns visions to tell us we need to move fine time to be bringing that up now whynt you say something before we hit ground one i didnt hear you making any objections girl two you told me and kikun shitall about what you and aste here were planning to do with the flit had all i could do to fly the damn thing and keep my eyes open same time she set the cup down brushed her hand across her face depressed again i dont know why im fussing we can turn and twist all we want but ginnys pulling our strings we cant get away from that he takes a notion he can bring all hell down on us roh ant stretched growled thats your bones talking shadow get some sleep kitcat shadith snapped thumb against finger my bones are just fine thank you youd better see to that meat before it burns meats all right he coughed turned his head spat hmp with a pinch of luck we can flip this around sooner or later someones going to take a look at these buildings unless its a circle of beaters moving out from the estate he glanced at asteplikota the local shook his head glad to hear it makes things easier probably a squad in a flit then or a boat four five six men we can handle that if we work it right and we get transport out of it he took the cup kikun handed him scowled at it then drained it in one long gulp dio thats slop he sniffed rumbled with satisfaction as his nose began to clear and the fatigue washed out of his body works though thanks kikun shadith sat up ante this is your world is the ciocan right we have a chance of breaking loose asteplikota smiled at rohant his eyes sinking into a web of wrinkles you think like my brother ciocan yes singer the kanaweh arent all that bright you know intelligence is a handicap in a headbuster he looked up as kikun came across to him with a third cup he took it without comment drank it and set the cup down his attention drawn from the meat he was tending rohant looked over his shoulder showing his teeth in a sketch of a challenge grin your brother huh we get a minute i want to know about him kikun those tubers about done wed better eat now times running out on us too damn fast to be fussy the powerboat came down the river buzzing like a swarm of elephantine mosquitoes the noise announcing it several minutes before it appeared a squat black bug crouching close to the water it curved over to the sagging wharf dumped out four halfarmored kanaweh who yelled and swore as the rotten waterlogged timbers gave under them and threatened to drop them into the muck below their leader leaned back put his feet up pulled his helmet visor down and prepared to doze until the search was finished stretched along a wide flat branch in the thickly fronded tree growing close to the shack theyd sheltered in part of the dense tangle of trees vines and thornbrush behind the abandoned landing rohant worked his mouth the drooping tails of his mustache twitching in derision as he watched the men blundering about visors carelessly pushed up they were just going through the motions convinced this search was a waste of time the ciocan winked at shadith who was perched on the next branch over dragged his sleeve across his dripping nose then darted two of the kanaweh as they rounded a corner and moved out of sight of the othersa dart in each face inchlong translucent slivers that drove through flesh and bone and exploded poison deep into the brain when the men dropped without a sound he looked at the tiny weapon raised his brows he gave shadith a tightmouthed grin and rubbed his thumb across the polished wood inset in the grip a small silent accolade shadith eased her finger away from the trigger sensor of the stunner tucked the tube into the fan of frondlets before her on the branch rohant went back to watching and waiting for another shot at the kanaweh stripped to his dry rough hide kikun strolled away from the cluster of buildings and walked along the ruts to the wharf shadith looked at him found herself looking away forgetting him looking back startled each time she saw him his hands were empty he had no weapon nothing visible anyway she looked away again forgetting him again as she heard yells of anger and disgust then a rattle of shots from the largest of the crumbling warehouses one of the searchers came out kicking vermin from around his boots cursing them he shoved his pelletpistol into its holster gave a mangy lump a last kick dyesh mikka tank where the hell are you nobody in this dump but chasakin mitsish the second kana came out of a shack brushing cobwebs off his arms eheh he glanced toward the wharf saw kikun step into the boat kekwa shouting as he ran he lunged toward the wharf shadith lifted the stunner waited not trusting his aim at that distance with the unfamiliar weapon rohant tapped the darter to spray and swung the line of darts across the face of one runner then the other dropping them in midstride in the boat kikun was behind the driver as the kana jerked awake the lacertine took his helmeted head into an enveloping embrace twisted sharply shadith winced she was too far away to hear the crack but she felt it in her own neck with a continuation of the neck whip kikun flipped the local into the river on the shoreside used a boathook to shove the body under the wharf where it got hung up among the rotting piles shadith and rohant swung down from the tree and started toward the boat as asteplikota came hurrying out of the tangle behind them carrying their pouches and shadiths harpcase the two cats loping beside him watching him with the amiable speculation of sated carnivores sassa spiraled into the sky and circled overhead waiting to be summoned asteplikota joined the other two as they stopped beside one of the bodies that was the last easy thing he said as he shrugged out of the tangle of strapping when they find these dead there will be no more lazing on the job no doubt shadow you and kikun load up the boat get the cats settled get it ready to go aste you and me well clear up this refuse he strolled to the corpse coughed and spat landing a gob of clotted mucus on the turtle armor bulging over the dead mans chest well put these bodies under the wharf with the other one give us a bit of luck they wont be noticed for a while long enough for some lead time i take it it wouldnt be a good idea to be found with kana equipment on us right on the other hand we dont want anyone wondering whos that in a kana boat the cats can go under a blanket but we better have those helmets we can leave them with the boat when we leave the boat we cant ride it all the way to ainairil theres too much traffic go through their pockets for their money its anonymous enough and we could need it mmh grab his feet will you lets move twenty minutes later they were on their way going full out down the river riding the edge of disaster since shadith didnt dare explore the instrument board she didnt know what the riverbottom was like asteplikota lay back in the seat beside her his eyes on the cloudless sky scanning for the flits rohant had seen earlier kikun sat in the back with the brewpot between his feet it was sending out wisps of steam and a thickening green smell eyes glassy faced flushed to a dark copper as his cold took a deeper hold on him rohant sprawled beside kikun the cats leaning heavily against him he was coughing and sneezing between sips at the brew after a while he slept she turned bend after bend the boat droning through a bluesky morning and an increasingly busy countryside hundreds of flits zipped back and forth like lie blackfly swarms rohant had called them they ignored the boat but shadith could see grounded flits and men stopping trucks on the levee road other flits dipping down at what looked like random intervals so kana could search groves and farms factories and anything else that caught their attention at first the search was disorganized chaotic but as time passed it tightened up and she began to wonder just how long they could go on unmolested the river was wide and muddy the current was frighteningly powerful a giant hand grasping the keel as the traffic thickened she slowed and as she slowed that current took on a demonic perversity and seemed bound to smash her into something there were barge strings around every curve there were freighters and tankets fishets sailers even rowboats there were snags and shoals bridges and wharves trouble and trouble and trouble on and on kikun fed her more of his brew the taste didnt improve as it cooled but it kept her going on and on rohant woke briefly several times grumped under his breath cleared his throat and spat overside into water went back to sleep on and on there was an air of desperation about the flits swooping overhead but none of them seemed interested in the kana boat no matter how erratically it raced down the river on and on turn soon kikun said yes asteplikota said wed better get off the river where what side left into the wetlands theres a branch should appear soon there now watcher cell the fire bloomed in the dark sudden as a sneeze a naked man painted in horizontal stripes of dusty black and chalky white rose from the ring of painted men who raised a noise of rattles and rattling drums that seemed to lift him off the ground nata kata atahao they sang in the oldiangue kiki kiska kiskelita the dancer scooped resins from the spirit pouch and flung them into the fire with passionate intensity in every line of his body flung himself into leaps and cartwheels the capers and caprioles of his sacred dance the ring of men swayed and chanted in unison breathed in unison even thought in unison napriests came from the trees in black cowls and black leather pellet rifles in their blackgloved hands sunk deep in their outlaw ceremony the celebrants saw nothing the dancer saw nothing but the grand images of the dreamgods a black hand lifted the rifles snugged against black leather cheeks the hand fell there was a rapid spitting volley the celebrants fell over between one breath and the next dead before they knew they were shot several of the napriests gathered the bodies into a pile while the rest of them vanished into trees there was the shriek of chainsaws and other less definable noises then the priests were back with chunks of wood which they piled around and over the bodies they emptied half a dozen carafes of fuel over the pyre and tossed matches at it in silence as intense as the chanting and the dance they squatted and stared into the fire until the pile was ash flesh and wood alike cell pakoseo pakoseo pakoseo the serpentine grew and grew as it wound through the workers quarters and burst into the streets where the tawa merchants had their clan houses the tanak and maka folk would not have dared this intrusion even a month ago but the pakoseo fervor was building among the despised and disenfranchised and beginning to catch among the young in the more advantaged castes shy and a little afraid young tawas male and female alike slipped from the dullfaced tawa compounds pakoseo ribbons fluttering in their hands tambours tied to their belts and sashes they caught hold of tanak and maka hands they wouldnt have touched in ordinary times and raised their voices in the driving beat of the dance pakoseo pakoseo pakoseo cell a twowheel racer went roaring and squealing through the filthy rainsodden streets of the laborers quarter in the factory town called alomapoy when it came to the town square the rider reached back slashed at the cords binding the bundle on the rack then went racing off leaving the mutilated body of the kipao sprawled on the worn cobbles cell his ancestors had dug the room lined it with stone and timber then laid plaster frescos over the stones images of rites that excited him desperately when he first saw them and realized what they promised he found the place by accident of rot and worm stole money from his father to hire a tanak tramp to repair the panels and restore the secrecy killing the tanak wasnt very satisfying he was so ignorant those days hed known nothing he used the frescos as a crude guide and buried the man folded in fetal position beneath the hearth he hadnt read the books yet he hadnt heard the secret god whispering in his ear he hadnt known about becoming or hitsa or how hitsa could help him become he hadnt known who he really was that he was nataminaho the hunter being reborn from the flesh of man the eye followed him recording his satisfaction as he marked a girlchild as his next sacrifice recording his impatience as he waited for the proper moment to take her it was not yet time to move openly his time would come to him gods voice told him she would come and it was so he collected her like a ripe fruit took her to the room and followed in loving detail the ritual he had derived from his reading when she was at last near her peace he took her beating heart from her body and ate it slicing it thin as paper and roasting the slices over the ritual fire consuming the hitsa with her heart drawing into himself her purity and her strength taking another step toward the great transformation the god voice had promised him a pakoseo year and it was upon them even now everything the voice had promised had come to him he was very happy when the heart was gone he wrapped the child in a clean sheet took her out into the night she was an empty vessel if he burled her as he had the tanak she would begin to draw back into herself the power he had taken from her he dropped her in the ditch took the sheet back to the room and burned it it didnt matter what happened to her leavings she was empty she had played her destined role and all that was sacred in her lived in him now cell a little girls body lay sprawled in stinking water and rotten weeds she was naked and shed been beaten until her face was a pulp broken ribs glistened white and yellow through the mud and putrifying meat her torso was ripped open from pelvis to just above the heart which was missing and there were other mutilations at the moment mercifully hidden by the mud and broken weeds drapped over her corpse she lay undiscovered for several days then a farm laborer came past on a tractor intending to get a field ready for planting he saw the body fell off the machine and waded into the ditch he eased her up out of the mud and slime wrapped her in a bit of canvas and took her to the village the villagers gathered around him wordless their anger so deep they could only moan and sway a woman came pushing through them uncovered the body she screamed tore at her hair her face her clothes her sisters and the other women led her off when she was inside her house the men of the village took the childs body to the lspisaco and banged on the great door their heavy somber blows the dead childs knell there was no response this time thered been none the time before or the time before that they didnt expect any they took her head and her hands and left the rest of her in silent accusation cell the thin wiry man was pacing about the command center with the furious energy of a fruiting tornado as he listened to the reports coming in from assorted sources kwantawiyal lost them hes been disciplined and is hot to go after them we have promised him a bounty for each head if he brings them in alive there is nothing in writing so that is no problem a patrolboat on the kinosipa is about an hour overdue with its callin five kanaweh crewing it wisake no wohtin the nisec a slug him been disciplined so often hes worn a rut in the cage but youknowwhos his uncle we have attempted to establish contact but we havent been able to raise him since he was in the grid seems likely his continued silence is directly connected with the explosion that occured just before dawn at the iskota estate the flit that exploded was reduced to shards as we reportedearlier but we did manage to locate a section of the drive pod with a serial number we ran it through the log its legit flits registered to one napechiko a kawa in a twoboat fish village named wanshin about thirty iskals north of ainairil its a junker he rents out to whoever comes up with the price the last one being a gutterbait gobetween of even less worth than the flit guess who eheh one kwantawiyal tests are still being made but it is becoming clear that there was nothing organic in the flit when it blew it is possible therefore that the patrol came across the fugitives and was killed by them the nisec being our favorite slug wiseacre theres not much doubt of it most likely those terrorists have taken control of the boat and are using it to escape the search grid we are combing both riverbanks for evidence this happened so far there is no result from that investigation cell the squat black powerboat surged past a long string of barges swept round a bend and went into a wild slew as asteplikota saw the branch he was looking for where the ancient delta was once where the presentday wetlands began shadith fought the current clawed her way back to the mouth of the branch and started down it slowing as quickly as she could so she wouldnt run aground before she got far enough from the river kinosipa the trees closed in over the boat and the pov dipped lower the stream was sluggish a greenishocher brew that looked solid enough to walk on the boatworked north along the edge of the wetlands as the sun passed zenith and crept toward the western mountains it was twilighta stinking steamy twilight under the giant ferns and the squat spongy palms with their festoons of moss and tangles of vinewhen they reached an islet of fair size relatively dry with thick grass a cluster of trees and even a small clear stream they piled out of the boat unloaded it stood arguing for several minutes then kikun turned his back on rohant and walked away he stepped into the boat reversed the water jets until it was clear of the mud then went scooting away from the islet vanishing almost immediately into the murk hands on hips shadith stood looking after him then she shrugged and went to join the others setting up the camp pukanuk pousli scowled at the cell swung round ginny should i give the makh hen a yell you dont want that bunch runnin loose in ainairil theyre too hard to handle long distance ginbiryol seyirshi looked up from the pathecorder not yet and not when they are with asteplikota i prefer to keep him out of the hands of the nistam or the gospah he is the planner the balance wheel the rebellion will sputter to nothing without him that is so obvious he thought why do i have to keep saying it ah well it is the nature of the beast if he were smarter he would be unusable no puk kiscomaskin needs his brother if the avatars decide to go with plikota to the islands until the stir dies down we will let them keep running the islanders have no skipcom for us to worry about and time is a thing we have plenty of if the avatars break off and head for ainairil then you may inform makwahkik where they are so he can pick them up i will expect you to see that plikota is sent on his way unharmed that might be touchy sir what if that little bitch starts dumpin what she knows hell be spooky as a threelegged rabbit i think you will find he cooperates with whoever is sent to draw him off he is a modest man but a clear sighted one he knows the weaknesses in his brother he knows how much he is needed to keep kiskomaskin steady discretion puk you know whom he would be most likely to trust arrange for such an individual to be available if he is required yes sir ahh one thing i might mention the makh hens gettin resty he wants us to pin the avatars for him quash that immediately inform makwahkik that we will withdraw completely if he presses us hes not goin to like that he dont follow the bit he got a hard mouth on him you must simply be harder puk i trust your gifts in that direction once the point has been made however you may sweeten him with a personal handarm and slightly more advanced surveillance equipment than we have provided before tickle his ambitions and he will quickly forget the strings yes sir chapter history for dinner as the sun went down blackflies gnats and other biters rose in thick clouds with them came flocks of small hairy fliers who went swooping through and through the swarms sucking in the insects like whales straining plankton out of seawater yet even they scarcely made a dent in the hordes more and more of the biters appeared as if the air itself squeezed them from the dark shadith scratched and slapped then pulled a blanket around her and huddled close to the fire privately mourning the absence of bugbombs and silentscreamers technology might have its drawbacks but meeting nature face to face wasnt all that great either she waved the endbit of a dried frond back and forth before her face and squinted across the fire at asteplikota pakoseo she said what is that i know this much its some kind of pilgrimage he looked up from the pot where he was stirring the soup he was making from the remnants of supper history lecture yeh about the pasesomethingumwapal something long like a river pasepawateo mitewastewapal from the godtongue the godtime it means the time of dreaming and desire when lightning strikes the heart whered you hear that about and about ill talk about that later she whipped the frond fan back and forth taking out her irritation on the bugs and air its your turn professor she dropped the fan in her lap give us your lecture historian tell us whats going on here asteplikota moved the stirstick round and round the pot and frowned at the fire so lecture as requested five thousand years ago the people came here to escape the chaos of dissolution a thousand worlds pulling and tearing apart the omniskaal empire we were out on the edge fair game to any warlord with the power to take and hold us those who could left there were three ships in our lot do i need to tell you their names right nataminaho opalekismimo nikamooskinin we came here not by choice we came trusting to fate which almost killed us we were flying on fumes when we landed we fled and found and thought we were safe it was a cold world harsh everywhere except around the equator we landed where we had to and marched south it was a terrible march and only a tenth survived it myth tells us that nataminaho hunted for us opalekismimo found the path and led us along it nikamooskinin sang strength and endurance into us sang the worst of the evils away from us it is possible this is sign for the captains of the ships i dont know theres very little written from that time for a thousand years we lived there in those highwalled fertile valleys and fiords we prospered and spread out and we exiled into the icy northlands anyone who disturbed the peace of the wealthy and the powerful we sent our criminals and rebels to that high plateau with its monster glaciers we sent them to die off where we wouldnt see them suffer and we shot them if they came back we lost a lot on the hard trek south books technology history sometimes i think we lost our souls at the end of a thousand years everything changed the sun kicked into a new phase it was suddenly much brighter much hotter the ice began to melt off the northlands the lowlands became unlivable even before they flooded the powerful claimed the mountain slopes then the mountain tops fighting to keep their hold on the riches they saw as their right they were not given to flexibility as far as they were concerned what had always been would always be bit by bit the rest traveled north and tried to claim land there the difficulty was the northland wasnt empty any longer the exiles were there the pliciks they called themselves yes our present day landlords and rulers they were nomads hunters trappers herdsmen the melting of the ice nearly destroyed them before they figured out how to change with the changing land at first they killed the people coming north they had centuries of hate to purge then some plicik had a bright idea andmade slaves of the newcomers used them to help him and his clan not only survive but prosper that first wave became the maka caste they were mostly landless workers whose only value was the strength of their backs and arms kept ignorant and unlettered because they were more tractable that way and thus more valuableuntil the floodtime when there was no more room for them and they were stripped of value and discarded they are still ignorant and unlettered the powerful may change their faces but never their natures fifty years passed a second wave went north these became the tanak caste farmers and fishermen miners and smiths skilled laborers like the maka they were men who worked more with their hands than their minds they could read and write and cipher but had little interest in book learning beyond that bare minimum they lost their value like the maka had but reclaimed it in the north as slaves the pliciks had learned not to waste good sturdy workstock there were two other waves before the southland was finally abandoned to heat and floodwhich happened several centuries after the change began the third wave were the merchants the tawa caste they were not made slaves they negotiated their way in in the fourth wave were the priests officers administrators landowners the rich and influential the kisar they bought their way in this is how our world wags shadow no slaves now but kisar sits on tawa tawa on tanak and tanak on maka with pliciks atop them all with one exception the islanders the exiles created exiles of their own banishing folk to island chains off the coasts the remnants from the parts of the northlands that got drowned the islanders do not permit castes and they take in fugitives from the pliciks and the priests rebels the disappointed the disaffected whoever wants to come naturally they dont do this out of altruism they are not saints or holymen they do it out of a profound hatred for the mainlanders and for profits sake they tolerate no one who cannot earn his way either with a skill or as a weapon against the pliciks and the priests i would not say it to them because they could not hear or understand it but in their way they are nearly as rigid and oppressive as the pliciks and the caste system dont worry shadow there isnt much more i am winding my way to the explaining of the pakoseo year rigidity has its strengths and its breaking points near the end of the first millennium after the flood a prophet arose among the people he called himself oplanikamon gods singer and he cried out against the evils he saw around him it was a time of famine and terrible storms and great corruption among the pliciks and the priests he sang his visions so powerfully that those who heard him saw them also nataminaho opalekismimo and nikamooskinin stood behind him and guarded him and set their seal on him the people saw visions and believed him he sang of returning to the holy time the firstflight time returning to the beginning and recreating virtue with the three striding before him he led the first pakoseo to the landing place walking across the land going from nation to nation and gathering in the people taking them with him to the place where the ships came down they tended the place and made it beautiful they sang and saw visions and went home again andwho knows whylife was better for a whileno more slaves for one thing im skipping over a lot all you need is the outline and the understanding that what happened was wholly beyond the control of either the priests or the pliciks they took bitter bloody measures to stop it and they could not the question and the secret police in each of the five nations tried to stop the pakoseo and they could not people left their villages their farms their businesses their jobs they traveled in a great river across the land they were shot axed hung imprisoned beaten tortured they suffered hunger thirst exhaustion thousands died but more thousands came and finally there were not enough soldiers or prisons to hold them the prophet walked with the three through the five nations and brought the people to the landing place and no one could stop him five nations wapaskwen where you are now we here have control of the landing site the mistiko otcha cicip there are also kwamitaskwen in the central plains kwamaskwen north plains swamiskwen south plains south coast and nakiskwen on the west coast except for small differences in dialect they are much the same the nistams loathe each other theyre bitter rivals but they stand together against internal and external threats its why the islanders never try invading the main its also why rebellions have never succeeded before now lets see what else is there the pakoseo year happens when it happens the priests and the pliciks always try to suppress it they never succeed then they try running in front of the swell and turning it to their advantage that generally does work eventually it happens in times of anger and suffering three years ago there was a plague in ainairil and a dozen other cities outbreaks in all five nations at approximately the same time and in all five nations the pliciks and their sycophants ran for the country and left the city to the dying which spread rage and despair among the people who couldnt get out and among the factory workers and farmers when the priests and pliciks brought the plague with them thousands died before the sickness went away as mysteriously as it came the signs and portents arrive with the rising rage of the people prophets appear and call for atonement poets sing subversive rhymes students rebel and children go wild destroying and killing people dream of the three some see them walking the whisper starts pakoseo pakoseo pakoseo last harvest festival the gospah ayawit proclaimed the pakoseo year he didnt want to but he had no choice its been three generations since the last but our souls remember and when the time comes we know it and we walk the insect horde grew quieter as the night got darker and older they werent flying about so much instead they crawled into every crevice and ran on any bit of exposed skin out in the murk around the islet there were coughing grunts howls peeping cries hoots splashes and other less identifiable noises shadith sipped at the broth from asteplikotas pot and frowned at rohants back the dyslaeror was standing at the edge of the islet sniffing and hawking to clear his head and staring down the stream where kikun had gonenot that he could see anything except the occasional glimmer of moonlight reflecting off the leaden viscid water he felt her watching him coughed spat into the water and came back to the fire hes probably in the belly of some crawler he shook his head vigorously to drive off the crawling biters dio asteplikota there any kind of bugoff in your gear asteplikota looked up startled out of the unhappy memories his minilecture had provoked what never mind we couldnt be that lucky he dug out another blanket scrubbed it over his face and arms snapped it through the air to shake off smashed and clinging bugs pulled it around his shoudlers as he dropped to the ground shadow that talent of yours how far can you stretch it youre that worried about him he should have been back an hour ago all he meant to do was ditch the boat soons he found a good spot sink hole or something like it maybe he got lost you cant seemuch of the sky and one muddy tree looks a lot like another muddy tree even in the daylight he doesnt get lost lissorn says its one of his talents he shook his head again violently not in negation but to send his dreadlocks flying and drive away the biters that were crawling after the moisture in his nose eyes mouth can you find him keep the flies off me and ill try i think wed better not talk about limits the air has ears remember dio he got to his feet stretch out and give me that fan she lay for a moment doing nothing just enjoying the freedom from buglegs and the coolness of the dirt then she began considering the mechanics of this operation she was fairly sure her talent wouldnt operate much beyond the local horizonunless she had a mount she was specially tuned to sasso hes handy and he has a raptors eyesight she felt around for the hawk comfortably filled with fish lizards and hairy fliers he was asleep in the tree that arched its fronds over the fire and concealed its glow no he doesnt know the terrainif you could call it terrain being its mostly water and muck horizon hmm i doubt kikun went that far anyway once he ditched the boat hed have to walk the glop back here hes not lazy hes not stupid either local forms will have to do the job for lagniappe get more data about this gunge we got to travel through she reached without trying to touch down just setting the direction in her mind getting a feel for the envelope of life about her all that practice in the ship had honed her skills until she was sharper than shed been any time since she acquired this body and its talent ginny monsters good for something funny its hard to think about him as a monster hes so i dont know so commonplace theres nothing grand about him just a little man yeah with some weird twists in his psyche forget that shadow you got work to do she touched one of the furwings a female her cheekpouches were stuffed with the bodies of insects if archetypal patterns held true here she was taking her catch to her nest so she could feed her offspring it was the time of year for births or hatchings no births as far as shadith could tell the local warmbloods werent mammalian but did birth live offspring undeveloped not quite marsupials but close she slid deeper into the brain and looked out through furrys eyes she didnt try to control the little creature it was going in the right direction that was enough for the moment ahlahlah i was right one gloppy tree is just like the next no sign of people aste didnt say anything about people living in here hmm plague in the cities i know what that means ginnys fingers twiddling in the stew plague tsoukbaraim it hadnt got to me not really what he plans for this world rohant said i believed him in my head not my gut gods its sickmaking hes using us to make it worse weve got to get away from here lee do i wish you were here you and gray and swardheld and anyone i could dig up if we can just get away maybe itll scare him off weve got got got to get away the furry dipped toward one of the pulpy trees she was heading for her nest with a mindsigh shadith slid out of her and probed about for another mount she brushed past a number of wispy animal souls but nothing she cared to seize on until she sniffed out a grumbling hunger sliding along beneath her she dropped and nudged inside the slithers brain the beast was mostly mouth with row on row of snag teeth like a slowly revolving saw as one set wore out another marched into place he was sinew and gristle six tentacles rippling powerfully driving him through the water faster than the boat had gone his eyes were as primitive as his teeth but his nose was extraordinarily subtle reading scent streams as easily as she read print she slid more firmly into that section of the brain and for the first time began picking up traces of kikun scent traces lingering on the surface of the water her excitement made the slither nervous he jerked about briefly then sank into the mud and sulked shadith swore calmed herself and began soothing him because he was hungry and hunting and anyway had the attention span of a gnat he forgot his pique and went back to his cruising he darted his head to one side caught a fish chewed it once or twice and swallowed without a pause in the beat of his tentacles he kept on snatching chewing swallowing the rambling stream was a soup seething with life kikuns scent traces were fresher with every beat of his tentacles fresher and fresherand then gone with some difficulty shadith disengaged from the slither hovered until she felt her reach melting on her the pointthrust of her mind getting set to snap back into her body she groped about for another mind a land mind nothing nothing then a flat warty hopper like a cowpat with legs she slipped into him it was like trying to squeeze into a tootight dress that brain barely qualified as more than a switching station the hopper had almost no longterm memory and no more than a few concepts which were on the level of thishurtskeepaway and thistastesbadleavealone sense data flowed through him without lingering his very efficient because very simple instinctsieve separating out the few elements that meant danger or food or sex and allowing the rest to drift away unacknowledged as she was settling in the hopper flipped out his tongue gathered in a lacewing crushed it against the horny roof of his mouth and gulped it down when the tongue was out she quivered to a doubling in the breadth and intensity of the sense data like many reptiloids he had scent receptors in his tongue receptors that drew in faint traces of kikun while the hopper speared and crunched more insects she left the pointthrust in him and retreated to her own brain to sort through what shed found and decide what to do next kikun walked by there when cant be less than an hour more like two when we were starting supper even if he crawled it wouldnt take more than twenty minutes to run the boat this far how long does scent linger on land after the maker passes wonder if rohant knows should i surface and ask no it doesnt really matter you dont need to know he went past there all right why hes going the wrong direction lost rohant says no hmp i need another mount i cant do anything with this creature looks like i come back to sassa after all she snapped the pointthrust loose reorganized herself and slid into the hawks brain this wasnt just a matter of riding she had to take control and force the bird into doing something against his will and his nature there was another distraction that made her task doubly difficult the ciocan was tightly linked to his hawk he knew where sassa was at all times shared his tactile sensationsrode the air with himshared his emotions though he couldnt look through his eyes as she did he could feel her easing into sassas brain and was jealous of her talent that came through strongly it was rather like being whipped with nettlesthough not all that unpleasant even with the scratchiness because he liked her and seemed to want to see her as a dyslaerin hed said something like that once that she reminded him of his toerfeles miralys probably because he felt himself challenged by her and had no other way of dealing with what he felt courtesy of that bastard ginny oh gods he was managing well enough before this touchingrubbing thing handling the artificially imposed relationship by seeing her as an outseason dyslaerin trouble was she wasnt seasonalthat screwed everything up for poor old rohant dyslaera females were essentially asexual when not in heat insatiable when in they were sleek and powerful tough as hard rubber and apt to vent both annoyance and passion with claws that were smaller but sharper than the males sex among the dyslaera tended to be a noisy combination of wrestling match and knife duel shadith knew enough about them to make her wary of getting involved with a male capable of satisfying a dyslaerin especially an alpha but he was a hot pressure in the hawk powerfully sexualin fact the hawk acted as an amplifier as well as a transmitter of emotion and even that short time theyd rubbed against each other left them both aroused and wanting at the same time wary of doing anything about it their branches of the cousin tree had diverged too far from the trunk and all of that was beside the point she tried ignoring him it wasnt easy even with her attention focused on sassa she was intensely aware of rohant bending over her waving the fan across her face to keep the flies off she could feel his heat she could smell him smell the rich musk rolling off him sending her barely postpubescent body into an uproar that made thinking the hardest thing shed ever done much more and she was going to forget all about size differences and the bloody habits of mating dyslaera she clamped her teeth on her tongue and wrenched her mind once more from her erogenous zones furious at herself raging to get after kikun to find him and bring him out of whatever hed fallen into even as she struggled though there was a small voice down under that turmoil saying why all this passion shadow youve known this pair three days to speak to theyre not friends theyre barely acquaintances thats not to say dont go after the little man hes an odd and charming little man and doesnt deserve to be abandoned but cool it hmm she ignored the voice got sassa under control and sent him winging north and east hastening to the place where the hopper was the place where kikun had come out of the boat to walk on land shadithmind rubbing uncomfortably against rohantmind she sent the hawk swooping low over the treetops discovering then following a ridge of dry ground that wound through the water and the muck the reeds and gnarled trees standing kneedeep in the wet a ridge frequently interrupted by sections where water had eaten away stone and earth a faint glow seeped through the heavy canopy off to the left of the ridge a subtle graying scarcely perceptible in the light of the largest of the three moons she took sassa down into the tops of trees growing thickly on an islet like theirs let him find a perch among the fronds then looked through his eyes at the scene below kikun was tied into an inert package and thrown on the ground beside one of the several small fires tethered neck and ankles to two trees at the moment he was being ignored but sassas eyes showed shadith the tears abrasions and assorted bruises developing on the areas of flesh visible hed been beaten savagely she shivered with rage but clamped down on the reaction before she lost control of the hawk she began scanning the rest of the camp four six seven men what a bunch of scrags at least three rungs down from silvercreeps lot which i didnt think possible gods one of the men was kneeling beside what looked like a pile of junk he cursed slapped at a part of the pile getting a wobbling shriek that went through to the bone but cut off before it did major damage sassashook his feathers then settled to sulk as shadith blocked all his attempts to get out of there pey nish nisto shaker come come come swampman here the com sputtered broke into a low whistle riding the whistle a tiny tinny voice mita sanki niya swampman make it fast kana swarmin all over us pass word shaker we got part a what the wan gonna go lookin fer th rest come mornin set a meet tmorra night tell m don push no way the gonna find em thout us nish pay niya out swampman slapped the corn off got to his feet he was a tall man bone thin with a head like a skull he wore a profusely fringed leather shirt and leggings a bright red loincloth bones threaded on string along with nuts seeds and bits of mirror he strolled over to kikun kicked him in the ribs not a gentle tap but no hostility behind it or malice kikun was just meat shadith fought down another spurt of fury then loosed sassa and let him climb into the sky the hawk was eager to get back he needed to be closer to rohant and he wanted more sleep shadith sat up leaned against rohants knee and drank another cup of asteplikotas soup trouble she said a band of swamprats have him seven of them seems they have connections outside the leader made a corneal while i was watching probably to ainairil how close are we she set the cup beside her drew her hand across her mouth asteplikota sat on his heels stared past her into the dark beyond the islet say forty iskals were in the outer edge of the wetlands the fringes you saw a comset whats so surprising about that this world seems littered with them he had a comset and he was talking to someone about selling kikun us too by the way the rats are coming for us in the morning yes yes of course you heard what you heard whats odd is comsets are bad oteh urn luck fate something like that to the shikwakola the people who live in these wetlands theyre skittish folk they dont like drylanders and they wont have dryland wiha tech in their makees those are the clan houses in their temporary villages theyre nomadic pick up and move every few months take their houses with them dryland wiha puts bad oteh on a makee probably some instrument shorted out in the wet and burned a house down killed people even the pariahs dont his mouth twitched into a brief smile sorry shadow seems one is a crea ture of habit ancient habit he rubbed his hand along the grayblond stubble blurring his jawline one supposes what you saw was a band of pariahs pariahs he looked away again a mix of regret and amusement on his square face he wasnt a handsome man and he wasnt young as he himself said he wasnt the sort you looked at twice but the more she knew him the more she found herself liking him we do seem to have a propensity for exiling our misfits what did they look like when she finished he nodded yes one could even put a name to him bonetalker not one of our finer citizens pariahs drylanders started calling them that and they adopted the name take a kind of perverse pride in it they live out here on the fringes and control the trade what there is of it between swamp and dryland raid both sides for women he glanced at shadith looked quickly away dont underestimate them theyre dangerous this is their homeplace and they know it like you know your music child every third plant in here is poisonous they know which and how to use them there are bottomless sinkholes scattered through the fringes stories say they herd trespassers and raiders into them then stand round drink and watch the men struggle and go down wager on how long before the sink eats them theres a species of carnivorous muddaubers with stings that could drop an ox rumors say the pariahs have tamed the things can set them on anyone they take a notion to kill and they share other even less appetizing habits he laughed a few harsh barks which is a pun one would rather not explain oh lovely and you brought us in here yes shadow bad as they are the question is worse i see no i dont think you do i hope you never learn i had a wife once i had to watch them listen while they he looked down at his hands they were shaking he pressed them against his thighs stared at them until the shaking stopped that doesnt matter now i thought the shikwakola the tribes or the pariahs they wouldnt bother me or anyone i brought with me we have a common enemy the kanaweh and all such and we have a bargain my associates and the swamp folk unstated but generally honored we bring the pariahs medical care and urn things they couldnt otherwise get and they give us free passage and shelter when were pressed one hadnt quite realized how high a price the nistam and ayawit would set on your heads or how soon theyd get the word out it looks like all bargains are off for the moment anyway weve got some time from what i heard even if his lot dont get us hes not going to give kikun up or hurt him until he gets his price we have no time shadow as soon as that gobetween opens his mouth the napriests will have him and therell be an army of kanaweh heading for the fringes and the pariahs will vanish into the swamp beyond anyones reach which means we get the dancer back now or not at all shadith stirred the ciocans hand closed on her shoulder the pressure comforting and save our own necks she said yes along with heart brain and liver the habit one mentioned remember part of their belief system involves eating their enemies those they can capture intact and unpoisoned absorbing their hitsa they call it hitsa is selfpower soul and lifeforce combined if they cant sell us theyll eat us they might even prefer that you three have awesome hitsa sari yes rohant ran a thumbclaw along a mustache tail a couple of problems i can see how do we get to them and how do we avoid spooking them we take the poleboats i told you about you said you could use a pole can he used a corner of the blanket to blot thedrip from his nose sneezed suddenly into the wool wiped his face again dio i hate this cold not without some noise especially when i dont know the layout or where the hell im going i see shadow that talent of yours can you provide a distraction so we can reach them without being spotted oh yes but youd better give me some idea what theyd do if the local life came swarming at them i dont want to scare them into killing kikun and running they wont as long as they dont see the handbehind which means we dont give them time to think about it asteplikota got to his feet we should wait till near dawn before we move let them get settled to sleep anything to add ciocan no good shadow you took a little over an hour to find them and get back did you run a straight line or turn a lot of bends will it take us longer poling pretty convoluted i dont know depends on how fast you pole and where the channels are at a guess half an hour not much longer i see get some sleep both of you one will wake you when its time chapter running to the rescue then just running the poleboats slid across the thick black water with the soft sound of silk clad thighs rubbing together standing in the assymetric rear and working the pole with a minimum of drip and sweat resolutely ignoring the ache in his head and the red misery of his nose rohant went first cats riding before him using his tie with sassa to guide him through the labyrinthine web of channels shadith couldnt do both at the same timetake the expedition to the camp and organize the distractionso she had to send sassa ahead to mark the pariah camp for rohant and give him the direction she was in the second boat the one asteplikota was poling curled by his feet as she mindrode a monster slither no mere hitching this she had a full lock on the brain it had taken her a while to learn how to manage the tentacles and the rest of the swimming behavior but now that she had these mechanics snapped in place she forced the beast to expend energy at a punishing rate raced him through the twisting channels through tangles of weed and tree roots drove him across sandy shoals until he finally reached the deeper water about the islet she let him cruise around it snatching at fish and other swimmers crunching them and swallowing them while she used him as a base to seek out and draw toward the islet the distraction she was constructing she found a nest of watervipers about twenty poisonous wrigglers long as a mans arm with stubby vestigal legs at intervals along the flat bodies she brought them writhing across a shallow stream of clear water at the small end of the teardrop islet and into the tangle of trees and brush around the sandy glade at the big end where the pariahs had their camp she held them in a knot while she kept hunting she found a pod of juvenile slithers in their amphibian phase prodded them from their mud nests and brought them into the grass outside the circle of firelight she collected small rodents furwings flying lizards and a swarm of muddaubers brought them all into the dark around the sleeping pariah shikwakola she withdrew a portion of her attention opened her eyes ready when you are rohant stop a minute asteplikota held back until the ciocan planted his pole then eased up beside the first boat he brushed a hand over his long blond hair the fogheavy nightwind was teasing at it blowing the strands into his eyes how close are we do you know the ciocan blotted his nose on the blanket hed thrown over one shoulder thought about the question given the channel doesnt change maybe five minutes off far as i can judge he slapped at questing biters shadow mmh whats happening she struggled to pull enough of herself back so she could think and speak coherently without loosing her hold on the horde when she answered him she brought out the words in small units sorting through the confusing clutter in her head from the dozens of sensory systems she was tied into sleepin two watch itchy they know some thing wrong noises wrong small lives acting funny i think want to take a chance rohant smothered a sneeze in the blanket wheres kikun in middle stretched flat legs neck tied to two trees can you get a ring round him to keep them off instead of attack along with it no use taking them and losing him she frowned could she do it shed been using sassa as a prime viewpoint so she could see the whole camp and lay out her attack at the same time she was trying to keep track of the other viewpoints ruffling through them like cards she was shuffling clamping down on all those furious and rebellious brains holding the horde in stasis until it was time to loose it on the pariahs she was rapidly finding out what her limits were and beginning to be frightened of what was happening inside her head once the attack started though shed probably have more capacity available the way her captives were churning about even the mildest of them raging to bite something she wouldnt have to do much prodding to turn them on the sleepers especially when the pariahs started hitting back trouble was rohant was all too right there was no point in any of this if kikun got skewered or poisoned her surrogates werent going to worry about who they chewed on once they started to swarm she had to set some kind of barrier around him that would keep them off she reviewed her forces made up her mind eheh she said finally can do good pariahs could go for the hostage when the attack starts he closed his eyes leaned heavily on the pole ante youd better stay with shadow shes going to be too busy to watch out for trouble shadow fix on those sentries the minute you see them getting really nervous or if they start moving toward kikun hit them with everything youve got she managed a few gasps of laughter made a face at him yeh papa the pariah stiffened turned to face toward the boats he still couldnt see before he had a chance to move or shout shadith sent the swarm of muddaubers bulleting toward him turning their rage at her for slaving them into a fury at the first target available at the same time she sent the flying lizards diving at the second watcher she brought the vipers crawling into the camp and wound them in a deadly ring about kikun who lay brighteyed and smiling who mouthed the words heyah shadow into the face of the queen viper rearing over him she drove the juvenile slithers out of the grass and aimed them at the sleepers and they came squealing their fury their stubby legs whirring their claws tearing up gouts of sand their rows of teeth clamping on then sawing at head limb torso whatever they first closed on she brought the horde of rodents into the ring of firelight sent them leaping at the pariahs biting everything they could get their teeth into the rest of the beasts shed collected she let fly or crawl as they would she had enough to do without them rohant drove the blunt bow into the islet went leaping into the chaos using shadiths stunner tapping it onoff in microbursts and careful to keep the stunbeam off the sublife he didnt want to flatten shadith through her surrogates he dropped pariah after pariah as the men came out of sleep into confusion and terror less than a minute after he hit dry ground he stood in the middle of bodies counting them seven down shadow get this zoo out of here will you rohant kicked the comset apart and dumped it in the mud with a grunt of satisfaction asteplikota rested his knife on the rope hed been sawing at that wont stop them he started cutting again kikun was nearly extinguished by a cocoon of ropes all of them knotted and reknotted so he couldnt be simply unwound it was going to take work and time to free him the moment the gobetween opens his mouth the napriests will start peeling his skin they might not pin this islet but theyll get the general area out of him and blanket it with sleds and searchers shadith came back from poking about the unconscious pariahs its not a guess anymore hmm they know we werent in the sled when it blew asteplikota nodded if they didnt before they do now he pulled the last of the ropes off kikuns torso waited kikun smiled amiably at him and lay without moving sighing asteplikota started freeing the lacertines legs we should get to the coast as fast as we can the closer we are to the edge when the kanaweh swarm the likelier we are to break loose no one fools with the kihcikistiliks shadith laughed i couldnt even say it the islands in the east if thats better if we murder your langue forgive us we had it thrust upon us rather abruptly with no say in how it was done one had wondered how you knew it he started peeling the ropes off kikuns legs if you were dumped here as you said there was a bit more to it than i told you i see he got to his feet pulling kikun up with him theres no time for histories now weve got to get moving ill lead since im the only one with an idea where to go one had hoped to get a guide from the pariahs things being as they are thats out shadow i want you in the boat with me with your harp ready to play why you three have to be the three flaunt it loud and filled with color we cant try sneaking along wed simply invite attack we cant fight the pariahs even with your weapons and your talents my friends we have to keep them away from us we have to confuse them set them arguing among themselves its the only way well get out of here alive rohant snorted picked up the blanket hed dropped in the attack sneezed twice and wiped his streaming eyes some demigod he said dripping with a cold kikun watched with halfclosed eyes projecting enigma and amusement shadith frowned at him irritated by that inappropriate insouciance she ran a hand through her hair pushing it into peaks turned to asteplikota do all of you eat your enemies or should i say your victims no of course not what do you mean if the pariahs the shikwakola dont believe like you why should they care about your gods demigods whatever they are ah i see in the five nations the practices differ according to caste or according to kind among the outcaste island or main god is one and his servants are honored arent you asking for trouble then playing games with your own beliefsor dont you believe whos to say one is playing games more often than not the avatar himself does not know what he is she is oppalatin works as he will he is not bound by the fallible logic of man she gazed at him a moment shook her head one thing i learned all the long years you dont argue a mans religion come on lets get out of here they slid through the winding channels poling as quickly as they could to put distance between themselves and the islet between themselves and the sunken boat the hunk of metal that would shout its existence if the kanaweh had metal detectors on board their sleds shadith knelt before asteplikota as she had before this time plucking tunes from her harp singing a while then playing again it was an eerie feeling performing for those unseen ears sensing shikwakola all around her gliding in parallel streams sensing their fear their confusion the ebb and flow of their anger she was beginning to understand how ginny was using her and the others it was clear too clear clear enough to make her sick when she saw it they didnt need to do anything they just had to exist everything happening down here was forcing them into the roles hed planned for them everything they couldnt escape his manipulationexcept by literally escaping getting off this world damn the man i wont be his typhoid mary i will not how you going to stop it shadow look whats happening virgin singer weve got to get off this world and soon or well have done all the damage he wants everything he wants from us pretty little petlings dancing to his jingeetune dipping our toesies ah no no up to our assies in a ocean of shit i am going to kill that monster if i ever get my hands on his neck ill squeeze till his eyes pop out she sang mad maras lament and put all her rage and sorrow into it and felt an answering anguish from the thinning darkness on either side of them she wanted to cry out to those hidden listeners dont believe it its not true but she wasnt about to offer herself as sacrificial victim there didnt seem to be any middle ground if she wanted to live she played the role if not she died and what good would dying do just get the others killed along with her no doubt theyd end as martyrs anyway and that could be the spark that set the world on fire ahlahlah i wish i hadnt thought of that martyrs oh gods i know thats on his peabrain agenda hes going to see the gospah or the nistam or both are blamed for killing us and watch the world explode maybe youre wrong sar ive got to be wrong when were out of this trap if we get out of it id better have a long talk with aste about this if anyone knows he does the air shook and the brightening day turned suddenly dark as a vast blanket of sleds filled the sky over them flying low enough to brush the fronds of the taller trees sassa came screaming down landed on the bow of rohants boat he perched there hunched over complaining at the noise and heat with querulous squawks and beakclashes cutter beams slashed through the foliage churned the mud boiled the water around them bracketing them again and again missing them each time though they were scalded by the steam from the suddenly heated water and slapped by severed fronds hastily shadith laid the harp flat on the pouches and dropped to a crouch in the bottom of the boat fragmentation bombs dropped around them missing them every time though she heard screams from the shikwakola whod been following them cries of rage fear and pain she was splattered by mud thrown up by the bombs metal fragments went whining through the sides of both boats inflicting a few small cuts one ripped across her arm an inch below the pellet wound another clipped a tuft of hair above her ear she yelped and grabbed at her arm a second later she heard a scream behind her and swung round asteplikota clutched at the pole and screamed again a cutter beam had sliced across the side of his head removing scalp and hair and the tip of his ear cutting off the end of his shoulder she could see the bone glare white in the blackened flesh she could smell charred hair and carbonized muscle it wasnt a killing wound but it was horrible and she shuddered at the pain that scraped her own mind raw as her talent resonated to it cursing under her breath she dug into her pouch found her firstaid kit and crawled back to him she set the kit down twisted the pole from him as gently as she could and lowered him to the bottom of the boat he screamed every time she touched him and moaned between the screams sweating and crying she got him down set a popper against his neck and squirted painkiller into an artery then sprayed a temporary bandage over the burns and cuts asteplikota relaxed and closed his eyes she eased him onto the pouches took her roll of gauze and wound it about and about the wounds until they were a little better protected from contamination and unexpected jars the flits passed on most of them the worst was over here though she could hear bombs and the hum of the cutters moving south away from them she heard a raucous cry looked back and saw the hawk powering into the air rohant was flattened out in the second boat like she was in this one unhurt as far as she could tell the cats beside him nervous and upset but untouched kikun was standing doing a peculiar shimmying dance she stared not understanding then turned to gaze at the devastation around her it seemed impossible they were all still alive she twisted round and focused on kikun again his dance went on and on gouts of steam floated around him the air shimmered as it would with heatwaves in a desert summer but this was neither desert nor summer his body wavered and attenuated was solid flesh again his edges melted into the air were sharp and definite again melted and were sharp rohant said you were a god incarnate i dont believe that but youre something maybe its luck maybe its you i dont know she sat up rubbed at her eyes looks like the powers have decided theres no way they can land us so the next best thing is ash us and every other warmblood here in the fringes gods lets get out of here sbe grabbed the pole levered herself onto her feet rohant you all right he got up slowly the cats growling and snapping at his legs as if they resented his moving he was suffering from feedback standing without moving hands pressed to his eyes he wasnt tied as closely to the cats as he was to the hawk but there was enough linkage to drive him to the edge of his control he lowered his hands blinked blinked again then looked hazily about for the pole when he found it he bent with care as if hed break if he moved too precipitously caught hold of it and straightened up still saying nothing he dug it into the mud of the bottom and stood waiting for her to start moving the next hours were nightmare they worked mechanically through a slowly lessening silence as the wetlands woke from the shock of the attack kikun stopped dancing he huddled between the cats face pinched eyes squeezed shut saying nothing seeing nothing doing nothing asteplikota lay on the pouches moaning she didnt dare give him too much of a painkiller the drugs she carried were calibrated to her body and that body wasnt born here or anywhere near the homeworid ofthis offshoot of the cousin races it worked on him thank whatever for that but every time she popped him she was half afraid she was going to kill him after an hour of steady poling she peeled out a stimtab and swallowed it it hit her hard empty stomach but she had no appetite and was too afraid of a repeat attack to stop and rest and eat and she had to get asteplikota somewhere a local doctor could look at him the coast thats where he said to go thats where she was going she could orient as well as kikun was supposed to do she never got lost when she knew where she was and where she wanted to go she didnt know either now but she had a line asteplikotas line north and east she held that line north and east she went as directly as she could the day developed stifling and muggy dank and cold an adjectival misery she worked up a sweat as she worked the pole the thick salt film lay in a sticky ooze over all her body the discomfort adding another small increment to her depression the tangle of channels was overgrown and treacheroustime after time the channel she chose pinched out on her and she had to back up until she found a branch she could pass into and go round the blockage the first time this happened she mindrode sassa for a while but the canopy was too thick the hawk couldnt find open channels from above the trees besides she was too weary she couldnt summon the concentration to pole and ride at the same time things got fuzzy on her very fast in one of those interminable backtracings she let too much time pass and the painpop shed given asteplikota wore off he started screaming and twisting his body about as he tried blindly to get away from the pain cursing and impatient she fumbled through the kit for the popper the stimtabs were making her hands shake sometimes her whole body shook she knew she ought to eat something there were a few tubes of concentrate in with the rest but she ignored them she bad the feeling shed simply vomit the stuff up again there was no point in wasting it she fumbled the shot but finally managed to hit the artery and asteplikota settled back into his stupor the popper was almost empty something new to worry about rohant was looking back waiting for her she got to her feet took up the pole and waved and they were off again a few sleds passed overhead the kanaweh were gridsearching now mopping up any life forms theyd missed on their first pass but there were no more cutters no more frag bombs around the boats kikun shriveled further seemed to shrink beneath his skin it hung in folds about his bones what shed suspected before she was sure of now he was expanding that curious nothere he could project that made eyes slide off him and minds forget him the moment the eyes turned away he was covering them and the cover worked clouds gathered as the day wore on under the trees it was so dark it might have been midnight shadith peeled off the last stimtab swallowed it glanced at asteplikota his face was flushed with fever hot and dry she sighed and got to her feet looked back at rohant sighed again and started poling her arms felt like mush the shaking was worse she dug the pole in and shoved pulled it loose set it again on and on the trees grew smaller and sparser there was more weed and reed a heavy breeze lifted licked against her face there was no relief in it breathing that air was like chewing leather with about as much sustenance and flavor in it clouds of pinhead biters drifted aimlessly on the wind settled on her crawled about licking up the sweat on and on she heard a croak behind her rohant she planted her pole looked back he was crouching tasting the water he looked up salt he said the coast watcher cell a child saw the three nataminaho smiled at her and beckoned opalekismimo laughed so infectiously she laughed too nikamooskinin played the kittkew so sweetly she

enforcers of the landlaw spurred their bull mos round and round the maka landfolk who ignored them as best they could and kept moving south in stubborn silence heading for the pilgrim road bisecting

ignoring the kicks and shoves from the mos walking and singing gazing straight before them as if they saw the three striding there leading them on their pakoseo prayerbeads rolling thr their fingers they kept walking south after another hour of futile threatening and harassment each kansi cut a walker from the crowd threw him or her across the withers of his mo and rode off when the kansi and their captives were no more than rapidly dimishing dustclouds there was a collective moan of grief with punctuating cries of grief and loss but not a single walker turned back lab ough cell the barrier island was a stretch of sand half a meter at its highest above the sea with a skim of graygreen salt crusted brush and reeds plus a thorny tangle of the ubiquitous amtapishka vine the boats were pushed up onto the sand on the landside of the island tethered to the poles which were driven into the sand the ocean was a brilliant blue like sapphire at once liquid and crystalline restful despite its patterned restlessness the sky was the same blue but softer and more diffuse as empty as the sea a few cloud puffs intensified rather than diluted that emptiness rohant lay stretched out on the sand wrapped in one blanket with another rolled up for a pillow he was asleep snoring a gaunt look lying uncomfortably on his broad face painfully reddened with flakes of skin peeling off it his nose jutted like the beak of his hawk his chin was a minor promontory kikun sat at his feet a small nub of a man not sleeping but huddled in on himself visibly plumping as if he drew sustenance from the suns heat and the whip of the wind that blew onshore with enough force to tear the bushes loosed their roots hadnt gone down to bedrock asteplikota lay in the boat gauze laid loosely over his face to keep off the biters he was not doing well he was restless with fever despite the antibiotics shadith finally took a chance on and fed him knowing the odds were theyd kill him they brought the fever down enough to prevent brain damage but they werent right enough to do more than ameliorate the infection he was asleep moaning in his sleep but comfortable and warm with a big cat dozing on each side of him the hawk perched on a thwart tearing at the body of a small rodent shadith stood looking out across the empty ocean the wind blowing strongly against her molding her torn and bloodied clothing against her body teasing at hair matted into clumps and tangles there were shadows under her eyes and furrows dug from her nose round the corners of a mouth too wide and too defined to match the childish contours of her face a childishness that was rapidly melting under the stress of the flight her cheeks were hollow emphasizing the jut of her cheekbones the delicate rondure of her childs limbs had gone hard and knobby when she unfolded her arms her hands shook as if she could see the eyethough of course she could not that was impossible the direction of her gaze was chanceshe scowled straight at him ginbiryol seyirshi hear me its your game if you want us on the board get your ass in gear and send us some backup she turned away from him and once more stood staring out to sea ginbiryol seyirshi was raging but he didnt let it show he controlled every nuance of his behavior he was never caught napping he was always ready to handle anything that came at him he took immense pride in his imperturbability it was an important part of his mystique it was something he fought fiercely to protect he could feel puk the lute watching him ajeri the pilot was looking sideways at him waiting for him to react to shadiths challenge he shook with hatred for that girl with her sneaking talent but he couldnt show it if he railed against her he called in question his own judgmentand his luck he chose to bring her here it was his decision to let the avatars run loose for a while they were doing what he brought them here to do generating rumor and stirring up the castes setting the low against the high and they were doing it very effectively no one could deny that at least five hundred pariahs were dead or dying the flits had left behind them a swath of destruction thirty km wide and the three had moved through that chaos as if they truly were gods with witnesses in plenty to testify to it and spread word about it grace of that oddity who called himself kikun there ginbiryols luck had served him well that drunken dyslaerik unmate who sold them the information had told the truth hard as it was to believe ginbiryol had a moments regret that hed let puk have the creature to play with before hed squeezed every drop of data from him about this putative god incarnate but that was unimportant at the moment if he wanted more data all he need do was reach out and take it he decided all that mattered was kikuns belief in this absurdity his conviction would convince others without him doing anything especially if they wanted to believe luck the lady had brought him everything in one throw of his net even though this girl was insolent and probably dangerous she was quite satisfactory as virgin god if he didnt need her in the production hed have her as penitent in a praisesong none of them would forget as it was he would have to make do with the end ayawit had waiting for her luck yes kikun was a demigod and the ciocan with his tiedbeasts was perfect for the hunter gathering him up had given ginbiryol more than a little satisfaction it was a ismail earnest of the payment family voallts were going to make him for the insult they had put on him when they refused to deal with his agent there was not a man woman or other alive who could say he had put the hurt on ginbiryol seyirshi he did not allow that to happen if it did happen he erased it the ciocan had felt his hand already the rest of family voallts would be destroyed one by one when he found time to deal with them calming himself by thinking of that and of the ciocans inevitable unenviable end he produced a smile chirruped to the pet and coaxed the simi to his lap stroking the round velvety head he turned to puk we must see that her end is a strong chastisement of her insolence pukanuk pousli looked wary yes sir he didnt elaborate it irritated ginbiryol that he didnt elaborate he kept his eyes fixed on puk the lute a silent inescapable demand for more behind the gaze though he relaxed a little pleased when he saw puks face begin to shine with sweat the lute fidgeted finally he said you want i should get onto one of our men in kiscomaskins camp say shipayupal and have him set up a coast search so he can find them it would have been more use if youd alerted him the minute the search and slaughter began yes sir i missed that i was inexcusably blind to possibilities the words were contrite but ginbiryol could read a cavil behind them you didnt think of it either it was becoming clear that puk was going to need disciplining and soon perhaps even before this operation was completed he made a note to set a personal dedicated closeeye on his second and check it frequently apologies will not restore asteplikota if he dies puk if i told you once i have said it a dozen times he relished the fear he saw in his tame killer the drop of sweat that collected at the end of puks nose and splatted onto the arms hed folded across his ribs in an absurdly childish sketch of selfprotection i need asteplikota alive and ambulatory see that it is accomplished he did not wait for puk to answer him but turned to his scanning of the other cells chapter still running when do we get to stop a touch on her arm drew shadith out of a restless hagridden sleep she pushed the blanket away and sat up brushing the sand off the side of her face kikun squatted beside her waiting for her to get herself together enough to notice him what is it this time she muttered she plucked at her hair grimaced at the knots and the greasy stickiness smiled as kikun passed over the comb hed gotten from her pouch intuition or foresight theres a sail on the horizon it looks like you got through to ginny and hes been pulling strings shadith winced as she worked the comb into a serious tangle she continued teasing at the knot while she thought over what hed said not more trouble from the powers he fluttered his fingers an inadequate answer but obviously all she was going to get hmm aste he blinked slowly coming back from somewhere wherever it was he went on these occasions of absence small changes eddied across his fineboned angular face but even with her talent she had no idea what they meant when he spoke though his words were prosaic enough about the same still under fevers no better no worse dont need to ask about rohant i can hear him snoring from here she dragged impatiently at the comb swore as it tore out a clump of hair i suppose i should take a look find out who they are for sure if you wish he contrived to be suddenly more present consider this also theyll pass us by unless we let them know were here if we want them to know all right oh god i hope they have a doctor onboard she reached and settled into the hawk got a firm hold on him and sent him winging out to sea riding him was even more of a problem this time because rohant was still sleeping though only marginally aware of her in the hawk he had less control of his basic emotions she shuddered under a blast of concentrated lust that shook her to her heels to the north of the wander of sandy barrier islands splayed along the curve of the wetlands an old threemaster was tacking slowly south leaving in place a thread of control to keep the bird circling over the ship she dropped into the ships cat a lazy torn with one ear and a truncated tail big enough and certainly tough enough to eat the average dog he fought her with every nerve in him nearly went into convulsions in his struggle to throw her off the men working the ship around him ignored his cavorting apparently they were used to his fits she subdued him and sent him prowling about the deck while she listened to the crew they werent talking much one of them a boy he couldnt have been more than twelve or thirteen had a pipe as long as his arm and was producing sounds that approximated music a lively bit of noise that made the pulling and hauling easier another lot of the misbegotten i wouldnt want to meet a one of them in a dark alley bright alley either smugglers i suppose if theyre not from no no not on the side of the powers not them all right all right whos in charge who signed you on lazy fourfoot you bloody old mangler she sent the cat scooting up a steep ladder onto a smaller deck that was built over a substructure of some kind there were three locals standing in a loose group one of them was a big sloppy man with a massive torso and long arms a stained and raveled mustache and a nose that wandered a fingers width off center he was scanning the coast through a crude spyglass mtika the shout came from the top of the midmast shed been thinking and reacting in interlingue having waked in that mindset so for a moment it was just sounds she heard mtika wa tipli her mind shuddered and clanged over to awenakis as the watch yelled some more looklooks more captaincaptains and went on that the bird int it t one you say look for and int it raat over us goin round and round like it knew who we was the cat twitched nervously as the hoarse voice came down through the bulging canvas the whining shrouds the three men stared up at the circling hawk the tipli lifted the spyglass focused it on the bird it a strange un all raat have a look he passed the glass over the second man was short and square hed a petulant pouty face with bulging eyes and a full red mouth he snatched the glass set it to his eye after some fidgeting and focusing he stared for a long moment at the bird then lowered the glass thats the one for sure it matches the description his voice suited his body it was high and whiny and dry enough to hurt an ordinary ear they must be around here somewhere if theyre still alive the third man was slight neatly made with a thin intelligent face and a pointed gray beard the first chin hair shed seen on a local he wore the neat twill jumpsuit and the bronze arm bands of a high caste doctor kisar at least she sighed and felt a weight drop off her shoulders when she saw that he looked up at the hawk but waved away the glass when the second man offered it to him the question is where did it come from his voice was a pleasant rumble that sounded more suited to the burly shipmaster lipatchin ask your man if he got a line on it that gave shadith an idea she withdrew from the cat let him go streaking off to hide in a coil of rope took hold of sassa and brought him swooping down the length of the ship screaming as he passed she took him in a last circle then sent him darting toward the sandy islet he wanted to land beside rohant but she wouldnt let him she made him hover briefly over the islet then sent him winging back to the ship once again he circled the topsails flew to the islet flew back the third time he reached the ship the crew was launching a longboat when the boat was in the water and the men in it saw him leave again the boy played him a rollicking salute then launched into a quickbeat as the sailors started rowing along the line sassad given them shadith let the hawk come where he wanted to be and went back to combing her hair she glanced at rohant who was awake and sitting up watching her theyre on their way she said what who some locals part of astes lot i think think dio eyes glazed each breath a wheezing rasp shudders running through his big body he got to his feet and went to stand looking out to sea waiting for the longboat to appear his hands clasped behind him his fingers curled about her stunner kikun eeled through the brush and squatted beside her he yawned glanced out at sea played in the sand a minute then slanted a look at her aste is restless he feels hotter to my hand shadith moved her shoulders impatiently unzipped a thighpocket and squeezed the comb into it im not going to give him any more of my stuff god knows what its doing to him sure not me theres a doctor on that ship let him handle the fever she whizzed the zipper shut and got to her feet anyway here they are the four sailors beached the longboat and squatted by its prow the boy stayed where he was the short square man from the upper deck swung over the gunnel and came striding up the sand to stop in front of rohant he stared up at the ciocan looked past him at shadith then kikun there should be another he said abruptly youre got a name who are you his voice an impatient growl rohant folded his arms across his chest and looked down his nose at the newcomer i am shipayupal where is the fourth one rohant thought that over another minute standing behind him and a few paces to the left shadith saw his body tense as he suppressed a cough name him he rasped what you heard the ciocans voice was scraping bottom now but he ignored that and pressed on you want to know what happened to him give me a name happened to him what do you mean happened to him no uayton name first tells me what side youre on fool shipayupal glared at rohant then he shrugged asteplikota wait here kikun come with me rohant swung round and strode off shipayupal gazed tightlipped after them then turn his eyes on shadith her first impulse was to follow rohants lead to challenge him and make him take them on their terms not his but the ciocan was tired sick and riding dyslaera instinct not using his brain all that much and playing ginnys game but arent we all huh hes looking at me wonder what he wants i dont think i like this local i dont care what side hes on hes a handler thats all he is tenlper boy working the edges out for what he can get perfect soulmate for ginny the creep come over here girl get in the boat she tightened her lips suddenly furious logic and reason melting like a summer mist ill wait dont be foolish we havent time for it wepi ahtay put her in she caught hold of sassa brought him diving and screaming past shipayupal talons ripping at his face missing this time but making the threat palpable at the same time she brought out the darter when the hawk was circling overhead again she showed them the weapon i will not be handled dont touch me youd best do what she says rohants cracking rumble came with an underpinning of soft snarls from magimeez and nagafog he was standing in a gap in the brush holding asteplikota cradled like a baby in his arms the black cats looming beside him huge and ominous creatures out of myth and nightmare they showed their teeth and twitched their tails as he spoke kikun waited behind him nearly extinguished under the pouches her harpcase and their blanket rolls none of us are in a mood to take any chousing shapayupal scowled at asteplikota what happened to him rohant cleared his throat spat toone side cutter hit him you got a doctor on that ship weve done the best we could but that isnt much yes there is a doctor we knew about the strafe and thought if you survived you might need tending pale blue eyes flicked from rohant to shadith slid over kikun in an uneasy wince you are unharmed luck of the toss rohant whistled to the cats and marched for the boat with them pacing on each side heads turning yellow eyes gleaming red mouths open showing the tearing fangs the sailors scattered scrambling to put distance between them and the beasts eyes wide with a struggling mix of fear and delight the piper boy stayed in the boat backed up as far as he could from rohant as the ciocan settled asteplikota carefully across two thwarts with the cats beneath him to support him where the thwarts didnt rohant straightened ran his eyes over the nervous locals get in lets go the painkillers wearing off and hes going to need help soon the cats are tame enough they wont touch you long as i tell them not to he looked over his shoulder at the boy youre not afraid are you the boy managed a wobbly grin sweaty hands clutching the pipe as if it were a safety line kikun grinned his eyes gleaming copper in the brilliant sunlight he dumped his load beside shadith climbed into the boat and settled in the bottom beside nagafogs head he scratched behind the beasts ears then began slapping his hand rhythmically on the nearest thwart threading a whistle through the drumming a cheery tune that the piper boy picked up his sound uncertain at first then strong sheepishly the sailors came back laid hands on the boat to push it into the water shipayupal started toward them wait shadith caught his arm stopped him theres not enough room for all of us and our gear in that boat and no point in trying to overload it aste has to go now no question of that answers simple they can send it back for us us certainly you dont expect me to wait here alone do you or trust you to come back for me forget that we wait together he opened his mouth to object heard the beat of sassas wings and changed his mind with a shrug he waved the boat off kicked together a pile of dry weed and lowered himself to wait for its return who are you where do you come from leaning against the pile of pouches shadith thought about the questions as she fought off a weariness that turned her bones to water her brief sleep had left her nearly as tired as when she laid down she had no inchnation to open her soul for shipayupal on the other hand she didnt want to antagonize him any more than she had to in her mind if not in her heart she regretted using sassa to intimidate him shed humiliated him in front of the others and he wasnt going to forget that she definitely didnt need any more enemies this was another time shed let her mindset get warped by fear and anger cool she wasnt and she kept paying for it this body shed acquired was a powerful drag on her mind when it came to crises it reacted as its original owner had trained it war was bred into the bone of its people attack and destroy were the approved mode of action she kept forgetting how intricately mind and brain were interwoven for so long so very long shed been a sketch of a person mechanically reproduced inside an unliving matrix now everything was new her immediate reactions were raw undirected by reason ahlahlah what do i do now id like to forget it and just sit here just sit and listen to the ocean tickle at the sand gods if it werent for aste id say run like hell for the city and crash the kanaweh headquarters im sure the skipcoms there where else would it be we were kidnapped and dropped here she said after a silence she knew was too long her voice was flat unconvincing she couldnt dredge up the energy to make that worn list of halftruths and wholelies sound believable we were picked up like stray cows and carted off she said and thought how blah it is i dont know why all i know is i want to get back where i belong even that had no strength behind it though it was the one fully true thing she said word is you claim to be nikamooskinin claim i claim nothing thats somebody elses stupid mistake youre a singer im a student of music from a half dozen other places i dont belong here how many times do i have to say it she closed her eyes rubbed at her temples her head was aching she felt sick and wondered if she was catching rohants cold and the green one green hes more gray than green ive known him what three days ask him what he is and the big man same she got to her feet stood staring out across the ocean the ship was a faint waver of sail and spar against the pale clutter between sea and sky she couldnt see the longboat for a minute or so then it heaved up and vanished again about halfway there she moved her shoulders trying to shrug off the fatigue that dragged at her she was tired of talking she was tired of thinking she pulled the harpcase over to her shed been too busy to worry before but now she was anxious about the harp what the gouts of steam and scalding water might have done to it scowling as she felt small blisters like a bad case of measles she ran her hands over the wood then threw the latches and took out the harp there were a few stains on the padding she chewed her lip when she saw theta turned anxiously to the instrument there were traces of moisture on the dark lustrous wood she took the polishcloth from its niche and began wiping gently at the damp places inspecting them wiping again and again until the glow was back deep and alive she tightened the strings tried each listening for the tones and halftones and undertones when she wasfinished with that she played one of her simpler homesongs played until she broke a fingernail and had to stop sighing she eased the strings shut the harp away it was time anyway the boat was coming back as soon as they were onboard the ship turned east and ran for the islands chapter stuck in an eddy atehana about an hour before midnight the ship dropped anchor in a halfmoon bay carved out of the southern end of a small island a thin spray of stars glittered like ice crystals flung across the cloudless black sky the moons were milky bright one a hairline crescent near the eastern horizon just rising one almost overhead a flattened half and a third in the west nearly full beginning to drop below the mountainous spine of another larger island some distance off the air was chill with wisps of fog drifting across the dark water like the fitful exhalations of hypothalassan monsters standing at the rail waiting to go overside shadith was surprised by the look of the town spread along the horns of the bag rising up the slope of the mountain behind street lanterns of translucent shell hung on high poles shining pale green pale amber on fogwet pavement it was a larger and more complex settlement than shed expected her notions colored by the feudalism of the main atehana lipatchin called this place atehana on the island wakisoe the tipli lipatchin decanted his passengers with obvious relief and upped anchor as if hed put into a plague port a group of locals mostly men a small knot of women to one side waited for the two boats on the central wharf the tipli had been on the corn with the island for the past two hours exchanging cryptic clipped phrases with them spaced at longish intervals the aura of wariness and secrecy was thick enough to cut as the first longboat nudged against the piles and two of the rowers locked it steady with boathooks the locals lowered a sling rohant and the doctor eased asteplikota into it and steadied it as the men working the davits drew it up the boat shadith was in swung up against a ladder and two of the rowers hooked it in place while she and kikun got their gear together and hauled it up the ladder onto the wharf she thought the cats were going to be a problem but the moment she and kikun were clear magimeez batted nagafog out of her way leaped from the boat hit the ladder crouched and sprang flying onto the wharf nagafog landed beside her a moment later they sat on their haunches grinning at shadith she grinned back then strolled over to watch as a small group of the locals transferred asteplikota to a stretcher on wheels and went running off with him she backed up against rohant we need to talk she muttered he touched her hair his hands were hot and trembling im at the end of my string shadow all right but i have this feeling we wait too long were going to be so bogged down well never get loose a young woman with fine blonde hair floating like fog about her face and shoulders broke from the small crowd of locals and came across to them followed by two other women both of them considerably older than she was she flickered a smile at rohant and kikun then turned its full glow on shadith and held out her hands singer one is i am uiaras your servant of the house of judge wakisoematwesie its very late you must be exhausted come a bath and a meal and a bed and youll feel more like youre alive the invitation was for her alone and she didnt like the idea of being drawn away from rohant and kikun kikun touched her arm go on twiceborn tomorrows soon enough to start again meet here here it is a wave of warmth ran through her this time she didnt bother wondering where it came from she needed it too badly all right she told the woman i must admit i could use a bath the womans hostel was halfway up the mountain a large dark bulk built from the same fieldstone that cracked and set in concrete paved the streets its fogwetted precipitous roof glistened in the starlight rounded slices of slate overlapped like the scales of a fish punctuated by half a dozen chimneys putting out threads of fragrant smoke golden lamplight glowed through the intricate stone lace that filled the pointed windows ranked on both sides of an open ogeed archway cut into the wallstone with a massive bronze door at the end its patina shimmering greenish gold in the light of twin lanterns of shell and bronze stone everywhere appears to me this place has more rock than trees come the winter what you bet its cold as a ottogynes finger at the foot of the wide shallow steps leading to the entrance uiaras touched shadiths arm wait here a moment its late they want you but theyll want to make sure it is you she smiled suddenly the highvoltage grin that did a lot to convince shadith to come with her dont worry i wont be long she ran up the stairs and into the entranceway punched a wide button beside the door a hatch opened in the wall beside her and the shadow behind the grill murmured something it was a womans voice shadith couldnt make out the words she slid the strap of the harpcase off her shoulder and eased it to the pavement then turned to the woman beside her the one who carried her travel pouch a short square figure with coarse silver hair and an uglyattractive intelligent face is it always this difficult the woman looked startled then smiled tentatively her grayblue eyes sinking into a nest of laughwrinkles curfew she said uiaras a wave of a small hand at the blonde woman arguing with the grill and we another wave that took in herself and the silent woman beside her we generally do not stay there she ran fingers over the bracelet on her left wrist silver shaped into a broad band inlaid with copper wire and turquoise beads the design a bird form curved about a cat when she saw shadith looking at it she said my marriage band there was both pride and sadness in her voice her face do you know the custom no ah well no doubt youd discover it soon enough one wears a i keep forgetting i i wear the band on my left arm because i am cast off my liwa he repudiated me for a younger woman one i had no sons you see only daughters i live here with my youngest daughter and her lover shadith shifted uneasily from foot to foot embarrassed by this unaskedfor soulbaring the woman shook her head dont waste your time on pity singer i much prefer this life her eyes gleamed with laughing malice and with a little luck ill see my exla skinned hes the head of the nistams guard such a lovely man he is the charm of a rabid amskir with the intelligence of a gnat the pakoseo works for us even if the other nistams come against us afterward as they always do well hold wapaskwen long enough to make a sweep of the bloody landlords and their lackeys of which my exia is the chief word is you are nikamooskinin the ninth incarnate dont believe everything you hear especially nonsense like that i dont you know nonsense my word on it but could you tell no no dont bother answering it doesnt matter what you are only what people think you are shadith opened her mouth to repudiate that then closed it again the woman was right people would most likely believe what they wanted to believe no matter what she tried to tell them she sighed shivered her clothing protected what it covered from the chill wind sliding down the mountain but her ears and nose were losing all feeling she glanced at uiaras then at the woman beside her try again old shadow if you can get one to buy it maybe the wordll spread my name is shadith my people are dead my guardian was sending me to university to study music when all this running through the familiar litany with no more energy behind the words than she could find for them last time she swept her hand in a looping gesture meant to take in the world and the events that brought her there happened listen my being here means nothing its chance thats all i have no connection with any of you or with this place the others either the woman pattedher arm yes yes she said mama soothing the hurt and angry child slipping the childs words into the internal wasteslot adults kept for such things one hah habit oh habit sad habit i am kati mola shadith blinked mola if i hear right that means no one its the name my daughter took when she left her fathers home she smiled again more easily this time a smile that trembled on the edge of laughter exploded away might be more apt she is a passionate creature my uiaras i never knew where she got it when i left i took that name myself as a matter of pride you understand shadith glanced from kati mola to the younger woman in the entranceway slapping her hand on the ledge but keeping her voice too low for her words to reach them family affair huh and trying to make me one of them no way ahlahlah i begin to see lees problem clearer its so tempting to follow ones passions you could help you know youve seen these things a thousand times why not slip them a little advice show them where theyre weak yeh a thousand thousand times enough to know if they dont do it themselves its worthless its their world let them spend their own blood and sweat on it with thumps and creaking behind her as the gate warder opened the great door uiaras came running down the steps come in come its cold out here the foyer opened into a huge common room woodpaneled hung with tapestries worked in rich earth colors the forms in them reminding shadith of the animal carvings in the treelodge where she woke what three days ago four seemed like a year except for a few areas lit by shellshaded oval bulbs putting out a brilliant white light where individuals were reading or working at needlepoint or embroidery most of the lighting came from oil lamps bronze straps and plates of amber shell that spread a rich golden shimmer over the room there were thick soft rugs on a polished wood floor plump tapestry pillows scattered about among low divans set up by smaller fireplaces of red brick that were spaced along the walls in the center of the room there was a round basin of red brick with a crackling fire in it an inverted funnel over it to catch the smoke and lead it out there were women in small groups and girls young but not prepubescent so they might be considered technically adult in this culture sitting on the cushions stretched out on the divans they wore long robes in dark jewel colors with bands of embroidery about the hems neck and sleeve edges polite and disciplined inside the boundaries of their culture and courtesy the women didnt stare at shadith as she stood in the doorway but glanced at her glanced away again eyes flickering like bicolored leaves flipping in the wind turning and turning as they went on with their conversations their voices a whispering like the leaves of the whisper trees the air was so thick with curiosityfearsuppressed angerhopeawe and lesser emotions that she found it difficult to breathe she turned to uiaras you said something about a bath uiaras laughed clapped her hands sitwa the singer needs a bath having been given permission by this to exercise their curiosity the women and girls came swarming round shadith hanging back just long enough to let the housemother greet her a tall woman with a stem ascetic face that changed completely when she smiled and a black mane liberally streaked with gray and white that fell in crimped undulations down past her waist welcome singer we had hoped you would come to us leave your things here if you will the waters hot and waiting the bath room was fragrant and steamy tiled over floor walls ceiling the bath a tiled pool large enough for swimming races the women stripped off their robes and fell into the steaming water with her splashing and laughing treating her like a baby soaping her lavishly stroking the hawk outline acidburned into her cheek asking a thousand questions about it never pausing for an answer they shampooed her hair exclaiming at its soft springy texture they stroked her skin wondering at its warm brown several shades darker than the darkest of them they wanted to know how old she was where she came from what her family was why shed come to kiskai they clucked and cried out over the sad tale of her abduction hugged her and told her she was welcome theyd take care of her they were curious about rohant they wanted to know if he was her lover or what they were both fascinated and repelled by kikun what was he where did he come from what kind of world could birth such an oddity they hustled her from the water ran her under a warm shower toweled her vigorously and enveloped her in a loose robe of a dark amber velvet with olive and emerald embroidery then they took her off to a meal of thick hot soup fresh rolls and the local tea shadith inspected the fingernail shed glued on to replace the broken one then drew her hand in a sweep along the strings help me with this she saidsang when i play so she demonstrated clap your hands with me thus and thus ah yes yes thats the way thus and thus she sang happiness came by me again clap your hands oh yes oh yes yesterday clap your hands my dears he wouldnt stay i wrapped him in my arms displayed my charms like smoke he slipped away she played a lively tune brought them onto their feet swaying and clapping a counterrhythm then calmed them down and sang sorrow came by me again clap your hands o softly softly and stayed awhile clap your hands my dears to caress and beguile bittersweet is better neat and tastier than honey i would not let him go but he faded so like smoke he blew away they sang for her when her song was done then danced with her while some played flute and some played drums and one plucked strings on a roundbellied gourd time passed unnoticed until it was very late indeed and they fell into bed pleased with themselves and each other and slept away the remnant of the night she woke with a thick head a throat someone had used a grater on a burning cut on her palm from the fake fingernail shed forgotten to take off last nightand a lazy good feeling that rolled like warm water back and forth along her body she yawned and stretched and the silence began to seep in on her the more she thought about it the emptier the building felt her leg twitched and began to itch she curled round under the quilts and scratched at the side of her calf sighing with pleasure at the relief the skin between her shoulder blades began to itch with an explosion of impatience she flung the quilts aside and rolled out onto her feet someone had washed and ironed her underclothing laid it out on a chair the same someone had sponged off her shirt and trousers and hung them over a hook screwed into the door her boots had been polished until they gleamed and were standing by the foot of the bed looking better than they had in years on a table beside the bed there was a tray with a pot on it swathed in a towel an overturned cup and a plate with a warmer lid over it she dressed quickly ate a little then left the room a girl was mopping the hall outside swinging the mop in damp sweeps that barely moistened the flags elbows flying narrow body working with explosive energy to finish a job she detested her distaste so evident it was almost a separate thing walking beside her after a moments effort shadith dredged up her name hasski she called the tray what shall i do about it the girl halted her furious progress looked back at shadith leave it ill take it down when im finished with this ill do it if you point me in the right direction just leave it hasski pushed impatiently at hair straggling into her eyes i dont have time to fool with you im due at work like now she snapped her head around and went back to her mopping shadith raised her brows she leaned against the jamb and watched thoughtfully as hasski mopped her way round the corner moods a bit different come the morning it seems work she cant be more than fourteen fifteen what was it aste said the islanders tolerate no one who cannot earn his way either with a skill or as a weapon against the priests and the pliciks ever children it seems wonder if they know about unions maybe i should drop a hint na keep your nose out of this shadow youre not going to be here long enough to spit on the floor if youre lucky children though maybe theyre in school early for school isnt it not that i know much about schools dont want to know either hmm lets get out of here and see if we can find old lion or kikun it was earlier than shed thought the sun barely clear of the horizon wispy patches of mist lingering in the shadows damp glittering on every surface an erratic breeze blowing from an icebox somewhere licking at her ears and fingers she hesitated on the steps decided she might as well trundle on down to the harbor and wait for the others to show up though this was the heart of the town the street and the structures along it seemed as empty as the hostel as if everyone that lived there had poured forth with the rising of the sun and been swept away her talent confirmed what her ears and eyes told her no one there like hasski said work what work who knows she began walking downhill the heels of her boots loud on the paving several large buildings had an official look their doors with totem forms in circular cartouches carved in deep relief were closed and shades were pulled across the windows the other structures were small rowhouses each sharing a common wall with the next all of them turning a blind blank face to the street one single window in each facade round and set with stained glass and lead canes it was opaque and tarry like a mole on the brow of the house the doors were painted in bright colors with a vertical row of black glyphs along the left side announcing the family lines of those residing behind that door if there were gardens or outside living areas they were around back there were no shops no sign of a produce or fish market not here kiskai had motorized vehicles of all sorts as well as lift sleds and other fliers no traffic on this streetthough she could hear motors grinding in the distance and subdued noises of city living that came to her like sounds in a dream halfway down she heard a child yell then childrens laughter then silence at least they werent all working she thought about that shook her head maybe so maybe not this walk was a paradigm of her experience so far on kiskai outside looking in with never a clue to what was really happening despite the wide variety of her experience with almostalien cultures apparent similarities were still traps and unless you were very careful indeed it was so easy to misread everything what you thought was happening wasnt in an odd way it was easier to deal with complete strangeness she continued along her paradigm nervously amused at the conceit but increasingly unhappy cold inside and out alone she didnt like being alone when ginny left her alone all that time she walked out on him herself everything she tucked her hands into her armpits in search of warmth it was a large town there must be ten twenty thousand people here where were they when she reached the wharves and plunged into the noisy swirl of life there she sighed with relief there were three ships being on and off loaded wharfmen hauling crates and barrels and bales exchanging incomprehensible comments on what she guessed was a game of some kind talking in a local slang she hadnt a clue about seabirds keening cats squawling assorted rodents hissing and shrieking thuds and creaks from the ships and warehouses intermittent roars from the crane mo tors and a cracklesputter from small motorized flats darting about like startled waterbeetles there were metal barrels with fires built in them several portable cookshops with hot drinks and fried whatever adding their lot to the tapestry of smells spilled spices pungent woods numberless nameless things redolent of mystery and mighthavebeen it was all lively and loud and built layer on layer atop the generic effluvium of salt sea shores she threaded through the anttrails of the lading crews stopping and starting a dance where she was doing all the work while her obliviouspartners went their way unimpeded and unconcerned when she reached an empty wharf she stopped to look around an old man sat there on a sacking pillow beside a pile of netting that was discolored and desiccated as a heap of dead leaves after three years rotting his face was bristly with a twoday crop of stubble he had a stained saltandpepper mustache and straggly gray eyebrows faded eyes of an indeterminate color somewhere between watery urine and weak tea his coarse yellowishgray hair was braided into a club that hung low enough to bump against his withered buttocks whenever he moved his shoulders his legs would have been crossed at the ankle if hed had ankles one leg was gone below the knee the other was missing a foot a pair of shears a ball of cord and a shuttle lay on the planks beside him as she walked toward him he was pulling a hank of netting into his lap inspecting it for holes breaks and frayed patches he came across a ragged tear took up the shears cut away broken ends then began the tedious process of mending the hole he didnt seem to be working especially quickly but he was cutting loose and pulling more net past before she reached him she dropped onto the wharf beside him sat with her legs dangling over the edge he gave her one quick morose scan then went back to staring out the mouth of the harbor his bony hands working on their own with no prompting from him a seabird dropped like a stone plunged beneath the surface came up with a fish caught sideways in its beak it paddled lazily on the small subdued waves until it was in the lee of the wharf then it tossed the fish up opened wide to catch it as it fell and squawked with rage as another of its kind came swooping by stole the fish and went flying off with it shadith laughed the sound surprised out of her she got a hooded look from the old man a derisive twitch of hismustache that reminded her briefly of rohant before he darted the kanaweh the local said nothing just sent a gob of spittle arching into the water shadith scratched at her chin old goat wasnt overawed by her godhood not him she was just some nosy foreigner sweet sweet xenophobia almost made her feel at home running into that again town uphill looks like someone pulled the plug whered everbody get to dont they work where you come from his voice was rusty as if he spoke at most two three words a week his hands continued their steady drive servomechanisms with enough internal memory they didnt need help from the mainbrain now and then they did a bit she said now and then a bit here a bit there his mustache twitched now that was almost a smile bet it herniated his whole face should i push it na rohant old lion get your butt down here hanh she sat watching the fisherbirds soar and drop into the littered water sometimes after fish sometimes after bits of garbage bobbing on the low waves from the scum marks on the piles the tide was a handspan below high and dropping with three moons to mess things up they must get different tides every day the local ephemeris be the size of an encyclopedia no wonder we came at a creep the last part of the trip one thing about being reared in a desert you dont get a feel for things like tides talking about deserts and people brought up in themcrawl out of bed you lazy cat im tired of being kicked about its time we started taking hold a rusty grating noise broke her from her thoughts old man clearing his throat she looked around he set the shears down let his hands rest on the net still for once as he fixed a malevolent glare on her word is you workin tnight singin on the comnet that was the first shadith had heard of it could have been something rohant worked out without a word to me tsoukbaraim i get my hands on him nil rip those dreadlocks out one by one teach him to take advantage like that no fool sells me but this fool herself ahlahlah she clicked her tongue shook her head i suppose it could be the locals assuming things well see well see she blinked at the old man sing for my supper hmm noughts free wanish he dropped his eyes to the net began working on the hole you and yours you pay goin rates like evehone else he said it with considerable verve and she knew shed been wrong he didnt question what she was supposed to be he simply saw all authority types as outside himself battening on him and his like leeches with privileges hed never have and they hadnt earned seeing her forced to work for her perks was something he contemplated with a vast surprise and a vaster satisfaction if there were an appreciable number like him asteplikotas rebellion wasnt going to move like he thought it would idiot woman this place may be revolting but its not where the revolutions stirring hmm if the lameness of a puns any measure im about as low as you can get she swung her feet and stared out across the water inventing maledictions for ginny in half a dozen langues and trying to rhyme them inside and across those langues she didnt want to think about what the songfest meant or why she was being squeezed into it she didnt want to think about ginny up there watching everything jerking their strings worse than that creep guard she didnt want to think about him looking at her whenever he wanted to whatever she was doing sometime later there was a change in the noise on the working wharves she twisted around to see what was happening looming head and shoulders over the smaller locals cats pacing beside him rohant came striding toward her she pulled her legs up got to her feet bout time she said he blew his nose into a handkerchief like a small tablecloth tucked it over his belt and glanced past her at the ancient come on he said out there on the horn i think he pointed toward a pile of black rocks near the mouth of the harbor no ears and some sort of lookout i can see the railings yeh i got a thing or two to say he flared his nostrils rat been telling tales so it was you sold me with dyslaera courtesy keeping his teeth well covered he grinned at her and ran the tip of his forefinger claw down her cheek touching her so delicately all she felt was a faint tickle if someone had to play the fool better you than me shithead make that mister shithead sir business agent ill do that soons it rains up cats pacing majestically behind them they strolled to the end of the wharves turned onto a flagged pathway and followed it to the lookout shadith hitched a hip on the top rail well rohant stepped over nagafog and leaned on the rail beside her it was strongly suggested we contrive some way of paying transport and lodging with a hint theyd throw us back if we jibbed poor little naif browbeaten by the local grubbers i dont believe mebbe so mebbe so thing is this is a big enough deal therell be islander yips flying in flying what i like about you kitcat dont need to draw you diagrams flat out it wasnt really a question merely a probe to confirm rohant was thinking what she was she chewed on a hangnail and scowled at the caked scum and decaying seaweed that marked the highpoint of the tides it seemed obvious to her that the only chance they had was grabbing the fastest flitter they could find and making a run for the what was it the kasta whatever and bruteforcing it shooting their way in and rummaging for the skipcom if shed learned anything at all from her dealings with ginny it was that finessing was worse than futile everything theyd tried so far got them wound tighter and tighter in the web we have a choice rohant used the toe of his boot to massage nagafogs ribs the big male opened his mouth let his tongue hang and purred like a magnified kitten jealous magimeez came to her feet and stood rubbing her head against the ciocans leg none i see but its so clumsy so dumb she wrinkled her nose embarrassing even devolving to primitive like this gets your back up you can sit here and moan about grace all i can see to moan about is it probably wont work how you rate the chances between null and nil we see eye to eye on that she flung her head back and glared into the cloudly blue arching over them to eye to eye to eye she shivered hugged her arms across her breasts wheres kikun sleeping swamp thing took it out of him minh so whens this singsing short while after sundown theyve set aside an hour for us to fill you mainly he ran his boot toe along nagafogs ribs looked slyly round at shadith theres a reception afterward touchyfeely for the yips at least thats what i gathered she made a face at the sky slid from the rail and brushed the dust off her behind assuming ginny doesnt decide to ground us kikun fades and acquires a flier while were dancing our jig nay assuming nothing they try to stop us we go through them them whoever shadith shivered i hate this dont we all he dropped his hand on her shoulder squeezed we do what we have to shadow that make it better never mind what happens the rest of the day you get a look at the broadcasting studio then you get to figure out the program then you get to rehearse i get hanh youre in this too me he looked uneasily at her i run a business not a dance troupe and i couldnt carry a tune if you wrapped it up and handed it to me she ran ahead a few steps turned and danced backward examining with exaggerated appreciation his big body and noble head maybe not but ahhh my dear oooh my friend what grand scenery youll make hrosslan he grabbed for her missed as she skipped back giggling scenery my foot scrambling after her he kicked into one of the flags nearly fell over but righted himself before he landed on his face she giggled again prudently widened the space between them foot foot talking of foot foot in mouth disease foot in uh she took another step back fell over magimeez whod slipped around her and crouched on the flags landed on her behind and temporarily knocked the wind out of herself rohant scooped her up threw her over his shoulder and strode off down the path ignoring the fists beating on his back when he reached the first wharf he set her down behave yourself kitcat she balanced a minute between annoyance and amusement then opted for laughter just you wait ro just you wait she inspected him noted the sudden apprehension on his broad face and laughed again come on lets go inspect that damn studio watcher cell the woman sitting at the sewing machine glanced up from her work gaped at something across the dicklocking room the worker next to her noticed the lessened noise snatched a look then began staring on her own the infection spread then the first woman got up and walked out leaving her machine and her work without a word ignoring the shouts of the overseer with the same intensity of purpose the nineteen other women got to their feet and walked out cell the nakiskwen gospah scowled at the screens that took transmissions from his napriests and the kanaweh sleds they rode by courtesy of the nistam who might be a brainless idiot but who had the survival instincts of a wolverine the roads were freckled with walkers heading north heading south all of them bound for the pilgrim way he turned to the napriest standing beside him black vizard pushed back the exposed face more of a mask than the mask itself one thought one had kept the rumors out he said his meager features twisted into a scowl the napriest shrugged one has one has canvassed the confessors and the wik priests no whispers none every wik in the country is clean someone would have heard something about the tattlers if that is how word got through about the avatars if they are avatars and not a fraud dreamed up to catch us napping what news from your sources in kwamitaskwen one wouldnt put anything past that old buzzard nothing there hes got the same problems at a slightly less advanced stage seems to be a factor of distance from the mistiko otcha cicip there was a crack of laughter from the gospah then a series of snorts same problems eh that does bear thinking about oh yes it does cell the gospah of kwamitaskwen listened to the whining complaints from the largest of the plicik landlords concealing his extreme dislike of the man with an ease born of long practice whats one going to do with ones stock huh huh tell one that huh huh they walk out on one they dont need to expect one is going to take them back one two three just like that compensation there has to becompensation the kwamitaskwen gospah tented his hands and smiled blandly at the plicik thickhead one is sure one can arrange for your neighbors to take them in he ignored the sudden dismay on the oafs face as he visioned the loss of all his maka serfs and how much it would cost him to replace them one neednt bother oneself about this small inconvenience as for compensation wall it is the pakoseo year so proclaimed from the heart of the world and landlaws are suspended for the duration ah ones memory becomes more impossible every day but one seems to recall one has not received your assessment yet no problem one is sure obviously your accountant was among those who left cell the room was huge with massive beams in a complicated crisscrossing web of polished wood and broad tapestries on the walls that absorbed the sound from the bright throng circulating slowly about conversation knots like antibodies in an arterial flow and in the middle of all that brightness and glitter the small drab form of the singer and the larger but still drab form of the ciocan the two cats beside him restless and illtempered enough to back off all but the most determined kikun was nowhere in sight cell only one moon of the three was up sisipin almost full and not quite at zenith yet the night was bright with him the few puffs of cloud shimmering llike motherofpears beside the great hall there was a terrace blasted out of the mountain it was littered with ground vehicles and the sleek closed flits of the visiting elite there were no guards no one in atehana would dare trespass or pilfer up here kikun was a shadow and sometimes less than a shadow even to the snooping eye there were times even the eye lost him he wove among the flits putting a hand on one then another and another and so on until he chose the one that pleased him he tried a hatch opened it with no difficulty and slid inside he was out again almost immediately running downhill to the center of the town he turned into a small deserted public garden where hed cached their gear late that afternoon all but the harpcase he gathered it up started trotting back to the terrace and the chosen flit pukanuk pousli paced restlessly back and forth along the width of the bridge he was bored with inaction the ground agents became more redundant as each day passed he had little part in the acquisition and the editing of these scenes and less interest in them he stopped before the central cells and scowled at kikun laboring up the mountain under his load of luggage how long you goin to let em run sir the last word lagged perceptibly behind the rest ginbiryol seyirshi pretended to ignore this minor sniping he could have plotted the growth of the lutes insolence point by point almost used it as a calendar to mark the stages of an operation once the endgame began puk usually came to heel like any hunting dog at the prospect of action but there was a serious question in ginbiryols mind whether the pattern would repeat this time and a fear stirring in him that luck had turned on him that the three he had assembled were something more than they seemed asteplikota and that woman had said it avatars seldom knew what they were his mind told him that was nonsense but a coldness spread through him every time he looked at cell and its neighbors having dealt with that fear by once again refusing to acknowledge its validity he sat watching the eddies of the party and kikuns maneuvers and chewing over what he should do shadith she was a focus of this this unpredictability this growing sense of disaster just ahead he loathed having to abort large sections of a schema and losing much of the nuance hed been cultivating butthis aspect of his plan had been going sour from the moment that girl showed up he was approaching the point where the danger she represented would outweigh her usefulness in fact that moment might be now he lay back in the chair closed his eyes he was not accustomed to so much vacillation ordinarily he saw the right path like a red thread through the weave of events and acted on it without doubt or waffling now it was like fighting through a polluted fog nothing to tell him where to go or what lay ahead of him let them take the flit yes let them he said his placidity as false as the avatars false yes he was sure of that suddenly they were not gods in disguise come to call him to account his real trouble was that it had been too long since the last praisesong he needed the catharsis more than hed realized and it would give him the chance to milk some of the piss out of puk he smiled and stroked the silky head of the simi as his course of action came clear in his head they have done what we brought them for rumor will take care of the rest too bad though i would have liked to see them burn puk take the lander as soon as they are over deep water you can have your fun with themas long as you remove all evidence of what happened to them a little mystery will stir up the animals nicely we can use the disappearance to indict the wapaskwen nistam and increase the intensity of the hatred and rage in the rebels and the lesser castes go now you need to be ready when they move we will let you know the moment the flit lifts off ginbiryol sat where he was for several minutes after pukanunk pousli left then he grunted and straightened up ajeri tiszt get onto makwahkik and let him know there mightstress mightbe an attack on the kasta late this night or sometime tomorrow night ajeri kilavez frowned at him you think theyre really going to get past puk hes hot for them specially that girl hes got a thing for her you know that ginny you know what hes like on a blood trail it might be enlightening ajeri tiszt to rerun the recording of their progress across that swamp there is a synergy about that grouping that i find interesting and it seems to be growing more powerful and more directed as the days pass that is why i have altered my schema you know how much i dislike altering my schemata ajeri tiszt yeh i know right anything else you want me to tell the makh hen or just what you said keep it simple ajeri tiszt he is a subtle man in his way a greedy man he will try to milk all he can from you i hear simple it is chapter maneuverings the lamplight melted kiskomaskins hair to whitegold played lovers tricks on his mobile minstrels face he was taller than asteplikota younger leaner but there was the blood likeness there visible only at certain angles and in certain configurations strongest when she least expected it how is he she said i was worried about him well enough hes tired of course but theres no infection and hes healing nicely he laid his hand lightly on her shoulder it was warm and gentle and meant to establish a subtle dominance she moved off a step and he didnt pursue that line any longer his instincts worked subliminally but very efficiently im glad she said has he talked to you only a few words mostly family matters his eyes were fixed on her face he was smiling slightly going after her with hypnotic intensity it seemed to her he needed adoration like other men needed air and he was very practiced at extracting it especially from women tried to kill you aste said kanaweh they did their best during the first half hour of this cattletrot the yips imported and local had stared then crowded about her and rohant and kikun though they tended to shy away from the lacertine after their first gush of welcome but the moment kiscomaskin and his entourage came in they backed off and left a polite space around him he spent a few words on kikun then aimed himself at shadith his entourage following him though like the others at the party they kept their distance as they listened while he courted her adding their bit to the pressure on her until she couldnt breathe without sucking him in his questioning was much the same as that last night in the hostel who are you whered you come from what do you think of our world aside from those bastards trying to kill you will you help us will you listen to me explain the same thing but different nothing of the womens spontaneity no interest in her beyond what she could do for him no laughter or warmth in the man not below the surface glitter not like asteplikota too much anger too much drive it was hammering at her made her increasingly uncomfortable she couldnt shut him out she must have gone pale because he touched her shoulder again then strolled away to talkto rohant undeterred by the big cats flanking the qom eyeing with lazy insolence anyone who came near one of the men in the entourage looked up as he passed her met her eyes a small man dark with a bony sardonic face a familiar face and so it should be aleytys spent a year in and out of his bed when she was still looking for her mother and shadith was still trapped in the diadem a concatenation of forcelines improbably alive arel the smuggler at it again he wont be selling the kind of arms those types want not him everything else though whatever the hopeful rebel needs hmm free to go in and out ferret down a hole nose about scat when hes finished i wonder no i go near him any of us try it no i imagine he still counts on his talent for sliding to stay loose therell be nothing on his ship hot enough to light a match its fast but ginnys got the high ground and the firepower gods yes and the fire power tsoukbaraim itd be so good to pile in and run for it i didnt run before when i had a chance maybe not much of a chance but something it was probably a mistake i dont know i dont know i dont know joran followed a pace behind as always pointed ears twitching quietly lethal not liking this crowd much but he never did like crowds joran fascinating to be a fly on the wall if he ever went after puk the lute id bet the house on that old killer puk wouldnt know what hit him shed come across arel and loran again when she was in her own body the time on avosing while she was there hunting for grey they were nose to nose for a few minutes at the smugglers market in keama dusta arel joran and her but neither of the men should have reason to remember her she rubbed at the hawk outline burned into her cheek out there for everyone to see and remember a lot of people have odd marks on them she was just another customer passing by unless he got hold of some rumors about what happened later plenty of talk about me and linfyar and the dreamsongs and aleytys sar the man did recognize her he was going to stop hastily she gave him a warnoff a flutter of the fingers as she slid a zipper open an inch and drew it shut again did he get it riiight way to go little man and so he should seeing its him who taught these signs to lee and methough he sure didnt know about me those days i wasnt very visible on the scene gods not like now not when i need a little invisibility he wouldnt break his schedule for her but he was really hooked on aleytys arent they all the men littering her backtrail grey swar come on shadow no time for that if i play this right screw ginnyl i foxed that creep guard ru fox him too right hes signing now what ah what trouble gotcha arel yeh i know your name trouble big mean me a focus keep off danger eye watching everything stomp you like a roach despite the wine glass she was still holding her fingers moved with growing fluency in the abbreviated signs that seemed little more than the ordinary twitches and fiddles of someone bored or nervous slippery little man that he was arel stood chatting casually with joran eyes flicking at her and away fingers acknowledging her signals spelling back to her what she spelled for him aleytys to her get word shadow here need help hurry watch out for glnny seylrshi got the word good you help no no no stay clear get out fast quiet fast quiet he ambled off joran falling into his usual halfpace behind the two men merging without fuss into the crowd gathered about kiscomaskin and the ciocan she gulped down the last of the wine in her glass and glanced around no one was interested in her at the moment some of the locals were clumped in small groups or moving into new ones involved in the politics of sex or power the others were gathered about rohant and kiscomaskin sucking in the exchange between the two men she listened a moment smiled from the sound of his growl rohant was growing impatient liking the pressure kiscomaskin was putting on him about as little as she had and he was getting more of it the leader of the band rah adult male more or less like the locals not some freak like kikun or a child like me where is kikun hope he hasnt run into trouble out there tsoukbaraim more touchyfeelies coming at me we got to get out of here before i lose it and say some things id be better keeping to myself shadith moved about the hall talking nodding smiling until her face hurt drinking too much of the local amtapishka wine which was delicate in flavor but deceptive in potency eating fingerfoods until she was stuffed and sticky and in a rage at having to satisfy the curiosity of idiots while her need to get away grew more and more urgent jauza xenophobes boot the stinking bigot assholes into orbit what do i care let ginny screw them all youre drunk shadow damn right im drunk and im bored and i hate this place and never was a vip worth the powder to blow the arrogant jauz to hell maybe even lee when shes being bitchone sometimes i cant stand her much as i love her weeping mama delicate plant wringing her dainty hands over what she wont stay and help fix tchah every vip in the islands has to be here looking us over i suppose seeing if were what we claim to be never mind we didnt want to come here in the first place working our butts off to get the hell away before some jauzo dickhead gets us killed sar i wouldnt be surprised if theyd like us to be so bent we can eat dinner off the soles of our feet gets iffy playing with gods anything to do the dirty on the main play kissyface with a wetlands slither if hed shit on the nistams foot even the priests look at him holy gospah and his handy torturers in their neat little masks about as holy as a pigturd huh i should apologize to pigs look at him laying down the law to poor old rohant old lion showing his fangs bite the bastard why dont you and were only second billing at this party our spellcasting rebel hes the one thats really it ohhh yehhh golden man playing the prince i like your brother you can go to hell clown na not clown thats insulting little lizard over there at least hes real not you pretty boy hollow man full of hollow sounds all of them echoing me me me gods i think im going to be sick wheres that what did they call it convenience better find it before i decorate the floor with some used hordoves she came back still shaky but feeling more alive the body shed claimed was better than most and it was young enough to recover quickly when abusedwhich shed been doing a good job of just now kikun was waiting for her leaning against the wall looking tired and unhappy the harpcase by his feet she stood beside him a moment the hall stank of aging perfumes and sweaty bodies lampoil and woodsmoke alcohol and spicy food that had been sitting around too long it boomed and twittered with the sound of voices the idle tootling and tunking from the fluteanddrum band up in the gallery lets do it she said kikun straightened slid the strap over his shoulder wait for you outside right pasting a smile on her face she plunged into the fug rohant stood by the door surrounded not too closethe big cats were on their feet tails switching snarling whenever they felt crowded by a herd of flirty matrons his ears drawn back flat against his head under the assault from cascades of silvery giggles most of the judges and the other male yips were at the other end of the hall gathered about kiscomaskin preening while he courted them as assiduously as he had shadith she elbowed her way to rohants side tapped magimeez on the nose touched the ciocans arm ciocan rohant she said firmly i need some fresh air come walk with me she turned her plastic smile on the women you will excuse us a few minutes im sure the cool saltcrisp night was like ointment on a burn she stopped on the steps and sucked in a long breathwhich was a mistake because the alcohol hit her hard she swayed and giggled forgot about ginny listening and tried to tell them about arel and the message but her tongue got so twisted between competing langues all she got out was nonsense rohant snorted with disgust scooped her up and went trotting off after kikun magimeez and nagafog frisking beside him happy to be out of that oppressive crowd sassa came swooping down from a perch high on the facade screeched a greeting to his tierohant and went sweeping away in wide loops gaining height with each turn the terrace was filled with soft sounds that merged into a pillowy quiet lying heavily over the crouched beetleforms of the flits and the smaller groundcars several somethings with wings flew by overhead driven into panic by the presence of the raptor a small rodent with large round ears scuttled from under a groundcar as they moved past it shadith started giggling again rohant growled clamped a hand over her mouth and walked faster eh kikun drivers guards in there he jabbed his thumb at the building behind them theres a room set aside for them easy goes round here he started off heading toward a large flit at the edge of the terrace i loaded the gear in that one over there the black and silver job rohant grunted stopped walking and glared at the sky kikun looked back what rohant shifted his grip on shadith her breathing had slowed steadied she wasnt quite asleep but not far from it im thinking him up there he wants us to get out he couldve stomped on this an hour ago you want to go back in na he looked down at shadith she said it slam ahead hard and see if the momentum will carry us get the door open lets hit the road watcher cell the flit lifted without fuss in the cabin shadith was stretched out on a padded bench snoring a little she lay belly down her face turned to one side flushed and puffy one arm had flopped down the back of her hand pressed into the harsh pile of the khaki carpet covering the floor kikun sat on the floor watching her rohant turned the flit directly west increased speed to maximum and clicked on the ottop he started rummaging through the abdits around the pilots chair grunted with satisfaction as he came up with a book of maps kikun he looked around let her sleep it off shell be all right kikun jerked his right hand in an impatient gesture she is very troubled there are things i dont understand about her dio kikun theres an encyclopedia i dont understand about either of you come round here i want you to do some dowsing for me vaguely uneasy disturbed as much by his uncertainty as by what he was seeing ginbiryol seyirshi watched the flit lift off he turned to ajeri kilavez do you have an answer from makwahkik yet she wrinkled her nose waggled a finger at one of the cells look there you can see hes still down with the gobetween trying to wring more information out of him stupid they got all the yobba has hours ago i could try going through that napriest puks running if you dont mind uncovering an asset for something as unlikely as that flit getting away from puk is what you mean ginbiryol thought you are getting uppity also ajeri my sweet i shall have to do something about that though perhaps you are right this time no that girl changed in the middle somewhere and it was not the wine that did it something happened something unobtrusive that i missed but she did not clever child too clever to trust i had better run that recording again tight focus on her face take care of this business first decide and forget for the moment we will let it rest for the moment makwahkik is not a stupid man he should soon realize the futility of questioning that fool for data he has not got as soon as he returns to his quarters make sure he receives the warning you have alerted puk yeh soons the flit was off the ground ill feed in course data once theyve settled on their line shouldnt be long now yes you sent an eye with puk certainly sir i was sure youd want to see the attack and the outcome its send is coming into long as the avatars are together we can spare one channel yes good i will be at the workstation for some time i do not know precisely how long when the attack seems imminent ajeri tiszt call me certainly sir the simi chattered in annoyance as ginbiryol set him aside but settled to a mutterfilled brooding as his master ignored him and moved with ponderous dignity across the bridge ginbiryol scanned the recordings of the party overview first marking the movements of the three hunting for anyone who seemed to be paying peculiar attention to the avatars nothing much gush and maneuver to get near the girl or the dyslaeror but nothing worth a second thought he reran the record focusing on the girl paying special attention to her moments with kiscomaskin she didnt like him might even call her hostile that surprised ginbiryoland disturbed him he was seldom so wrong about peoples reactions this mistake might be dangerous might mean there was a flaw in his plans a flaw that should be corrected when puk was finished with the avatars butnot necessarily he ran the section with kiscomaskin again but found nothing to justify his unease he fast forwarded past the section where she was standing by herself followed her on her ramble around the room ginny ajeris voice broke through his concentration acerbic impatient puk has the flit in view he frowned at shadiths small drab figure as she started to sway the wine taking hold turned the frown on ajeri he disliked being interrupted and he objected to the tone of her voice but he touched off the replay without comment and returned to the captains chair cell the flit was speeding along a few meters above the water inside shadith was still asleep turned on her side now her knees drawn up one hand tucked under her cheek she was flushed and rosy and lociked about ten kikun was kneeling beside her frowning at her stroking her delicately with his fingertips inspecting them as if they could provide some answers to what confused him about the girl rohant was stretched out with the pilot chair tilted almost flat his feet were on the console and he was dozing a muscle jumping by his mouth the tips of his ears twitching sassa was perched on the armof the co chair dozing the cats were on the floor beside kikun curled up together also asleep kikun looked up startled hed been subliminally aware of the follower but too focused on shadith to let his awareness surface now the danger was too near to ignore he slapped shadlths face shook her when she sat up muttering and blinking he left her and scooted over to rohant shook him ciocan wake up trouble rohant woke fast his feet swung down the chair snapped straight his hands came down on the console and the screen lit up he saw the lander driving toward them ginny soso dio rohant dropped the flit until whitecapped swells were slapping against its base at the same time wrenching it around until it was for a moment racing toward the lander a breath later he flung the groaning flit to one side dropping until he kicked up a cocktail of white spray another breath he jerked the flit up and through another turn then another and another while the ciocan satisfied his need to keep fighting though even he knew it was futile kikun scrambled back to shadith began a shuddering dance cell puk watched the dark bug skim along the waves the image breaking up again and again and seeming to merge with the heaving black water though it wasnt supposed to do that there was nothing in the visisystem that would initiate such interference he worked over the sensorboards for several minutes trying to clear up the trouble but he stopped fiddling when the flit passed the inner ring of the firing range he wanted them as close as he could get them he wanted to taste that death he knew ginny was recording it and him he was greedy for that he wanted to exhibit his lust and its satisfaction hed done this before performed for ginnys productions but this was the first time hed got a part in a major effort a limited edition he began arming his rats and shrikes cursing as he fought to lock them onto a target that was proving as illusive as something in a dream he glared at the screen the flit was in shards the readings were flickering as if the mass of the object was shifting aimlessly about since he didnt have the actual center available he set his pointofaim on the computed masscenter bared his teeth in a feral grin and tripped the trigger on the firing jack as cell blanked ginbiryol seyirshi smiled and folded his hands over his stomach the missiles had ashed the eyes set on the avatars along with their flit in cell pukanunk pousli was leaning forward tensely scanning the screen his fingers playing over the console as he used every sensor available to him to sweep the surface of the sea and the air around him when he found nothing not even debris from the flit he relaxed gotcha he said excited triumph shrilling his voice ginbiryol shifted in his chair ajeri have you reached makwahkik yet i was about to before puk did his pounce you want me to cancel ginbiryol got to his feet stood a moment frowning at the gray emptiness of cell no he said finally tell him what i said to tell him just in case that he pointed at the cell is not as final as it seems if necessary we can prod one of our assets into organizing an attack i think it would be as well to stir things up to a degree makwahkik has become too complacent he has been ignoring our interests ginbiryol followed shadiths progress about the hall as she drank glass after glass of the wine and had increasing difficulty maintaining a facade of courtesy as she dealt with the locals when she found a moments respite half hidden by a fold of tapestry he halted the run and played the sequence over in his mind i made a mistake he thought whatever it was happened after kiscomaskin left her he ran back to the beginning and brought up the image until her face filled the screen slowed the play until he could see every twitch magnified second by second he examined the slow shift of her expressions he saw nothing to interest him nothing nothing then a slight darkening of her eyes as her pupils widened then a tightening of the muscles in her face a change so slight he would have missed it except for the exaggeration of slowtime he cycled through that section until her face loosened up and her gaze went vague again shifted to the beginning of that section took a light pencil and marked what he considered significant changes he thought a minute then slid the pov around until he was viewing the scene from behind her shoulder and started the run as kiscomaskin walked off the mark from the light pencil flared he froze the scene and found himself looking into the eyes of a small dark man saw the pupils dilate recognition quickly suppressed ginbiryol cycled back to the point when kiscomaskin touched the girls shoulder smiled at her and moved off followed by his entourage the man seemed to be one of those he stopped the play went back to the point where kiscomaskin came in yes he thought there he is i do not know him i have not seen him before local i doubt it offworlder smuggler probably and he knows the girl that could be trouble he let the recording run until he was back to the moment when the mans eyes met the girls then froze the scene and drew a circle about the offworlders face he tied into memory and started a search while it was running he turned to the pilot ajeri kilavez was watching him one leg crossed over the other her foot bouncing with impatience come here he said when she was beside him he tapped the screen do you know this man no he knew the girl so whats the point look at him an obvious offworlder have you forgotten who her friends are if she managed to get a message to him do you understand what that means yes did she i do not know yet wake number one and call him up here that first then get eyes to kiscomaskins base set up a grid search the area if you do it properly you should find a lander or perhaps a small starship destroy it as soon as you locate it when you have a moment call puk back tell him to get here fast yes sir questions you want a rush job like get it done an hour ago yes after she left he sat with his hands one on top the other resting on his slight paunch waiting patiently for the search to finish the screen flickered information began to scroll past arel vejtar y kleftis age approx ananile stablized ht cm weight kg idf mks mole left buttock upper quadrant

particular punishment was proposed first entry irsud qv ffynch company records re failure to capture or stop penetration into ffynch co space penultimate entry avosing qv freetrader grapevine re ajin rebellion ultimate entry kiskai qv current recordings ginbiryol contemplated the data before him shadith was too young and too unimportant to have made an impression on the universe so there was no point in searching for a direct connection between her and arel he rubbed at his nose yes he thought why not is there any link between arel and the hunter aleytys the screen flickered cleared filled irsud qv ffynch co reports accd to fynch rep the woman aleytys not yet hunter present at funeral pyre nayid old queen disappeared later subsequent disruption among ruling nayids and shutdown of ffynch

market keama dusta at a time roughly coinciding with presence of aleytys on avosing her purpose there and activities unknown to freetraders i ncals closemouthed with outsiders contact possible but not verifiable ginbiryol scowled blanked the screen he sat tapping his fingers on the chairarm slippery no convictions only one close call registered if he gets off the ground he will be hard to find and harder to catch he brought up the record of the party recentered it on arel sir ah raqab do you know that man raqab number one inspected the face shook his head no sir you remember this one of course he split the screen and pulled up shadiths image yes sir her i remember i understand you know several systems of hand signs hand and body sir i want you to watch these two persons and tell me if they are signing and if so what they are saying what is his profession sir that might help smuggler the systems i know are mostly military sir i understand do what you can ginbiryol fiddled a moment arranged an alternation of frontal images of shadith and the smuggler then sat back and waited for raqab to evaluate and respond there sir see that flutter of the girls fingers as she plays with the zipper thats a warnoff universal his signsi cant read em mights well forget showing him probably he just wants to know what shes talking about ah there shes spelling something i think ah i can make a guess theres enough similarity to flusn basic arel does that make sense something something has a feeling of more warning but i cant read it more spelling aleytys something shadow something ginny seyirshi something a strong warning i think telling him to get away from her fast thats about it yes well thank you raqab you may return to your quarters there will be a bonus added to your stipend to show my appreciation for your efforts thank you sir ginbiryol waited until hed left then he cleared the station and walked slowly back to watch ajeri kilavez at work shed wiped half a dozen cells and was using these to organize the search pattern anything yet early days ginny barely got the eyegrid in place finding that ship has become extremely urgent why dont i send puk over there the landers got the firepower to take out a considerably bigger ship than that smugglers pram is like to be and he could do a backup spiral the grids coarse not enough eyes to make it finer even if i ship out the nearest from the main theyd get there too late to be useful yes do that tell him the smuggler is carrying a message from that girl to the hunter and has the clout to reach her without wasting time it seems he is an old friend of hers were in a nest of them looks like yes it will not be necessary to abort the project if he does slip through the grid she cannot possibly arrive in less than three months it will all be over by then when you get finished there start the assessment for planting the banger when we go we leave a cinder let her deal with that if she can chapter how come were still alive shadith woke in a chill rolling yawing darkness fighting back the vomit that rose in her throat she groped about by accident or the planning of the designer one hand bumped a button and a light came on behind her head pale whitish gray she was in a narrow tube with rounded ends like a gel capsule the uncomfortable hardness pressing on her legs was her harpcase the lump that prevented her knees from straightening was her travelpouchshe squeezed her eyes shut memory came in fragments kikun shaking her out of a sodden dreamridden sleep at first it seemed just more nightmare when he told her they were about to die kikun dancing rohant diving toward her scooping her up throwing her into aid an escape capsule her head banging on something hard thats it out lights and slide escape capsule she fumbled around found a tube marked water pulled it from its clip and sucked in a mouthful of stale lukewarm liquid her throat felt better immediately but her stomach cramped and she had to swallow fast to keep her dinner down ginny must have decided we were too much trouble for whatever benefit he got from us sent puk to erase the mistake sar the lute must have enjoyed that hes wanted to do me since the first time he laid hands on me so why am i still alive only one answer to that kikun clowndancer god he saves us one more time and im going to join his congregation did he get out too rohant the cats well dont lay about biting your nails shadow have a look and see after another cautious sip at the watertube she closed her eyes and reached seabird like those she watched in atehana bay out past his usual round he was gliding in wide circles shifting from thermal to thermal the joy of flight permeating mind and body she settled in him enjoyed the flight for a few moments then took hard control of his brain and scanned the water her capsule was a bright yellow pill riding on the glittering blue swells alone being blown along by a strong wind away from the faint line of red that marked the horizon blown west dawn at my back dont see land either way just a bunch of clouds how far out are we she sent the seabird spiraling higher then drove it toward the dawnline two capsules bobbed close together when the bird flew over them shadith tasted at them the cats mad as hell both of them id hate to be the one opens those capsules hmm means im heading the right way i think the bird was growing restive she tightened her hold and sent him on still no sign of land long way to swim ah thats a relief two more capsules floated between adjacent swells she tasted at the nearest and smiled kikun unmistakable in good health as far as she could judge she blinked and sassa hes got sassa in there with him poor damn bird must be going woowoo shut up like that no ah well i suppose thats kikun too rohant in the next irritated and bored arent we all are not we all first thing get together all right fishbreath go where you want and dont i wish i was you she lay back and closed her eyes her throat was still a disaster her head was throbbing and her energy level was so low even dying was too much of an effort to contemplate at that moment i suppose i should eat something these things are bound to have emergency rations tubes of glop gah after a few minutes of poking around she found a cache of hipropaste tubes labeled in interlingue part of the stores the locals acquired when they bought the flit from some freetrader gods only knew when she squirted the grayish paste into her mouth hastily washed it down with gulps of water it was worse than anything anyone had told her maybe it was the sensory equipment of this body that made the stuff so foul maybe the gunk was turning rancid whichever was the case though it did its work settled her stomach more than a little improbably and cleared her head she shuddered gulped some more water and started searching for a seabeast large enough and with the necessary conformation to act as a pushboat sar this is getting to be booorrrring get em up ride em ow cowboy or should i say cowgirl get your nose up whale and shove funny looking whale a double dozen legs and a grin like a buzzsaw slithers big brother and i do mean big nudge me along not like that dammit the way pm collecting bruises i could set up as the tattooed lady any fair ease off ease off thats it almost there easy now eeeeasy ouch damn blessings be nothings broke not even me poor old nagafog hes in a mood to chew nails cant say i blame him knocked about like this all the time and shut in some subrate cousin to a tin can now how do i work this line up the pills hey the things smarter than i thought and it likes this game thats right baby pitapat us along eeeeasy these pills got breakable innards thats right one two threestraight ahead thats a lovely little sea monster pitapat gently gently and on we go sing a song of silliness pocket full of peas four and twenty tentacles awhippin up the seas heyyyy baby talk about whipping along were smoking it up making the algae cry uncle gods im getting seasick this is no way to work off a hangover why oh why did i drink all that amtapishka squeezing uhoh were getting close what do i want to do now this is working fine thing is can the toothfarm out there handle five these capsules must be putting out some kind of beep we could sit and wait for someone to pick us up i dont want to sit about waiting im tired of playing clever and looking so hard ten steps ahead i dont see the hole in front of me lets do it theres some kind of land straight west if we go far enough all right my little motive power line up the pretty yellow pills and shove it was not a comfortable ride the seabeast played with the capsules as he pushed them along tapping and turning them until shadith felt like a pea in a rattle at times she thought of calling it off before the lot of them were battered into mush but she didnt the sea was shallowing the land had to be getting closer whats that beasties getting nervous what there was a dull throb growing louder and louder a pulsing in the water she heard through the swimmers ear patches a noise that made the beast twitch all over surf reefs hold on lil monster a bit farther and maybe we can break out and swim to shore the beast screamed suddenly she felt the swell and scrape of the shout in her own throat he fought her hold and because shed been driving him lightly just a touch now and then to keep him moving he broke free and began swimming frantically for deeper water shadith let him go she didnt understand his panic but she felt its power through the link that joined them and knew shed better look round for what touched it off when she reached she found sweeping spirals of seabirds filling the skies that many birds they wouldnt be more than a kilometer or two offshore would they ahlahlah i wish i knew more about the sea she slid into one of the larger birds and scanned the water around the capsules tsoukbaraiml not surf steamer somethings pumping smoke out that funnel a warship of some kind bow could slice onions and look at those cannons coming like its tails on fire sari might as well be yelling get out of my way ill stomp you if you dont no wonder old toothface split and what you bet its coming for us yeh its slowing stopping didnt know you could stop in the middle of the ocean like that the capsule split around her hands were reaching in pulling her out pulling out the harpcase and her travelpouch the wind was very cold and the sudden brightness of the morning sun was like broken glass her legs were shaky and her knees kept threatening to unhinge so she was grateful for the arms that held her upthough she didnt much like the avid curiosity in the faces of the young navas pressing about her she blinked and pushed awayand saw they were about to open nagafogs capsule even without trying she could feel his rage and bloody intent wait she cried or thought she did the word was a croak and dropped like a stone impatiently she pushed at the hands that reached for her again and halfran halffell across the short stretch of deck to the capsule that was already beginning to crack open she wasnt worried about the navas he might bloody one or two of them but she knew only too well hed be shot before he had a chance to get a good massacre started and she couldnt see any reason for wasting a creature only doing what his nature demanded besides she was a lot fonder of him than she was of this world or its people hoping theyd hesitate to shoot a girlchild she flung herself in front of the big cat and froze him as he shoved his head and forelegs through the gap dont open any more of them until i have him calm she screamed this time she was loud enough to be heard as she worked with nagafog rubbing at his head stroking under his chin touching all his peacepoints she heard the shouted order to keep away from someone with a loud voice and the arrogance of command then she heard muted mutters the scrape of feet on the metal deck thats a good lil kicat she murmured goood baby i know i know stuck in the dark and banged around like that goooood cat pretty cat looove the cat nagaaa fogeee nagee goood cat let those little muscles go loose thaats it goooood cat she laughed as she felt the tension flow out of him and heard a basso purr break loose all right baby you sit there and enjoy and ill unpack magi for you she got to her feet looked calmly around until she spotted the pihtatipli captain of a steamship leaning over rails about a platform of sorts that was the flat roof of a flit cradle she smiled at him knowing he thought he was safe up there from her and the cats fool nagafog can jump twice that from a standing start and will if you give me cause she turned her back on him and located magimeez pointing to the capsule she said that one next open it and give me room to work then you can open the others theres no problem with them sassa stood on the deck shaking himself flexing his wings then he screamed his anger and delight and launched himself into the wind cold wet wind that fought him until he won control of it and soared free kikun leaned against shadith shrunken and shivering his skin a nubbly greengray rag hanging lank on his bones once again hed half destroyed himself to save them this time from puks malice and his missiles magimeez and nagafog were stretched out on the deck beside the ciocan making their muscles ripple and switching their tails pleased with the attention they were getting rohant was ignoring everyone with gloomy intensity working the knots out of his muscles and his temper they were surrounded by awe battered by awe rohant might pretend to ignore it but he felt it kikun fed on it used it to plump himself out againwhich disturbed shadith despite her fondness for the little man and all she owed him she fought the smother and heard dimly the pihtatipli yelling orders to his men after this is over id better get lee to show me how to block inflow or im going to burn out this reading thing keeps getting stronger on me she rubbed at her eyes shivered moved closer to rohant using him and the cats to shield her from the emotional battering watching the three every spare moment the navas shut down the beepers and dropped the capsules overside cracked open so theyd sink to the bottom and stay there shadith watched them go with considerable satisfaction puk thought they were dead or he wouldnt have gone off and left them if he ashed the eyes maybe even ginny thought they were dead she sighed unfortunately that wouldnt last long the pihtatiplis ambition was skunk strong the minute he hit shore half the world would know what he fished from the sea ainairil seems like weve spent a year trying to get there and now id rather not go wonder if arel got off all right should i tell the others about him no hes the jack up my sleeve my wildcard definitely we should go for the skipcom best to have two shots make sure one gets through hunter the pihtatipli was leaning over the rail again looking eager the ciocan stared back what will you come below you will be more comfortable shadith sniffed pulled her mouth down almost wagging his tail and so he should how hes planning to use us come on ro give him an answer im freezing my ass off out here as soon as the three were settled in the tiplis quar ters the pihtatipli hovering hospitably leaving the running of the ship to his second the engines were brought up and the destroyer began racing for the harbor at ainairil watcher the cluster of cells focused on the pilgrim road were filling up with hordes of people as if the countries along the road were draining into it ginbiryol seyirshi scanned them repeatedly tightening the focus onto individual eccentricities of the pilgrims rejecting all but a few of the images blending the remnant into a collage to heighten the feel of a swarm building toward an immensity powerful enough to eat the land rebel activity in nakiskwen west coast kwamitaskwen central plains kwamaskwen north plains and swamiskwen south coast dipped to nothing as the population decreased to a skeleton of skeptics and thieves public and private in wapaskwen east coast where the mistiko otcha cicip was where everyone was going the rebels were growing more frantic more disorganizedmore violent ginbiryol clucked with satisfaction as he tasted and took scene after scene of burning and bombing of streetfights and stoning of kanaweh and kipaos killing and being killed of napriests on the question floor doing torture by the numbers because there was too much work for personal attention what had been art was now mechanical process the pliciks drew in on them selves retreated behind armed guards bars and a hardening resistance to change ginbiryol labored steadily at his assemblage until he heard an exclamation from ajeri kilavez he looked up what is it jeri tiszt smugglers pram hes offworld and scooting for the limit puks on his tail no chance of catching that pram but he might get a missile off in time yes there it goes missed shit language ajeri tiszteh continue please puks after him more missiles the pram must have a slide shield its slipprier than a bead of mercury puks dropping behind fast ive never seen anything go like that sublight specially that size puks still trying but he hasnt got a hope you want me to keep on no call him back there is no point in continuing this have you begun the crust assessment yet the kephalos is working on that now she touched a sensor scanned the readout itll be finished in approximately twenty minutes you want a preliminary or shall i call you call me he went back to his editing dumping and saving cutting and juxtaposing focusing down or expanding to wideshots cell children with pakoseo ribbons tied in their hair clapped hands in a circle dance about other children who were swinging folded paper birds from strings tied to long slicks they shouted the nataminaho song the hunter singing to the birds and beasts he is coming nataminaho the hunter is coming run before him for he will take you to feed the people around them the marching adults smiled indulgently but stopped them after a short while so they wouldnt exhaust themselves and have to be piled on the supply wagons in order to keep up with their families in that grueling all day day on day on day march cell fires dotted the plain from horizon to horizon along the pilgrim road north and south east and west ghostdancers in black and white paint came out of the dark and danced their secret subversive and very sacred mime tales they danced to ancient music music that belonged to them alone that was never heard outside the secret societies except on the pakoseo trek music that was forbidden by the gospahs and lightside priests of all degrees music that brought the singer musician or dancer instantly to the question if he was discovered the list was endless that name roll of ghostdancers forced to deny and abandon their rites their dances their music whole families seemed to lose ancient hidden traditions but the patterns survived the music lived the dances were performed and passed on generation to generation and every pakoseo had its ghostdancers as if the earth herself spawned them in swarms too vast to count cell tagwit priests stirred the vast cauldrons of beans and soup starting new pots as soon as one was emptied day on day on day dishing out bowls of food to the horde marching past a meal three months long without interruption more supplies came in every day meat animals from the plicik ranches beans and rice from the collective farms the pakoseo assessment given freely by some and grudgingly by others soup and beans beans and soup steam curling up from the cauldrons odor of sanctity pleasing in the nostrils of oppalatin cell grumbling under his breath the kana climbed into the flit this is gettin to be like work weeshk we mights well be fuckin plainboys chasin fuckin bos out n the fuckin grass shut up wakso you worsen a sore toe sit down and strap up we got a job to do mights well get at it kaweeshk waited until his sour grumbling partner was settled then he thumbed the starter the flit exploded molten metal and metal shards slammed into other flits garaged at the kasta they began to burn fuel caught there were more explosions alarms were clanging there was confusion panic that gradually devolved to order as a few effective leaders appeared when the fire was out two men stood by the twisted sooty rail of a walkway bomb one said at a first guess one would say packed with thermit the second man was in such a rage he was trembling he slapped his left hand against his leg again and again and again a dreary monotonous slap slap slap that he didnt realize hewas doing after a long tense silence he said them not much doubt of that in here too looks like weve got rats in the walls who was it in the flit one doesnt know it doesnt matter a brace of scuts on street patrol no one important he grabbed the rail with both hands shook it may their souls rot in hells cellar its deliberate provocation no question and theyre going to get what they asked for come on one has to report to to the math hen how long before one has your assessment of the debris cell shadows flickered from house to house night in the maka quarter was busier than a broken anthill flits whined overhead stabbing searchlights into the murk missing with an impatient inevitability everything they were trying to find squads of kipaos marched with equally ineffectual arrogance through the potholed twisting streets of the quarter shining the beams of their hand lumens into the sidestreets blind alleys the barred windows and the recessed doorways of the crumbling structures that passed as houses in this part of the sprawling city they were terrified sweating with it and stinking despite their armor and their weapons and the poverty of the people they were hunting the smells the shadows that moved in the corners of their eyes but vanished when they swung round to confront them the miasma of rage and hatred that stirred like smoke in the rancid air all this spooked them more and more several times a number of the younger recruits shot holes out of the air or blew up piles of garbage they were growled at warned of punishment detail when they got back to barracks it didnt help their immediate fear was too great cell in the village three bodies were laid on improvised biers before the village wikhouse the mehewik a boy and two girls none older than seven the wik priest stood on the steps of the mehewik and spread his hands in helpless grief he could not meet the accusing eyes of the maka nor could he blame them whatever happened hed pushed for a probe into the deaths pulling every string he could get his hands on though he was warned off told he would be severely disciplined if he persisted he even tried to reach the wapaskwen gospah but all that brought him was a visit by a triad of napriests and an order from the gospah to cease and desist if he wanted to retain his seat if he refused he would be declared contumaceous and brought to ainairil for reeducation at the hands of the question he was from a relatively poor but unusually gifted kiser family and was deeply devoted to the service of oppalatin and to the poor ones beloved of god the make working the soil who were his own children the wik priest looked at the dead children and their kin and was bitterly angry at the hierarchy at the greed and the maneuvering for influence and power the corruption of those who should have cared for these little ones he sighed and stared down into his open hands then quietly took off his cassock stood there shivering in his underwear wait he said he tossed the cassock into the dirt beside the steps and went inside when he came out he had on the trousers and sweater he wore when he worked in the garden he left the door openbehind him andcame down the steps to join the men ill bring him out to you he said what you do do it quickly and without unnecessary pain he is a beast not a man give him the swift death of a beast they went silently to theispisaco but the man they sought was not there and no one would say where he had gone cell cell the thin wiry man sat at a kidney shaped table scanning papers with a nervous rapidity jotting a few words on a pad with each when one padsheet was filled he tore it off and spiked it brilliant morning sunlight streamed through the wall of windows to his left touched his face with an innocent unintended cruelty exaggerating the hunger in it the neediness that was the outward aspect of his ambition the coldness and amorality in the man a soft chime broke the gently rustling silence the man scowled thumbed a button down yes the aides voice was a calm drawl baritone verging on bass he had perhaps been chosen as much for the quality of that voice as for his administrative skills piskwakan from the port asks to speak to you makwahkik sape he will not say why save that it is very important and something you have expressed strong interest in recently will you speak to him makwahkik drummed his nails on the desk tell him scramble put him on makwahkik sape we have them we have the avatars the scrambler turned piskwakans voice scratchy and shrill but the words came through clear enough to turn the listeners face weaselhungry how a moments silence as the portdirector got his facts in order makwahldk was an impatient man just after dawn the sd picked up a distrees call corning from out toward the islands emergency beepers on a clutch of escape capsules the kiyakipao on duty had instructions to whistle me up if something like that happened was a tip from a local mouth he said something important was coming at us hes a straight mouth gives us good whistles bit he said maybe even kiscomaskin or his bro was a destroyer in port ordered it out to collect the capsules bring em back softly softly something peculiar the capsules were all over first then they were in one lump bumping together then they started moving shoreside pihtatipli brought back tracings to verify this also photos of the capsules standard types with no motive power also photos of the avatars and the beasts one collected all those prints and films both one will send them with the avatars there is um a complication the pihtatiplis an ambitious man and a brainless twerp but a twerp with powerful connections they bought his commission otherwise he wouldna got near a ship hes swore to keep his mouth shut but hell spill the whole with his first bottle of pishka squeeze one wouldnt waste your time except hes not just a plicik hes some sort of eighth cousin to the nistam out of ones league you want one will order him to patrol the swamp trouble is he makes one corn call and one gets ones butt kicked and he gets the order quashed one has been able to muzzle him for the moment but hes getting impatient so over to you friend you want to fetch this lot or shall one shove them into a flit and ferry them over to the kasta send them what about the destroyers crew theyve seen the avatars and they know damn well what they were looking at one can shut them up onboard the ship for twentyeight hours no more even then therell be rumors leaking off before a third of that time has passed this is a port makwahkik sape you know what that means right give one six hours you can manage that this is good work piskwakan sake one owes you and one wont forget opplas boon friend makwahkik clicked off the corn went back to drumming on the desk after a few minutes of this he toggled the speaker nahwac arrange highsecurity quarters for three therell be a flit arriving in the next ten minutes have it put down in the whisper court clear out that part of the kasta i want no one looking out those windows have them brought to me as soon as theyre in ill be here if you need me before then ajeri kilavaz swore she listened a moment longer then called out ginny get over here the shit is hitting the fan and we could end up covered in it ginbiryol seyirshi frowned at her but said nothing he crossed the bridge and stood beside her watching the screen what is he talking about then i was right it was not as simple as it seemed it would be does puk know ajeri kilavez shook her head he wont answer com i expect he will follow the smuggler all the way to teegahs limit keep trying for him you know puk how stubborn he can get yes how did they manage it ginny that flit had the defenses of a newhatched gnat theres no way it could shrug off a seekershrike it is my feeling that puk was shooting at ghosts if he hit the flit at all it was empty by then with the escape capsules registering as fish if they registered at all remember the swamp ajeri tiszt that lizardman has some dangerous talents the assessment ready theres a rift in the ocean floor about a thousand kilometers off the east coast same latitude as ainairil the mantle is thinnest there drop the banger in that and goodbye kiskai you want me to lay the egg ginny no i do not want to take chances with it there are too many luck strands weaving down there we will prime and lay it just before we leave i would like to have a record of the event but i think better not you got it sir anything else not at the moment jeri we will watch and wait chapter ainairil at last it was a big room filled with light light from the ceiling strips light pouring through the ceilingtofloor windows at one end it was meant to express the power and importance of the man behind the broad tablethe nishmokkipsao makwahkik head of the secret policeand it did the side opposite the windows broke open into a smallish alcove where the shadows not permitted in the main room almost but not quite obscured the art deco bulk of a skipcom shadith saw it seconds after she stepped through the door touched rohants arm he saw it met her eyes one brow raised why not she murmured rooms mine thats yours when they were being hustled closer to the table kikun quiet behind them the cats left in the anteroom with sassa the pihtatipli kept trying to push past them to get to the nishmok but the quiet aide kept a firm grip on his arm and held him in place by the door the squad of guards spread into twin horns on either side they looked alert enough they had to the nishmok was their ultimate boss but they werent really expecting the three to act up or cause problems for them kikun rohant and shadith had carefully cultivated a mild bewilderment that engendered a cozy degree of carelessness in their escort on three she said one she moved away from him drawing a pace ahead of the guards looking around playing the child again with a childish eagerness that disarmed those guards and even the nishmok her smile widened into a grin as she saw that two she moved faster reached the table several paces ahead of the rest three she sprang at the table slapped her hands down wheeled over it landing a solid kick on the chest of the nishmok knocking him back before he could reach the alarm sensors of any weapons if he had them there she hit the carpet and came onto her feet with the darter in her hand took out the one guard who reacted quickly enough to get his gun up pressed the business end of the darter into the nishmoks nape as the swivel chair rebounded from the wall and he caught at the table to stop its gyrations dont move a hair or youre dead look at the guard and youll see what i mean on the count of three rohant charged for the alcove scattering guards like gamepins by the time shadith was making her speech he was at the console bringing the skipcom online when shadith vaulted across the table kikun slipped to the door and had it open before anyone noticed him he whistled softly the cats came bounding in and trotted over to rohant they settled by the arch like totem beastwards huge and beautiful and deadly speaking beyond the physical to ancient archetypes in the kiskaid psyche pulling the guards eyes irresistibly to them commanding the pihtatiplis attention even the aide lost his calm and stared still mostly unnoticed kikun relieved a guard of his sidearm and stationed himself at the door the action had taken less than a minute going as smoothly as if theyd spent hours rehearsing it the nishmok sat quite still he was more angry than afraid but above all else he was controlled shadith could feel him plotting she didnt mind that it would most likely keep him occupied long enough for the ciocan to get the message out rohant stepped to the arch shadow the corns blocked i think i can get through but itd be quicker if i had the access codes he folded his arms stood with his eyes fixed on the nishmok want me to do some arm twisting shadith tapped the nose of the darter against the back of the nishmoks neck tell the man oinkoid wont mess up your arrangements its private business were into he stared at the door muscles knotting along his jaw when he spoke his voice was harsh flat one of my kanaweh is dead too bad he wouldve killed me if i let him look lets get this over with you think i dont know what youre doing keep your hands on the table buuk longer you hold us here the bigger the chance we trip over our own feet right never mind i dont need an answer to that and my leonine friend over there be doesnt need the password he can get round your blocks soonern you think they wont be complicated will they just something to keep the unauthorized offline and not many of those reach this far right ro better get at it you might even break through before i have to shoot someone uhhuh you heard me primo pig pig oh merely something i picked up in my researches ancient epithet you get the gist im sure another item for your consideration the darts in this weapon dont have to hit anyplace special they explode but its the poison that kills you saw how fast your kana died its painless almost merciful you might say certainly compared to your methods what ive heard of them tell you what ill let you pick my next target im going to shoot one after another until you give ro the word which ones it going to be the man sat rigidly silent abruptly she saw it wasnt going to work to answer her would be to diminish himself in front of witnesses and he wouldnt do it for a threat she was going to have to dart someone no shadow be honest kill someone damn theres no way i can justify stupid stupid stupid painting myself into a corner like this well keep on keeping on if i have to back down i back down no point in anticipating the debacle though well see what we see maybe the bastardll buy it no preference well looks like eeny meeny miney mo and phut to you she stepped back from the nishmok keeping the darter steady on him while she let her gaze drift around the room lingering briefly on one then another of the locals her eyes as shallow and emotionless as those of the cats pretending to herself as well as to the locals that she actually would shoot one of them if she had to magimeez yawned stretched out over three meters of live black power she left the arch and strolled among the guards nosing at them pawing at them claws out growling deep in her throat as she circled the room the tension in the air thickened until it was almost unbearable there was a stir at the back close to kikun the aide came smoothly through the arc of guards hands out and empty he stopped a few paces from the table theres no point in this he said hunter nahwac ignoring or forgetting shadith the nishmok leaned tensely forward his hands flattened on the table top no yes nishmok i repeat there is no point in putting more lives at risk for so little hunter rohant stepped into the arch what is it nahwac glanced nervously at makwahkik straightened his shoulders his mind made up silitipisim that will open channels out thanks he ducked back got busy with the sensorpad the aide looked past the nishmok singer you have what you want put the weapon away when the ciocan is finished then well well talk about it in the alcove rohant had switched to dyslaer and was talking rapidly to someone apparently one of his family shadith could hear the satisfaction in his voice though she couldnt understand the words the aide listened frowning confused his calm eroding with every minute that ticked past hed tried to take on himself an action that the nishmok would not could not entertain it was his duty and his pleasure to facilitate for mikwahkik hed done it so often and so well that his move was as close to automatic as a reasoned act could be but now he was beginning to think hed misread the situation for all he knew rohant might be calling death onto kiskai or if not on kiskai on themrevenge for his kidnapping his capture or their previous attempts to kill him shadith didnt need her talent to read his uneasiness she could see it in the shift of his eyes their flick flick flick from the arch to the nishmok and back as the incomprehensible conversation in the alcove continued the spitting growl of the dyslaer stopped abruptly and the whine of the skipcom cut off rohant came to the arch thats there was a crashing noise a stinkan agony in her shoulder then nothing watcher cell irritated ginbiryol seyirshi frowned at the blank prime cell then shifted to as the girl sprang across the table he sucked at his teeth and cuddled the pet as he watched her take command of the room watched rohant race for the alcove and the skipcom i knew better he thought i knew it was fatal to break the schema but i panicked yes that is the truth naked and there they are carried willthey nillthey directly to that corn luck was taking his hide off inch by inch and he was not enjoying the process when puk got back he would have to stop putting off the praisesong too involved he thought i am neglecting the lady she punishes neglect oh yes a quick sidelook at the pilot yessoon for more than one reason ajeri tiszteh you had best find another three eyes and sensitize them to our avatars it looks like they will be with us for a while all the eyes are deployed ginny i dont have to tell you a worlds a big place even a world like this with just one major landmass you got any preference where i lift them stroking the head of the simi he considered the question take three from irils streetscene bank use those replace them as soon as you can by shifting eyes off the pilgrim road it has settled to a rather placid mass there is little useful in that march and a lot that is tedious start with the westernmost eyes shift them east thin out the ones on the road move them closer cluster them in wapaskwen you need not rush unduly ajeri tiszteh we should have another two months before the culmination he stopped talking stared at cell as chaos broke out in makwahkiks office cell rohant shut down the sldpcom and came tbthe arch thats the crack of a pellet gunshadith blown back against the wall failing in a sprawl behind the table rohant roared and charged at the muzzle flash and the pihtatipli who was yelling and laughing and waving the antique he wore at his belt a large bore muzzleloader considerably older than he was full of himself for doing what the nishmok and his array of guards couldnt manage to accomplish there was a shriek from kikun that soared into the supersonic then the lacertine blew the top off the pihtatiplis skull with the pistol hed taken from the kana guard rohant roared again satisfaction and commendation saturating the sound he swung round heading for shadith but pulled up at a bellowed command from the nishmok the kiskaid had scooped up the darter when shadith dropped it and now was swinging it between him and the cats stand back and call off your beasts or one will kill them then you rohant whistled magimeez and nagafog to him and stood with a hand on each head let me look at her is she dead makwahkik ignored him nahwac take the gun from the dancer the rest of you get out of here and keep your mouths shut or one will have you playing heretic for trainee napriests back off hunter i mean it you come a step closer and youre dead as that fool far more aware than anyone else in the room even his aide how much the death of that idiot plicik was going to complicate all their lives he watched the kanaweh file out he didnt expect his reputation or his threats to keep them silent long they had to disappear one more count to set against those interfering offworiders he scowled the hunter to silence and stood watching the girl bleed until he heard the door to the outer office close then he transferred his scowl to the corpse leaking brain and blood onto his rug if there ever was an unused organ he said nahwac get an emergency team up here the girls alive her shoulders a mess but its nothing serious you have the names of those guards yes sir you want one to send cipapil and his crew to deal with them yes scrub the flakes and dump that he jabbed a forefinger at the dead plicik in the eel vats get onto piskwakan tell him you know what to tell him the medics make it doctor meskew and his mutes tell him to bring a bodybag for the kana one wants a reading on the poison if he can manage it one doesnt expect miracles chances are its something organic and impossibly complicated besides being offworld muck the girl goes to the infirmary in this building if she has medications in her gear tell meskew and his to try them first oppalatin only knows what her internal workings are like she looks normal enough but make sure meskew knows better than to take that as given i want a noleak seal on that room a roundtheclock watch on her make sure the guards know one will have them hung from their foreskins if half a whisper slips out get hold of ocipahweh one doesnt care what hes busy with one wants him for them jab of his finger at rohant and kikun have him and his men take them to the quarters you got ready for them signal through when meskew gets here the doors going to be locked and barred until this mess is cleaned up yes sir if ocipahweh is outcity one seems to remember he went into the wetlands two days ago youre right one had forgotten call him in he should be here within the hour meantime hmmm when you get a minute take them over yourself with a squad of kanaweh take men you can trust a tight sour twitch of his mouth or men we wont miss hmm ajeri tiszt have you got through to puk yet no but hes on his way back better have the tranx ready hes going to be in one of his things see to it when he is capable of reasoned discourse bring him here may take a while we have time there is no hurry now the avatars have seen to that ginny yes never mind ginbiryol watched the fourth cell a few moments longer grunted as the medics carried shadith out and the aide led rohant and his beasts and kikun away then he went back to his scan of the developing scenes in the other cells chapter squeezing the voice of a gnat burring in her ear shadith drifted up out of a drug haze blinked her eyes open and stared into the face of a stranger who the word was a breathy croak barely loud enough to break through the hum of the airconditioning one is the gospah ayawit child he tired to brush the hair from her sweaty forehead but she jerked away from his hand though she paid for it with a swimmy halffaint when her vision cleared she saw the affronted look on his face saw that he was contemplating forcing his touch on her and she saw the moment when he changed his mind he folded his hands across the bright beadwork panels on the front of his black robe and bent over her dark and ominous and more frightening than she liked to admit what is your name he said he had a rich rotund voice that dripped over her like melted butter and that was frightening also she shivered closed her eyes here we go again do i tell the tale or do i say hell with it ahlahlah i fell like shit fried what happened anyway i was shot i think i remember the sound of it the pain gospah gods aste said question i cant stand the pain came back as the painkillers wore off her stomach turned over and waves of weakness muddled her head what are they giving me what kind of muck under the sheet she closed her hands into fists shadith she said wearily what are you nothing to you she opened her eyes a moment let them droop shut again why did you come you think i want to be here she lay silent a mopent then went into the tired litany shed produced so many times before speaking in a muttering whisper telling herself she didnt care if he heard her or not what could he do to her she knew all too well what he could do but she didnt want to think about that her talent floated around her amoebic and restless without direction it passed over him tasted him she had no sense he believed anything he heard but she kept on until she finished why do you claim to be an avatar i dont she said and turned her head restlessly back and forth on the pillow they never changed the questions not even their order the pain was getting worse a pneumatic drill working on her shoulder she was hot sweaty the sheet was wet with it clinging to her she wanted to push it off but she couldnt seem to get it loose someone came in the room took that fool away who was trying to dig answers out of her she didnt have that vulture that picker over of bleeding souls that iron maiden made flesh compressing thought to fit a rigid mold someone else eased the sheet off her bathed the sweat from her face and shoulders and smoothed a damp cloth down her arms she felt a prick in her arm a burning that spread upward from her elbow then the pain was a bubble floating away away from her as she dropped deeper and deeper into a rocking blackness she slept ate slept woke again with someone standing over her the nishmok makwahkik this time she closed her eyes she didnt want to see him he wanted to know everything about her and rohant and kikun about the explosion of the flit about how they escaped the harrowing of the swamp about asteplikota about kiscomaskin about the islands why and how they ended up in the capsuleshe threw question after question at her prypicks meant to dig out specific nuggets of data she said nothing just lay with her eyes closed wondering when the painkiller would wear off this time and if the nurses or doctors or whatever they were would throw him out too he waited for a beat between questions to give her a chance to answer then went on with his onesided inquisition until he finished his list and stood silent beside the bed the silence lasted for several minutes keeping her eyes closed was hard but she did it i see he said finally think about it ill be back she thought about it and lay in a cold sweat until one of the young nurses came to give her a bedbath helping asteplikota had drained her medikit so she was dependent on local drugs and half the time the treatment seemed to make her sicker than the wound fever seized hold of her sleeping and waking she dreamed pain strangeness sliding into kikuns head looking out through the lacertines eyes in the nightmare it seemed at once ordinary and terrifying that she was there pain locals were beating himlher shouting questionsbut they didnt stop for answers they didnt really want answers the questions were only an excuse to continue tormenting kikun the hate and fear in that small cell were smothering the stench of them almost lethal snake they shouted at him slimeviper in the nightmare she knew that kiskaids had a deep aversion to snakes kikun wasnt really but he was close enough to wake that race horror and unleash a pitiless cruelty born of xenophobia and fear in the nightmare she knew they were torturing him not for what he knew but for what he was in her delirium she cursed and cried out flung herself about several times reopening the wound and bringing on new and more dangerous bouts of fever she felt the nurses trying to hold her down and fought them cursing them as torturers in half a dozen langues because she was kikun fighting his tormenters crying curses on their heads it was the only weapon he had she babbled the nurses heard enough to make fearful wondering guesses at the tie between her and the other avatars and what this tie was doing to her meskew came and listened he had them time the crises and he checked those times against icikuns torture sessions kikun was left alone after that very much alone locked in a cell and fed like a beast rohant was left alone too the kana screwworms had tried their tricks on him less the miasmic hate and fear he simply glared at them and went nincsothran dropping into a trancestate where he could see and hear move and tend to his bodys needs but felt nothing either physically or emotionally the dyslaera had a far bloodier history and prehistory than the kiskaids could even imagine or attempt despite the efforts of the napriests and the nishmoks own torturers that trapresponse was a survival trait selected for over aeons of ambush and feud after viewing flakes of question sessions makwahkik conceded defeat there was no point in beating on an insensible unresponsive block of flesh days passed weeks it was like inskip joumeytime everything else on hold with the locals waiting for her to regain her strength so they could beat it out of her againnot much of an incentive to recover but her body was young and strong and when her will faltered her flesh prevailed she regained the weight burned off her by the fever the wound closed over and pain retreated until she no longer needed the local painkillers she was happy to dispense with these because they nauseated her and addled her head until she couldnt stand straight and twitched all over her face and lost the feeling in her toes and fingers the gospah ayawit didnt come back she didnt miss him but she worried about his absence whenever she thought about it the nishmok makwahkik didnt come back she worried about this a lot more she was confined to the single room when she was able to get out of bed and allowed to walk around all she could do was pace from wall to wall she couldnt even look out there was a window but the glass in it was acidwashed and as good as a wall at keeping her from seeing what lay beyond it she was bored bored bored they wouldnt bring her harp it was too heavy bound to put an unnecessary strain on newly knit flesh and besides wouldnt it press so painfully against the wound she couldnt use it anyway late on the night when she was given the bad news about the harp the youngest of her nurses slipped through the door shadith looked up from the tedious turgid theology text which was all she had to read wayan singer the natoisk said you had to turn off the light and sleep shadith looked at the page shed been working at sighed and shut the book no great loss any chance for some hot cider if youre thinking about feeding me a sleeping pill forget it the natoisk said you had to take it singer wayan sighed she went through this every night and was obviously getting tired of it shadith grimaced and gave in once again the head nurse had the personality of a truncheon and less than half the charm that warhorse was quite capable of sitting on her head and ramming the thing down her throat with a steel rod once again wayan brought her a glass of water and gave her the pill once again shadith tucked the capsule under her tongue and let the water slide down her throat she was reasonably sure the little toisk had no illusions about the pill actually following the water but the girl was careful not to ask unnecessary questions and when she took the glass away she was tactful enough to turn her back her sandal soles squeaking softly on the composition floor wayan hurried to the door opened it a crack and stuck her head through for several minutes she spoke to the guard outside from the tone of her voice she was coaxing him to do something as shadith listened to them murmuring at each other she tucked the pill into the cache shed contrived in the side of the mattress lay back and wondered what the hell was going on wayan reached through the opening brought in a black bulbended case smiling triumphantly she carried this like a victory prize to shadith and set it on the quilt beside her brown doeeyes shining with a private laughter she patted the belly of the case when he was about my age my oldestbutone brother thought he was going to be an ililinikasoh and sing his way to fame and fortune she giggled and began undoing the latches but it got to be too much like work so he went to the kastakana instead she lifted from its frayed green velvet bed a delicate lutelike instrument and set it on shadiths stomach none of the rest of us has any gift for music so i thought why not this kitskew isnt heavy and you wont hurt your shoulder it sits in the lap when its played shadith pushed up touched the wood then the strings it was a lovely graceful instrument if not a work of art at least one of high craft its beautiful she breathed i cant take this wayan it must have cost an arm and a leg wayan wrinkled her nose primmed her mouth waweh what it cost helli was a pretty boy and bouncing in and out of plicik houses from the day his hair was cut for a man he had the kitskew off some hag he bedded for what he could tease out of her he called it kishi and kissed its backside when he told me better you have it singer youre right its a nice thing and doesnt deserve the smell of its getting use it and make it sweet again she glanced round at the door twisted her face into a comical scowl but if you please dear patient not till the morning or the natoisk will have my hide she put the kitskew back in its case clicked the latches home and set it on the floor beside the bed with a quick conspiratorial smile she straightened her starchy robe adjusted the folds of her white service shawl and went scurrying out a moment later she stuck her head back in and shut off the light remember shadith stared after wayan she could feel her jaw dropping it was rather like being nipped by a nursling lamb you know the thing has teeth but its so soft and cuddly and guileless you dont expect it to use them shed been wholly preoccupied with herself she hadnt thought of the people tending her as people at all just shadows adjuncts rushing around doing things for her she searched through the sheets for the bell cord found the light switch and shut off the lamp then wriggled around until she was stretched out on her back staring up into the dark there was a lot to think about the hiatus was bound to end tomorrow the next day soon and then theyd all be catapulted back into ginnys web eightythree days spotchals to here whatd old warhorse say this morning i should stop malingering thirty plus three days is long enough to lie around getting waited on hand and foot thirty some days well its one way of killing time hunhi if you dont get killed yourself dont try it again old shadow the next fool might be a better shot fifty days to go maybe lessi wonder how high lee can crank that ship up if shes in a hurry to get somewhere vryhh ships are the fastest around nothing can catch them somewhat lacking in hard data that lets hope lets hope she can cut it seriously cut it down she yawned sleep stealing over her despite her plans to get her immediate future better organized still weak from the wound and the fever she slipped from her drowse into a deep dreamless sleep in the morning she began experimenting with the kitskew running simple scales and listening to the tuning she tried remembering and picking out some of the songs the women sang that night in the hostel until one of the morning nurses rushed in and stopped her it took shadith some time to find out why then she shook her head ruefully amused by her own stupidity rebel songs naturally wouldnt go down well not here she went back to her own collection retuning the kitskew to her needs it had a rich singing tone with interesting overtones from the secondary strings and was close kin to many of the stringed instruments shed mastered in her original body getting used to this one with these fingers was harder than she expected and frustrating ahlahlah a babbling baby could do better my fingers feel like sticks chording sari come on shadow you can pat your head and rub your belly with the best of em its like learning to swim some idiot throws you in the ocean and it all comes back damn there goes another fingernail i want my gear you think they going to give it to you naaaa i swear im going to boot ginnys behind here to wolff give me half a chance the next evening wayan sneaked shadiths kit to her and helped her glue on the false nails then she teased the guard into leaving the door open and the nightstaff in the infirmary gathered round for a sing they taught her pakoseo songs and love songs and joke songs guards and all they sang until they were hoarse and her hands were sore with playing that night shadith slept ferociously well most of the pain was gone her energy was returning and altogether she just felt good the nishmoks office was suffused with pearly gray morning light from the northlooking windowwall a few raindrops slid down the glass blown at a slant by a healthy wind that made the air inside seem stale and oppressive wondering why she was here and what was going to happen shadith stood gazing across the crowded busy bay white sails bellied out and poufs of black smoke from the steamers gray water whipped to froth the city swept in a broad arc along the shoreline rising to a rocky for on the north horn and the immense pile of stone wood and tile riding its crest the nistams little cottage i am colossus bestride the world see me and tremble she made a face at it scandalizing the guards ranged along the hinderwall then strolled to the three backless armchairs lined up in front of the table and settled herself in the middle one rohant stalked into the office he ignored the guards nodded at shadith dropped onto the chair beside hers and sat clicking his claws on the arms and glowering at the table kikun came in surrounded by more kanaweh officious scowling kiskaids who prodded him and jerked him about until they got him to the third chair and dumped him in it shadith chewed her lip feeling more helpless right then than she had when she was shut in that miserable cell onboard ginnys ship anything she did would make things worse his painfully repressed fury giving his chest an unhealthy rale kikun got to his feet and moved around behind shadith he stood there leaning against her his hands on her shoulders needing her her eyes misted she reached up touched his fingers all right all right now he took warmth from her and his breathing quieted she could feel him gathering himself smoothing out the jags and getting ready for whatever was coming she wasnt all that ready herself the only thing she knew was whatever they wanted she wasnt going to do it gently stroking kikuns fingers she turned to rohant fifty days to go she said about think we can make it rohant shrugged cant change it so we live with it maybe we can find another smuggler he swung round his eyes narrowing another at the cattletrot she sighed read this someone you knew he sighed soso go slow not to say knew she signed toldhim pass the word just a face id seen before why keep it to yourself he signed why beforenotsign ive got credit youve got credit we might have bought passage maybe youve an urge to suicide i havent she signed because i didnotthink of it why didnot you that why we got blown out of the water he signed mea culpa head bowedandbloody never mind explains why miralys already knew who when where i was going to ask you about

alreadyknow willnothelp some not cannothelp there is that he signed gotcha it doesnt count for much its this side thats got us how you feeling like ill be glad to get back where the treatment isnt worse than the trauma i itch and i cant play my harp yet if youve got the energy to paitzher like that im going to stop worrying about you hah as if on cue makwahkik came in exuding energy like a shorting dynamo dynamotor on feet no wheels he dropped into the swivelchair behind the table glanced briskly from one to the other settled on shadith youre looking better than the last time i saw you singer one hopes the search this time was more thorough and youve had your teeth pulled my kanaweh shoot straighter than that fool one reminds you weve both forgotten he raised a brow thinking of the crystal blade disguised as a welt in her boot shadith smiled noncommittally theyd missed that though her armory was gone when they returned the remainder of her gear except for the harp a few hours ago she considered his words and his attitude and wondered what the man thought he was about whatever it didnt mean anything to her let him talk let him see where it got him nowheresville and nevemeverland he had light brown eyes with flecks of orange in them marmalade eyes he pinned her with them measuring her unspoken hostility with the ease of long experience then he turned to rohant hunter one is certain you were aware of listeners fifty days you have before your friends family come for you youve made it obvious that one cannot use you for information so youve no value that way a kana is dead the girl killed him you others are complicitous the judgment is death by the stranglers cord he waited for a response when he got none he went on it is possiblethough one believes not likelythat you really are avatars of the three yes one knows youve denied it but that means nothing less than nothing he smiled though he shouldnt have bothered it didnt improve his face any theres plenty of historical precedent to suggest you wouldnt know if you were he moved his hand as if he were brushing away what hed just said and the truth is it doesnt matter what the truth is only what people think it is and they think you are the three rumor of you has spread throughout the five nations so theres value in you after all if you consent to play the game with us its that or the cord rohant folded his arms across his chest his dreadlocks bushed out in threatresponse the papillae of his scalp erecting like gooseflesh on an icy day his eyes narrowed and brightened as the pupils shrank until his stare became hot gold bluff he said maybe you can throw a fool to the eels without consequences you cant do us without joining us perhaps not now but the march to the holy ground is less than four weeks off ten days on the pilgrim road three more of ceremony and rite until the culmination count the days hunter less than fifty yes so the pakoseo year ends with the culmination after that your value is nil after that who cares what happens to you do you understand what one is saying rohant bared his tearing teeth in a broad grin so we take our chances the wheel turns the nishmok nodded one expected that gelid marmalade eyes moved over shadith touched kikun moved back to her do you concur does the hunter speak for you dancer singer kikun hissed laughed as he saw the kiscaid flinch shadith stared back at the nishmok her mouth set in a stubborn line i see he swung the chair around flicked a switch on the corn nahwac time is he swiveled back and stood it is apparent one must give you further reason for acquiescence come they emerged from the empty doorlined corridors into the whip of a wind heavy with rain and the salt tang from the sea they were on a covered walkway that circled three stories above a barren stony court a pit without shelter from rain or sun or anything else the weather provided the nishmok waved the guards back pointed at an arcaded overlook stand there the three of you watch down in the pit a door opened in groups of two three five prodded by unseen kanaweh a number of locals men women children came blinking into the watery daylight like revenants from a graveyardwhich they might as well have been hostages or rebels whatever they were what life was left to them was most probably going to be short and painful one of the last arrivals was a youngish woman with a kitkew tied to her back her legs were cut off at midthigh she had a black patch over one eye and wild black hair twisted into dreadlocks much like rohants a guard more impatient than the rest booted her out of the doorway then stood watching as she crawled along on stumps and elbows till she reached the north end of the pitcourt where there was fractionally more shelter from the rain several young boys separated from the rest and crossed to the woman moving with a peculiar sliding sidling gaitprepubescent thin and ragged archetypal street urchins miowee it was almost a song one boy made of her name the sound came lightly to the listeners despite the wind clear and sharp even amplified a little sing for us miowee about a third of the adults seemed horrified by this turn they walked away and clustered in a tight knot at the far end of the court the rest gathered into a ragged arc about the woman squatting patiently waiting for her to begin it probably would have been more politic if shed refused them more prudent to keep quiet and refrain from baiting her captors but even three stories above her shadith could see that she was a woman for whom prudence would always be a second choice miowee looked up at makwahkik and laughed an unrepentant irrepressible sound that mocked him and all he represented swinging the kitskew around she bent over it a moment tuning it then she swept a cord and threw back her head fixing her eyes on the watchers above challenging them to do their worst she played a complicated effervescent tune that settled quickly to simplicity the pit acting like a gigantic sound horn forgetting anger in delight shadith clutched the rail and leaned into the sound as far as she dared shivered with pleasure as the streetsingers rough contralto filled the horn fire in the streets miowee sang theres fire in the streets the streets fill with dead children children fight your killers with stones stones and bones build our revolution revolution burns in our blood our blood rises in a drowning tide the tide sweeps away the murderers of our souls our souls burn with opplas fire miowee interrupted the chainsong for a passionate cadenza on the kitskew singing vowel sounds around and through the voice of the instrument an endless outflow of pain and anguish with an edge of fury shadith vibrated to the anger and the artistry felt an answering passion rise in her she sang softly with the singer below not trying to compete with her following her lead then stopped to listen as miowee reclaimed the chain theres fire in the streets the streets rise against the thieves of our strength our strength fuels the revolution revolution builds in our hands our hands reach out and take hold of life the life your stranglers steal we steal back with steel and stones stones and childrens bones fuel our fury our fury rages through the streets the streets burn with holy fire once again miowee let the chain slide she played and crooned fantasies of pluck and strum of soaring wordless song that was attack and assertion of her self and causeand shadith opened her throat and sang with her wordless wondrous play and passion her soprano lifting up and up echoing mirroring plaiting distant harmonies until miowee stopped the interplay stilled the strings with a sudden powerful dissonance after a beat of silence she took up the chain theres fire in the palaces and factories the factories fill with the stilled breath of dead men dead men rise and cry out for retribution retribution rides the winds of revolution revolution burns with holy fire theres fire in the streets enough amplified and colder than the rain the nishmoks shout drowned instrument and voice both shadith swung round furious at the interruption she opened her mouth to excoriate himand a laugh was startled out of her as miowee complied but got in a small dig a slide down a string a clowns pratfall in sound makwahkik ignored both of them you at the far end stand with your backs against the wall the rest of you join the singer quickly the handheld bullhorn filled the space without effort he wasnt shouting any more he didnt need to kimeesit a kana stepped through the door touched his chest and bowed a lean grayhaired man taller than most move them the man bowed again and stepped back inside the next several minutes were noisy confusion and deliberate brutality the meanness of the kanaweh gnawing at shadith all the more because it was so unnecessary these people were starvling skeletons with barely enough energy to stand only the boys were offering any resistance and even that was passive rather than activethey clustered around miowee taking on their own bodies the shoves and kicks that were aimed at her the cuts from the limber slitted canes when the confusion was sorted out around a dozen prisoners were pressed against the southwall the rest about twice the number were regimented in three rows back against the northwall eight kanaweh were arranged in a line across the middle four facing south four north kimeesit stood in the doorway looking up makwahkik held up four fingers then pointed south he clapped his hands the sound made shadith jump then gasp the crack of the pellet guns came amplified and echoing up the pit four prisoners fell one has learned your lesson singer makwahkik said tomorrow it will be eight he clapped his hands again and the kanaweh began herding the prisoners out of the pit the next day ten you can stop it any time watcher cell one sing tom he c the cell one sing tom he c the cell one has learned your lesson singer makwahkik said tomorrow it will be eight he clapped his hands again and the kanaweh began herding the ginbiryol seyirshi stroked the simi and smiled with contentment as the scene played out he was almost regretting the need to ash the world this was better much better experience counted after all yes makwahkik was handling her very well indeed and i was right about that streetsinger she will be more important than ever if i read him correctly we praise again this night yes yesss he turned his head ajeri kilavez was playing with her sensorpad readjusting the eye transmissions i am aware ajeri tiszt how difficult it was to shift the eyes all those eyes without losing important scenes good work pilot thank you sir he cleared his throat puk is i think we can untie him tomorrow not tonight better not hmm ginbiryol swallowed his disappointment without much difficulty it was the tiniest of flaws in his vast and increasing happiness he went back to studying the cells one hand stroking the simi the other moving over the testtransfer sensors of the pathecorder outlet chapter somehow someway im going to get out of this the room was a cube covered floor ceiling walls with institutional gray enamel so many layers of paint the thickness was tangible like an ancient dirty hide pulled over the stone the entrance was a rectangle of graypainted steel with a slot waisthigh for mealtrays and a headhigh covered grill for looking in at whoever occupied the room a second door led into a smaller room with a toilet and shower washbasin and mirror a threelayer bunk bed was shoved into the corner opposite that door there were two battered wooden chairs pushed against a wall a table and an hassock out in the middle of the floor in a futile attempt to liven what was essentially a prison cell some hopeful soul had brought in rugs with geometric patterns in bright primary colors and scattered them about and had tucked matching coverlets over the bunk beds there was no window air and light came through a grill up where the walls met the ceiling shadith pulled a hand across her mouth looked at it then at miowee dont be more stupid than you have to killing yourself wont change anything hell just bring another lot in here and hold them over our heads so i should let you corrupt me when he couldnt corrupt sar look dead youre dead he goes on that seem like a good trade dead he cant use me dead he cant suck me into his rot if youre set on it take him with you at least it wouldnt be a total wipe miowee stared at her laughed youre something else you really are well its not my world she frowned glanced at the ceiling not seeing the stains crawling over the gray paint seeing ginnys bridge instead she twitched her shoulders folded her arms across her chest hugging herself and it wont be yours much longer she burst out any of yours not even him what miowee lifted the patch wiped at the scarred socket beneath it she fitted it back dropped her hand to her lap what you on about girl second thoughts chased each other round and round in shadiths head she suspected makwahkik had arranged to overhear whatever passed between her and miowee and she wasnt happy about whispering her secrets in that yelloweyed jakals ear i wonder if weaselface is listening now she snorted it seemed suddenly hilarious that there might be another nose snooping into her business concentric shells of panting voyeurs with old shadow sitting mouse in the middle miowee sniffed wriggled backward on the lowest bunk until she was leaning against the wall someone out there listening or electronics and anyway whats it matter hmm shadith dropped onto the hassock sat with one foot tucked under her thigh after a minute she smiled serve him right if he is this conversation stopped making sense bout three or four sentences back thats because ive left things out so put them in why not theres a thing with a clutch of names planetbuster worldbanger maybe just buster or banger nutcracker eggpeeler you get the idea right right part bomb part something elsevery else weird anyway it goes boom and instead of a world youve got rubble you telling me the mahk hen has one of those na and he wouldnt use it if he did hes not terminally stupid just corruptto use your favorite word she scratched at her knee shook her head as miowee twisted her face into a comic grimace all right all light ill stop wuffing ive lied so much i doubt if i can ever remember the truth but here goes this is a play a drama all you kiskaids are actors in it you turn and twist for the amusement of an audience youll never see your lives and your deaths every emotion you feel every joy every agony slapping her hand on her knee she counted out the words all your pains and pleasures all of it is being recorded for clots with too much money and a dearth of brain cells slimy little perverts who get off on others peoples pain and torment she drew her mouth down shook her head sorry about that lurid bit call it lack of editing she sighed shook her head again as she saw miowees face go blank with rejection listen dont turn me off yet we were brought here my friends and i to make your passions more intense and your suffering worse not by our choice believe me on that if nothing else the director of this drama did all the deciding he reached out and took us and dumped us here we werent supposed to know what was happening or why but he slipped up there ill explain later if you really want to know you can see why he lighted on the ciocan and his beasts impressive yes and the way you kiskaids feel about reptiles had to play some part in why he chose icikun for the dancer me im a music student with baaad luck she reached inside her shirt and rubbed carefully around the wound it helped the itch a little you expect me to accept this this fantasy expect accept what you want believe what you want maybe im lying though what the point would be i dont know its up to you if you want to play the fool if not open your ears asteplikota told me about the plague that started all this how it popped up out of nowhere and vanished into nowhere he did it him sitting up there now watching us she jerked a thumb at the ceiling ginbiryol seyirshi ginny the creep in his perambulating poison machine it was him planted plague on you yeh he wanted a pakoseo year and that was the fastest and surest way to get it oh its just a guess i admit that but if i were you i wouldnt bet against it miowee shook her head i dont believe it do you know how many people died not his people besides thats what he wants people dying he feeds on that dying sucks up the agony to pleasure his customers i look if it was for power or revenge maybe but for a picture show i was told his picture shows bring him mmm consider the worth of everthing produced on this world for say five years since you dont have a lot of hitech here then multiply that by a thousand shadith spread her hands got it no dont blame you its one of those numbers thats too big to make sense shows how many has he i dont know i thought the nistam was a monster but yeh and talking about the nistam i have no doubt at all that ginnys stuck his thumb in your rebellion and hes still beavering away on both sides to make the hate come stronger and the fighting worse he buys men and women you know he uses people like hes using us tricking them into doing what he wants agitated and uncertain she pushed her hands back and forth along her thighs her palms catching on the zippers she didnt want to say the rest of it but she was sick of lying we got word out to our families we had to you know we used your high hooftas own skipcom theyre coming for us she laced her fingers and squeezed palm against palm theyre a long way off eightythree days altogether though its less than fifty now theyll have started as soon as they heard the thing is my people ginnys afraid of them im afraid because of us as soon as he gets the pictures he wants boom goodbye evidence which means goodbye kiskai she forced a smile makes it rather silly to play at suicide dont you think that the point of this this whatever it is no point really i just got tired of playing games theres still room for maneuvering its pretty damn hopeless but well to be honest the only times ive contemplated suiciding myself is when im petrified with boredom and the one thing you can say about this mess its not boring miowee stared at shadith for several minutes then switched round on her stomach and wriggled to the edge of the bunk so she could see the grill hes watching us now through that maybe through that not him weaselface maybe not him he doesnt work that crude probably is watching im one of his catalyst points his stars you might say thats a guess theres no way i can be sure why not you seem to know everything else ive a talent not omniscience you cant see or detect eyes thats the point of them what talent not mindreading she turned her head tilted it back you hear that jakal you can relax now your secrets are safe i see you kiskaids say that a lot the door clanged open two kanaweh came in separated and stood on either side of it with weapons drawn miowee snickered they ignored her though there was a brassy tinge to their ears and waited with punctilious rigidity for whoever it was they were escorting to appear in the doorway shadith was not greatly surprised to see makwahkik walk in she sat where she was her mood turning peculiar on her a swimmy feeling like she had in the first days after she was shot her emotions had been yanked around so much recently it was as if shed been put in a wringer and squeezed dry she was surprised when he pulled a chair out from the wall and sat down shed expected to be hauled off and questioned about the banger i want to make some things quite clear he said do you hear me she blinked at him shrugged do you hear me yes the woman there will go with you at all times you will not be touched whatever you do any punishment you earn she gets so think hard singer before you act he paused for emphasis then went on and speak im telling you now say nothing to disturb the people training you and i dont want quibbling about what i mean by disturbed im sure youre quite aware what subjects should be avoided do you hear me theres a cycle of twentyseven songs youll have to learn within the next two weeks that instrument of yours isnt suitable well provide one the paleka kitskew his streaky eyes flicked to miowee at the squeak startled out of her shifted back to shadith the gospah ayawit has consented to its use its a stringed instrument like the one you were given in the infirmary only bigger ive been told the fingerings arent complicated and shouldnt present any great problems to a musician of your ability once again he turned to miowee you know the songs youll play with the singer rehearse her until she does them properly he examined the streetsingers frozen face bared his teeth in a grin as much a threat as any of the ciocans though he lacked the dyslaerors tearing fangs you have a daughter yes we found her you didnt expect that did you no but whats a little betrayal beside your treachery traitor the singers misdeeds will be punished on your flesh yours will be punished on your daughters he reached up his left sleeve withdrew a flat photo took it by a corner and skimmed it at miowee she caught it sat gazing down at it her face expressionless shadtih got to her feet and went to look over the streetsingers shoulder at the picture the daughter was a pretty child seven perhaps eight with her mothers coarse black hair and intensely blue eyes the way she was scowling from the print she also shared her mothers temperament shadith could see almost nothing of the room the child was in it was a featureless outoffocus blur deliberately so she thought though she knew miowee wouldnt welcome her sympathy she closed her hand on the singers shoulder just to let her know she was there if she was needed she looked up met makwahkiks streaky gaze oh you miserable buuk you and ginny deserve each other if theres any way i can make you hurt ill leap at it the nishmok got to his feet exquisite little creature hard to believe shes yours itd be a sad thing to scar that delicate skin perhaps we wouldnt have to i know a certain person here in iril whod find her enchanting for a while at least when he reached the door he turned singer your training begins this day the first hour after noon the two of you will be escorted to the kisa misthakan where youll be measured for your robes then taken to the choirmaster and the paleka kitskew be diligent singer or your companion will suffer for it i want my harp i dont like the tone of your voice singer must i already have your surrogate punished dont be a bigger fool than you were born to be push me too hard and i say hell with it find yourself another avatar push me too hard and i might shadith shrugged my pleasure i hereby resign cipapiu yes makwahkik sape a slight man with dead eyes moved around the nishmok and crossed to shadith he put his gun to her head and waited for the order to shoot theres only one way to resign singer say the word andthe thing is done ive a feeling id make one hell of a mess out of your plans if i said yes wouldnt do my plans much good either hnun alive is marginally better than dead ill be polite in public in privates another thing altogether that enough now that youve got that out of you shall we proceed my harp no i dont want you wasting your time with it i wont waste time with it but i want it ill consider it after todays session is finished be diligent singer and youll get your reward watcher cell jotting angry impatient notes on his scratch pad makwahkik listened to the tiny insect voices his face growing grimmer and grimmer a play a drama all you kiskaids turn and twist for the amusement of an audience youll never see asteplikota told me about the plague he did it him sitting up there now it was him planted plague on you ginnys stuck his thumb in your rebellion and hes still beavering away on both sides ginnys afraid of them im afraid because of us as soon as he gets the pictures he wants boom goodbye kiskal makwahkik stopped the playback slapped down the intercom toggle nahwac get cipapll here then i want to see kinanipli i dont care what the bastards doing grim as makwahkik ginbiryol seyrishi watched the scene play out then he dumped the contents of cells and in the throwaway making sure no hint of those events were left in the showstock it was as well both puk and ajeri were still resting after the praisesong though they would have to know something about this debacle soon enough that girl that cursed girl she was a bomb that kept exploding the makh hen was going rabid he was beyond their control now there comes a point when bribes cant buy and kinanipli was apt to spend the scant remainder of his life on a kana interrogation table fortunately they didnt need him any longer still he was one of puks lot his key agent in ainairil and when the lute found out about his loss the situation onboard was going to be very shaky indeed ginbiryol settled back in his chair and sat stroking his jaw after a short spell of brooding he freed up a section of screen keyed in the closeeye sensied to pukanuk pousli the lute was curled into a fetal knot sweating and snoring his face puffed from his exertions in the praisesong otherwise he was more or less intact thanks to the ministrations of the odoc yes ginbiryol tapped a code into the pad and watched with satisfaction as a tranx web coiled about the sleeper better he sleeps for the next several weeks chapter scrambling and scratching sassa circled above the city seeking out and riding the thermals that rose from the barricade fires slipping sideways to avoid the prowling kana flits and the streetlights with their straying pellets and catapulted stones it was the gray clear firstlight of morning and even the fires were tired though the fighters didnt seem to be the clashes went on and on breaking off and starting again or shifting from one winding alley to another from one decaying structure to another for a short while longer he flew for the pleasure of soaring then he began to get nervous at the length of his absence from rohant and swung out across the bay he was a curious mix of raptor lines a construct rather than a hybrid shadith thought of him as hawk mostly because he looked like one of the larger buteos but his capacities were much more extensive than the natural strains hed take ground targets and birds in flight but preferred fish when he could get it he liked savannahs for hunting and rocky shorelines for breeding but hed tolerate heavy forests and take prey from treelimbs if he had to this morning he was after fish and he got one on his second stoop with it flapping in his talons he flew back to the perch hed established on the roof above the cell where rohant was shadith sat up blinked the hate and rage shed picked up through sassa lingered like a foul taste ginny might have sparked the overt rebellion but the explosion must have been building for years even generations this boil was going to be a bloody mess when it broke open she shivered started to lie down again and pull the quilts over her but her bladder felt like a balloon so she dragged herself over the edge went down the ladder and trotted into the bathroom when she finished her business and stood she saw the smear of blood on the seat and swore fervently of all the things i didnt need she washed off the seat and went into the bedroom to fetch a tampon and another of the sleeping shifts the infirmary had sent along with her gear the one she had on was a mess her bodyd been telling her for days she was due her breasts were sore and there was a dull floating ache around tile base of her stomach but shed been too distracted to notice these signs so many things happening wrong bodyweight not much difference in the gravity but enough to throw her reactions off days the wrong length getting shot and drugged and fever ridden no wonder shed lost track of her cycle she rinsed out the bloody shift and hung it from a hook then stepped into the shower and let the hot water beat on her back breathing in the steam that rose around her reveling in the warmthuntil the water turned tepid and ended her brief heat orgy when she came back miowee was awake watching her from the lowest bunk shadith hesitated shed provoked scathing comment when shed lifted miowee onto the bunk without waiting to be asked for her help the streetsinger was touchy about doing for herself use a hand she said finally nodding at the bathroom no later maybe miowee frowned youre an oddity you really are i cant make you out sometimes youre a child sometimes you act like youre older than time how old are you consider me an old soul um i just thought of something some cultures like yours a menstruating woman is unclean taboo supposed to sit in her house and hide till its over miowee smiled wahyeh therere some touches of that about in the fervent and the male like our high and holy gospah you going to tell him unfortunately it rather proclaims itself first two days i gush like someone stuck a pin in me have to change tampons every hour on the hour blasted nuisance times like this even you starpeople with all your klem klem i dont think i know that word maka word street talk take what you call hitech mash that in with all the things you know we dont ah yes therere drugs thatll suppress the cycle i dont fool with them dont want to mess myself up case i want to have kids later i dont know if i do or not but its a bit soon to be foreclosing options my bodys sixteen standard somewhere round that anyway i couldnt say exactly time gets royally twisted traveling tween worlds you never know exactly when you are even if you do know where deah deah miowee pulled herself up grinned at shadith what a wise child it is deah deah what a crock shadith yawned stretched well well maybe its not so bad after all buys us more time weaselface cant blame me for this delay thats what you think naaa even he must know the blood comes when it comes miowee laughed then shook her head there are drugs on this world too shadow drugs that can dry you up faster than a summer drought and hell use them if he takes a notion to you have no say in it im not local flesh miowee he might find himself with a corpse on his hands if he gets too busy i swear some of the things they shoved into me when i was shot came closer to killing me than that pellet did they had to pump my stomach twice and restart my heart at least once the good doctor meskew was a lot more careful after the heart thing and the nishmok knows about that oh yes that slimebag doctor was sweating rivers when i opened my eyes after my heart quit weaselface was standing behind him looking like he could chew nails then youre right youve bought some time you cant go to the chambers while youre in blood opplas teeth thatd be a sight aynowit would have a stroke on the spot theyd have to reconsecrate the whole damn place himself included sheeht talk about your evil omens she laughed until she started coughing shadith pounded her on the back then brought her a glass of water her giggles finally trailed off into bubbles in the water once again shadith hesitated but she was tied in knots as long as the nishmok had that child she had to try prying her loose once that was done she could see about breaking out of here the thing now was to get this across to miowee without the listeners knowing what she was after she thought a minute then dug out her notebook brought it to the bunk look you cant sleep i cant sleep might as well not waste this time she knelt beside miowee and flattened the notebook on the covers do you think this might make a song min mudda aksira ana ajuana ana aishashana ana asukninana thats how it sounds what it means come along here what would be the best way of saying this in kiskaidish she scribbled at the page for a short time look here this is what it means she pretended to read what shed written a short time ago i was hungry i was thirsty i burned with fever miowee looked astounded then gasped as she understood what was happening she wriggled around and crawled along the mattress until she was hunched over the notebook she read what shadith had actually written my talentmindriding beastsseeing hearing feeling what they see hear feel it will take time but i think i can find your daughterif shes anywhere in the citywould that helpcould you get her away her voice steady her face expressionless miowee said i like the way it sounds in the original you could use that as a refrain of sorts its meant to be a love song yes the rhythm though the two langues are very different i dont know miowee took the stylus wrote yes yes yes i can i will dont ask how not even you if you are playing games with me i will strangle you or something somehow how long if you can shorten the phrase she said break it into different repeats like this maybe she wrote more read aloud min mudda aksira my saklimoheh strayed from me a short time ago an eternity min mudda aksira ana ajuana my saklimoheh sets my soul on fire i thirst for him i perish from desire shadith took the notebook i see yes it can be done that way and the phrases would still make sense but wouldnt the repetition get terribly monotonous or i just had a thought why not exaggerate that monotony she wrote no gamesdont know how longdepends where she is and how much beastlife there is aboutneed eyes to look throughcan move from mind to mindcant linger long without baseor see without actual physical eyesif dont find her before mens over be limited to sleeptime searchtake lots longer with luck could be tomorrowwithout who knowswant something for thishelp to hideif manage to get awaytill rescue three of us she wrote more read aloud min mudda aksirao a short

saklimoheh set my soul on fire i thirst for him i perish from desire miowee looked up smiling made the kiskaidish formalsign for agreement a pressing of the palms together a dip of the head then she reread the last lines no no shadow youve gone over the edge it just doesnt work she yawned im tired even if were not going to be working today lets get some sleep she pushed the notebook at shadith i think you need to change again youre showing through that shift ahhh what it is to be a woman shadith grinned at miowee gave her a thumbsup and took the notebook into the bathroom where she shredded the pages and flushed them away seven days later seven women came for shadith grayhaired matrons dressed in heavy black robes black gloves black veils thrown over their heads and held in place by a crown of jayshi antlers the ends fluttering about their knees they circled her singing a dirgelike chant closed in on her and stripped her they whipped her with soft wool straps the color of fresh blood a ceremonial scourging they wrapped her in a bright red blanket pulled over her head a white jayshi skin painted with sacred patterns and deeply fringed the fringes splitting over her arms and hanging to mid thigh in front and back they spun her round and round then took her from the room seven prepubescent girls lifted the kitskew from its case and carried it after the matrons seven unmarried maidens wearing long yellow cloths wound about their breasts and loins brought in buckets of purified water and began scrubbing every inch of the cell the matrons took shadith to the kisa misthakan and drove her at a trot around the outside of the great wall scourging her as she ran with the red wool straps wearing only thick black blindfolds and black loincloths two kam priests swung open the postern gate and stood with their backs to the opening their faces to the wall as the matrons led shadith inside the purification court at the far end of the octagonal court a large wooden tub steamed gently into the brilliant morning air the matrons stripped shadith again bathed her stood her on the blanket and anointed skin and hair with perfumed oils then one of them took black and white paints and soft wood sticks and drew geometric patterns on her face and on her arms and down along her body to her feet another unfolded a shift its fine white cloth billowing in the wind three drew it over her head and tied the laces that snugged the bodice against her slight form while the loose skirt fluttered about her legs brushed against her bare and painted feet in silence with the others silently following behind two matrons took her wrists and led her from the court into a lightless mazeshe could hear bare feet pattering hands sliding against stone siss siss the women around her breathing in unison this whole thing was beginning to have an odd effect on shadith ancient and rational of a species able to manipulate such things fully aware of the way these rituals develop and the reasons behind them yet she was catching awe and wonder from the women and the girlsperhaps it was the impact of their deep belief in what they were doing perhaps some sense of the antiquity of this rite it made her uncomfortable that feeling yet it was close to irresistible because there was a part of her that needed to belong to something which would reach out and enfold her she was lonely she hadnt let herself think about that but it was part of her fear of university of being alone on a whole world with no one who knew her history no one she could talk to without holding back she tried to shake off the malaise but it ate deeper and deeper into her made her all too susceptible to the power of the rite a door boomed open ahead with the sound of the crashing of thunder more thunder came the beat of huge drums their boomdoom vibrating in the bone the matrons brought shadith into an immense hall three stories tall galleries rising rank on rank along the sides sunbeams slanting into torchlight from twin rows of clerestory windows while incense drifted lazily down from silver censers dangling on silver chains bolted to the ceiling beams napriests in black leather and black wool stood shoulder to shoulder silent and ominous filling the lowest gallery five hundred of them staring down at her above them the second gallery was crowded with kisar judges and scholars the wealthiest of the kawa merchants womenkisar kawa and plicikeach in their own sections filled the third gallery on the floor plicik males like beaded peacocks stared with easy arrogance at shadith and her retinue the matrons brought her to the foot of the curved shallowstepped stair to the altar stage with its chair of the gospah and above that the totem of oppalatinan immense maskin carved from some dark tightgrained wood rearing on his hind legs reaching out with silver claws extruded and gleaming as if to at once embrace and threaten the accembled believers the women backed away from her and lay on the crimson carpet their faces pressed to the wool their arms outstretched the girlchildren with the kitskew came timidly forward placed it on the lowest step then backed away and dropped flat behind the matrons the gospah ayawit stood beside his chair a massive backless banc with the form in abstract of a maskin crouching carved from the same wood as the totem he beat his staff on a wooden soundboard beside his feet opplatin awashoneeotehiyaasewacikapiyah he intoned in the liquid heartrhythm of the ancient langue opplas bounty blessings be well done omisa otanisan depart now your work is complete he brought the staff down again stood waiting while the matrons and the girls got to their feet and backed out spines arched heads bowed over hands pressed together fingers up when they were gone he stood smiling benignly down at shadith prepare o nikamooskinin prepare a third time he set the board booming nitahwaikis a flute and a pair of basenote longhorns joined the drums the sound filled the chamber beating with her heart throbbing in her brain she relaxed and let it take her swimming in the seething complex stew of emotion in that great chamber emotion as strong for her as the sound a masked figure danced through long velvet beaded drapes at the left of the altar an androgynous figure with grasses and cornhusks knotted into a rustling robe and wooden plaques linked to form scapulars before and behind it held a black and white blanket swinging it up and around as it came toward shadith she dropped to her knees as shed been exhaustively instructed the blanket dropped over her concealing her completely tahnokipo waposh boomboom went the sounding board a second figure danced out the ceremony went on and on the tension lessening rebuilding lessening building to a higher plateau the drums throbbing seizing control of every heart in that sounding chamber bringing them into unison seizing control of the breath until there was a single creature breathing the cynical and the unbelieving there for status and curiosity caught with the others in the powerful impulse of the rite shadith wrinkled her nose at the door set her back against the steel and grinned to miowee im holy again wahhhweh miowee plucked a tinkly tune from the kitskew do i bow do i slap my brow on the slates you consecrate yes you bow come now kowtow she whirled dizzily about the room tripped over the hassock and went skidding on a rug until she slammed against the bunk folded in the middle and collapsed on the husker mattress grace incarnate miowee played another phrase of the jokesong you finished shadith rubbed at the sore spot where her head had cracked against the bunkframe looks like you know its funny i thought the gospah would have his nose out of joint at this messy hangup female thing why wikpriest on up they have to deal with bodies all the time theres a rite for everything from spitting to shifting miowee shrugged picked another tune it was the one theyd been working on to camouflage their conversations now it was the question she couldnt ask shadith groaned and got to her feet after all that im hungry enough to eat a slither raw and tired wake me when the food arrives she shook her head an unspoken answer to the unasked question climbed the ladder and slipped into the top bunk for the past week shed been methodically ransacking the kasta searching for the child shed been sure makwahkik was keeping her close at hand in case he needed to beat on miowee needed was an ambiguous word and an apt one because miowee opened wounds in him that he refused to acknowledge yet suffered from what she was what she said what she did all of it was a scathing condemnation of everything hed given his life to his trouble was he wasnt stupid so she reached through his defenses and showed him to himself and he didnt like what he saw he needed to crush her to destroy her independence her integrity to force her to acknowledge his rightness his worth with their question tables and surgical theaters their prisoners mutilated in mind and body the cellars made her weep and swear and churn with nausea but she kept looking no child after she finished that part of the search she lay a long time staring into the dark trying to forget what shed seen ground level had a kilometersquared of floorspace it was a maze of offices and kana sleeping quarters and kitchens and a kana cafeteria with separate officer dining halls and preliminary interrogation units and cells and cells and cells miowee had lived there over two months before makwahkiks demonstration and prisoner chapels and kana chapels and detention suites and a repair facility for the kana flits and assorted storerooms plus a scatter of anonymous nooks and crannies even late at night there were kana scribes working there kana torturers hauling prisoners to the question tables kana guards coming in and out bringing back wounded and dead kanaweh from the stone and fire fights in the city bringing in battered and wounded prisoners along with whatever dead makas and tanaks they could lay their hands on so they could identify them and haul in their families to suffer for their misdeeds it took five days to search that level and even then she wasnt sure shed nosed out all of it no sign of the child anywhere second level held the infirmary larger and more elaborate offices meeting chambers record rooms computers corn banks guest suites for visiting kana officers more kitchens and washrooms an armory light arms the flit garage a fuel dump a number of anonymous nooks and crannies but not so many as below she finished that level the night before the rite was scheduled no child she lay on the bunk and wondered if her assumptions were correct but that was only a bit of foreplay before she plunged into the exhausting search unless she was entirely mistaken in everything she thought she knew about him makwahkik simply couldnt let the child go far from his hand she closed her eyes found a prowling cat and slid into him there were cats everywhere cats were makwahkiks clan totem and untouchable besides this they earned a welcome because they kept down the vermin attracted by the muck in the cellars the food in the kitchens they paced through the halls trotted through the maze of heating ducts with the arrogance of ownership slept on top of cabinets on desks and in chairs with the clerks and others shooing them without thought when they were in the way they went where they wanted when they wanted without being much noticed and they served shadith as well as they did makwahkik and the kanaweh third level held makwahkiks office the high chapel of the kana used for funerals and graduation rites and other kana ceremonies the nishmoks personal flit storage and repair shop quarters for his bodyguards for his aide nahwac reception rooms of varied stages of grandeur assorted high security suites like the one where she was now where rohant and kikun were living another armory communication rooms that were busy day and night busy now as she sent the cat trotting through them this floor being much less extensive than the two below she pushed on so she could finish with it before her lessons started again food shadow food a clatter of metal against china shadith released the cat and dropped back into herself yeh she muttered and fought the dizziness that came from prolonged riding levering herself up she looked over the edge of the bunk ah miowee was sitting at the table pouring herself a cup of the local tea any interesting dreams fraid not she swung down and seated herself across from the streetsinger maybe later this socalled meal could bring on a few she made a face at the soup and salad and single paperthin slice of dry toast this is all after what i had to do this morning be glad aynowit hasnt decided you should fast for the duration hunh tell you something i dont deal well with being ordered about eat your soup while its still warm yes mamanot she sighed and picked up the toast so what is this culmination thing when i asked the gospah he soured up his face like i spat in his wine miowee took a long drink of tea sat the cup down with an exaggerated care why bother its just a collection of rituals youll learn they have to teach you the songs uhhhhuh tell me how should i know anything im maka they barely teach us to read youre maka like im aynowits twin sister my mother was its the truth shadow and your father why should i tell you that no reason doesnt matter anyway

come on mee youre not my mama curb those hormones huh what i dont know could hurt the hell out of me know thats the problem i dont know anything just rumors stories last pakoseo year was a long time ago no one remembers it my grandmother wasnt even born yet she pushed at her hair made a face at shadith all right all right calm down will you and eat while im doing this or i stop right now she waited until shadith started spooning up the soup sighed and started talking again story is there are always avatars sometimes more than one set of them theres holy dances and holy songs and at the culmination theres the sacrifice to coin a phrase i see shadith broke the toast in half sat holding the smaller bit thats how the gospah keeps his grip on things right you got it come on come on give she popped the toast in her mouth rubbed her thumbs rapidly across her bunched fingers the whole thing she said thickly not just a hint the avatars return to oppalatin aaah details woman how remember you asked the story goes theres a mock battle not so mock where youre concerned you three youre tied to stakes and the stakes are piled round with oilsoaked wood theres singing and music and someone cries out that you go willingly to the father of all and they light the fire and when its over they gather the ashes and take them up in a flit and drop them over the heads of the pilgrims and everyone goes home edified and sanctified oh yes well see about that shadith drained her cup pushed the chair back ill sleep on it a while see if i can come up with something late that night hours past midnight she found miowees daughter lying curled up on a mat at the foot of makwahkiks bed watcher cell asteplikota opened and shut his hand pressing and releasing pressing and releasing the padded spring his therapist had given him so he could build up muscle to replace that sliced away by the cutter beam i dont know he said and looked curiously at his brother i dont fully understand them i never did you want a guess they were trying to get home medd not selling out to the nistam kiscomaskin vaulted onto the stone balustrade that went round the terrace at the back of the merchants house where they were staying for the moment ignoring the chasm at his right hand as he walked along the lichened stone with careless ease showing off was one of several childhood habits hed never shedespecially when he was alone with his elder brother he came back stood with the vanishing sun setting his hair on fire his hands clasped behind him does it matter you know ayawit hed find a way to coopt them no counting their inclinations and intentions he would and he has youre a reasonable man aste my oste thats your weakness and you like people too much thats another and youre not reasonable and you dont like people if thats true why areyou doing all this its a scam aste look at the way were living he waved his hand at the house and the wild extravagant view were you half this comfortable when you were beating history into stoneheaded kawas and kisars asteplikota shook his head smiling fondly at his younger brother not believing a word of what kiscomaskin had said judging him by himself and by the oldtime wit he remembered when kisca was a brilliant but erratic scholar filled with fervor for the righting of ancient wrongs you could be sitting at ayawits right hand brother have you forgotten his fancy for you not half kiscomaskin shuddered swayed jumped hastily down enough of this silly game we have to take them out fast brother people are getting confused and dispirited watching ayawit parade them about she was on the comcircuit that girl of yours singing for them like she sang for us a week ago ive been getting shit in the face ever since the oplacursed judges want to know whats going on we could lose a big part of our funding they have to die and we have to find a way to blame the nistam for it kisca my oste get her away from them shell be more useful alive if you cant get them all at least take her itll break the set thats all you need cant do that aste my oste be hard enough to pull off an assassination kidnapping is out of the question theyd help if you could get to them ive seen that girl work it is amazing what she can do so you say little brother i cant take the chance besides its already started he looked up frowned at the clouds gathering overhead im leaving for the main less than an hour on i probably wont be back before the culmination you take care you hear he closed his hand tight on asteplikotas uninjured shoulder dont stay out too long its going to rain i dont want you catching pneumonia cell late at night in the nishmoks personal quarters on the fourth level of the kasta a small sleek cat darted from behind a leather divan ran like black water along the wall and crouched by a cluttered worktable ears pricked whiskers twitching when she was satisfied the silence was going to continue unbroken she jumped lightly onto the table and nosed through the papers files cassettes and other items scattered about on the polished wood until she found makwahkiks keypac she batted it onto the carpet then stalked tailhigh to the board beside his computer outlet her tail jerking side to side she crouched and nosed at the pad then she raised on her toes and batted at the onswitch when screen went bright and the outlet started humming she jumped away then dropped to her stomach and crawled cautiously back moving awkwardly because control was being forced on her from outside she hit other keys entering the nishmoks password when she was done with that she licked vigorously at her sides looking up repeatedly at the screen until the run was finished shaking her head angrily the rider on her brain irritating her more and more she settled to work tapping instructions into the outlet shutting down the security network over certain selected areas of the kasta she stared at the screen until it flashed the endsignal then she exited the program turned off the outlet and leaped to the floor for several moments she raced wildly about the room playing with ghosts then she bit at the keypac until she had it secure in her mouth and went trotting around behind the divan the pov slid after her caught the tip of her tail as she vanished into a heating duct whose loosened grill shed clawed aside amazing what the girl is able to do with that peculiar talent ginbiryol seyirshi scratched behind the simis small round ears the pet sighed with pleasure and flattened himself against his owners chest one would think that its scope would be quite narrow ajeri kilavez crossed her legs and jiggled her foot one would think she said her voice was slow slurred and there were dark circles under her eyes she wasnt used to endphasing under this much pressure especially without puk as balance and it was undermining her confidence in herself more important it was eroding her confidence in ginbiryol he looked swiftly at her as swiftly away and seethed with hatred for that interfering girl voallts had insulted him and he was going to destroy them for it but there was none of this corrosive rage in that it was prudence more than anything else he didnt leave enemies behind him her he wanted in his hands his own hands urgently passionately he wanted her he glared at cell shadith was stretched out on the top bunk ostensibly asleep her face a map of her efforts grimacing twisting continually shifting expression he was tempted to send the mercs after her but he resisted it would throw everything into chaos he might get some good footage but he couldnt control the outcome let the schema run its course let her play the role he chose for her that would have to do him he set the simi aside and swung the chair around to take a look over other developing scenes cell theyre turning against us no thats not it the pakoseo helped us in the beginning now its hurting the maka have no time for us no thought for us theyre getting ready to walk away tanak theyre worse were losing our base no thats not it its the three ayawits got his claws in them somehow ive heard and ive heard and ive heard and ive heard im tired of hearing whose fault is that if you did something do what makh hens agents are like fleas they everywhere and you dont know when theyre going to light or who on the acrimonious exchanges went on and on in the basement somewhere in the maka quarter where the five were meeting waiting for a sixth to arrivethe council of the five all of them with prices on their heads the men who provided whatever organization and leadership the chaotic rebellion possessed the reality where kiscomaskin was the shining symbol the grounding under his feet kiscomaskin came in quietly no fanfare no kaboomherelamlookatme but the carping died immediately and the five turned to face him he waved his bodyguards out the door pulled it shut and dropped into a chair tell me a maka with long redbrown hair plaited into half a dozen thin beaded braids nastrldmas leaned forward elbows on knees a frown on his lean worn face he was the leader of the shawanalotah windwalkers the action triads of the council of the five nightstalkers hitting inside the strongholds of the pliciks and the priests there was a price of five thousand wiyas on his head weve got access to the kasta right into the maid hens bedroom he took a keypac from his shoulder pouch dangled it from long bony fingers with security blanked out where it counts kiscomaskin tapped his fingers on his thigh and miowee the streetsinger you know her she was picked up a few months ago she got word to us while she was with that girl supposed to be nilcamooskinin when she was practicing the pakoseo songs in the kisa misthakan she got these out an hour ago he rattled the keys malch hen made a big mistake he thought he could control that girl by making miowee a whipping churl instead he going to lose the three thats the price for this he swung the keypac again we bringing them out tonight long with miowee and her daughter he straightened raised his thumb in defiance grinning as the rest of the five shook their thumbs with him and slit the makh hens throat before he know what hit him the tanak mohecopah cleared his throat he was a sturdy sourfaced man with broad hands and large feet a hard solid body dark suspicious eyes and a straggle of brown hair kinking about a bald spot the size of a saucer he was a total loss as an orator but oneonone he could sell a man his own skin and make a profit on it he was the one who maintained the web of support services in ainairil and throughout wapaskwen providing intelligence housing food even coin he had a prodigious memory and could usually produce people tools and supplies for whatever projects the council of five had working the price on his head was fifteen thousand wiyas i keep trying to tell you all he said his harsh voice strident with anger we cant kill the man it would ruin everything hold him to ransom keep him as hostage so the kanaweh wont firebomb the quarters otherwise dont touch we kill him we trigger a massacre what then whos going to listen to us when their families are dead when theyre all dead you the word was an explosion from the second maka dencipim he was a thin intense man with graystreaked black hair plaited into the make braids a bum scar along his jaw and a number of thin white knife scars on his face and neck the backs of his hands he led the strikes the marches the barricade fights in the streets of ainairil his temper was notorious it gave him a ferocious energy and drove him to acts of legendary daring the price on his head was ten thousand wiyas you make me sick he shouted i spit on that weasel talk i spit on you the kisar lihtaksos hissed impatiently the both of you weve been through this and been through it the decision was made mohecopah makwahkik is one of the few loyal and able men the nistam has too able he is more dangerous to us alive than dead and dead hell be when the shawanalotah go in he crossed his legs at the ankle tented his hands touching fingertip to fingertip in a characteristic posefor what he called far too many years hed been a lecturer on early history at the university a colleague of asteplikota he was a fair frail man with fine lank grayblond hair and faded blue eyes that frailty was misleading he had a tough incisive mind a resilient body and an undentable will he lived on the run in cellars and rags eating when he could snatching sleep whenever he could find a safe hole but he never lost his poise and his worn elegance he was the mediator of quarrels among the five the least known to the people in the streets because he had difficulty with ordinary chitchat and few close friends outside his work circle he had no constituency among the kisars even including his family and clan he was held to be both traitor and fool the price on his head was the smallest only a thousand wiyas the fifth sat silent watching the kawa wetaklsoh a small wiry man huddled in heavy embroidered robes the scalplock of the kawas trained to fall past his left ear along with the totemdangles of his personal clan small copper ovals hanging on copper chains with the namska fish stamped into them exsmuggler extrader he was the fives tle into the disaffected kawa clans reaching men who were too cautious to declare themselves but were willing to provide services and supplies for the rebels he understood and shared the prudence of his caste kept his head down himself until the nishmok forced him into the open the price on his head was five thousand wiyas he stirred as lihtaksos finished speaking were wasting time he said his voice was a deep soft basso a gentle rumble that was as misleading as the scholars frailty the shawanalotah are waiting kiscomaskin sape have you anything to tell us kiscomaskin tapped his fingers on his thighs he wasnt happy at having this pushed in his face but he couldnt let it slide he was hardly past puberty when he learned that the prime secret to being a leader was the ability to recognize a developing consensus and to articulate it before anyone else all the five wanted makwahkik dead even mohecopah but what troubled him was troubling the othersand more than they were willing to admit i have a thought nashkimas youve made copies of that pac nashkimas tossed the keypac into the air caught it and dropped it into his shoulderpouch of course make one make ten doesnt take all that long why send in an additional triad once youve taken out the nishmok dont leave his body there have them get it away while the rest go about their business if they can they should take it to the middle of the bay and drop it in weighed down with enough scrap metal to keep it there till woridsend leave the kanaweh a mystery to investigate not a death to avenge while it might be satisfying to cut his throat dont no get him some way that doesnt leave traces behind that you cant clean up the stranglers cord yes yes yes how appropriate dont you think use his own tool against him he sat back smiling at the shouts of approval right now where you going to put the three when you get them out ginbiryol set the pet aside and began entering short notes into his mm pad there were two strands developing below two promising fates for that girl the fire at the culmination and kiscomaskins assassination plot ginbiryol was not sure which he wanted to come to fruition he was also unsure whether he had any say in the matter he preferred the burning he wanted to see that girl writhing in the fire the others did not matter that much but she had earned the fire over and over by what she had done to him to them all she had made a mockery of them he replayed the scene between the brothers and brooded over the exchange he could not make up his mind whether he should call off kiscomaskin or let the man try what puk had so disastrously failed at he had a strong feeling that the local would not manage it either the girl by herself was bad enough put her with that lizard man they were hoodoos of major proportions he watched cell and brooded some more he could call kiscomaskin off probably he had better do that letting the girl get at the kiskaid might be no would be disastrous she knew too much she talked too much even before she got him killed she had wiped out makwahkiks usefulness if he lost kiscomaskin as well on the other hand kiscomaskin had a nose for smelling out weaknesses no matter how deeply they were hidden ordering him to keep off would send him digging at the girl as soon as he thought hed dropped his watchers no the least intrusive way was the best let events play out it did not really matter nothing the locals could do would change the end he rubbed at his jaw and stole a look at ajeri she was reading one of her magazines ignoring the cells the girl had gotten to her long before this she could not stand to look at her now well ajeri tiszteh come the burning you will be right again come the burning cell black fabricwings rode the eddying winds to the roof of the kasta the shawanalotah made the precarious landings with precision and silence despite the slant of the leads and slimy mixture of dust and dew that made the roof a potential deathslide after folding the kites and tucking them behind the parapet the five triads ran bent over toward the litup area of the nishmoks private flit landing miniature crossbows loaded with drugged darts in their left hands the front triad crept forward moving with the undulant predatory grace of blackvipers the leader took out the dozing sentry before he knew he wasnt alone on the roof after a quick scan failed to locate anyone else up there the leader waved the others forward keyed open the lift and punched in the code that would take them down into the heart of the kasta fourth level two triads peeled off trotted for the armored doors of the nishmoks suite third level one triad stayed to hold the lift one scattered to plant the firebombs they carried in their sacs the third followed a small black cat through the maze of corridors twentythree olph the leader checked the designation opened the squint throaty growl smell of cat ah he breathed hunter the word was a thread of sound but the answer came back immediately a snarl filled with hostility what get ready you leaving singer say this miralys have your skin you mess this up kitcats word on it he keyed the lock and swung the door open a snort from the darkness the sound of something big moving about then rohant appeared in the doorway pouch over his shoulder cats at his heels the triad collected klkun then shadith swung miowee into a leather harness strapped her onto the back of the largest shawal and went trotting back to the lift to wait for the bomb planters cell one ansit the number glyph and the letter glyph were ornate thick silver shapes inlaid with elaborate gold scrolling the door itself was steel veneered with purplewood polished and waxed and shimmering like gemstone in the brilliant white light that kept the hallway clear of shadow the lead triad spread out a shawal facing each way along the hall the third trying the keys on the lock the second triad trotted off toward the armorythey were were going to collect what they could carry and set the rest to blow once they were away the child lay on a pallet at the foot of a wide bed a blanket over her a chain from her leg to the bedpost though the shawanalotah came as quiet as shadows moving across a wall she started from a troubled sleep and sucked in a breath preparing to scream a shawal sprang at her got a fistful of blanket across her mouth and held her as gently as he could pressing down on her leg so she wouldnt rattle the chain makwahkik was deeply asleep but something must have reached him because a faint snore broke in half and the springs creaked as he shifted position the shawanalotah rushed him one caught him by the hair jerked his head up the other whipped the cord about his neck pulled it tight makwahkik clawed at the shawal stranglers leather gauntlets until the second shawal caught his wrists and forced his arms down when makwahkik went limp the shawal dropped his wrists and stepped back he stood a moment looking down at the man responsible for the death and torment of so many of his kin too easy too fuckin easy he turned and trotted out the shawal with the child eased the pressure on her brought his head down close to hers kayataki he murmured your mum sent us to get you youll be seeing her in a little while if youre quiet and good she said youd worry whether we were telling the truth she said tell you remember mohemohe the turtle and how he used to cry he began easing the blanket off her face dont be afraid now we wear these things so people wont know who we are youre a big enough girl to understand that she stared up at him unblinking her body taut with rage not fear a rage his words did nothing to diminish him she whispered hes dead the slight body relaxed suddenly the child gulped and began to cry silently making no fuss about it as if something inside her had chosen that moment to break he lifted her held her close patting her back and murmuring comforting syllables in her ears the other shawal tied off the cord then came to the foot of the bed and began trying keys on the cuff around the girls ankle it fell away with a dull clank and the shawal got to his feet come on you take his legs and lets get out of here i dont trust those timers far as i can spit ginbiryol seyirshi watched as the shawanalotah streamed from the lift collected their kites and liberated three flits from the nishmoks personal fleet they went skimming off flying low almost brushing the rooftops avoiding the areas where the kanaweh were ending their nightly scramble he locked in the sequence where makwahkik went tumbling toward the cold black water out near the mouth of the bay a good distance from the moored freighters and government armships then he turned his attention to the chaos and destruction as the bombs began going off and the kasta started to burn gloating at the painhatefear his patheeyes were sending up to him chapter running again the flits darted flat and dark into the murk of the swamp fringe south of the city landed on a sandy island thick with intertwining puzzletrees a small clear spring bubbling from the side of a hillock near the middle the shawanalotah piled out a pair of them began work on the propulsion systems breaking recklessly into the sealed units shadith hauled her harp overside hefted out her travelpouch and trudged with them to the fallen tree where a shawal had deposited miowee ler daughter and her gear kikun came and squatted beside them on a patch of grass rohant strolled over carrying his pouch and kikuns the cats pressing close to him irritated and unhappy he dropped the gear to the grass and settled on the trunk beside shadith didnt have a chance to say before she said its good to see you two again whats that about she nodded at the flits he snorted suicide he said or stupidity miowee clicked her tongue irritation momentarily chasing anger not half hunter talk about what you know theyve done this before they know what theyre doing she turned to shadith theyre inducing shorts theyre going to use the flits like flying bombs send them at the kiceota thats the nistams pile up there on the horn seems chancy miowee shrugged we cant keep them anyway have to get rid of them why not stick a bomb up the nistams arse makh hens going to be spitting mad hell go through the quarters with a burning rake no he wont the childs voice was shrill and loud colored with a disturbing satisfaction kaya miowee sounded startled what do you mean they killed him kayataki yawned suddenly groped for her mothers hand they took him away gonna dump him deep what they said miowee looked fierce and squeezed her daughters fingers good she spread kayatakis hand on what was left of her thigh smoothed it with gentle strokes as if it were a kitten sitting there after a minute she winked at the girl well have to swear off fish for a couple months or old monsters like to give us a belly ache kayataki giggled drowsily pressed her face a moment against her mothers stump then cuddled against her she was shivering the night was chill and damp and all she wore was a skimpy white shift her lids kept drop ping she was swimming with sleep but when she looked up her dark blue eyes were as fierce as her mothers she had reason there were bruises over all her body abrasions burns and ligature marks makwahkik had used her ruthlessly knowing whatever he did would be erased when he had her killed which hed scheduled for the day after the culmination when thered be no one left to claim her shadith watched her sickened by the ugly mess of hurt and hate she read in the child and by the memory of what shed seen in that bedroom she hadnt said anything about it and miowee hadnt asked perhaps because she didnt need to no doubt the nishmok had thought his tastes were secret like many of the ruling kind hed have been appalled to learn just how much of his private life was known to the underclasses all of which was beside the point he was too dead to care what anyone knew and they were alive and needed to get on with living the shawanalotah clamped the workports shut and stood waiting beside the flits they watched the sky and ignored their expaksengers except for the shawal whod been carrying miowee he left the group ran to the downtree tossed a small bluedsteel handgun into the singers lap trotted back to his triad friendly types shadith muttered i feel like lost luggage cheap luggage miowee snorted whatd you expect flunkies bowing you around she removed the clip examined and replaced it made sure the safety was on tucked the gun into the case with her kitskew a third flit came skimming under the trees and landed beside the others a triad climbed out the leader wiped under his mask readjusted it feeding the fish he said finished he nodded at the other flits ready to go what about yours the leader tilted his head back measured the progress of the stars no time only an hour or so till dawn theres a couple incendiaries left over ill set those before i jump lets go rohant got to his feet stood watching the flits vanish into the fog gathering over the water theres brave men and fools and that bunch is both i wouldnt have got back in those things with a gun at my head shadow any trouble close enough to bother about i want to take the cats hunting theyre getting hungry so am i shadith sighed gave miowee a quick halfsmile i have to tell you mee we didnt do all that well the last time we were in here she put out feelers tasting at the life forms around them for the moment there seemed to be nothing threatening no pariahs for one thing nothing i can smell out kikun stretched got to his feet looking sleepy and mostly absent no informers in the pariah not now not later he shuddered intoned makh hen made it so theres no reward thats rich enough to pay for dead and maimed kana or napriest come they near the fringes they are deadand dead well be should we stay too long he opened his eyes wide spread his hands and jerked them updown a chopping gesture meant to underline his words my azee tells me begone before the week ends rohant scratched at his jaw shook his head then whistled to the cats whod gone off exploring when they appeared he went striding away along the island with the great black beasts frisking beside him shadith watched them vanish into the gloom well it is to be hoped nothing eats him or shoots him she stood and looked around what now miowee scrubbed her hand across her face bent to touch her daughters hair there should be a shelter somewhere around the spring i expect its been provisioned for us if not our stayll be even shorter than kikun suggests kikun chuckled he jumped to his feet turned around twice then fell onto his knees with his back to miowee on he said miowee scowled at him angry because she had no reasonable choice but to let him carry her for over a decade since shed lost first her eye then her legs shed fought against pity and horror distaste and averted gaze fought against being shut away in a genteel home run by kamsisters where her injuries wouldnt offend the passersby despite desperate times she never spoke of including repeated rapes muggings peckingorder battles and bearing her daughter alone on ragged sacking in a deserted warehouse shed made a life for herself where she was dependent on no one for mobility or support more than that shed won a wide following for her love songs and joke songs and above all the passionate and powerful songs calling for redress of the wrongs done maka and tanak in the name of traditional valuesthose values that perpetuated ancient injustices and maintained in power and wealth those whod always had power and wealth and now she was discarded like suckedout pulp and reduced in front of her daughter to the cripple shed refused to be she said nothing shed learned in a hard school to do what she had to without making a fuss about it she swung herself onto kikns back told kayataki to take his hand and come along the shelter was a shikwakola makee a threeroom but on stilts with walls of woven reed and a thatch roof shadith ran up the ladder found a heap of supplies piled into the middle of the front room along with an assortment of spare clothing though there was nothing for rohant except one extralarge robe that might or might not accommodate his shoulders she swung round holding up the robe as kikun put miowee down on an aromatic reed cushion looks like ros going to be stuck with blankets if were here long enough to do a wash kikun heeheed and went back to collect the rest of the gear miowee tried to smile but the grimace evolved into a yawn she shook herself gazed thoughtfully at kayataki crumped beside her head on her thigh with a visible effort she lifted her head and looked directly at shadith put kaya to bed for me will you please im too tired to move a small but energetic fire crackled in a threelegged stone brazier set on a round ceramic tile in the main room the cats were a complex knot of black fur in front of the door in the puzzle tree spreading like an umbrella over the makee sassa was asleep and dreaming of fish kayataki was deeply asleep on the springy pile of bedmats in the small room to the left shadith lay with a battered mug warming her stomach on the outside most of its contents warming her insides her eyes were closed she was looking through the eyes of a flying furwing similar to the furry shed ridden the first night in the swamp but considerably larger its like someone pulled the plug it must have been going on since before we got here i suppose thats your people mee passing the warning the towns getting too hot for anyone she paused a moment but miowee said nothing the pilgrim road out of iril is walltowall people far as the furwing can see most of them walking some riding or driving urn i suppose theyre mos and kekelipis not that ive ever seen those beasts no motors thats the rules huh back at the city kanaweh flitting about firebombing the quarters and theyre not being all that careful about boundaries from the way theyre built some of the houses burning are kawa and the fires are spreading the fools are going to burn the whole city if they dont cool it she grinned into the twilight where the others were dark lumps barely visible i dont hear any groans so ill keep on the kasta i can see somewindows boarded over smoke stains not much damage itll take more than a few bombs to level that lump flits going in and out like bothered bees hmm thats odd the guard on the roof is a napriest looks like the gospah has expanded his territory well well the kanaweh out of control or near to it the city burning and makwahkik vanished id say your people really made a dent this time the kiceota hmm one of the flits seems to ve taken a hefty bite out of the north tower theres a sag in the seaside wall flit didnt hit that but it blew one helluva chunk out of the cliff beneath searchlights all over the place probably if we went outside wed see them from here small army on the walls maybe you didnt actually put the bomb up his arse but id say youve got the nistam sitting nervous ahhh my heads getting tired i think thats all for tonight early morning of their fourth day on the island the biterswarms were still sleeping off the nights excesses the air was pleasantly warm though heavy with damp and just enough wind was blowing to brush the flat lacy surfaces of the puzzletree fronds against each other producing a gentle susurrous nflowee was sitting on the fallen tree near the sandy stretch where the flits had landed kayataki beside her she was playing a jokesong on her kitskew and singing harmony with her daughter stripped to shorts and an undershirt kikun was dancing on the sand a slow sinuous twisting that was more plantlike than animal shadith stood at the waters edge frowning at the enigmatic swamp she couldnt see more than a few meters into the trees not with her own eyes and she was feeling more than a little burned out after the nightly sessions flying over the city not so much from the effort it took as from what she had to look at shed seen death before destruction war shed never learned to look at it with indifference perhaps because after the first time the time her family died shed always been been an outsider with none of the resources the locals had for deadening that fear and loathing none of the justifications none of the righteousness rohant had been gone for hours at least it seemed like hours hes restless only four no three days cant count this one yet and he almost cant stand it maybe its the length of the rope tieing us down the longer the tether the closer to breaking it the more impossible she glanced over her shoulder at the others smiled then went back to glooming at the water theyre out there now the shikwakola i dont have to reach to fed them watching kikun was right were going to have to go somewhere else soon where no answer how worse no boats no flits no nothing were almost as much in prison as we were in the kasta they stuck us in the pantry to save for later the kuudj might as wellve stayed where we were except for the burningsar dont want to think of that walk out theres miowee shed have to be carried and kaya its impossible a raft have to cut down trees hard to know what the shikwakola would think of that feed us to a slither maybe she clicked her tongue kicked sand into the water cut down trees sail with what our teeth i swear next time i get to a city rm going to stay there hang on with teeth and fingernails if i have to and kick the crutch off anyone who tries to shift me kiscomaskin strolled from under the trees no dont stop he said a charming tableau finish your song please my dears he dropped to a squat beside shadith and watched kikun dance to the song miowee and kayataki were singing when they were finished he clapped politely then straightened up and moved away from the waters edge i imagine youre getting rather bored with this ah solitude wheres the hunter suddenly wary though she was careful not to show it shadith got to her feet you said it bored hes off nosing around the swamp she reached for the nest of muddaubers shed located in case of trouble hell be back before dark probably not much before she felt miowees eyes on her but she wasnt worried about the streetsinger fumbling a cue or kayathe girl had learned before she could walk to smell trouble and keep her head down kiscomaskin inspected miowee as she set the kitskew on the trunk beside her and reached for its case shadith felt him decide the cripple was nothing he should worry about too bad i was hoping to make a sweep of you all he slid his hand beneath his coat and brought out a small quickfirer and before he got off a shot miowee put a bullet through his head using the pistol in the kitskew case shadow her voice was a harsh rasp any more of them he wouldnt bring witnesses dont give me logic are there any more shadith loosed the daubers and made a quick sweep around the island she caught a distant hint of rohantcoming back for lunch as usual not as usual when he gets here and sees what dropped in shikwakola too watching more of them not good no one else mee can let her hormones rest rohants coming in no strangers around she said wearily at least we have transport courtesy of that she waved a hand at the corpse has to be a flit back there or a boat well need it the shikwakola about ready to pop better to go before they doif we had any idea where to go kikun looked at her moved quietly off into the trees kayataki had her legs pulled up and her thin arms wrapped round her knees she was a little paler than usual and she was carefully notlooking at the dead man the man her mother had killed she was too calm shadith read emptiness in her seven years old and shed seen more death and torment than men ten times her age like the child shadith was feeling nothing no revulsion no regret not even anger not any more not at ginny not at the people running this world not at fate or luck or whatever it was that ran the universe she was worn out she went over to the dead man stirred him with the toe of her boot in his ribs why she said after a while i dont understand why weyyah i dont know having broken the gun down miowee was cleaning and oiling it i could guess youre too hard to control like trying to hold a live kilifish it keeps squirting out of your fingers no matter how tight your grip hed get more mileage out of you dead especially if he could lay the blame for killing you on the nistam she inspected the barrel gave it a last wipe and began reassembling the weapon he cant do what the makh hen did hed have to coax you and that wouldnt work would it the three of youve made no secret about wanting to go home wherever it is you call home she put the gun in the case snapped the latches and set the case on a clump of grass beside the trunk kaya you all right she reached down stroked her daughters hair home child a mine the man goin home she sang softly her voice in its lowest notes caressing yet remote walkin the hard way the long way walkin on stones he pile up hisself she began humming and plucking single notes from the strings after a while her voice shaking then gaining strength kayataki took up the chorus walkin home walking home home child a mine the man going home miowee sang repeated the phrase kayataki blending with her child soprano light and pure woman contralto worn ragged as powerful as it was let to be a long way a hard way on the shells of his hurts the song went on and on adding travails to kiscomaskins route to redemption until miowee laughed ruffled kayas hair laughed again as kikun was suddenly there handing her a mug of hot tea after they rolled kiscomaskin into the water for the slithers to feed on they sat and drank tea and ate stale biscuits and waited for rohant to get back so they could argue out what was best for them to do they were still arguing when the napriests came for them watcher cursing with concentrated malevolence his voice a shrill whine that sent the pet shuddering onto the back of the chair where it sat with its hands pressed over its ears ginbiryol seyirshi watched shadith and kikun roll kiscomaskins body into the murky water he glanced at ajeri saw her shudder absurdly like the pet and fix her eyes on her magazine she was too afraid of him to open her mouth but he knew she was dreading a praisesong with him in this mood that gave him a savage satisfaction which was momentarily pleasing but he knew it wasnt prudent he needed her he didnt like it he loathed the truth in it but he considered himself above all a practical man he made a note to start looking for candidates to replace her and puk then went back to wrestling with the current crisis when he had his rage under control he touched a sensor gave a set of coordinates to the listener below and followed with sour satisfaction the arrival of the napriests the days rolled on the eyes continued to collect scenes and send them to the satellites which fed them to ginbiryol while a third of the worlds population poured into wapaskwenonly a third because the pakoseo fervor dissipated considerably as it reached the more ratified levels of power the crowd of pilgrims was heavily weighted toward maka and tanak with a salting of kawas and kisar and a very few pliciks there was a complex web of consinships of shared attitudes most of all a shared hatred of the plicik authority and all the brightsider priests who collaborated with that authority to wring everything possible from the low to pile the chains on the workers and keep them on there was kinship and a common history a common enemy perhaps because of this perhaps because there were whole families infants to grandmothers walking together perhaps because the pakoseo fervor exhausted them the immense throng was extraordinarily peaceful elbow to elbow they marched without much clashing there were a few fights none with weapons a few screaming matches curiously muted and soon over nothing more in wapaskwen especially in ainairil the five fought a chaotic battle the city was burning and mohecopas fieldcorps were scattered along the pilgrim road most of them impossible to contact the few kipaos left in the city retreated to their blockhouses and ignored whatever happened in the streets makwahkiks death was proving one of the fives larger mistakes the kanaweh had slipped beyond anyones control in addition to their nightly raids on the quarters individual kana were breaking into armories taking flits and going on killing sprees among the pilgrims concentrating on maka and tanak groups but not worrying where their stray shots went others were looting kawa storehouses even some kisar compounds shrines were losing their votive tokens the gold and jeweled bits and what the raiders didnt take they destroyed and desecrated the gospah ayawit tried to calm them and reinstate discipline but they wouldnt listen to him and beat or shot the napriests he sent out to them the nistam didnt bother trying he stayed in the kiceota behind rank on rank of royal guards and puttered in his garden for the most part the other pliciks were cheering the kanaweh on only having second thoughts when their own houses got singed ginbiryol tasted dumped selected saved excised drowning his anger in the flood of satisfaction at the savagery and chaos below in the familiar comfortable work of compiling his images the anticipation of the final cut the pulling together of those images into a unified work of art that final satisfaction that was greater than any other cell asteplikota lay back in the longchair as the girl brushed and braided his hair pulling the shining blond loops around to cover the ridged scarring where his scalp had been sliced away it was a pleasant attention but it made him uneasy he had a strong aversion to such pampering and he was worried about his brother uncertain now that kiscomaskin wasnt here to reassure himnot with words because words were unimportant and unreliable but with the flash of his smile and the warmth of his fondness it was at those moments when they were alone and wrapped in bloodcaring that he felt kiscomaskins posturing was only that the mask of a man protecting himself from his gentler side the girl finished her task dipped and backed out as if hed waited outside for her to be done and begone lihtaksos tapped lightly on the doorpost came in without ceremony a measure of his disturbance oppla bless aste my friend kiscomaskin has he been here in the past week asteplikota sat up no i havent seen him since he left for the main lihtaksos dropped on the hassock by asteplikotas feet seemed to crumple in on himself the three are in the gospahs hands have been for the past two weeks but he doesnt have your brother even in his deepest pit were sure of that and hes nowhere else weve looked im sorry aste but i think hes dead i dont know how or who but i can see no other answer asteplikota closed his eyes touched the tips of his fingers to his brow hiding his face grief was cold in him it was a loss he couldnt comprehend hed half been expecting it but that didnt help somewhere distant almost beyond reach he felt anger he knew it was anger but it was meaningless right then he dropped his hands i see so lihtaksos brushed absently at the wrinkles in his shirt killing makwahkik was a mistake he said wearily maybe there was satisfaction in it perhaps even justice but it was most definitely a mistake there was a center to what we were fighting now theres none we hit at clouds and gain nothing from it people die now for nothing nothing at all aste nothing at all come back with me we need you dencipim is at everyones throat wetakisoh is drawing back into himself his caution is becoming paralysis mohecopah goes around in a permanent gloom saying i told you so he warned us against killing makwahklk and now hes proved right lihtaksos smiled wryly much more of that and ill strangle him myself kiscomaskin was our balance wheel aste we could defer to him none of us is willing to give that power to the others none of us is big enough to take it we need you i dont have kiscas talent lihto i have enough trouble driving myself i cant you dont have kiscas flash my friend but we can do without flash now be better off for the loss of it we know whose mind devised the strategies that kept your brother afloat we know who helped him polish away his excesses we need you well then ill come do what i can are things on the main as bad as weve been hearing he held out his hand let lihtaksos pull him onto his feet the scenes we get over the corn are enough to make a slither cringe cell the flatwagon was assembled outside the city on the road itself guarded by the nistams troops who were nervous enough to shoot without warning anyone who came too close and their idea of close was a measure that changed with the changing tensions the wagon was fifteen meters wide and thirty long with six sets of double wheels individually mounted along each side and an additional four in front with twin tongues for the two teams of twenty kekelipis that pulled it once the basic assemblage was finished with the shell stage for the three made ready the throne of the nistam installed above the warded cabins where the passengers would retreat for meals and sleep teams of kisar and plicik women decorated everything with silk flowers bright ribbons and gilded lace royal guards in gilded armor plicik men and women in beaded silks with quickfirers in silver studded straps kisar judges and scholars in their blowing beaded crimson robes kanaweh in flits and prowling about on the edges of the throng in the midst of all these sweeping along with him the angry reluctant avatars miowee and her daughter the nistam and his court progressed to the wagon so thats your nistam shirai whispered to miowee what a weed of course it isnt mlowee whispered back the real ones even worse he wouldnt dare stick his nose out where it could get shot off everyone knows that thats his fifth double the others were poisoned or stabbed or something look at the bastard sweat if everyone knows why should he be sweating whod waste his life on a double youre thinking rationally shadow thats a mistake someone might lust decide to send a message to the nistam keep him nervous hunh sweet folk yours when the procession reached the wagon the pseudonistam was installed on his throne his court settled around him behind screens of pelletproof glass the avatars were taken to the shell rohant told to sit on a massive bench at the back the cats flanking him on their own benches as sassa came circling down and perched on the rod at the apex of the shell the ciocan was a magnificent figure with his springing mane and golden eyes his huge size and powerful musculature the brilliant barbaric clothing he was given to wearblack leather beaded all over in crimson and gold azure and emerald against the matte white of the shell he sprang to the eye there was a hissing of approval from the watchers out beyond the ring of guards kikun was led to a round dance platform and told to squat there he wore a fringed harness hung with copper chains and totem dangles and was painted head to toe in horizontal black and white stripes there was a shudder of pleasurable fear among the watchers as he took his place three plicik honormaids took shadith to a white bench halfway between kikun and rohant she wore a long white leather robe beaded in lapis lazuli and gold with crimson beads in a diamond between her breasts she supposed it was meant to represent her heart her hair was an explosion of tiny curls the tips bleached to gold they shimmered in the sunlight making a gilded halo about her face her plicik attendants spread out her skirt panels arranged her limbs in the proper position slapped her spine straight fluffed out her hair smoothed pearl powder over her face and arms clucking as they always did at the darkness of her skin she sat glowering through all this only smiled when they brought miowee and kayataki to her and settled them at her feet when the plicik maids moved to take their own seats she bent down is this thing really supposed to move and what happens to this foofaraw if it rains miowee snorted it gets wet whatd you think you mean we get wet that too miowee winced as the drum corps started banging away get ready shadow another minute and youre on give me half a chance id the only way you could get out of this now is invisible or dead your choice fool she laughed tapped miowee lightly on her head so whered they get that lot of tineared dead arses theyre not the ones we practiced with she wrinkled her nose ive heard more rhythm from a seaslug theyre pliciks what did you expect theyve never had to please or starve they bought the right to make fools of themselves cell the wagon creaked out of the city and plunged into the throng of pilgrims following the pattern drilled into her during practice sessions in the kisa misthakan shadith played the sacred paleka kitskew and sang the traditional pakoseo songs miowee and kayataki blending with her their voices picked up and amplified by concealed lugikes as they plunged deeper and deeper into the pilgrim throng the people took hold of the song and began singing with them the sound spreading and spreading until it filled the space under the bowl of the sky sometime around midafternoon there was a disturbance by the right front corner of the wagon a man as elaborately dressed as rohant was screaming something that was partly drowned by the shouts of the guards and partly carried off by the wind he tried to climb onto the bed of the wagon laying about him in a frenzy of desire and determination with a seasoned quarterstaff his strength multiplied by his insanity in a lull when the wind dropped shadith heard what he was screaming i am nataminaho i am not him not that imposter i am nataminaho i am anointed by oppalatin i am he was driven back knocked down a moment later she heard him scream as the broad wheels began to roll over him ginbiryol scowled at as he recognized the shouter one of puks protйgйs the country plicik with the taste for torturing children he had some effective scenes from that one this would finish the tale but there was a problem with the style of the end he considered a moment then isolated the sequence a good many of his clients shared the tastes of that local and would be insulted by his ignoble death seeing it as a judgment on them however there were two or three who had a sentimental gloss on their attitudes toward children theyd enjoy the pain the writhing the blood and feel a special glow of virtue as they also enjoyed the wretched end of the torturer he dumped the sequence into a special file for a limited version of this limited edition though finishing the story off satisfied his aesthetic sense it was a dangerous ploy if he misjudged his audience it wasnt merely a matter of refunding the purchase price he would have some very unpleasant people angry with him people who had a propensity for direct and bloody retaliation for anything they considered an insult he continued monitoring the cells brooding over timing as he watched the emotional content of the scenes was intensifying to the point of exaltation and the autumnal odor of endphase was strong as burning leaves time is now he thought i had better set the banger in place he tapped his forefinger on the armrest ajeri wasnt here shed taken to avoiding the bridge the kephalos tracked her and found her in the gym where she was exercising with grim determination sweat rolling off her body her face a grotesquerie of strain ginbiryol watched a moment decided to leave her where she was he called up the record of what shed already done with the planetkiller nodded with satisfaction when he read its current status he finished activating it and used servos to ease it into the drone which ajeri had already programmed all he had to do was pop it out and send it down the drone dropped in a slow lazy spiral taking most of the day to reach the surface it slid into the ocean and drifted down and down for another half a day until it nosed into the muck at the bottom of a vast chasm in the seabed near hotvents that went even deeper into the worldheart when the slavecircuit beeped to notify ginbiryol the banger was in place he set his sandwich and kaff aside to contemplate the dark bulk in the darker rift and savor in anticipation shadiths consternation as the world blew up around her almost as an afterthought he started a quartet of quiverworts droning out to teegahs limit these quasiplants which had been developed by the sikkul paems from their own root stock were ordinarily not available outside the paem system though there was a good deal of interest in them because they were sensitive to disturbances created by surfacing starships were the most reliable alarms around ginbiryol had acquired his worts by means devious and expensive and was careful to keep their presence on his ship from the paems who cared for his drives he wasnt worried about help arriving for the avatars kiskai was so far off the usual ship runs there was very little chance either hunters inc or voallts korlatch had ships closer to it than spotchals by his calculations no ship was likely to make it here for at least another three weeks however he was a cautious man and even a minute chance was worth guarding against especially when it was something he planned to do anyway he finished his meal to the sound of the com bell emergency calls from downside agents were coming in faster and thicker as the hours passed he ignored them events had their own momentum now he didnt need to prod them any longer the onplanet agents were expendable and it was as good a time as any to cut them loose after the serviteur went off with his lunch tray he sat back and contemplated the busy cells satisfied finally with the way things were going let the girl plot and twist and subvert all she wanted in the end she was just another tool in the end she was ash chapter riding to a fiery finish knowing that ginny was watching and savoring her growing terror recording it for his loathesome clients shadith fought it and with it a sickening sense of helplessness and a rage that nearly strangled her she could put on a face to fool miowee and kikun and rohant and their captors but he could read behind that face and gloat over what he saw and sell her fear her frustration her fury in all her long hard life she had not hated anyone so much not even the slavers that took her and murdered her family late on the third night in the kisa misthakan shadith lay on the cot with her eyes closed the bare lightbulb that hung from the center of the ceiling was swinging slightly at the end of its wire it was never turned off and she was not allowed to cover her face a priest with a shaved head and a brown leather halfmask sat on a chair by the door arms folded eyes following her every move at regular intervals he got to his feet and came over to her stood looking down at her she ignored him he was just one more irritation there were no rats or mice not even any spiders in this prison wing so no ears and eyes were available to her it was like living with a sack over her head and boxing gloves on her hands her cell every cell in this section had all been scrubbed until they stank of disinfectant even the microbes were annihilated either ginny had warned the gospah about her talent or he was by nature obsessively neat perhaps both the one reinforcing the other outside the walls of the misthakan the city teemed with small lives this was a time of feasting for them the streets were full of dead meat much of it fried the kanaweh were deeper than ever into their killing frenzy preparing their own doom though they semed incapable of realizing that as they went from looting shrines to raiding the plicik ispisacos she shuddered away from the bloody chaos and brought the small black furwing she was riding into the misthakan courts and sent it sniffing around for the others kikun miowee kayataki and rohant were one two three four down from her in cells that stank of disinfectant with watchpriests sitting by the door she hadnt seen them since they were dumped here in her training sessions young aspirants took their parts in the choreography the gospah was drilling into her no doubt the same was happening with them they all had small barred windows high in one wall unglazed coneshaped cut through several feet of stone she tried flying the furwing through the bars into rohants cell but the watchpriest saw it and killed it she wrenched her mind loose but not before the creature died and its small agony seared into her she moaned and curled into a fetal knot crying with a grief that reached to her toes that filled every milliliter of her body in the morning heavyeyed and so angry still that she couldnt eat she went to the training court and worked on the songs the stylized stiff movements of the sacred choreography after a while she was almost happy the work absorbed her and kept her from replaying the death of the furwing and remembering the fire that was beginning to haunt her dreams and so it went day after day no threats were made overtly but now and again whenever ayawit felt she wasnt cooperating as enthusiastically as he thought proper kayataki was brought in and whipped gently her skin reddened but not broken it was enough shadith bled again was isolated and purified and put back to work the priests who watched her would not talk to her would not respond to anything she did even when she hit at them they only moved away she was not alone never alone despite that her days in the misthakan were very like those in the cell on ginnys ship this time though she couldnt let herself give up the fire was waiting for her she kept trying to find a crack to wiggle through but there was nothing by the time the wagon was finished and the trek to the otcha mistiko cicip was about to begin the futility of everything she did was beginning to wear her down when they came for her she stared at them then went without comment she was taken with the others and incorporated in the progression riding in a palanquin with miowee and kayataki kikun and rohant walking beside it the cats at rohants heels and sassa flying overhead ignoring the warning hiss of their priestguards shadith leaned out bringing her head close to rohants any ideas my minds blank nada cant breath without a damn priest up my nose you too huh ten days on the road maybe theres something there we wait and see i suppose yeah you better pull your head in our guards are getting nervous we want to keep them sweet sweet hunh she straightened and looked around with considerable interest as the parade formed up the court like painted paper butterflies fluttering around a slight figure she took to be the nistam until miowee told her otherwise day drifted into day as the wagon moved along the pilgrim road shadith sang when she was ordered to kikun danced rohant preened and posed and muttered angry sarcasms that almost made her laugh each day the response was more intense so intense she was battered to a nub by days end and kikun was reduced to a lump of skin and bone day after day after day the wagon crept among the crowd that spread from horizon to horizon funneling onto the long twisty grade that led to landing place the dead volcano the place where they were going to die they could talk they were freer than they had been but there was even less chance of escape theyd have to push through the throng of pilgrims and it was obvious at half a glance that theyd get two steps three before they were herded back night ghost dancers like painted shadows pale against the dark watchers tapwit priests ladling soup in pilgrim bowls and passing out hard biscuits pilgrims sitting motionless and hushed around the wagon focusing on the three praying at them worshiping them like a blanket smothering shadith couldnt think could barely breathe kikun huddled close to her used her as a buffer a far too inefficient barrier between him and the silent demands of the watchers rohant more and more the predator restless irritable pacing pacing sniffing at every crack for a way to escape death by fire it hung over them all burned alive and no way of escaping it burned alive they werent thinking about helping the others not any more it was how can i escape i i but there was no escape unless unless aleytys came faster than shadith had a right to expect vengeance was ashes in the mouth what good would it do them when they were dead eightythree days eighteen now fifteen when they reached the mistiko otcha cicip twelve when the fire was lit lee would get here too late at least a week too late maybe more unless unless shadith could finesse a way out contrive a holding action something something midafternoon on the tenth day the wagon labored across the floor of the crater and pulled up before an immense broken bubble of black volcanic glass the pseudonistam climbed down and vanished into the housing cavern while the vrainistam took his seat in the crystalpalace pellet proofed glass on an armorsteel cage on the crystal throne with his court around him the kam priests got the wagon into the store cavern and unhitched the kekelipis the gospah and his napriests herded the rest of the sacerdotes and the three up one of the twin ramps into the blackglass bubble and began laboring to bring order out of chaos by sundown they all were settled in pilgrims and pliciks prisoners and priests small fires bloomed across the crater floor and climbed the walls as high as people could perch the otcha cicip hummed with sound laughter music as people ate their dinners and exchanged the gossip theyd packed in with them the noise rose to a peak as sisipin full reached zenith then faded as families and clans and single travelers settled to sleep shadith crouched by the front of the cage theyd put the prisoners in and watched the moonshadows crawl across the floor three days then the fire she reached into her boot touched the welt that hid the crystal knife and was tempted then she sighed and took her hand away there was a solid rank of napriests sitting like stone teeth across the mouth of the bubble and a score of others rolled in their blankets sleeping on the floor she wouldnt get two steps before she woke at least one no chance not now gods lee put your foot down and get here chapter shadowplay invocationthe first morning the gospah ayawits mellifluous voice dripped out over the pilgrims from speakertowers twenty meters high scattered about the fivesquared kilometers of the crater floor clad in cloth of gold with kiskaid totem symbols wrought with colored gemstone beads and kiskaid holy writ in gold and silver wire with diamond accents the gospah ayawit shimmered and glittered like the sun himself from screens ten meters tall mat weh kat ta ti chanted the gospah calling oppalatin to witness their worship calling the folk to listen hear the bells of change ring out hear the word of oppalatin mat weh kat ta ti oppalatin ma illiloo kiskaiwin eh ishi shikahisheeaywin keh kah sak kehaaa din kid ma kid ma kid ma the antique syllables went on and on slithering and sliding past the ears of pilgrims mostly ignoring himtalking laughing doing clapsongs and slapdances setting out their blankets and their jugs of wine and fruit drinks their crisps and popcorn and pretzels and fried fowl and roasted kipsi fruits and the thousand other things theyd packed in for the occasion tieing on their ribbons and testing the bells on their leggings the wooden clackers on thumb and forefinger their bone pipes and baby kitskews their drums and rhythmbones the sun was pleasantly warm with a few cloud puffs to turn the sky bluer than blue and just enough of a breeze to make the crowding comfortable they looked up now and then to see the gospah glitter to see the longhorn pipers standing on their benches the palaka dancers dancing on the great drums nitahwaikis in husks and seeds tahnokipo waposh in tortoiseshell and polished stone with clackers on his legs and soundstones in his hands shapostim mayah in feathers and ribbons with strips of bells along his legs and tinkly tiny cymbals on his fingers shadith watched from the cage at the back of the bubble kikun was stretched out on a lumpy pallet laid along the left side of the cage recovering from the battering of the trek here rohant knelt by him holding his hand miowee was huddled at the back of the cage sunk into a black depression that shadith had a hard time shutting outespecially since she was looking fire in the face at the moment a more literal fire than the one that had been haunting her bonfires crackled energetically one on each side of the stage at the front of the broken bubble near where the ramps went down these werent the sacrifice pyresthose were set up at the back of the bubble cameras focused in tight on them carved posts and carved sticks saturated with aromatic oils now and then an errant breeze brought her the odor of those oils nauseating her bumdeathit scared her witless as time passed and hope evaporated she was more and more out of control turning into a quivering mess the sun went down and supper was served shadith couldnt eat kikun wouldnt eat couldnt lift himself off the pallet rohant raged at them teethtips bared he shook shadith out of her lethargy shoved bread and meat in her mouth and held his hand over her face until she swallowed when he was satisfied she was aroused enough to keep the juices flowing he tore small pieces of bread and cheese and fed them to kikun he wasnt interested in miowee and left her in her gloom until kayataki pulled at his sleeve crying because she couldnt get any reaction from her mother he slapped the streetsinger into fury got her energized enough to eat on her own then went back to feeding kikun the shadowplay goddance began in the early afternoon on the second day the palaka dancers stamped on the drums shook their clackers and their bells the longhorns hooted low grumbling sounds that entered the body not so much through the ears as the pit of the stomach rohant marched from the cage and climbed upon a broad and massive bench the cats beside him heiratic symbols out of history and dream sassa rode his arm gold eyes glaring head erect with fierce and deadly pride the image of that ensemble was repeated over and over out across the crater coldeyed predators staring down on the pilgrims from hundreds of screens on his feet more by will than intrinsic strength kikun danced onto the low flat drum at the front of the stage he wore no bells or clackers only a loincloth and the black and white paint his image crossed and recrossed rohants grim beneath her whiteface paint shadith walked slowly from the cage miowee and kayataki were already in place chained to the floor with gilded paper links loaded down with rustling chains until only their hands and arms were free kaya to play the finger cymbals miowee with her kitskew shadith sat upon the ivory banc and tuned the paleka kitskew until she was satisfied with the sound then she sang kikun danced rohant posed the cats leaped down from the bench and danced with kikun writhing and winding about him black flows moving in time with the song a sigh passed across the throng of pilgrims faces turned to the screens she could feel them coming together as shed felt them not together before the gospah stood in front of rohant on the floor of the bubble his head barely past the ciocans knees the mime nitawaikis stood beside the lefthand fire still as a graven image the mime tahnokipo waposh and the mime shapostim mayah stood beside the righthand fire still as graven images shadith brought the song to its end kikun froze the longhorn players puffed through their three meter pipes and the palaka dancers swung into stamping circles behind them the kam priests chanted ma ma ma ma llillo kiskaiwin ma ma ma the pilgrim wave began to break apart the gospah blew on his little pipe the shrill note broke through the chant brought it to an end the longhorns fell silent shadith sighed moved into the second song of her program miowee and kaya singing with her about halfway through the pilgrims took up the song the sound was a low hum at first that rose and spread and filled the whole of the crater even unto the sky and shadith felt her power on her without the hallucinogens of avosing nothing but the intensity of the belief before and behind her and kikun squeezing down that force and funneling it into her even the gospah was in the circuit which would have surprised her if shed had mind enough left for wonder he burned with fervor nothing he was doing now was cynical he believed in his righteousness and in the thing they were evoking believed it with a force of will and spirit that had nothing to do with that part of him that maneuvered so skillfully and ruthlessly for power and influence the part of him that could watch unmoved as his napriests tortured a rebel the pilgrims elbow to elbow across the crater were perhaps less complex less divided against themselves but their belief was as strong each individual reinforcing the reaction of the individuals around him each family group clan group accepting and reflecting the fervor of the groups before behind and to the sides the feedback built and built until the air itself clanged like metal she began to shape digging deep within herself laying hold on the power offered her crafting out of memory and instinct out of the peoples belief she shaped the three and sent them dancing over the crowd made them sing with the voice of the throng made them strut and posture and gather to themselves every eye every heart every fragment of brain the priests in the bubble left their places and streamed down the ramps at the two sides of the stage melding with the crowd chanting and rapt their eyes fixed on the three the palaka dancers lifted their arms and danced round and round where they were moaning and turned so deeply inward they were beyond noticing anything around them the longhorners blew in a trance seeing nothing but the three hearing nothing but the groan and thrum of their pipes the napriests were on their knees sobbing their arms stretched toward the three shadith looked over her shoulder caught rohants eye jerked her head at the front of the bubble still singing almost blind with the effort her voice picked up and transmitted to the speakers by the lugikes clipped between her breasts she got to her feet and began moving step by slow step toward the ramp at the right curving down from the bubble stage to the crater floor behind her rohant launched sassa into the air then reached for the gospahs neck caressed his carotids until the man was out cold he laid him on the bench and stepped down moving as quickly as he couldthe air felt thick as chilled honey and his head was throbbing his eyes tearing so badly he could barely seerohant crossed the few steps to miowees side he tore away the paper chains and swept her up and around so she could cling to his back then he caught hold of kayas hand and led her after shadith the cats writhing about him kikun danced his shimmerdance putting aside the stamps and turns beaten into him by the priests shiver and shimmer he moved slowly after shadith and rohant holding the feed steady maintaining the flow from the pilgrim trance into shadith so she could keep that trance going keep the illusion there to pin the eyes of everyone and let them walk away using the hallucinated three to open a way for them nikamooskinin twenty stories tall bending to sweepher illusory fingers through the pilgrims shadith struggled across the floor of the crater exhausted running on the dregs of her strength emptying herself to keep the trance in place the images whole and present she won one meter two three ten twenty the firedeath at her back pulling endurance out of a consuming terror she drove herself on and on playing the kitskew till her fingers bled singing the same song over and over watcher ginbiryol seyirshi watched the invocation begin then switched his attention to the prisoners all that chanting and hopping around it was boring the kind of thing one might expect from that woman the girl was going to meet that xenoethnologist boring boring boring most of it he would have to throw out maybe keep a little for the colorand of course one could always sweeten the scenes by mixing in the pulsing terror from the girl ahhh she was afraid ah yesss she was sick with horror he touched the testsensors on the pathecorder and smiled as he felt a lump of horrorterrorfury grow inside him he savored the sour flavor of her nausea yes fire and death ahhh that would be splendid firedeath he ran his tongue over his lips tasting the burning in anticipation smelling the meat the second day started out more interesting and improved as it progressed especially after the girl began singing he listened to that soaring voice contemplated the shining youth of the singer so sweeet so tennnderand on the verge of ceasing to exist exquisite pathos he could see his clients weeping at the sadness of her fate reveling in every nuance of her pain they were a sentimental lot which was just as wellif they were not they would not pay his prices in the early afternoon when the resonance was born between the singer and the pilgrims and began to build and build he was elated the charge coming through the eyes was so strong it was close to blowing the circuits of the pathecorder his connoisseurs of emotion would be ecstatic when he saw the giant holos form he laughed aloud and murmured encouragement tender nothings loving nonsense so good so good a phenomenal finale blessed be the lady for sending you to me a moment later he was scowling as shadith began slogging slowly and painfully down the ramp then across the crater floor forcing her way through the pilgrims heading for the broken section of the crater wall where the road came in the cicipi gate kikun rohant and his beasts were following her that that he looked around as if the answer to handling her was pinned on the wall somewhere he was alone ajeri was in the gym and puk was still tucked away in the tranx web he rubbed his hands together glared up at the pet whose chatter was beginning to irritate him he didnt need them he knew the kephalos better than anyone it just took time stroking his thumbnail over his chin and down along his throat he contemplated cell she was halfway across the crater already the others plowing along behind her the holos of the local demigods dancing a stately pavaneabove them the pilgrims swaying and ululating lost in a trance so deep they were blind to everything but the towering images moving over their heads he examined the readouts and frowned what was pouring off the locals was beginning to move beyond the capacity of the pathecorder circuits even of the kephalos itself triggered he thought by the three especially the girl and that odd little lizardman despite the strain of his instruments it was good it was very good better than anything hed expected to capture fascinating the synergy developed by those three he unfolded cell the one assigned to rohant emptied it out and sent the pov dancing from eye to eye the scene careening here and there front and back side to side as he tried to decide what to do he did not want to break the trance and lose the dancing demigods they were going to make this edition the best he had ever created still he did not need much more of that shadowplay that giant ghostdance yes he thought yes more pathos let her alltmost reach the gate then drag her back yes ajeri tiszteh come to the bridge immediately i need you ajeri kilavez strode to her chair a vortex of nervous energy in precarious control once she was settled she glanced at cell and her mouth tightened until her lips disappeared she swung to face ginbiryol well let them get to the gate then pull them back from what i have seen all you will have to do is disrupt that trance thats all her voice dripped sarcasm he ignored that though he added it to the balance against retaining her once this project was completed you will find it easy enough simply disrupt what comes from those speakers it is her singing that controls the effect she is producing hmm ajeri swung back frowned at the cell given it works that should be easy enough all right what about the banger it is in place all it needs is the touch of my finger he held up the bony digit the flesh finger on his realhand that is not long off ajeri tiszteh good after a long dark stare at the cell she bent over her sensor board and started working the music and the voice came from everywhere sound picked up from a thousand speakers shadith singing with herself smooth as water flowing effortless as breathing or so it seemed until the pov swooped closer to her showed her face gaunt with strain sweat rolling into her eyes dripping from her nose and chin ajeri leaned forward smiling tongue moving along her lips eyes glowing with anticipation she reached slowly down and touched a sensor cell the song collapsed into a screech the kind of noise that made the teeth ache and put twitching knots in the back muscles shadith dropped the kitskew and fell to her knees her arms pressed over her ears her eyes squeezed shut kikun fell flat unconscious his eyes rolling back his mouth sagging open the cats went crazy clawing at their ears rolling on the ground during the first seconds of that assault then they howled and attacked whomever they could reach grabbing with their forelegs disemboweling with their powerful hinddaws one stroke and twist away on their feet again jaws closing on necks a shake and leap ahead to the next rohant brushed kayataki away tossed miowee off him she landed on several surviving pilgrims rolled to the ground bruised but intact and screaming for her daughter and raced after his beasts before he got near them napriests came from the crowd like maggots from meat and shot the cats into hamburger rohant the ciocan roared his fighting challenge and ran at the nearest shooters his lips drawn back from his tearing teeth his eyes red with fury as he ran past a priest snapped erect hammered him to the ground with a club like a young tree the sound cut off shadith struggled to her feet looked wildly around started running head down driving as hard as she could for the gate a napriest came after her whipped his stranglecord about her neck jerked her back against his body tightened the ligature she started to lift her hands then there wasnt anything left a chime sounded repeatedly a pleasant bonging sound with an unpleasant message quiverwort was announcing the arrival of a starshipover a week before he was expecting it ginbiryol swore swung round and tapped off the alarm it might be coincidence a wandering trader but he didnt think so he set the kephalos searching for the intruder and turned to the pilot wake up the paems and get ready to go fast ajeri tiszt thirty minutes no more then we run for the limit trouble it could be we will continue to record as long as possible when the time comes to leave he pointed to the traces of a ship racing recklessly insystem head out ninety degrees that line as fast as you can wind her up he looked at the track of the incoming ship for a minute yes im sure of it that has to be a vryhh ship if we are not obtrusive about it i believe the hunter will ignore our departure in favor of the world itself he smiled tightly slanted his eyes at ajeri with a little luck she will still be there when the banger lets loose luck oh yes he turned his shoulder to her and went back to watching the scene in cell unfold cell the stink of perfumed oils brought her back she was tied to the center pole of a sacrifice pyre her boots sunk in the carved sticks mlowee bound beside her knees like a slave sacrificed to serve her mistress in the afterlife kayataki beside her mother bound and gagged so she wouldnt cry out when the fire took her both of them tethered to the center post shadith tried to say something but all she could do was croak her throat felt destroyed he should have ended it that priest he was too cruel ropes wound round her knees to neck no more running no more maybes left for her kikun was slumped on her left he was alive but his soul was somewhere else the body was an empty sac rohant was on her right struggling with the ropes that bound him to his pole so much rope he was like a worm in a cocoon blood dripped from the wound on the back of his head his eyes were glazed wild no intelligence left only the ancestral beast glaring out the gospah ayawit came from the side and stood in front of shadith he was furious and afraid of the consequences flowing from the past hours events for one thing oppalatin had almost been denied his prime sacrificethe thought of his gods vengeance for this failure made him sweat all over and there were kiskaids bloodily publicly deadalready howls out there for his hide rebels stirring everyone up against him and against the nistamhis hold on power would be even more precarious and the nistam was not a man to tolerate the lapses of his subordinates both aspects of the gospahs ambitions the sacred and the secular were put at risk by what the singer had done what they all had done those cursed avatars if they were such by your choice so be it he chanted his voice carried out over speakers suddenly cleared of noise or so it seemed to shadith as she twisted her wrists against the ropes searching for a way to slip her hands clear you chose to begin the last battle beforetime so do you bring the culmination on you also beforetime come the sundown we send you home he bowed turned and walked to the front brought his staff down three times on a sounding board and the ritual took up where the priestmimes the longhomers and the choir had left off when she brought their gods to life for a moment she gavein to panic then she bit down hard on her lip closed her eyes and reachedsearching for something anything she could use to disrupt what was happening rats or any sort of furry capable of chewing the ropes off her i wont give up she croaked the words lost in the hoom of the horns the doorndoom of the drums wont give up as long as im breathing there has to be a way has to be she spoke aloud to help focus her efforts to escape from a terrorinduced paisivity to remind herself of the fragility of the body she wore despite the pain in her throat she kept on talking as she searched shadows crawled across the bubble as the sun descended time was running out ginny were ready give the word and we go ginbiryol grimaced he was going to miss the burning well what could not be cured must be endured he glanced at the shiptrack at the rate she was going the hunter would reach kiskai about sundown a nose to nose finish with the fire he spent a second hoping she would be just too late then he unlocked the killlink and touched the sensor right he said the bangs set for the moment we cross the limit go as ginbiryol seyirshis ship slid into the insplit her detecs registered an enormous burst of radiation he turned his head smiled at ajeri then coaxed the pet into his lap and began stroking the simis velvety fur chapter boom shadith let the reach fade even sassa was too far off to answer her call driven away like all the other beasts and birds by the turmoil in the crater she was shaking with fatigue her strength was gone her mind was mush all she could see was fire all she could think about was fire their voices deep burring near subsonic the choir was chanting ma ma ma the lugikes picked up the sound transmitted it to the pilgrims along with the longhorn bellows and the beats of the godmimes feet on the great drums the cameras at the front of the bubble sent images dark and bright of the choir the gospah and the godmimes out to those thousand screens scattered about the crater showed the pilgrims their shadowforms circling through the ancient dance of the gods the back of the bubble was dark and quiet the cameras there were turned off until it was time for the fire there was no lugikes close enough to pick up the screams of the burning avatars that would be aesthetically unpleasing the ropes were wound round and round shadith knees to neck were jerked so tight they dug grooves in her flesh she fought against them until her arms and legs were numb and swollen and she couldnt move them anymore finally she rested her head against the pole closed her eyes out on the crater floor new trancenodes were forming about ghost dancers and chanting rebels men were calling for the avatars they were calling for the three to come back they were cursing priests pliciks and the nistam women children and grandparents moved into enlarging knots and began pushing toward the edges of the crater rage built across that floor rage against the priests and the pliciks and the nistam himself tanak and maka blaming him and his followers for the dead blaming him for the vanishing of the demigodsthe pilgrims demigods not the priests not the pliciks most of all not the nistams it was unifying them again that rage pulling them together almost as strongly as shadith had the sticks were heavy on shadiths feet and the stench of the oils that saturated them crawled up her nose she wanted to sneeze but she was too tired her eyes burned with the sweat dripping down her face there were napriests out among the pilgrims exhorting them threatening them ayawit had given the orders they moved in a fog of rage untouched by it arrogant in their reliance on the terror their black vizards produced in everyone who saw them the pilgrims moved back from them muttering inaudibly not yet worked up enough to overcome their fear and attack these symbols of the sacred authority a row of napriests were crouching across the front of the stage they werent watching the captives any more they were watching the pilgrims like the pilgrims they had dropped out of the celebration like the pilgrims they paid no attention to the ritual they no longer felt its compulsion they were too afraid too angry serene in his conviction that he was right and would prevail the gospah chanted his litanies and moved through a choreography of worship so old it antedated the arrival of the kiskaids on kiskai shadith was so tired so very tired maybe it was time to accept the inevitable shed lived long shed known more worlds than most people knew cities it was a strange life but a good onein many ways though not all she didnt want to die not now but there was no way no way the pyres were cubic piles of seasoned hardwood each piece of wood carved and saturated with sacred oils raised two meters high about the center post the top of each pile was relatively flat two meters by two meters square tethered to that center post by short lengths of rope miowee and kayataki lay on the wood by shadiths feet more cursorily bound than she was hands tied behind their backs kayatakis ankles also bound the child was gagged presumably because the celebrants didnt fancy listening to the screams of a little girl but they hadnt bothered with the woman miowee had forced her body around until her back was pressed against kayatakis she was cursing and struggling with the rope on her daughters wrists her fingers bleeding as she tried to solve knots she couldnt see so her child could wriggle loose a sound came from the maka and the tanak a low growl not loud enough yet to overcome the volume of the chant pouring through the speakers but it was growing a wordless shapeless sound as the men began pressing toward the bubble and the portable crystal palace where the nistam sat shadith heard that sound and she savored it she wouldnt be going into the dark alonethe men who murdered her would be just as dead it wasnt much of a comfort but it was something she managed a wry smile as she remembered telling miowee if youre set on dying take him with you him being makwahkik what with one thing and another makwahkik was the one that went not miowee not shadith the nistam would go this time probably the gospah the napriests she wouldnt see it sun was almost down for sure not much comfort the gospah finished his supplication and began turning in stately circles while the choir slid into another litany of praises he was pressing on to the end despite all distractions a moment ago when he moved offstage for a change of paraphernalia the niot pipondihek chief of the nistams personal guard exliwa to kati mola brought orders to cut the ceremony short and light the fires so they could get the hell out of there before the place exploded he nodded politely acknowledging the command and ignored it thereafter the nistams wishes were not important now there were things that must be done if the sacrifice was to be acceptable that was more important than the nistams life more important than his own miowee was whining with frustration an odd little sound rather like the noise an exhausted and angry puppy might make her fingers were strong and agile but she couldnt see what she was doing and the knot had been pulled tight by a napriest with long experience in the unnatural strength of people pushed beyond their limits shadith blinked the sweat out of her eyes twisted her neck around so she could look down at the singer mee it was more of a groan than a word but her voice was beginning to come back to her this body was resilient as hard rubber recovering with a speed that still managed to astonish her it was too bad she shrugged off regret tried again mee listen what miowee didnt look up just kept on clawing at the knot if you can reach my left boot theres a knife in it but be careful dont get near kaya with it youd cut her in half before you knew what was happening what good is it then cut the tethers roll her off the prye at least she wont burn ah her eyes closed her mouth working miowee slumped for a moment against kayatakis back then she shuddered collected herself and began working her body back around until she could reach the boot top listening as she moved to shadiths explanation of how to get into the sheath the nistam was in a rage almost as great as the pilgrims a fury he intended to exorcise by ridding himself of that idiot ayawit after this stupidity was over with and he was back safe behind the kiceota walls until the ceremony was completed until the culmination was enacted he couldnt leave he had to perch on this ugly uncomfortable throne and put his neck on the line his own neck elementary precautions were one thing running from a gaggle of maka clods was something else his legitimacy and the power it conferred on him came from family tradition and the reputation of his ancestors running now would destroy thatand him there were dozens of other pliciks and plicik clans with ambitions to replace him and his half of them sitting around him now watching him in the cavern behind the portable palace the niot pipondihek was calling in reinforcements from the city and the countryside every plicik capable of bearing arms it was a desperate throw the landlords and their forces might prove more dangerous to him than the pilgrims but they were a greedy lot with delusions of competence feuding with their neighbors trusting no one and far easier to manipulate than the bloody fanatics out there now divide and buy his ancestors had done it before and won in smaller ways he had kept himself intact and in power buying and dividing he could do it againand win the nistam sat impassively behind glass and steel and watched the not developing around him miowee drew the crystal knife from the sheath in the boot but her hands were clumsy because she couldnt see them and she didnt fully understand the danger of the blade as she pulled it out it sliced through ropes and cloth and pared away skin and muscle from shadiths leg until she felt the warm gush on her hands and twisted around to see what was happening miowee wasnt aware of what shed done she sucked in a breath as she saw the red flood shadow yeh i know shadith managed a creaky laugh told you death to the pliciks death to the godkillers dencipim came out of the crowd leaped the rope and buried the pistol in the belly of the nearest royal guard as he pulled the trigger he snatched off the guards gilded helmet threw it to the men following him over the rope death to the pliciks death to the godkillers darkness flowed across the crater the shadows at the back of the bubble thickened shadith froze but the rite went droning on and the sun came out again cloud or what maka and tana began throwing themselves at the guards and the portable palace coming at it in waves individual men dying and dying and dying the waves never dying death to the pliciks death to the godkillers miowee shifted cautiously located the tether that bound kayataki to the pole kaya mmmmphmm it was a small sound but as much noise as the girl could make around the gag it was just audible above the chanting of the choir the groan of the longhorns the doomdoom of the drums child of mine you know how to fall soon as youre loose go over the edge then scoot for the back find a hole and crawl in you hear me mmmooohminm the sound rose in protest the child shook her head do it im coming soon as im loose but i swear baby i wont move till youre out of sight mmnimm it was a falling sound this time acquiescence shivering and icy pale kayataki hunched forward pushed her head against her mothers side then pulled back stretching the tether taut so itd be easier to cut miowee handled the knife more awkwardly than she intended applying too much force despite her care the blade went through both ropes hers and kayas without noticing them and kept on going missing her buttock by a hair and sinking into one of the oily sticks she let go of the hilt as if shed closed her hand about a snake a redheaded woman came riding through the cicipi gate sitting in an arslibre howda mounted on the arching back of an immense and ugly warbot like the worst possible cross between a spider and a lobster two more paced alongside and a third followed behind they shot gouts of steam through spiracles along their sides opening a path for themselves through the surging throng of kiskaids walking with ominous sinuous inevitability through the selfcreated clouds of steam the pilgrims scrambled to get away from the things frantic with terror seeing them as demons from hells cellar maka and tanak were swarming over the glass palace stomping on it kicking at it shooting at it with guns theyd brought with them or taken from dead guards the glass was chipped and webbed with cracks but would not break the cage groaned from the weight it was carrying but refused to collapse men died their bodies piling up against the glass inside the portable palace the nistam stared grimly at grotesque dead faces staring sightlessly back at him loyal guards fired into the mob killing hundreds but a half a million men were coming at them they couldnt kill them all there wasnt enough room for aiming or even for using their rifles effectively one by one they were falling about half the guardforce deserted and slid into the crowd the moment they got a chance to tear off their uniforms by will and the force of the discipline hed imposed on aspirants all the long years hed been gospah ayawit was holding the rite together despite the chaos out on the floor of the crater though he was gradually losing some of his priests the core held the longhorners played their bassnotes the choir sang the godmimes dancedand the napriests crouched in the guardline between the gospah and the people one by one the weaker souls slipped away throwing off their robes and cassocks stealing clothing off the dead melting into the mob outside but the core held as miowee went over the edge and landed with a thump on the planks behind the pyres shadith sagged against the ropes they gave a little she could move her hands her arms after a moment she understood why getting the knife out miowee had cut through several loops of the coil that bound her to the pole and that coil was beginning to unwind her leg burned a little but she still wasnt feeling much pain the crystal cut too clean she flexed her knee gasped at the sudden agony felt sick when her foot sloshed in the blood that was filling the boot the knife hadnt touched an artery but she was leaking like a holey pot im going to bleed to death she thought no she rocked her body the rope unwound faster and faster fire she was fire the gospah was coming toward her his eyes glazed with the intensity of his concentration he didnt see the loosened rope she had the feeling he saw nothing but whatever it was inside his head his arms were outstretched and empty but three kam priests behind him held torches he stopped in front of her he chanted something a kam priest gave him a torch his voice rising to a shriek ayawit looped it onto her pyre it landed by her feet the sticks caught exploded into a sheet of flame shadith closed her eyes stopped breathing she shut down everything but that rough pressure against her body and the slow agonizing dance that kept the rope uncoiling until she tore the last loops off her neck and shoulders she dropped to her knees reached through fire and grabbed the knife ignoring the pain as the hot hilt burned into her palm then she flung herself off the back of the pyre her bleeding leg giving way as she landed on the planks beside miowee your wrists push them away from you not daring to cut all the way through she didnt have time to take care not to slice into miowees arms she nicked the rope round her wrists deeply enough she hoped to let the singer break free then started crawling toward kikuns pyre which was burning now as the gospah marched away with the last torch crossing to rohant she heard shouts shooting ignored them as she stabbed the knife into a stick near the top then concentrated on pulling herself up the back of the pyre the choirs chant faltered stopped the kam priests shouted and began pushing and jumping trying to get away from something that was more terrifying than the gospahs anger the longhorns went silent the drums stopped sounding there was a rattle of highpitched pings so close together they produced an almost continuous whine that improbably filled the whole of the broken bubble shadith levered herself over the edge of the pile retrieved the knife and cut cautiously at the coil of rope binding kikun to the center pole he woke from his trance and began helping her peel the rope away his face was blistered from the heat of the flames he was coughing as a few tendrils of oily smoke blew into his nostrils the fire quit one minute it was there the next gone leaving behind a foul stench and a sudden chill as if whatever had snuffed it had not only killed the flames but sucked the heat out of the fuel that fed them out of the air itself steadying herself as her leg threatened to give way again shadith grabbed at the center post and gaped at the devastation in the bubble bodies sprawled everywhere piled on top of each other stunned not dead they were still breathing the new arrival sitting calmly in the middle of all this on a huge warbot of worldclass ugliness three smaller clones of the thing standing guard behind it aleytys grinned at her eh shadow dea ex machina reporting for duty eh lee shadith closed her eyes popped them open again as she remembered you better machinate some more or all well be is smears on rubble she eased the blade into the center post above kikuns head she didnt trust herself with it not any more i suppose you didnt see any ship in orbit someone was skittering for the limit thought id better collect you first machinate howand why that someone probably left us a little present planetkiller think you can locate it say its there lovely friends you have here before you bleed to death and waste my worry aleytys tossed a medpac to shadith then snapped a command to the warbot she was riding it twisted its long jointed neck up and around bringing its head close to hers she began talking rapidly and inaudibly into its shielded sensors leaving kikun to finish freeing himself shadith eased down onto the quenched and blackened sticks maneuvering her wounded leg around so she could see the cut not much point in cleaning it up now leave that to lees autodoc better stop the bleeding though sar ive lost enough blood on this jauza world to feed a vampire for a year come on come on lee move it we die now i swear ill haunt you hey i wonder if one ghost can haunt another sheehl pm getting giddy she broke the seal brought out the canned bandage and sprayed a thick layer of foam over the cut the foam solidified into resilient fauxskinthat hurt pressure on the damaged nerve ends knowing what was doing it didnt help at all hands shaking she dug out a painpopper checked the dials her eyes blurring unreliably then managed to get a pop into her leg and shut off the agony cool dry fingertips touched her face all right right enough kikun straightened looked around useful friend yeh i had better cut the ciocan loose dont you think cool him down first um you know about the knife i know cuts anything not a great exaggeration my friend wa he gazed across the backs of the warbots shook his head at the bloody screaming war going on out in the crater wa weh shadith grimaced as he jumped down the knife held loosely in his left hand he was surefooted but given the properties of the crystal prancing about with it like that came absurdly close to suicide shed done the same thing a minute ago but she hadnt been tracking very well just then aleytys was still talking to that bot shadiths stomach knotted and she swallowed hastily to keep her dinner down that ship of hers tigatri she calls it daughter i dont know maybe it she can handle the banger be the baddest joke in the universe if lee rescued us just in time we all get blown to nada got here faster than i expected maybe depends on ginny doubleknotter if i read him right hell want to be insplitting before the banger goes if gives us some hours working time maybe i dont know i dont know she hitched painfully over to the center pole leaned against it and shut her eyes its chelae absurdly gentle the warbot plucked shadith off the pyre and deposited her beside aleytys who was leaning back but keeping a wary eye on the readouts spread across the front of the howda shadith forced herself erect lee relax tigatris got the banger located shes slapped a stasis field around it thats the good news bad news is theres no way of shutting it down and the field eats power like its cotton candy on a stick shes in the process of hauling the thing up and carting it to the next world out thats an iceworld barren better it goes than this one thatll shake up the system some but kiskai and these people theyll survive she glanced over her shoulder at the war outside the bubble if they dont kill each other off first how long before we can get out of here about an hour oh shadith hauled her leg up rested her ankle on the front of the howda well i lasted this long she inspected aleytys had the baby hmm two months ago daughter aleytys eyes went fond and sappy shadiths assessment she smiled down at her hands her names lilai youll meet her when we go onboard tigatri shes beautiful shadow shes a little firehair got angelcurls redder than mine greys gaga over her he didnt want me to bring her but im not leaving her like i did my son no never where i go she goes rohant was squatting on his pyre scowling abruptly his face relaxed he got to his feet shadow im calling sassa in tell your friend to let him through right aleytys raised a brow sassa hawk ah she lay back closed her eyes bird raptor admit shaditheased back the tension dropping out of her for the first time in months she was safe she didnt have to fight any more she didnt have to scramble or run she could lie there and let the minutes drift past she enjoyed it for about a minute and a half then her eyes popped open and she sat up again miowee she said kikun she broke off then burst out laughing as the little lacertine came stumping between the pyres miowee on his back and kayataki following behind kikun if you cant read minds you do a good imitation kikun wiggled his pointed ears he deposited miowee on rohants bench and went trotting into the darkness behind the pyres a minute later he was back with the paleka kitskew and her harp he set them by the bench and dropped into a squat beside them shadith took hold of her leg and shifted it down caught hold of the top of the console and pressed herself forward until she could see the singer better looks like your revolutions kicked off to a good start mee what about you what are you going to do miowee passed her hand over her tumbled tangled hair wait she said after a while ive got people out there when the fightings over it will be over soon it cant last kaya and i well go back to ainairil and see what we can do to help pull things together asteplikotas going to be looking for who killed his brother ill face that when if i have to come with us ill get you into a place where you can regrow your legs fix your eye starfolk klem you know miowee covered her face with both hands hunched her shoulders for a long time she said nothing then she shook her head no she said no be reasonable mee the next months are going to be hell and a half by the time you get back things willve settled down some reasonable the word exploded out of her she glared up at shadith if id been reasonable id be dead reasonable snuffs out the light i never have been reasonable and im not going to change now look at me i can make you look at me i can make you see me i can make you listen you listen out of pity and horror but you do listen and you hear she sighed youre a nice child shadow and you mean to be kind but you dont understand maybe not but i am who i am shadow i am what ive made myself and its something to take pride in i wont take gifts i wont unmake me there was a soft almost subliminal chime aleytys sat up frowned at the console theres a swarm of flits coming this way miowee heard her laughed not a nice sound one gift she cried ill take one gift will your friend open the glass for us crack the oyset so we can get at the putrid pearl inside nistam the nistam let us have him if we die for it shadith nodded yes i owe that lot something too lee if you mean that hill out there look at the thing shadow its five deep with stomping locals i doubt you want me to punch holes through them kaya bring the kitskew miowee pushed off the bench crawled rapidly toward the front of the bubble humping over the stunned sacerdotes scattered about the planks ignoring them wriggling through the jointed warbot legs ignoring them at the outer edge of the stage she settled herself on the back of a recumbent napriest took the paleka kitskew from her daughter tuned it and began playing improbably the sound cut through the noise shed collected a lugike sometime during her crawl shadith hadnt seen her do it but was amused it was so like the woman practical and outrageous at once harrowee darrowee yarrowee hoo she sang hear ye oh heed ye oh dearie my loo i am miowee you know me you do at first it seemed absurd singing a song and a nonsensesong at that to a warinprogress but one then another another and another called out miowee miowee miowee its miowee listen the name went skittering across
