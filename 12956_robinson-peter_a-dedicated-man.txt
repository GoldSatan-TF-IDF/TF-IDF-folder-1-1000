peter robinson a dedicated man one when the sun rose high enough to clear the slate roofs on the other side of the street it crept through a chink in sally lumbs curtain and lit on a strand of gold blonde hair that curled over her cheek she was dreaming minotaurs bank clerks gazelles and trolls cavorted through the barns maisonettes and gothic palaces of her sleep but when she awoke a few hours later all she was left with was the disturbing image of a cat picking its way along a high wall topped with broken glass dreams most of them she ignored they had nothing to do with the other kind of dreams the most important ones that she didnt have to fall asleep to find in these dreams she passed her exams and was accepted into the marion boyars academy of theatre arts there she studied acting modelling and cosmetic technique for sally was realistic enough to know that if she lacked the dramatic talent of a kate winslet or a gwyneth paltrow she could at least belong to the fringes of the world of glamour when sally finally stirred the bar of sunlight had shifted to the floor beside her bed striping the untidy pile of clothes she had dropped there the night before she could hear plates and cutlery in the kitchen downstairs and the rich smell of roast beef wafted up to her room she got up it was good policy she thought to get downstairs as soon as possible and help with the vegetables before her mothers call its on the table came grating up to her at least by showing a willingness to help she could probably avoid too probing an investigation into her lateness last night sally stared at herself in the fulllength mirror of her old oak wardrobe even if there was still a little puppy fat around her hips and thighs it would soon go away on the whole she decided she had a good body her breasts were perfect most people of course complimented her on her long silky hair but they hadnt seen her breasts kevin had just last night he had caressed them and told her they were perfect last night they had gone almost all the way and sally knew that the next time soon they would she looked forward to it with a mixture of fear and desire that according to what she had read in magazines and books would soon fuse into ecstasy in the heat of passion and longing sally touched her nipple with the tip of her forefinger and felt a tingle in her loins the nipple hardened and she moved away from the mirror to get dressed her face burning kevin was good he knew how to excite her ever since summer began he had played carefully with the boundaries of her desire he had pushed them back a little further each time and soon the whole country would be his he was young like sally but still he seemed to know instinctively how to please her just as she imagined an experienced older man would know she even thought she loved kevin a bit but if someone else came along somebody more mature more wealthy more sophisticated someone who was at home in the exciting fastpaced cities of the world well after all kevin was only a farm boy at heart dressed in designer jeans and a plain white tshirt sally drew back the curtains when her eyes had adjusted to the glare she looked out on a perfect swainsdale morning a few fluffy little clouds one like a teddy bear another like a crab scudded across the piercing blue sky on a light breeze she looked north up the broad slope of the valley side its rich greens interrupted here and there by dark patches of heather and outcrops of limestone to the long sheer wall of crow scar and noticed something very odd at first she couldnt make it out at all then she squinted refocused and saw spreading out along the slope just above the old road five or six blue dots which seemed to be moving in some kind of pattern she put her finger to her lips thought for a moment then frowned two fifteen miles away in eastvale the dales largest town somebody else was anticipating a sunday dinner of succulent roast beef and yorkshire pudding detective chief inspector alan banks lay flat on his stomach in brians room watching an electric train whizz around bends over bridges through signals and under papier mache mountains brian himself was out riding his bike in the local park but banks had long since given up the pretence that he only played with the trains for his sons sake and finally admitted that he found the pastime even more relaxing than a hot bath he heard the phone ring out in the hall and a few seconds later his daughter tracy shouted through its for you dad as banks rushed downstairs the aroma from the kitchen made his mouth water he thanked tracy and picked up the receiver it was sergeant rowe desk officer at eastvale regional headquarters sorry to bother you sir rowe began but weve just had a call from constable weaver over in helmthorpe seems a local farmers found a body in one of his fields this morning go on banks urged snapping into professional gear chap said he was looking for a stray sheep sir when he found this body buried by a wall weaver says he shifted one or two stones and its a dead un all right looks like someone bashed is ead in banks felt the tightening in his stomach that always accompanied news of murder he had transferred from london a year ago sickened by the spiralling of senseless violence there only to find in the gallows view case that things could be just as bad if not worse up north the business had left both him and sandra emotionally exhausted but since then things had settled down thered been nothing but a few burglaries and one case of fraud to occupy his attention and he had really begun to believe that murders peeping toms and vicious teenagers were the exception rather than the rule in eastvale tell constable weaver to get back up there with as many local men as he can muster and rope off the area i want them to start a systematic search but i dont want anyone else closer to the body than ten yards got that the last thing he needed was half a dozen flatfoots trampling down the few square feet where clues were most likely to be found tell them to put everything they find into marked envelopes he went on they should know the procedure but it wont do any harm to remind them and i mean everything used rubbers the lot get in touch with detective sergeant hatchley and dr glendenning tell them to get out there immediately ill want the photographer and the forensic team too okay yes sir sergeant rowe replied he knew that jim hatchley would be enjoying his usual sunday lunchtime pint in the oak and that it would give banks a great deal of satisfaction to interrupt his pleasure i suppose the supers been informed yes sir it was him as said to tell you it would be banks complained i dont suppose he wanted to miss his sunday dinner but he spoke with humour and affection superintendent gristhorpe of all his new colleagues was the one who had given him the most support and encouragement during the difficult transition from city to country banks hung up and slipped on his worn brown jacket with the elbow patches he was a small dark man in appearance rather like the old celtic strain of welshman and his physique certainly didnt give away his profession sandra bankss wife emerged from the kitchen as he was preparing to leave what is it she asked looks like a murder she wiped her hands on her blue checked pinafore so you wont be in for dinner sorry love doesnt look like it and i dont suppose theres any point in keeping it warm shouldnt think so ill grab a sandwich somewhere he kissed her quickly on the lips dont worry ill give you a call as soon as i know whats happening banks drove his white cortina west along the valley bottom by the riverside he was entitled to a police car and driver but he actually enjoyed driving and preferred his own company when travelling to and from a case a generous mileage allowance more than compensated for the cost with one eye on the road and one hand on the wheel he flipped through an untidy pile of cassette tapes on the passenger seat selected one and slipped it into the deck though he swore that his passion for opera had not waned over the winter he had to admit that he had been sidetracked into the world of english vocal and choral music it was a change sandra heartily approved of she had never liked opera much in the first place and wagner had been the last straw for her after she had finally gone so far as to attack one of his tapes with a magnet the one with siegfrieds funeral march on it banks remembered sadly he had got the message with ian partridge singing dowlands i saw my lady weepe he drove on like the larger and more famous yorkshire dales swainsdale runs more or less from west to east with a slight list towards the south until the humble river loses itself in the ouse at its source near swainshead high in the pennine fells the river swain is nothing more than a trickle of sparkling clear water but in carving its way down towards the north sea it has formed with the help of glaciers and geological faults a long and beautiful dale which broadens out as it approaches the vale of york the main town eastvale dominated by its norman castle sits at the extreme eastern edge of the dale and looks out over the rich fertile plain on a clear day the hambleton hills and the north york moors are visible in the distance he saw lyndgarth on the valley side to the north near the dark ruins of devraulx abbey and passed through peaceful fortford where the remains of a roman fort were still under excavation on a hillock opposite the village green ahead he could see the bright limestone curve of crow scar high up on his right and as he drew closer he noticed the local police searching a field marked off by irregular drystone walls the limestone shone bright in the sun and the walls stood out against the grass like pearl necklaces on an emerald velvet cushion to get to the scene banks had to drive through helmthorpe the dales central market village turn right at the bridge on to hill road and then turn right again on to a narrow road that meandered northeastwards about halfway up the valley side it was a miracle that the track had ever been tarmacked probably a gesture towards increasing tourism banks guessed no good for tyre tracks though he thought gloomily being more used to getting around in the city than in the countryside he scraped his knee climbing the low wall and stumbled over the lumpy sods of grass in the field finally out of breath he got to where a uniformed man presumably constable weaver stood talking to a gnarled old farmer about fifty yards up the slope by the side of the northsouth wall loosely covered with earth and stones lay the body enough of its covering had been removed to make it recognizable as a man the head lay to one side and kneeling beside it banks could see that the hair at the back was matted with blood a jolt of nausea shot through his stomach but he quickly controlled it as he began to make mental notes about the scene standing up he was struck by the contrast between the beautiful serene day and the corpse at his feet anything been disturbed he asked weaver stepping carefully back over the rope not much sir the young constable replied his face was white and the sour smell on his breath indicated that he had probably been sick over the wall natural enough banks thought probably the lads first corpse mr tavistock here he gestured towards the whiskered farmer says he just moved those stones around the head to see what his dog was scratting at banks looked at tavistock whose grim expression betrayed a man used to death exarmy most likely and old enough to have seen action in two world wars i were lookin fer one o my sheep tavistock began in a slow thick yorkshire accent and i saw that there damage to t wall i thought thered bin a clapse he paused and rubbed his grizzly chin there shouldnt a bin no clapse in a bessthwaite wall bin there sin eighteen thirty that as any road old ben started scratting at first i thought nowt on it then he shrugged as if there was nothing more to be said what did you do when you realized what it was banks asked tavistock scratched his turkey neck and spat on the grass just ad a look thats all i thought it might a bin a sheep somebodyd killed that appens sometimes then i ran ome he pointed to a farmhouse about half a mile away and i called young weaver ere banks was dubious about the ran but he was glad that tavistock had acted quickly he turned away and gave instructions to the photographer and the forensic team then took off his jacket and leaned against the warm stone wall while the boffins did their work three sally slammed down her knife and fork and yelled at her father just because i go for a walk with a boy it doesnt mean im a tramp or a trollop or any of those things sally mrs lumb butted in stop shouting at your father that wasnt what he meant and you know it sally continued to glare well thats what it sounded like to me he was only trying to warn you her mother went on you have to be careful boys try to take advantage of you sometimes especially a goodlooking girl like you she said it with a mixture of pride and fear you dont have to treat me like im a baby you know sally said im sixteen now she gave her mother a pitying glance cast another baleful look at her father and went back to her roast beef aye said mr lumb and youll do as youre told till youre eighteen thats the law to sally the man sitting opposite her was at the root of all her problems and of course charles lumb fitted easily into the role his daughter had assigned him that of an oldfashioned narrowminded yokel whose chief argument against anything new and interesting was what was good enough for my father and his father before him is good enough for you too young lady there was a strong conservative streak in him only to be expected of someone whose family had lived in the area for more generations than could be remembered a traditionalist charles lumb often said that the dale as he had loved it was dying he knew that the only chance for the young was to get away and that saddened him quite soon he was certain even the inhabitants of the dales villages would belong to the national trust english heritage or the open spaces society like creatures in a zoo they would be paid to act out their quaint old ways in a kind of living museum the grandson of a cabinetmaker lumb who worked at the local dairy factory found it hard to see things otherwise the old crafts were dying out because they were uneconomic and only tourists kept one cooper one blacksmith and one wheelwright in business but because lumb was a yorkshireman through and through he tended to bait and tease in a manner that could easily be taken too seriously by an ambitious young girl like sally he delivered the most outrageous statements and opinions about her interests and dreams in such a deliberately deadpan voice that anyone could be excused for not catching the gentle mocking humour behind them if he had been less sarcastic and his daughter less selfcentred they might have realized that they loved each other very much the thing was though charles lumb would have liked to see more evidence of common sense in his daughter she was certainly a bright girl and it would be easy for her to get into university and become a doctor or a lawyer a damn sight easier he reflected than it was in his day but no it had to be this bloody academy and for all he tried he could see no value in learning how to paint faces and show off swimsuits if he had thought she had it in her to become a great actress then he might have been more supportive but he didnt maybe time would prove him wrong he hoped so at least seeing her on the telly would be something sally after a few minutes sulking decided to change the topic of conversation have you seen those men on the hill she asked i wonder what theyre doing looking for something i shouldnt wonder her father replied dryly still not recovered from the argument sally ignored him they look like policemen to me you can see the buttons of their uniforms shining im going up there to have a look after dinner theres already quite a crowd along the road well make sure youre back before midnight her mother said it cleared the air a bit and they enjoyed the rest of their meal in peace sally walked up the hill road and turned right past the cottages as she hurried on she danced and grabbed fistfuls of dry grass which she flung up high in the air several cars blocked the road by the field and what had looked from a distance like a large crowd turned out to be nothing more than a dozen or so curious tourists with their cameras rucksacks and hiking boots it was open country almost moorland despite the drystone walls that crisscrossed the landscape and gave it some semblance of order they were old and only the farmers remembered who had built them there was more activity in the field than she could recollect ever seeing in such an isolated place uniformed men crawled on all fours in the wild grass and the area by the wall had been cordoned off with stakes and rope inside the charmed circle stood a man with a camera another with a black bag and seemingly presiding over the whole affair a small wiry man with a brown jacket slung over his shoulder sallys eyesight was so keen that she could even see the small patches of sweat under his arms she asked the middleaged walker standing next to her what was going on and the man told her he thought thered been a murder of course it had to be shed seen similar things on the telly four banks glanced back towards the road hed noticed a flashing movement but it was only a girls blonde hair catching the sun dr glendenning the tall whitehaired pathologist had finished shaking limbs and inserting his thermometer in orifices now he stood cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth muttering about what a warm night it had been as he made calculations in his little red notebook it was just as well banks thought as he looked over at the spectators that two of the forensic team had first examined the roadside they had found nothing no skid marks or tyre tracks on the tarmac no clear footprints on the grassy verge but it looked as if someone or something had been dragged up the field from the road glendenning confirmed that the victim had been killed elsewhere and merely dumped in this isolated spot that would cause problems if they had no idea where the man had been killed they wouldnt know where to start looking for the killer the doctor rambled on adjusting his column of figures and banks sniffed the air feeling again that it was too fine a day and too beautiful a spot for such unpleasant business even the young photographer peter darby as he snapped the body from every conceivable angle said that normally on such a day he would be out photographing rawley force at a slow shutter speed or zooming in on petals with his macro lens praying that a bee or a butterfly would remain still for as long as it took to focus and shoot he had photographed corpses before banks knew so he was used to the unpleasantness all the same it was worlds away from butterflies and waterfalls glendenning looked up from his notebook and screwed up his eyes in the sunlight a halfinch of ash floated to the ground and banks found himself wondering whether the doctor performed surgery with a cigarette in his mouth letting ash fall around the incision smoking was strictly prohibited at the scene of a crime of course but nobody dared mention this to glendenning it was a warm night he explained to banks with a scottish lilt to his nicotineravaged voice i cant give an accurate estimate of time of death most likely though it was after dark last night and before sunrise this morning bloody wonderful banks thought we dont know where he was killed but we know it was sometime during the night sorry glendenning added catching banks expression not your fault anything else blow to the back of the head if i may translate the cumbersome medical jargon into laymans terms pretty powerful too skull cracked like an egg any idea what weapon was used proverbial blunt instrument sharpedged like a wrench or a hammer i cant be more specific at this point but id rule out a brick or a rock its too neat and i cant find any trace of particles full report after the autopsy of course is that all yes you can have him taken to the mortuary now if youve finished with the pictures banks nodded he asked a uniformed constable to send for an ambulance and glendenning packed his bag weaver sergeant hatchley come over here a minute banks called and watched the two men walk over any idea who the dead man was he asked weaver yes sir the pale constable answered his names harry steadman lives in the village married yes sir then wed better get in touch with his wife sergeant would you go over to mr tavistocks house and take an official statement hatchley nodded slowly is there a decent pub in helmthorpe banks asked weaver i usually drink at the bridge sir food not bad right banks turned to hatchley well go and see mrs steadman while you attend to tavistock lets meet up in the bridge for a bite to eat when weve done all right hatchley agreed and lumbered off with tavistock there was no chance of a roast beef dinner at home now in fact there would be few meals at home until the crime was solved banks knew from experience that once a murder investigation begins there is no stopping and little slowing down even for family life the crime invades meal times ablutions and sleep it dominates conversation and puts up an invisible barrier between the investigator and his family he looked down at the village spread out crookedly by a bend in the river its grey slate roofs gleaming in the sun the clock on the square church tower said twelve thirty sighing he nodded to weaver and the two of them set off towards the car they passed through the small crowd ignoring the local reporters tentative questions and got into the cortina banks cleared the cassettes from the passenger seat so that weaver could sit beside him tell me what you know about steadman banks said as he reversed into a gateway and turned around lived here about eighteen months weaver began used to come regular for holidays and sort of fell in love with the place he inherited a fortune from his father and set himself up here used to be a university professor in leeds educated chap but not stuckup early forties bit over sixfoot tall sandy hair still quite younglooking they live in gratly i thought you said they lived in the village same thing really sir weaver explained you see gratlys just a little hamlet a few old houses off the road doesnt even have a pub but now the newer houses have spread up the hill the two are as near as makes no difference the locals like to keep the name though sense of independence i suppose banks drove down the hill towards the bridge weaver pointed ahead over the river and up the opposite valley side thats gratly sir banks saw the row of new houses some still under construction then there was a space of about a hundred yards before the crossroads lined with older cottages i see what you mean banks said at least the builders were doing a tasteful job following the design of the originals and using the same local stone weaver went on making conversation no doubt intended to help him forget the sight of his first corpse just about all the new houses in helmthorpe are at this side of the village youll get nothing new on the east side some bright sparks say its because it was settled from the east vikings saxons romans and whatnot course you dont find many traces of them now but the place stills seems to spread westwards he thought about what hed said for a moment and added with a smile spreads slowly that is sir much as banks was interested in snippets of local history he lost track of weavers words as he drove over the low stone bridge and crossed helmthorpe high street he cursed to himself it was early sunday afternoon and from what he could see around him that meant carwashing time in the village men stood in driveways in front of garages with their sleeves rolled up and buckets of soapy water by their sides shiny car roofs gleamed and water dripped from doors and bumpers polished chrome shone if harry steadman had been dumped from a local car all traces of that grisly journey would have been obliterated by now in the most natural way soaped and waxed over vacuumed and swept out steadmans house last in a short block running left from the road was larger than banks had imagined it was solidly built and looked weatherbeaten enough to pass for a historic building that meant it would sell for a historic price too he noted a double garage had been built on the eastern side and the large garden bordered by a low wall consisted of a wellkept lawn with a colourful flower bed at its centre and rose bushes against the house front and the neighbours fence leaving weaver in the car banks walked down the crazy paving and rang the doorbell the woman who answered holding a cup of tea in her hand looked puzzled to find a stranger standing before her she was plainlooking with stringy lifeless brown hair and wore a pair of overlarge unbecoming spectacles she was dressed in a shapeless beige cardigan and baggy checked slacks banks thought she might be the cleaning lady so he phrased his greeting as a question mrs steadman yes the woman answered hesitantly peering at him through her glasses he introduced himself and felt the familiar tightening in his stomach as he was ushered into the living room it was always like that no amount of experience purged that gutwrenching feeling of sympathy that accompanied the soothing useless words the empty gestures for banks there was always a shadow it could be my wife it could be someone telling me about my daughter it was the same as that first glimpse of the murder victim death and its long aftermath had never become a matter of routine for him but remained always an abomination a reminder one hardly needed of mans cruelty to his fellow man his fallen nature although the room was messy a low table littered with magazines knitting spread out on a chair records out of their sleeves by the music centre it was clean and sunlight poured over the red and yellow roses through spotless mullioned windows above the large stone fireplace hung a romantic painting of what swainsdale must have looked like over a hundred years ago it hadnt changed all that much but somehow the colours seemed brighter and bolder in the picture the contours more definite what is it mrs steadman asked pulling a chair forward for banks has there been an accident is something wrong as he broke the news banks watched mrs steadmans expression change from disbelief to shock finally she began to weep silently there was no sobbing the tears simply ran down her pale cheeks and dripped on to the wrinkled cardigan as she stared blankly ahead they could have been caused by an onion banks found himself thinking disturbed by her absolute silence mrs steadman he said gently touching her sleeve im afraid there are a few questions i have to ask you right away she looked at him nodded and dried her eyes with a screwedup kleenex of course why didnt you report your husband missing mrs steadman missing she frowned at him why should i banks was taken aback but he pressed on gently im afraid youll have to tell me that he cant have come home last night werent you worried didnt you wonder where he was oh i see what you mean she said dabbing at her damp reddened cheeks with the crumpled tissue you werent to know were you you see i wasnt expecting him home last night he went out just after seven oclock he said he was calling for a pint at the bridge he often went there and then driving on to york he had work to do there and he wanted to make an early start did he often do that yes quite often sometimes i went with him but i was feeling a bit under the weather last night summer cold i think and besides i know they get much more done without me anyway i watched television with mrs stanton next door and let him go harry stayed with his publisher well more of a family friend really michael ramsden what kind of work did they do on a sunday oh it wasnt what you or i would understand by work they were writing a book harry mostly but michael was interested and helped him a local history book that was harrys field theyd go off exploring ruins roman forts old lead mines anything i see and it was normal for him to go the night before and stay with mr ramsden yes as ive said they were more like friends than anything else weve known the family for a long time harry was terrible at getting up in the morning so if they wanted a full day hed go over the night before and michael would be sure to get him up on time theyd spend the evening going over notes and making plans id no reason to report him missing i thought he was in york her voice faltered and she started to cry again banks waited and let her dry her eyes before asking his next question wouldnt mr ramsden be worried if he didnt arrive didnt he call you to find out what had happened no she paused blew her nose and went on i told you it wasnt that kind of work more like a hobby really anyway michael doesnt have a telephone hed just assume that something had come up and harry couldnt make it just one more thing mrs steadman then i wont bother you any further today could you tell me where your husband might have left his car in the big car park by the river she replied the bridge hasnt got a car park of its own so the customers use that one you cant really leave cars in the street here theres not room enough do you have a spare key i think he kept one around i dont use it myself i have an old fiesta just a moment mrs steadman disappeared into the kitchen and returned a few moments later with the key she also gave banks the number of steadmans beige sierra could you tell me where mr ramsden lives too id like to let him know whats happened as soon as possible mrs steadman seemed a bit surprised but she gave the information without questions its not so hard to find she added there are no other houses within half a mile yet do you need me to er to identify the body mrs steadman nodded yes im afraid we do tomorrow will do though is there anyone you can get to stay with you for a while she stared at him her features ugly and swollen with crying her eyes looked fishy behind the harsh magnification of the glasses mrs stanton next door if you would of course banks went next door mrs stanton a longnosed alertlooking little woman immediately grasped the situation banks sympathized with her shock i know he said it must seem so abrupt to think that you saw him only last night she nodded aye and to think what was happening while me and emma were watching that silly old film still she ended stoically who are we to question the ways of the good lord she told her husband who sat slouched in an armchair reading his news of the world to keep an eye on the roast then went over to comfort her neighbour sure that he was leaving the widow in capable hands banks returned to his car and got in next to weaver who had regained his pinkish colour im sorry sir he mumbled about being sick ive never seen a corpse before i know never mind constable theres a first time for everyone mores the pity shall we go to the bridge for a bite to eat weaver nodded im starving myself banks went on starting the car and you look like you could do with a drop of brandy as he drove the short distance down to the bridge on helmthorpe high street banks thought about his interview with mrs steadman it had made him feel edgy and uneasy at times after the initial shock her reaction had seemed more like relief than grief perhaps the marriage had been shaky banks found himself thinking and mrs steadman had suddenly found herself both wealthy and free surely that would explain it one weaver pulled a face i dont like brandy sir he admitted sheepishly my mum always used to give me a drop for medicinal purposes whenever i got a cold as a lad never could stomach the stuff the two of them sat in a corner of the bridges quiet lounge banks nursed a pint of handdrawn theakstons bitter and weaver complained about his brandy did it do you any good banks asked i suppose so sir but it always reminds me of medicine of being poorly if you follow my drift banks laughed and went to buy weaver a pint to chase away the bad taste they were waiting for detective sergeant hatchley who was still with tavistock no doubt enjoying a good cup of tea or something stronger and perhaps a plateful of roast beef tell me banks asked why is this place so empty its sunday dinner time and the village is crawling with tourists thats right sir weaver said his boyish face had fully regained its natural pink flush but look around you banks looked they were in a small lounge with faded wallpaper and a cracked brown ceiling a few watercolours of local scenes reminiscent of the ones in old railway carriages covered the most obvious damp spots on the walls the tables were worn and scored from years of dominoes and shovehapenny and ringed by generations of overflowing beer glasses around the edges were charred semicircles where cigarettes had been left to burn out a rack holding tongs and a bent poker stood by the small tiled fireplace true it didnt look much there are three pubs in helmthorpe sir weaver began counting them off on his chubby red fingers thats if you dont count the country club for the nobs theres the dog and gun and the hare and hounds theyre for the tourists mostly real olde worlde country inns if you get my meaning sir horse brasses copper bedwarmers antique tables with kneecapper wroughtiron legs you name it they have big old fireplaces too all done up with black lead now that every pub in christendom seems to offer real ale its got trendy to advertise a real fire the dog and guns a kind of family place with tables out back by the river and a little enclosed area for the kiddies to play in and the hare and hounds is more for the younger set they have a disco there every friday and saturday in season and you get a lot of the campers going along thats when we get most of our bother here the odd fight that kind of thing some nights during the week they have folk music too a bit more civilized if you ask me weaver sniffed and nodded towards the wall and then theres this place its fairly new by village standards victorian id say at a pinch and its all thats left for the serious drinkers the only people who drink here are the locals and a few visitors who know about the beer its a pretty wellguarded secret course on weekends you do get a few hikers and whatnot in the public bar theyve all read their good beer guides these days it seems but they never cause much trouble theyre a quiet lot really why did steadman drink here do you think steadman weaver seemed surprised to be so quickly jolted back to business liked the beer i suppose and he was pally with a few of the regulars but he had money didnt he a lot of money he certainly didnt get that house on the cheap oh yes he had money rumour has it he inherited over a quarter of a million from his father his pals have money too but theyre not nobs much more downtoearth banks was still puzzled why someone so well off would drink in such a dump good beer or not by rights steadman ought to have been chugging champagne by the magnum to wash down his caviar those were london terms though he reminded himself ostentatious display of wealth maybe people with over a quarter of a million who lived in helmthorpe by choice were different he doubted it but steadman certainly sounded unusual liked his drink did he never known him drink too much sir i think he just enjoyed the company here glad to get away from the wife weaver reddened i wouldnt know about that sir never heard anything but he was a funny sort of chap in what way well sir like i said he used to be a professor at leeds university when he inherited the money he just packed in his job bought the old ramsden house and moved up here ramsden house banks cut in that wouldnt have anything to do with michael ramsden would it weaver raised an eyebrow as a matter of fact sir yes he answered it was his parents house used to be a bedandbreakfast place when steadman and his wife started coming up here for their holidays ten years ago or more young michael went to university and landed a good job with a publishing firm in london then when old mr ramsden died the mother couldnt afford to keep on the house so she went off to live with her sister in torquay it all happened at just the right time for steadman banks looked at weaver in astonished admiration how old are you he asked twentyone sir how do you manage to know so much about things that happened before your time family sir i was born and raised in the area and sergeant mullins he runs the show around here usually but hes on holiday right now theres not much escapes sergeant mullins banks sat in silence for a moment and enjoyed his beer as he sifted the information what about steadmans drinking companions he asked finally what kind of people are they he brought them all together sir weaver answered oh they all knew each other well enough before he moved up here like but steadman was a friendly sort interested in everything and everyone when he wasnt busying himself with his books or poking around ruins and abandoned mines he was quite a socializer theres jack barker for one you might have heard of him banks shook his head writer mystery stories weaver smiled quite good really plenty of sex and violence he blushed nothing like the real thing of course oh i dont know banks said smiling go on well sir hes been here three or four years dont know where he started from then theres doc barnes born and raised hereabouts and teddy hackett local entrepreneur he owns the garage over there and a couple of gift shops thats all really theyre all fortyish well doc barnes is a bit older and barkers in his late thirties an odd group when you think about it ive been in here a few times when they were together and from what i could hear theyd take the mickey out of steadman a bit him being an academic and all that but not nasty like all in good fun no animosity youre certain no sir not as far as i could tell i dont get in here as often as id like wife and kid you see he beamed work too aye that keeps me busy as well but i seem to spend more time giving directions to bloody tourists and telling the time than dealing with local affairs whoever said if you want to know the way ask a policeman ought to be shot banks laughed the locals are a fairly lawabiding lot then on the whole yes we get a few drunks now and then especially at the hare and hounds disco as i said but thats mostly visitors then theres the odd domestic dispute but most of our troubles come from tourists leaving their cars all over the place and making too much noise its a peaceful place really though theres some as would say its boring at this point sergeant hatchley walked in and joined them he was a bulky fairhaired and frecklefaced man in his early thirties and he and banks had developed a tolerable working relationship despite some early hostilities partly due to northsouth rivalry and partly to hatchleys having hoped for the job banks got hatchley bought a round of drinks and they all ordered steak and kidney pies which turned out to be very tasty not too much kidney as weaver remarked banks complimented the landlord and was rewarded with an ambiguous aye anything new banks asked the sergeant hatchley lit a cigarette lounged back in his chair rubbed a hand like a hairy ham across his stubbly cheek and cleared his throat nowt much by the look of things old tavistock went looking for a stray sheep and dug up a fresh corpse thats about the strength of it was it unusual for him to go poking around by that wall would other people be likely to go there if youre thinking that anyone could expect to dump a body there and leave it undiscovered for weeks then youre barking up the wrong tree even if old tavistock hadnt gone out looking for his bloody sheep someone wouldve come along soon enough hikers courting couples banks sipped some more beer so he wasnt dumped there for concealment then shouldnt think so no probably put there just so wed have to leg it halfway up to crow bloody scar banks laughed more likely so we wouldnt know where he was killed aye why wasnt steadman reported missing sir weaver cut in he seemed anxious to restore to the chief inspector the respect that hatchley appeared to be denying him banks told him then he told hatchley to get back to the eastvale station find out as much as he could about steadmans background and collate any reports that came in what about the press hatchley asked theyre all over the place now you can tell them weve found a body shall i tell them who it is banks sighed and gave hatchley a longsuffering look dont be so bloody silly not until weve got a formal identification you cant no and what will you be doing sir my job banks turned to weaver youd better get back to the station lad whos in charge weaver blushed again his pinkness deepening to crimson i am sir at least i am at the moment sergeant mullins is away for two weeks remember i told you about him sir yes of course how many men have you got theres only two of us sir its a quiet place i called some of the lads in from lyndgarth and fortford to help with the search theres not more than half a dozen of us altogether all right then banks said it looks like youre in charge get a request for information printed up and distributed shops pubs church notice board then start a housetohouse enquiry up hill road that body wasnt carried all the way up there and somebody might just have seen or heard a car at least itll help us narrow down the time of death all right yes sir and dont worry if you need any more men let eastvale station know and theyll see what they can do im going to pay michael ramsden a visit myself but if you ask for sergeant rowe ill make sure he has full instructions he turned to hatchley again before you go back go and tell the men up in the field that theyre temporarily transferred to helmthorpe and theyre to take their orders from constable weaver here theyll probably understand the situation already but make it official and check the car park for a beige sierra he gave hatchley the number of the car and handed him the keys its steadmans car he added and while it doesnt look as if he got to use it last night you never know it might tell us something get forensic on to it right away yes sir hatchley said through clenched teeth as he left banks could almost hear the three bags full sir that the sergeant probably added when he got outside he grinned broadly at the nonplussed young constable and said dont mind him hes probably just got a hangover now off you go weaver time to get to work alone he slipped his new pipe from his jacket pocket and stuffed it with shag drawing in the harsh tobacco he coughed and shook his head he still couldnt get used to the damn thing maybe mild cigarettes would be better after all two excited sally had watched banks drive off towards the village and followed in the same direction she stopped to pick a campion by the hedgerow and casually admired its pinkishpurple colour the petals like a babys splayed fingers then thinking about what she had to tell her friends she let it drop and hurried on her way she had actually seen the man the policeman in charge close up and had had to stifle a giggle as he lost his footing climbing the low wall it was obvious he wasnt used to bounding about the northern countryside perhaps hed been sent up by scotland yard she found his gaunt angled face under the short neat black hair attractive despite a nose that had clearly been broken and imperfectly reset the sharp restless eyes expressed energy and power and the little white scar beside his right eye seemed to sally a mark of exotic experience she imagined hed got into a fight to the death with a bloodcrazed murderer even though he seemed too short for a policeman his wiry body looked nimble and strong at the western edge of the village near the bridge was a coffee bar where sally and her friends hung out the coffee was weak the coke warm and the greek owner surly but the place boasted two video games an uptodate jukebox and an ancient pinball machine of course sally would rather have expertly applied a little makeup and passed for eighteen in one of the pubs especially the hare and hounds on disco night but in such a small community everyone seemed to know a little about everyone elses business and she was worried in case word got back to her father she had been in pubs in eastvale with kevin though even that was risky with the school so close by and in leeds and york which were safer and nobody had ever questioned her about her age the door rattled as she pushed it open and entered to the familiar bleeping of massacred aliens kathy chalmers and hazel kirk were engrossed in the game while anne downes looked on coolly she was a bookish girl plain and bespectacled but she wanted to be liked and if that meant hanging around with videogame players then so be it the others teased her a bit but never maliciously and she was blessed with a sharp natural wit that helped her hold her own the other two were more like sally if not as pretty they chewed gum applied makeup unlike sally they did this badly and generally fussed about their hair and clothes kathy had even got away with a henna treatment her parents had been furious but there was nothing much they could do after the fact it was hazel the sultry blackhaired one who spoke first look whos here she announced and where have you been all weekend the glint in her eye implied that she knew very well where sally had been and who she had been with under normal circumstances sally would have played along hinting at pleasures she believed hazel had only read about in books but this time she ignored the innuendo and got herself a coke from the unsmiling greek the espresso machine was hissing like an old steam engine and the aliens were still bleeping in their death throes sally leaned against the column opposite anne and waited impatiently for a silence into which she could drop her news when the game was over kathy reached for another coin a manoeuvre that necessitated arching her back and stretching out her long legs so that she could thrust her hand deep enough into the pocket of her skintight calvin kleins as she did this sally noticed the greek ogling from behind his coffee machine choosing her moment for best dramatic effect she finally spoke guess what theres been a murder here in the village they dug up a body under crow scar ive just come from there ive seen it annes pale eyes widened behind her thick lenses a murder is that what those men are doing up there theyre conducting a search of the scene sally announced hoping shed got the phrasing right the scene of the crime and the forensic team was there too taking blood samples and tissue and the police photographer and the home office pathologist all of them kathy slid back into her seat forgetting the game a murder in helmthorpe she gasped in disbelief who was it here sally had to admit lack of information which she disguised neatly by assuming that kathy meant who was the murderer they dont know yet you fool she replied scornfully its only just happened then she hurried on keen not to lose their attention to further fleets of aliens i saw the superintendent close up quite a dish actually not at all what youd expect and i could see the body well some of it it was buried by the wall up in tavistocks field somebody had scraped away some of the loose soil and then covered it with stones there was a hand and a leg sticking out hazel kirk tossed back a glossy ravens wing of hair sally lumb youre a liar she said you couldnt see that far the police wouldnt have let anyone get that close i did sally countered i could even see the wet patches under the superintendents arms she realized too late that this outburst clashed with her more romantic image of the superintendent and rushed on hoping nobody would notice only anne wrinkled her nose and old man tavistock was there i think he discovered the body and all the policemen from miles around geoff weaver was there that pinkfaced pansy kathy cut in it wasnt so pink today i can tell you i think hed been sick well wouldnt you be if youd just found a dead body anne asked coming to the defence of young weaver on whom she had had a schoolgirl crush for nearly six months it was probably all decomposed and rotten sally ignored her and there was another inspector or whatever they call them he wasnt in uniform anyway tall strawy hair a bit like your dad kathy thatll be jim hatchley anne said actually hes only a sergeant my father knows him remember when the social club was broken into last year well they sent him from eastvale he even came to our house my dads treasurer you know hatchleys a coarse pig hes even got hairs up his nose and in his ears and ill bet that other chap was chief inspector banks he had his picture in the paper a while back dont you ever read the papers annes stream of information and opinion silenced everyone for a moment then sally who read nothing but vogue and cosmopolitan picked up the thread again theyre here now in the village they drove down before i came im surprised they didnt give you a lift hazel said seeing as how youre on such good terms shut up hazel kirk sally said indignantly hazel just smirked theyre here theyll be questioning everybody you know theyll probably want to talk to all of us why should they want to do that kathy asked we dont know anything about it its just what they do stupid sally retorted they do housetohouse searches and take statements from everyone how do they know we dont know anything till they ask us sallys logic silenced kathy and hazel we dont even know who the victim was yet anne chimed in who do you think it was ill bet it was that johnnie parrish kathy said he looks like a man with a past to me johnnie parrish sally sneered why hes about as interesting as a a a dose of clap anne suggested they all laughed even that would be more interesting than johnnie parrish ill bet it was major cartwright hes such a miserable badtempered old bugger there must be lots of people want to kill him his daughter for one hazel said and giggled why sally asked she didnt like to think she was excluded from what appeared to be common knowledge well you know kathy stalled you know what people say about what about major cartwright and his daughter how he keeps such a tight rein on her since she came back to the village why she ran off in the first place its unnatural thats what people say oh is that all sally said not quite sure she understood but shes got her own place that cottage by the church maybe it was alf pringle hazel suggested now theres a nasty piece of work be doing us all a favour if somebody did away with him wishful thinking kathy sighed do you know he chased me off his land the other day i was only picking wild flowers for that school project he had his shotgun with him too he sounds more like a murderer than a victim anne chipped in who do you think did it well it might not be anyone from around here kathy answered i mean we dont know do we it could have been a stranger of course it was someone from around here sally said annoyed at the way her discovery seemed to have become common property you dont think somebody would drive a body all the way from leeds or somewhere like that just to dump it under crow scar do you they could have done kathy defended herself without much conviction well im not going out after dark until hes been caught hazel hugged herself and shuddered it might be one of those sex murderers another ripper it could even be major cartwrights daughter up there for all we know or that mrs caret the new barmaid at the dog and gun i shouldnt worry kathy said nobody would want to sex murder you she spoke in the usual spirit of friendly banter but somehow her joke flopped and the girls seemed distracted each wrapped in her own thoughts kathy blushed still she said wed better be careful ill bet it was jack barker that did it anne suggested who that writer bloke sally said yes you know what kind of books he writes ill bet you havent read any kathy taunted her yes i have ive read the butcher of redondo beach and the san clemente slasher theyre lurid ive read one too hazel said i cant remember what it was called but it was about this man who went to his beach house somewhere in america and he found two people hed never seen before chopped to pieces in his living room it was grisly i only read it because he lives here thats the butcher of redondo beach anne informed her patiently thats what its called sally was bored by the direction the conversation was taking and besides she thought jack barker looked far too handsome and debonair to be a murderer he was a bit like one of those old film stars her mother was always going on about errol flynn clark gable or douglas fairbanks the ones who all looked the same with their oily slickeddown hair and little moustaches he was the type she thought who might shoot his adulterous wife if he had one in a fit of passion but he certainly wouldnt carry her body all the way up to crow scar afterwards that was for sure he was far too much of a gentleman to do that whatever kind of books he wrote sally finished her coke and turned to leave but before she did so she whispered the police will see me i can tell you that for sure i know something i dont know whos dead or who the killer is yet but i know something and with that she exited quickly leaving the others to gape after her and debate whether she was telling the truth or simply trying to draw attention to herself three there are two routes to york from helmthorpe the first winds up through gratly continues diagonally across the dales more or less as the crow flies and eventually joins the main road a couple of miles outside the city the second longer but quicker involves taking the main road back to eastvale then driving southeast on the busy york road because it was a beautiful day and he was in no real hurry banks took the first route on his visit to ramsden he slipped the cassette back into the player and to the strains of o sweet woods drove up the hill turned left past the steadman house and followed the road as it climbed the dale side slowly he passed through the tiny hamlet of mortsett and paused with his window down to look at an attractive cottage with a post office sign above its door and a board advertising walls ice cream propped outside insects hovered and hummed in the still warm air it seemed unreal an image of england from before the first world war beyond relton at the junction with the fortford road he seemed to leave civilization behind soon the greens of the hillsides gave way to the darker hues of the heathercovered moors which continued for about two miles before dropping slowly into the next dale it was like a slow roller coaster ride and the only obstacles were the sheep that sometimes strayed on to the unfenced road itself only a thin band hardly distinguishable from the landscape around it banks saw a few hikers who stepped on to the rough grass when they heard his car smiling and waving as he drove by the main road busy with lorries and delivery vans came as a shock following mrs steadmans directions banks found the turnoff a narrow track with a lonely red phone box on the corner about a mile from yorks boundary he turned left and after a quarter of a mile came to the converted farmhouse he pulled into the smooth dirt driveway and stopped outside the newlooking garage ramsden answered the door shortly after the first ring and asked who he was when banks showed some identification he slipped off the chain and invited him in cant be too careful he apologized especially in such an isolated place as this ramsden was tall and pale with the melancholic aspect of a romantic poet he had lightbrown hair and banks soon noticed a nervous habit of brushing back the stray forelock even when it hadnt slid down over his brow the jeans and sweatshirt he wore seemed to hang on him as if they were a size too big please excuse the mess he said as he led banks into a cluttered living room and installed him by the huge empty fireplace as you can see im decorating just finished the first coat a clear polythene sheet covered half the floor and on it stood a stepladder a gallon of pale blue paint brushes tray and rollers its not about that woman is it he asked what woman an old lady not far from here was murdered by thugs a few months ago i had a policeman around then no sir its not about the woman that would have been york region im from eastvale cid ramsden frowned im afraid i dont understand then pardon me i dont mean to seem rude but im sorry sir banks apologized accepting the whisky and soda ramsden had poured for him without asking this isnt easy for me would you care to sit down ramsden looked alarmed what is it he asked fitting himself awkwardly into a small armchair you were expecting mr steadman to visit you last night harry thats right we had some notes to go over before todays field trip why has something happened yes im afraid it has banks said as gently as he could aware of the muscles in his stomach clenching tightly mr steadman is dead ramsden brushed back the phantom forelock i dont follow dead but he was coming here i know that mr ramsden thats why i wanted to tell you myself werent you surprised when he didnt show up werent you worried ramsden shook his head no no of course i wasnt it wasnt the first time he hadnt come but are you sure about harry i mean cant there have been some mistake im afraid not what on earth happened were not certain about that yet sir but a farmer found his body this morning in a field under crow scar it looks as if he was murdered murdered good god harry i cant believe it you know no one whod have a reason absolutely not nobody not harry he rubbed his face and stared at banks im sorry chief inspector i cant really think straight im having trouble taking this all in ive known harry for a long time a long time this is such a shock i realize it must be sir banks persisted but if you could just spare the time to answer a couple of questions ill be on my way yes of course ramsden got up and made a drink for himself you said it had happened before that he hadnt turned up yes it wasnt a formal arrangement more casual really why didnt he come once when emma wasnt too well he couldnt make it and one time he had a stomach upset things like that we were very close chief inspector there was always a bed made up for him and he had a key in case i had to go out didnt it cross your mind to phone and ask what was wrong not at all ive already told you our arrangement was casual i dont have a phone i spend enough time on the blasted thing at work the nearest public call box is on the main road he shook his head i just cant believe this is happening its like a bad dream harry dead did you go out last night ramsden looked at him blankly you said mr steadman had a key in case you were out banks pressed on were you out last night no i wasnt actually when harry hadnt arrived by eleven oclock i was rather i mean dont get me wrong a little relieved you see im working on a book of my own a historical novel and i was glad of the opportunity to get some writing done he looked embarrassed about it didnt you like working with mr steadman oh of course i did but it was his baby really i was just the editor the research assistant where were you planning to go today we were going to visit an old lead mine in swaledale quite a distance really so we wanted to get an early start emma he exclaimed suddenly emma must be in a terrible state shes upset of course banks said mrs stanton the neighbour is looking after her should i go thats up to you mr ramsden but id say best leave her for today at least shes in good hands ramsden nodded of course of course what about you will you be all right yes ill be fine its just the shock ive known harry for more than ten years would it be possible to talk to you again about this just to get some background that kind of thing yes i suppose so when the sooner the better really tuesday morning perhaps we might know a bit more by then ill be at work fisher and faulkner were not terrifically busy at the moment if you want to drop by yes thatll be fine banks asked directions to the publishers then left ramsden and returned to eastvale by the quickest route at the station an invitation to call at superintendent gristhorpes for tea awaited him he phoned sandra who wasnt at all surprised at his absence checked that no important news had come in while he had been at ramsdens and set off for helmthorpe for the second time that day it was only three oclock and as he wasnt expected at gristhorpes until five he would have plenty of time to see how the locals were coping the helmthorpe police station was a converted cottage on a narrow cobbled road that forked from the eastern end of the high street towards the river there weaver who was running off more copies of the request for information told him that three constables were still making doortodoor enquiries along hill road and another had been dispatched to the campsite that was the biggest headache banks realized they would have to try and find out who had been staying at the campsite on saturday night most of the campers would have moved on by now and it would be damn near impossible to get comprehensive or reliable information there was also the press to deal with besides reg summers of the local weekly two other reporters were still hanging around outside the station as hatchley had warned thrusting their notebooks at everyone who entered or left banks certainly liked to maintain good relations with the press but at such an early stage in the investigation he could give them little of value however to gain and keep their goodwill because he knew they would be useful eventually he told them what he could in as pleasant a manner as possible at twenty to five he left weaver in charge and drove off to see gristhorpe on the way he decided he would visit the bridge that evening to see what he could get out of steadmans cronies more he hoped than hed managed to pick up so far one banks pulled into the rutted drive at five to five and walked towards the squat stone house gristhorpe lived in an isolated farmhouse on the north dale side above the village of lyndgarth about halfway between eastvale and helmthorpe it was no longer a functioning farm though the superintendent still held on to a couple of acres where he grew vegetables since his wife had died five years ago he had stayed on there alone and a woman from the village came up to do for him every morning the building was too austere for banks but he could see it was ideally suited to the environment in a part of the country windswept and lashed by rain much of the year any human dwelling had to be built like a fortress to provide even the most basic domestic comforts inside though gristhorpes house was as warm and welcoming as the man himself banks knocked at the heavy oak door surprised at how the hollow sound echoed in the surrounding silence but got no answer on such a fine afternoon he reasoned he was more likely to find gristhorpe in his garden so he walked around the back he found the superintendent crouching by a heap of stones apparently in the process of extending his wall the older man got to his feet redfaced at the sound of footsteps and asked is that the time already its almost five banks answered im a few minutes early mmm i seem to lose all track of time up here anyway sit down he gestured towards the rough grass by the stones the superintendent was in his shirtsleeves his ubiquitous harris tweed jacket lying on the grass beside him a gentle breeze ruffled his thick mop of silver hair below it a red pockmarked face upper lip all but obscured by a bristly grey moustache grinned down at banks the oddest thing about gristhorpes appearance and it was a facet that disconcerted both colleagues and criminals alike was his eyes deep set under bushy brows they were those of a child wide blue innocent at odds with his sixfootthree wrestlers build they had been known to draw out confessions from even the hardest of villains and had made many an underling caught out in a manufactured statement or an overenthusiastic interrogation blush and hide in shame when all was well though and the world seemed as fresh and clear as it did that day gristhorpes eyes shone with a gentle love of life and a sense of compassion that would have given the buddha himself a good run for his money banks sat for a while and helped gristhorpe work on the drystone wall it was a project that the superintendent had started the previous summer and it had no particular purpose banks had made one or two attempts at adding pieces of stone but had at first got them the wrong way around so that the rain would have drained inwards and cracked the wall apart if a sudden frost came often he had chosen pieces that simply would not fit lately however he had improved and he found the occasional wallbuilding afternoons with gristhorpe almost as relaxing and refreshing as playing with brians train set a silent understanding had developed between them about what stone would do and who would fix it in place after about fifteen minutes banks broke the silence i suppose you know that somebody dismantled one of these walls last night to cover a body aye gristhorpe said ive heard come on inside alan and ill make a pot of tea if im not mistaken there are still a few of mrs hawkinss scones left too he rhymed scones with on not like a southerner with own they settled into the deep worn armchairs and banks cast his eyes over the bookcases that covered one entire wall from floor to ceiling there were books on all kinds of subjects local lore geology criminology topography history botany travel and shelves of leatherbound classics ranging from homer cervantes rabelais and dante to wordsworth dickens james joyce w b yeats and d h lawrence jane austens pride and prejudice lay on the table the position of the bookmark indicated that gristhorpe had almost finished it as always when he visited the superintendent banks mentally reminded himself that he should read more gristhorpes office in eastvale was much the same books everywhere and not all of them relevant to police work he came from old dales farming stock and his decision to join the police after university and army service had caused trouble nevertheless he had persevered and he had also helped out on the farm in his spare time when gristhorpes father saw that his sons natural aptitude and capacity for hard work was getting him places he stopped complaining and accepted the situation gristhorpes father had been sad to see the farm dwindle to little more than a large back garden before he died but his pride in his sons achievement and the status it gave him locally eased him and his death was without acrimony gristhorpe had told banks all this during their frequent meetings usually over a good single malt whisky after a wallbuilding session the older mans candour along with more practical advice made banks feel like an apprentice or protege their relationship had developed this way since the gallows view affair bankss dramatic introduction to northern police work as he told what he knew about the steadman murder he was alert for any tips that might come his way its not going to be easy gristhorpe pronounced after a short silence and i wont say it is for one thing youve all those tourists and campers to consider if steadman had an enemy from the past it would be an ideal way of doing the job they never keep records at campsites as far as i know all they care about is collecting the money he nibbled at his scone and sipped strong black tea still the killer could be a lot closer to home doesnt look like youve got much physical evidence though does it somebody might have heard a car but i doubt theyd have paid it much mind i know that road it swings northeast all the way over to sattersdale still i dont suppose i need tell you your job alan first thing is to find out as much as you can about steadman friends enemies past the lot nose about the village talk to people leave the donkey work to your men im an outsider though banks said i always will be as far as people around here are concerned i look out of place and i sound out of place nobodys going to give much away to me rubbish alan look at it this way youre a stranger in helmthorpe right banks nodded people notice you theyll soon get to know who you are you dont look like a tourist and no villager will mistake you for one youre even a bit of a celebrity at least for them as reads the papers around here theyll be curious interested in the new copper and theyll want to find out what makes you tick youll be surprised what theyll tell you just to see how you react he chuckled before this is all over youll feel like a bloody priest in his confessional banks smiled i was brought up c of e ah were all methodists or baptists hereabouts gristhorpe said but some of us are more lapsed than others and most of the daftest sects your sandemanians for example have all but disappeared i hope i wont have the same obligation to secrecy as a priest heavens no gristhorpe exclaimed i want to know everything you find out youve no idea what an opportunity this is for me to catch up on helmthorpe gossip but seriously alan do you see what i mean take weaver hes a pleasant enough lad trustworthy competent thorough but as far as the villagers are concerned hes a fixture boring as a rainy day though i shouldnt make that comparison around these parts see what i mean though half the womenfolk in helmthorpe probably changed his nappies when he was a nipper and most of the menfolkve given him a clip around the ear once or twice nobody will tell weaver anything they wont confide in him theres nothing in it for them but you youre the exotic newcomer the father confessor i hope youre right banks said finishing his tea i was thinking of dropping in at the bridge tonight weaver told me steadman used to drink there regularly with a few friends gristhorpe scratched his pitted red chin and his bushy eyebrows merged in a furrow of concentration good idea he said imagine itll be a bit of a wake tonight good time to pick up stray words theyll all know whos been killed of course and probably how would that chap barker be one of steadmans cronies by the way yes jack barker the writer writer be damned gristhorpe almost choked on a mouthful of scone just because he makes money from the claptrap doesnt mean hes a writer anyway its a good idea youll get something out of them however useless it might seem at first what time is it now ten to six supper yes any time youre ready banks had almost forgotten how hungry he was it wont be owt special you know gristhorpe called out as he went to the kitchen just salad and leftover roast beef two sally and kevin raced the last few yards and collapsed panting by ross ghyll they were high up on tetchley fell on the south side of the dale having walked to the source of one of the numerous becks that meander their way down to the swain when they had caught their breath kevin kissed her thrusting his tongue deep into her mouth and they lay down together on the pale springy grass he touched her breasts felt the nipples harden through thin cotton and slowly let his hand slide down between her legs she was wearing jeans and the pressure of the thick seam against her sex made her tingle with excitement but she broke free and sat up distracted im going to tell the police kevin she said bbut we she laughed and hit him lightly on the arm not about this stupid about last night but then theyll know about us he protested theyll be sure to tell no they wont why should they you can tell them things in confidence you know like catholics and priests besides she added twirling a strand of hair between her slim fingers my mum and dad know we were together i told them we were at your house and we forgot about the time i just dont think we should get involved thats all it could be dangerous being a witness oh dont be daft i think its rather exciting myself you would what if the killer thinks we really saw something nobody knew we were up there nobody saw us how do you know it was dark and we were too far away he might see you going to the police station sally laughed ill wear a disguise then now youre being really silly theres nothing to be afraid of kevin fell silent once again he felt hed been outwitted and outreasoned by a mere girl i wont tell them who you are if it bothers you so much sally went on reassuring him ill just say that i was with a friend id rather not name talking talking kevin laughed and reached for her is that what we were doing sally giggled his hand was on her breast again but she pushed him away and stood up brushing the grass from her jeans come on sally he pleaded you know you want it as much as i do do i now yes he made a grab for her ankle but she stepped nimbly aside maybe she said but not now especially with someone whos ashamed to admit he was with me last night besides i have to be home for tea or my dadll kill me and she was off like the wind sighing kevin got to his feet and plodded along behind her three when you hit someone over the head doc jack barker asked does the blood gush pour or just flow thats a pretty tasteless question at a time like this isnt it barnes said barker reached for his pint its for my book in that case i shouldnt think accuracy matters then does it use the most violent word you can think of your readers wont know any more than you do youre wrong there doc you should see some of the letters i get theres plenty of ghouls among the reading public do you know how many of those little old ladies are hooked on gruesome forensic details no and i dont want to either i see enough blood in my line of work as it is and i still think youre showing poor taste talking like that before poor harrys even in the ground it was early and barnes and barker were the only members of the informal group sitting in the snug death comes to us all in the end doc barker replied you ought to know that youve helped enough people shuffle off their mortal coils barnes scowled at him how can you be so bloody flippant for gods sake have a bit of decency jack even youve got to admit that his death was an untimely one it must have been timely enough for the killer i dont understand you jack never in a million years barnes sighed over his beer still i have to keep reminding myself you write about this kind of thing all the time its just shock barker said reaching for a cigarette believe it or not i didnt personally witness every murder ive written about and as you well know ive never set foot on american soil either he ran a hand across his slickedback hair its a bloody sad business all right i know we used to tease the poor bugger about his rusty nails and pigs of lead but ill miss him a lot barnes acknowledged the eulogy with a curt nod have the police been talking to you yet barker asked the doctor seemed surprised me goodness no why should they oh come off it doc i know youre an eminent gp pillar of the community and all that crap but that kind of thing doesnt cut much ice with the cid old man and it doesnt alter the fact that you were here last night with the rest of us and you left quite a bit earlier than usual you surely dont think the police would he began then he relaxed and mumbled almost to himself of course theyll have to check every angle leave no stone unturned cut the cliches barker said they hurt barnes snorted i cant see why you write enough of them yourself its one thing giving the public what it wants and the publishers what they pay for but quite another to spout them out in intelligent company anyway you look worried doc what skeletons will they find in your cupboard dont be ridiculous barnes said and i dont think you should joke about a matter as important as this after all poor harry is dead and you know damn well where i had to go last night mrs gaskell is already a week overdue with her delivery and frankly im getting a bit worried i suppose she can give you an alibi then of course she can should it ever come to that besides what possible motive could i have for harming harry oh still waters run murky and deep barker replied mimicking the doctors own style of speech at that moment teddy hackett arrived looking every inch the flamboyant entrepreneur he was a vain dresser always wearing a shirt with a monogram or an alligator embroidered on its top pocket gold medallion and expensive designer jeans he tried to look younger than he was but his dark hair was receding fast at the temples and a flourishing beer belly hung over his belt almost obscuring a handwrought silver buckle depicting a growling lions head it was well known around the village that when hackett wasnt making money or drinking with his cronies he was living it up in nightclubs in leeds darlington or manchester turning on the charm for any attractive young woman who came his way he had certainly done well for himself the garage a couple of gift shops and he kept a keen eye open for anything else that came on the market he was the kind of businessman who given free rein would probably buy up the whole dale and turn it into a gigantic funfair bloody hell he said easing into his chair with a brimming pint grasped in his fist what a turnup for the book hey barnes nodded and barker stubbed out his cigarette got any details hackett asked no more than anyone else i should think barker replied i bet the docll find out a thing or two after the autopsy barnes reddened with anger thats enough jack he snarled these things are confidential itll be done in eastvale general by the pathologist glendenning theyre bloody lucky to have him up here one of the best in the country or so ive heard he looked at his watch i wouldnt be surprised if hes at it already dead keen they say he faltered catching the unintentional pun a moment after hed let it out anyway you can be sure itll go no further like young joanie lomaxs recent dose of clap eh youre going too far jack i know youre upset like the rest of us why cant you admit it instead of behaving like some bloody actress waiting for opening night reviews barker shifted uncomfortably in his chair has anyone been questioned yet hackett asked the other two shook their heads its just that i saw that detective fellow im sure i recognize him from that photo in the local rag last autumn hes at the bar right now they all looked over and saw banks leaning against the bar foot on the rail apparently enjoying a quiet pint alone thats him barker confirmed i saw him leaving emmas this morning what are you so nervous about anyway teddy youve got nothing to hide have you nothing no but we were all here last night with him werent we i mean theyre sure to want to question us why havent they done it yet you left after harry as i remember barker said yes it was saturday night wasnt it had to get up to darly for freddys new club opening bloody good night it was too there were some real corkers around jack why dont you come along with me sometime handsome young bachelor like yourself ought to get around and about a bit more ah barker replied shaking his head better things to do with my time than chase scrubbers in a disco mate a writers life writer my arse hackett said i could turn out that junk in my coffee break barker raised an eyebrow and grinned maybe so teddy but you dont do you theres the difference besides i hear youve had to hire a secretary with a ba in english to translate your business letters for you my english would hardly be a handicap if i was in your line of work anyway theres no room for fancy footwork in a business letter you know that jack short and to the point thats what the reviewers said about my last book barker sighed well perhaps not in so many words and even doc barnes had to laugh at that after that brief and traditional exchange the three of them fell silent as if they knew that they had been talking and joking as usual just to fill the void of harrys absence to pretend for as long as possible that nothing had changed that nothing so brutal and final as murder had touched the cosy little group barker volunteered to buy another round and went to stand next to banks at the bar excuse me he said but arent you the policeman investigating harry steadmans death when banks nodded barker stuck out his hand jack barker im a friend of his banks offered his condolences look barker went on we were wondering i mean we were all pals of harrys and we spent a good deal of yesterday evening with him would you care to join us in the snug itll be a sight more comfortable and convenient than hauling us all in to the station individually for questioning banks laughed and accepted the offer i reserve the right to haul you in if i want to though he added only half in jest banks had been intending to drop in on them all along he had been imitating the vampire who will not enter his victims room until invited and was pleased that his little trick had worked perhaps there was something in gristhorpes advice after all curiosity had got the better of them barker looked happy enough to be bringing him back in tow but the other two appeared uneasy banks however was experienced enough not to read too much into their reaction he knew what discomfort the arrival of the police always caused even the most innocent of men and women begin to worry about that forgotten parking ticket or the little income tax fiddle as soon as a copper comes in range a tense silence followed the introductions and banks wondered if they expected him to begin a formal interrogation notebook in hand instead he began to fill his pipe glancing at them in turn as he did so barker looked suave in a forties film star kind of way and barnes was a little balding grey man with glasses he had the shabby look of a backstreet abortionist about him banks thought finally hackett the flashy one started to chat nervously we were just talking about harry he said sad business cant think whod want to do such a thing is that what you all think banks asked keeping his eyes on the pipe they all murmured their agreement hackett lit an american cigarette and went on its like this harry might have been a bit of a dotty professor type and i dont deny we teased him a bit but it was all in good humour he was a fine man goodtempered evennatured he had a sharp mind and a tongue to match when it came to it but he was a good man he never hurt a soul and i cant think why anyone would want to kill him somebody obviously felt differently banks said i hear he inherited a lot of money over a quarter of a million his father was an inventor patented some electronic device and opened a factory did very well i suppose the wifell get it now thats how it usually goes whats your opinion of mrs steadman i cant say i really know her well hackett answered she only came down here occasionally seems a good woman harry never complained anyway barnes agreed im afraid i cant add anything barker said i know her slightly better than the others we were after all practically neighbours up in gratly but she seems unremarkable enough to me not much interested in harrys work stays in the background mostly but shes not stupid and she knows how to cook a good dinner banks noticed barker look over his shoulder at the bar and turned to see what the attraction was he was just in time to see a young woman with glossy black hair down to her waist she wore a blue shawl over a white silky blouse and a long loose skirt that curved from her slim waist over the graceful swell of her hips he only glimpsed her face in profile for a moment as she walked out it looked good angular high cheekbones straight nose like a north american indian half obscured by her hair a crescent of silver flashed where her jaw met her long neck whos that he asked barker barker smiled oh you noticed i see thats olicana he pronounced the foreign word slowly olicana yes at least thats what harry used to call her apparently its what the romans called ilkely the spirit of the place the genius loci her real name is penny cartwright not half as exotic is it what happened last night banks asked with an abruptness that startled barker was it a normal evenings drinking as far as you were all concerned yes barker answered harry was on his way to york and dropped in for a couple of swift halves he didnt drink any more than usual a little less if anything he was driving did he seem unusually excited or worried about anything no barker assumed the role of spokesman he was always excited about his work some rusty nail or broken cartwheel rusty nail yes thats how we used to joke about it it was his field of study industrial archaeology his one great passion really that and the roman occupation i see ive been told that mr steadman was supposed to visit an old lead mine in swaledale today know anything about that i think he mentioned it yes we tried not to let him get away with too much shop talk though i mean its not everyones cup of tea is it rusty nails what time did he leave here last night barker concentrated for a moment itd be about a quarter to nine he answered finally and the others nodded in agreement when did you leave barker glanced at barnes and hackett before answering i left about ten fifteen i was alone by then and it was no fun banks turned to the other two and they gave him their stories so you see barker concluded any one of us could have done it our alibis are all weak just a minute barnes cut in only joking doc sorry it was in poor taste but it is true isnt it are we suspects inspector it is inspector isnt it chief inspector banks answered and no there arent any suspects yet i know what that means when there are no suspects everybodys a suspect you write detective stories dont you mr barker banks asked mildly barker flushed and the others laughed defective stories i always call them hackett chipped in very droll barker growled theres hope for you yet tell me banks went on pushing the pace now hed got them going youre all well off why do you drink in a dump like this he looked around at the peeling wallpaper and the scored stained tables its got character barker replied seriously chief inspector were not quite so well off as you think teddy heres been living on credit ever since he bought up hebdens gift shop and the docs making as much as he can fiddle from the nhs barnes just glared not even bothering to interrupt and im just dying for someone to buy the film rights to one of my books harry was loaded true but when it came it came as a bit of a surprise to him and he didnt know what to do with it apart from quitting his job and moving up here to devote himself to his studies he didnt change his way of life much he wasnt really interested in money for its own sake you say it came as a surprise to him banks said i thought he inherited it from his father surely he must have known that he was in for a sizeable inheritance well yes he did but he didnt expect as much as he got i dont think he really paid much mind to it harry was a bit of an absentminded prof took after his father it seems that the old man had patents nobody knew about tucked away all over the place was steadman mean stingy good heavens no he always paid for his round hackett smiled tolerantly while barnes sighed and excused barkers flippancy what hes trying to say in his charming manner the doctor explained is that none of us feel we belong to the country club set were comfortable here and im not being facetious when i say its a damn good pint banks looked at him for a moment then laughed yes it is isnt it he agreed this was another thing banks had picked up during his first year in the north the passion a yorkshireman has for his pint the people in swainsdale seemed to feel the same way about their beer as a man from say burgundy would feel about wine banks got himself another drink and by directing the conversation away from the murder managed to get everyone talking more openly on general matters they discussed ordinary things it turned out just like anyone else politics the economy world affairs sport local gossip books and television they were three professionals all more or less the same age and all except perhaps barnes just a little out of place in a small community that had its roots deep in agriculture and craftsmanship four penny cartwright locked and bolted the sturdy door behind her drew the thick curtains tight and switched on the light after she had put down her package and dropped her shawl over a chair she went around the room lighting candles that stood at various lengths on saucers in empty wine bottles and even in candlesticks when the room was flickering with tiny bright flames which made the walls look like melting butter she turned out the electric light slipped a tape in the cassette player and flopped down on the sofa the room was now as private and cosy as a womb it was the kind of place that looked bright and happy in sunlight and warm and intimate by candlelight there were a few things tacked to the walls a postcardsize reproduction of henri matisses the dance which a friend had sent her from new york a framed copy of sutcliffes photograph gathering driftwood and a glossy picture showing her singing at a concert she and the band had given years ago shadowed by candlelight the alcoves at both sides of the fireplace overflowed with personal knickknacks such as shells pebbles and the kind of silly keepsakes one buys in foreign lands things that always seem to bring back the whole atmosphere of the place and details of the day on which they were bought a plastic key ring from los angeles a miniature slide viewer from niagara falls a tiny porcelain jar emblazoned with her zodiac sign libra from amsterdam mixed in with these were earrings which penny collected of all shapes and colours penny took out papers and hash from a battered old holborn tin and rolled a small joint then she unwrapped the halfbottle of bells there seemed no point getting a glass so she drank straight from the bottle and the whisky burned her tongue and throat as it sank to stir a warm glow deep inside her the tape played unaccompanied traditional folk songs a strong clear womans voice singing about men going off to war lifeboat disasters domestic tragedies and supernatural lovers of long ago with part of her mind penny studied the vocal style critically she admired the slight vibrato but winced at the blurring on some of the high notes as a professional or an exprofessional it was second nature to her to listen that way finally she decided that she liked the womans voice flaws and all it had enough warmth and emotional response to the lyrics to make up for the occasional lapses in technique one song about a murder in staffordshire over two hundred years ago she knew well she had sung it herself many times to appreciative audiences in pubs and concert halls it had even been on the first record she had made with the band and its modal structure had stood up well to the addition of electric guitars and percussion but this time it sounded fresh though the song had nothing to do with the bad news she had heard that afternoon murder was murder whether it had been committed the previous night or two hundred years ago perhaps she would write a song herself others would sing it or listen to it in warm secure rooms hundreds of years in the future the whisky and hash were doing their work penny was drifting suddenly the memory of that summer so many years ago sprang clear as yesterday into her mind there had been many good years of course many good times before the craziness of fame spoiled it all but that summer ten years ago stood out more than the rest as she relived it she could smell the green warmth of the grass and catch the earth and animal scents on the featherlight breeze then the general memory crystallized into one particular day it was hot so hot that emma had refused to move out of the shade for fear of burning her sensitive skin and michael who was sulking for some reason had stayed at home reading chattertons poems so it was just penny and harry they had walked all the way over to wensleydale harry tall and strong leading the way and penny keeping up the best she could that day they had sat high on the valley side above bainbridge below semerwater where they ate salmon sandwiches and drank chilled orange juice from a flask as they basked in the heat and looked down on the tiny village with its neat central green and roman fort they could see the whitewashed front of the fifteenthcentury rose and crown and the river bain danced and sparkled as it tripped down the falls to join the gleaming band of the ure then the scene dissolved broke apart and shifted back in time so vividly had harry recreated the past in her mind that she felt she had been there the valley bottom was marshy and filled with impenetrable thickets nobody ventured there the hillmen built circular huts in clearings they made high on the valley sides near the outcrops of limestone and grits and it was there that they went about the business of hunting raising oats and breeding a few sheep and cattle a roman patrol marched along the road just below where they sat strangers in a cold alien landscape but sure of themselves their helmets shining heavy cloaks pinned at the chest with enamelled brooches the two scenes overlapped ten years ago and seventeen hundred years ago it had all been the same to harry she could sense the stubborn pride of the brigantes and the confidence of the roman conquerors she could even in a way understand why queen cartimandua had sided with the invaders who brought new civilized ways to that barbaric outpost the tension spread throughout the dales as venutius the queens exhusband and his rebellious followers prepared for their last stand at stanwick north of richmond which they lost harry brought it all alive for her and if there had been sometimes an inexplicable awkwardness and uneasiness between them it had always disappeared when the past became more alive than the present how bloody innocent i was then penny thought laughing at herself and all of sixteen too how long it took me to grow up and what a road it was then she remembered the coins they had gone to see in the york museum volisios dumnoveros and cartimandua they were marked and the pigs of lead stamped imp caes domitiano avg cos vii and on the other side brig the latin words had seemed like magical incantations back then and so she drifted the joint was long finished the tape had ended the level in the whisky bottle had gone down and the memories came thick and fast then as suddenly as they had started they ceased all penny was left with was blankness inside there were vague feelings but no words no images she worked at the bottle lit new cigarettes from the stubs of old ones and at some point during the evening the tears that at first just trickled down her cheeks turned into deep heartracking sobs one monday morning dawned on helmthorpe as clear and warm as the five previous days while this wasnt exactly unprecedented it would have been enough to dominate most conversations had there not been a more sensational subject closer at hand in the post office old bent mrs heseltine there to send her monthly letter to her son in canada doin right well for imself es a full perfesser now was holding forth strangled by a madman she repeated in a whisper and right ere in our village i dont know what the worlds coming to i dont were none of us safe anymore and thats a fact best keep yer doors locked and not go out after dark rubbish mrs anstey said it was is wife as done it fer t money like stands to reason moneys t root of all evil you mark my words thats what my albert used ter say aye muttered miss sampson under her breath thats because e never made any the lazy sod mrs dent having read every lurid novel in helmthorpe library and some especially imported from eastvale and york was more imaginative than the rest she put forward the theory that it was the beginning of another series of moors murders its brady and hindley all over again she said theyll be digging em up all over t place there was that billy maxton disappeared wiout a trace and that there mary richards youll see digging em up all over t place theyll be i thought theyd run off to swansea together billy maxton and mary richards chipped in letitia stanford the spindly postmistress anyway theyll be questioning us all no doubt about that that little man from eastvale itll be i saw im poking about ere all day yesterday aye added mrs heseltine i saw im too looked too short for a copper es a southerner said mrs anstey as if that settled the matter of height once and for all at that moment the bell jangled as jack barker walked in to send off a short story to one of the few magazines that helped him eke out a living he beamed at the assembled ladies who all stared back at him like frightened prunes bid them good morning conducted his business then left well sighed miss sampson indignantly and im a friend of mr steadmans too id like to see what the poor mans enemies is doing hes an odd one all right letitia stanford agreed not the killing type though and how would you know asked mrs dent sharply you should read some of is books fair make you blush they would and full of murder too she shook her head and clucked her tongue slowly at the sprightly figure disappearing down the street two sally lumb sat in her best underwear before the dressing table mirror her long honeyblonde hair was parted in the middle and brushed neatly over her white shoulders a short carefully maintained fringe covered just enough of her high forehead as she studied her milky skin she decided it was about time she did some sunbathing not too much because she was so fair and it made her red and sore but just an hour or so each day to give her skin a deep golden hue she had a good face and she knew all her weak points her eyes were fine big blue and beguiling and her nose was perfectly in proportion with just a hint of a bob at its tip if anything was wrong it was her cheeks they were a little too plump and her cheekbones werent well enough defined it was only puppy fat though like that around her hips and thighs it would disappear completely in time nevertheless there were ways to play down its effect right now so why wait the same with her mouth it was too full voluptuous would be the kindest word and that wasnt likely to change by itself sally studied the array of tubes palettes brushes sticks and bottles in front of her then made her skilful choice of the correct shades and tints calculated to highlight the best and obscure the worst of her facial features after all chief inspector banks was from london so shed heard and he would naturally expect a woman always to look her best as she applied the cosmetics she ran through the scene in her mind imagining what she would say and how he would jump up and dash off to make an arrest her name would be in all the papers she would be famous and what better start could an aspiring star wish for the only thing better than that she thought carefully drawing her eyeliner would be to catch the killer herself three banks sat in his office and gazed out over the market square with its ancient cross and uneven cobbles the gold hands of the bluefaced clock on the church stood at ten fifteen a small group of tourists stood in front of the plain sturdy building taking photographs and shoppers in twos and threes ambled along narrow market street banks could hear occasional calls of greeting through his open window he had been at the office for almost two hours keen to read and digest all the information on the steadman case as it came in after leaving barker and company at the bridge the previous evening he had driven straight home enjoyed a mug of hot chocolate and gone to bed consequently on monday morning he felt unnaturally fresh and wide awake much to the surprise of sandra and the children who had been half asleep at the breakfast table as usual on his arrival at eastvale station he first found a message from constable weaver informing him that the housetohouse had produced negligible results one person reported hearing a motorcycle at about eleven thirty and two cars between midnight and twelve fortyfive he had been eating indian food in harrogate and the resulting heartburn kept him awake later than usual everybody else was either away on holiday or fast asleep one woman who had spotted the request for information in helmthorpe parish church at evening service had dropped in early to rant about the devil hells angels skinheads and the price of local produce when the patient weaver had tried to pin her down to specifics so the laughing sergeant rowe reported to banks it turned out that she had spent all saturday including the night with her married daughter in pocklington banks fiddled with his pipe and frowned annoyed at how little there was to go on every good policeman knew that the first twentyfour hours of an investigation were the most crucial ones as time went on the trail cooled the press of course had been pestering him again on his way in and he regretted that he had nothing to tell them as a rule for every piece of information he passed on to the papers he had four more up his sleeve there was always the chance that visitors at the campsite might have seen something banks doubted it though most of the ones questioned on sunday afternoon and evening had either just arrived that day or had heard nothing at all many of saturdays guests had left before the discovery of the body according to the site manager who explained that they had to be out by ten oclock in the morning or pay an extra days rent unfortunately he kept no register of names and addresses and he hadnt noticed anyone running around waving a bloodstained candlestick or hammer banks had asked sergeant hatchley to check dr barness alibi and to issue an appeal for information in the yorkshire post but his hopes were slim one problem was that the campsite was on the northern bank of the river swain next to the cricket pitch and the car park was on the south side well set back from high street and practically surrounded by trees and tall hedges it was an ideal secluded place for a murder after dark except between eleven and half past when the pubs were emptying it was possible according to dr glendennings unchanged estimation of the time of death that steadman had been killed between nine and ten oclock shortly after he left the bridge at that time it would have been just about dark enough and the car park would have been quiet drinking hours being what they were most people arrived between eight and nine and stayed until closing time so far a thorough search had failed to find any traces of blood on the car parks pitted macadam surface in fact forensic had turned up little of interest at all glendenning however had proved as conscientious as usual he had spent half the night on a thorough autopsy and a clear jargonfree report was waiting in bankss in tray at eight am the wound had been made by a metal object with at least one sharp edge and was indeed the cause of death stomach contents revealed a low alcohol level consistent with the evidence of the bridge crowd and the remains of an earlier dinner the blow itself could have been inflicted by either a man or a woman glendenning had added as the actual strength required to kill with such a weapon was minimal also the killer was probably righthanded so it would do banks no good to follow the fictional detectives procedure of watching out for a lefthanded suspect it did however appear to rule out emma steadman who was lefthanded but she had a solid alibi anyway hypostasis indicated as banks had suspected that steadman had been killed elsewhere and his body driven to the field much of the lividity had formed on his right side but he had been buried on his back there were no traces of blood in the car but vic manson found plenty of prints the trouble was that the few clear ones proved to be steadmans the prints on the steering wheel and the door handle were smudged as they almost always were when people drive or open and close doors their fingerprints slide against the smooth plastic or metal surface of the handle and the result is a mess what fibres remained on the vinylcovered seats were so common as to implicate half the dale if taken seriously they indicated nothing so unique as a personally imported italian suit or a yakswool sweater supplied by an exclusive local outfitter nor was there on the tyres any trace of mud soil or clay that could only be found in one specific place there wasnt even wedged in the tread a chip of gravel from an easily identifiable driveway banks had little faith in forensic evidence anyway like most detectives he had convicted criminals on fingerprints and blood groups but he had found that if the criminal had any brains at all forensic evidence though it might narrow the field of suspects was useless until he had been caught by other means then it might help to ensure a guilty verdict it was surprising how many jury members still seemed to trust the experts even though a skilled defence lawyer could easily discredit almost any scientists testimony still banks supposed if the public were willing to accept the scientifically proven superiority of certain toothpastes or breakfast cereals that advertisers claimed then nothing was surprising just after eleven oclock sergeant hatchley poked his head around the door although the station coffee had improved greatly since the introduction of an automatic filter system the two men had established a tradition of walking across to the golden grill for their morning break they weaved through the groups of strolling tourists called hellos to the few locals they recognized and walked into the cafe the only available table was at the back by the toilets the petite waitress shrugged apologetically when she saw them take it usual she called out yes please gladys love hatchley boomed back the usual was coffee and toasted teacakes for both of them hatchley put his buff folder on the red checked tablecloth and ran his hand through his hair where the bloody hells richmond these days he asked fishing for a cigarette hes on a course didnt you know course what bloody course the super sent a memo round never read them maybe you should hatchley scowled anyway what course is this something to do with computers its down in surrey jammy bastard probably at the seaside with his bucket and spade surrey doesnt have a coast hell find one whens he due back two weeks hatchley cursed but their order arrived before he could say anything else he would have banks knew two objections to richmonds absence in the first place the sergeant had often said that he thought education was about as useful as a rubber with a hole in it and secondly even more serious with detective constable richmond away hatchley would have to do most of the legwork on the steadman case himself i checked on doc barness alibi this morning like you asked hatchley said reaching for his teacake and its true he was there with that mrs gaskell all right seems shes having a difficult pregnancy what times arrived about nine thirty according to the husband and left at ten fifteen so he could still have easily killed steadman first and stuffed him in the boot of his car or done it later no motive hatchley said not that we know of yet whats that banks pointed at the folder gen on steadman hatchley mumbled his mouth half full of toasted teacake banks browsed through the report as he ate steadman had been born in coventry almost fortythree years ago at a time when his father was busy setting up his electronics business educated at a local grammar school he won a scholarship to cambridge where he got a first in history after that he did postgraduate work at birmingham and edinburgh then landed a teaching job at leeds university at the age of twentysix there he began to develop and pursue his interest in industrial archaeology a new field then and in local history in his first year of teaching two important things happened first just before christmas that year his mother died and second at the end of the final term he married emma hartley whom he had known for two years emma was the only daughter of a norwich shopkeeper and she had been working as a librarian in edinburgh when steadman was studying there she was five years younger than her husband they had no children the couple honeymooned in gratly staying at the house they now owned hatchley had put an asterisk by this piece of information and when banks turned to the note at the bottom of the page it read check with ramsden the house belonged to his parents banks knew this already but he praised hatchleys thoroughness it was so unusual it deserved encouragement as steadmans career continued to flourish publications praise promotion his fathers health steadily declined when the old man had finally died two years ago the son inherited a considerable fortune he first took his wife on a european tour then after seeing out the university year he bought the house in gratly left his job and began to concentrate on his own interests what do you make of it banks asked hatchley who had finished eating and was now picking his teeth with his fingernails well what would you do with all that money the sergeant said im damned if id buy a house around here and spend all my time poking about ruins you think it was foolish of him not much of a life is it but its what he wanted independence to pursue his own studies hatchley shrugged as if there were no answer to such a silly statement you asked what id do but you didnt tell me hatchley slurped down the last of his coffee it was syrupy at the bottom with undissolved sugar i reckon id make a few choice investments first just enough so i could live comfortably off the interest like nothing risky then id take a few thousand and have a bloody good holiday where everywhere fleshpots of the world banks smiled and then then id come back and live off the interest but what would you do do nowt much bit of this bit of that might even go and live in spain or the south of france or maybe one of those tax havens like bermuda youd leave your job then hatchley looked at banks as if he was insane leave my job course id leave my job wouldnt anyone i suppose so but banks wasnt sure what he would do himself a holiday yes but afterwards to him steadman had made an admirable choice he had extricated himself from the pedestrian and stultifying elements of his work and turned to concentrate on its essence perhaps id set myself up like sherlock holmes a dalesman himself banks thought if i suddenly found myself with a private income take only the most interesting cases wear a deerstalker come on he said shaking off the fantasy itll be a cold day in hell before you and i have to worry about problems like that when banks got back to his office he found emma steadman waiting for him she had just been to identify her husbands body and was still distraught there was little expression in her pale face but the owlish eyes magnified by the lenses of her spectacles showed traces of recent tears she sat upright on the hard chair her hands clasped together on her lap i wont keep you long banks said as he took his seat opposite her and started filling his pipe first id like to know if your husband had any enemies is there anyone you can think of who might have wanted to do him harm no she answered quickly not that i can think of harold wasnt the kind of man who made enemies banks decided not to point out the lack of reason in that statement the bereaved relatives of murder victims frequently assumed that there could be no possible motive for the crime was there anybody he argued with then even a slight disagreement it could be important she shook her head frowning no i told you he wasnt just a minute there was something i dont know how important it was though tell me he had complained a bit about teddy hackett recently hackett when was this about a week ago they were friends really i know but they had some kind of ongoing feud about land oh i suppose it was just silly men often are you know just like little boys anyway im afraid i dont know all the details youll have to ask mr hackett do you have any idea what it was about mrs steadman frowned again this time in concentration i think it might have been something to do with crabtrees field thats just a bit of overgrown land by the river harold was certain hed located some roman ruins there he had some coins and bits of pottery he said were evidence but teddy hackett was trying to buy the land why what did he want with it knowing hackett it would be some vulgar project for making money i dont know exactly what he had in mind a discotheque perhaps or a fairground video arcade supermarket let me get this clear banks said leaning forward what youre saying is that hackett wanted some land for development and your husband was trying to get it preserved as a historic site is that right yes it wasnt the first time either last year harold wanted to start a small local museum in a shopfront on high street but hackett bought the place up quickly and turned it into a gift shop they argued about that too harold was too trusting too nice he wasnt aggressive enough theres no one else you can think of what about dr barnes did your husband ever say anything about him like what anything no jack barker no he thought jack barker was a bit of a cynic a bit too flippant but thats all what about visitors to the house did you have many just friends we entertained who locals mostly we seem to have lost touch with the crowd from leeds barker penny cartwright hackett and dr barnes occasionally sometimes michael ramsden came over from york some of the teachers and kids from eastvale comprehensive harold gave guest lectures and took classes on field trips thats all i can think of therell be a lot of money banks said casually pardon a lot of money your husbands youll inherit i should imagine yes i suppose so she said i hadnt really thought i dont know if harold made a will what will you do with it all mrs steadman looked startled behind her glasses and more than a little disapproving ive no idea as i said i havent really given the matter much thought what about your relationship with your husband were you on good terms was the marriage stable mrs steadman froze what i have to ask but i dont have to answer thats true i dont think i like what youre insinuating chief inspector she went on i think its a very impertinent question especially at a time like this im not insinuating anything mrs steadman just doing my job thats all banks held her cold gaze and remained silent if thats all then she stood up banks followed her to the door and shut it quietly behind her before breathing a sigh of relief four after shocking the old ladies in the post office jack barker set off down helmthorpe high street it was only about ten thirty but already clusters of tourists sauntered along the pavements cardigans draped over their shoulders to keep off the morning chill they would stop now and then holding on to impatient children to glance at displays of local craftware in shop windows crow scar loomed to the north and the shadow of an occasional wispy cloud drifted across its limestone face barker hesitated for a moment outside the tiny secondhand bookshop run by mr thadtwistle at ninetyeight the villages oldest inhabitant then hurried on and turned into the narrow street of cottages opposite the church at number sixteen he paused and knocked nothing happened he knocked again then he heard stirrings inside and smoothed back his hair as he waited the door opened a few inches oh its you penny cartwright said squinting at him closely my god you look awful said barker old man not around is he penny began to shake her head but immediately thought better of it can i come in penny stood aside and let him enter if youll make me a strong cup of coffee its a deal and i didnt mean what i said earlier you look as lovely and fresh as a white rose in the morning dew penny pulled a face and flopped down on the couch her long jetcoloured hair was uncombed and the whites around her blue eyes looked greyish and bloodshot she had dark puffy bags under her eyes and her lips were cracked and dry she held a bottlegreen kimonostyle dressing gown closed at her throat a red dragon reared and breathed fire on the back barker busied himself in the small untidy kitchen and soon came out carrying two steaming mugs of coffee he sat in the battered armchair at right angles to penny as she reached forward to pick up her mug from the low table he could see her lightly freckled cleavage the folds of her silky gown also revealed a long delightful curve of thigh as she crossed her legs she seemed entirely oblivious to the way she was making jack barkers pulse race i suppose youve heard about harry he began lighting a cigarette penny reached out for one too yes she nodded blowing out a lungful of smoke and coughing ive heard these thingsll ruin my voice she glared at the cigarette have the police been to see you yet why should they that chief inspector banks his name is he was at the bridge last night barker explained he talked to us for quite a bit anyway he saw you at least he saw me glancing over at you and asked who you were and you told him yes you told him i was a friend of harrys had to hed have found out sooner or later wouldnt he then hed have been suspicious about why i didnt tell him in the first place so what youve got nothing to hide have you barker shrugged anyway penny went on you know how i feel about the police hes not a bad sort quite friendly really but sharp as a knife doesnt miss a trick hes the kind wholl spend a pleasant evening buying you drinks then ask you hard questions when youre sozzled sounds awful penny pulled a face and ground out her halfsmoked cigarette in the ashtray still theyre all much the same what will you tell him she looked at him and frowned what is there to tell the old man she shook her head hes sharp barker repeated penny smiled well then hell be able to find out all he wants to know wont he barker leaned forward and took her hand penny she shook him off gently no jack dont not now barker slumped back in his chair oh come on jack penny chided him dont behave like a sulky boy im sorry penny gathered her gown around her and stood up think nothing of it youd better go though im a bit unsteady on my pins today barker got to his feet are you singing this week friday if my voice holds out youll be there wouldnt miss it for the world love barker answered then he left five the police station didnt look at all like sally expected for one thing the old tudorfronted building was modern inside and the walls werent papered with wanted posters instead it was more like one of those pleasant openplan offices with potted plants all over the place and nothing but screens separating the desks behind the reception area it smelled of furniture polish and pinescented airfreshener she told the polite young man at the front desk that she wanted to see chief inspector banks the man in charge of the helmthorpe murder no she didnt want to tell the young man about it she wanted the chief inspector she had important information yes she would wait finally her persistence paid off and she was shown upstairs to a network of corridors and office doors with things like interview room stencilled on them there she was given a seat and asked if she would mind waiting a few moments no she folded her hands in her lap and stared ahead at a door marked disappointingly stationery supplies the minutes dragged on she wished she had brought a copy of vogue to flip through like at the dentists suddenly sounds of scuffling and cursing came from the stairwell and three men fell into the corridor only feet from where she was sitting two of them were obviously police and they were struggling with a handcuffed third who wriggled like an eel finally they dragged him to his feet again and hauled him off down the hall he was squirming and swearing and at one point he managed to twist free and run back down the hall towards her sally was terrified at least half of her was the other half was thinking how exciting how much like hill street blues it was the policemen caught him again before he got too close and hustled him into a room sallys heart beat fast she wanted to go home but the chief inspector came out of his office and ushered her inside im sorry about that he apologized it doesnt happen often who is he sally asked wideeyed and pale a burglar we think he broke into merriweathers stereo emporium last week sally found herself sitting before a flimsy metal desk littered with paper clips pens and importantlooking folders the air was thick with pipe smoke which reminded her of her father she coughed and banks taking the hint went to open the window fragments of conversation drifted up on the warm air from market street banks asked sally what she wanted its private she whispered looking over her shoulder and leaning forward she was unsettled by what she had just witnessed and found it much harder to get started than she had imagined i mean she went on i want to tell you something but you have to promise not to tell anyone else anyone the smile disappeared from his lips but still lingered in his lively brown eyes he reached for his pipe and sat down well sally said turning up her nose at the smoke like she always did at home i suppose its up to you isnt it ill just tell you what i know shall i banks nodded it was last saturday night i was up below crow scar in that little shepherds shelter you know the one thats almost collapsed banks knew it the derelict hut had been searched after the discovery of steadmans body well i heard a car it stopped for about ten or fifteen minutes then drove off did you see it no i only heard it i thought it was maybe a courting couple or something at first but theyd stay longer than that wouldnt they banks smiled it was clear from the girls desire for secrecy and her knowledge of the temporal requirements of courting exactly what she had been doing in the shepherds shelter which direction did the car come from he asked the village i think at least it came from the west i suppose it could have come from over the dale up north but theres nothing much on that road for miles except moorland where did it go up along the road i didnt hear it turn round and come back the road that leads to sattersdale right yes but theres plenty of other little roads that cross it you could get almost anywhere from it what time was this it was twelve fourteen when it stopped twelve fourteen not just after twelve or nearly quarter past twelve most people arent so accurate it was a digi sally stopped in her tracks banks was looking down at her wrist on which she wore a small black watch with a pink plastic strap it wasnt digital better tell the truth he said and dont worry your parents neednt know i wasnt doing anything wrong sally blurted out then she blushed and calmed down but thank you i dont think theyd understand yes i was with somebody my boyfriend we were just talking this didnt sound convincing but banks didnt regard it as any of his business and then this car came sally continued we thought it was getting late anyway so kev my boyfriend looked at his watch its a digital one with a light in it and it said twelve fourteen i knew i should have been home hours ago but i thought i might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb we just stayed where we were not paying it much mind really then when we heard it go kevin looked at his watch again and it said twelve twentynine i remember because it was funny kevin said they hadnt much time to sally stopped and reddened it had been all too easy once she got going to forget who she was talking to now she realized she had not only told this strange man with the pipe her boyfriends name but had also given him the impression that she knew all about what men and women did together at night in cars on lonely hillsides but banks didnt pursue her romantic activities he was far more concerned about the accuracy of the information he was getting than about her love life besides she looked at least nineteen old enough to take care of herself whatever her parents thought i imagine kevin your boyfriend could confirm these times he asked well if he had to she answered hesitantly i mean i told him i wouldnt mention his name we dont want any trouble my mum and dad wouldnt like it see i told them we were at his house watching telly theyd tell his mum and dad where we really were and theyd stop us seeing each other how old are you sally sixteen she answered proudly what do you want to do with your life i want to be an actress at least i want to be involved in films and theatre that kind of thing ive applied to the marion boyars academy of theatre arts im impressed banks told her i hope you get accepted he noticed that she was already a dab hand at makeup he had thought she was nineteen most girls of her age never seemed to know when enough was enough but sally obviously did her clothes sense was good too she was dressed in white kneesocks and a deepblue skirt gathered at the waist that came to just above her dimpled knees on top she wore a white cotton blouse and a red ribbon in her goldblonde hair she was a beautiful girl and banks wouldnt have been at all surprised to see her on stage or on television is it true youre from london sally asked yes did scotland yard send you no i moved here but why on earth would you want to come up here banks shrugged i can think of plenty of reasons fresh air beautiful countryside and i had hoped for an easier job but london sally went on excitedly thats where it all happens i went there once on a day trip with the school it was fabulous her wide eyes narrowed and she looked at him suspiciously i cant understand why anyone would want to leave it for this godforsaken dump banks noted that in about twenty seconds sallys opinion had undergone a radical reversal at first she had been coquettish flirtatious but now she seemed disdainful almost sorry for him and much more brusque and businesslike in her manner again he could hardly keep from smiling did you know harold steadman is that who the man yes did you know him yes a bit he often came to the school to give lectures on local history or geology boring stuff mostly about old ruins and he took us on field trips sometimes to fortford or even as far as malham or keld so the pupils knew him quite well as well as you can know a teacher sally thought for a moment but he wasnt really like a teacher i mean i know it was boring and all that but he liked it he was enthusiastic and he even took us to his home for hot dogs and pop after some of the trips us yes the pupils who lived in helmthorpe or gratly there were about seven of us usually his wife made us all some food and we just sat and talked about where wed been and what wed found he was a very nice man what about his wife did you know her not really she didnt stick around with us she always had something else to do i think she was just shy but mr steadman wasnt hed talk to anybody was that the only time you saw him at school on trips sallys eyes narrowed again well apart from in the street or in shops yes look if you mean was he a dirty old man the answers no thats not what i meant banks said but he was glad that she had reacted as if it was he made her go through the story again while he took down all the particulars she gave the information unwillingly this time as if all she wanted was to get out of the place when she finally left banks slouched back in his chair and grinned to think that all his appeal all his glamour had been lost in his move from london to eastvale outside in the market square the clock chimed four one on tuesday morning having sent sergeant hatchley to helmthorpe to check on weavers progress search harold steadmans study and bring in teddy hackett for questioning banks set off for york to visit michael ramsden again he drove into the ancient roman city at about eleven oclock through suburbs of redbrick boxes after getting lost in the oneway system for half an hour he found a parking space by the river ouse and crossed the bridge to fisher amp faulkner ltd a squat ugly brick building by the waterside the pavements were busy with tourists and businessmen and the huge minster seemed to dominate the city its light stone glowed in the morning sun a smart male receptionist pointed him in the right direction and on the third floor one of ramsdens assistants called through to the boss ramsdens office looked out over the river down which a small tour boat was wending its way the top deck was bright with people in summer holiday clothes and camera lenses flashed in the sun the boat left a long v of ripples which rocked the rowing boats in its wake the office itself was small and cluttered beside the desk and filing cabinets stood untidy piles of manuscripts some stacked on the floor and two bookcases displaying a set of fisher amp faulkners titles even in a dark business suit ramsden still looked as if his clothes were too big for him he had the distracted air of a professor of nuclear physics about to explain atomic fission to a layman while simultaneously working out complex formulae in his mind he brushed back an invisible forelock and asked banks to sit down you were a close friend of harold steadmans banks began could you tell me a little about him his background how you met that kind of thing ramsden leaned back in his swivel chair and crossed his long legs you know he said looking sideways towards the window i was always just a little bit in awe of harry not just because he was nearly fifteen years my senior that never really mattered but because i dont think we ever really got over the studentprofessor relationship when we met he was a lecturer at leeds and i was just about to begin my studies in london so we werent even at the same university we werent in the same field either but these ideas get fixed in ones mind nonetheless i was eighteen and harry was nearly thirtythree he was a very intelligent very dedicated man an exact role model for someone like me at that time anyway although i was as i said just about to go to university in london i always came home at christmas and in summer id help around the house do odd jobs make bacon and eggs for the guests and i loved being at home being in the yorkshire countryside it was best when harry and emma came to stay for their annual holidays id walk for hours sometimes alone sometimes with harold or penny penny banks cut in would that be penny cartwright yes thats right we were very close until i went off to london go on we used to go out together in a casual sort of way it was all very innocent she was sixteen and wed known each other nearly all our lives shed even stayed with us for a while after her mother died how old was she then oh about ten or eleven it was tragic really mrs cartwright drowned in a spring flood terrible pennys father had a nervous breakdown so she stayed with us while he recovered it seemed only natural later when well you know we were a bit older anyway harold was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the area he took to swainsdale immediately and pretty soon he was teaching me more than id learned living there all my life he was like that i was impressed of course but as i was about to study english at university i was insufferably literary always quoting wordsworth and the like i suppose you know he bought the house when my mother couldnt afford to keep it on banks nodded yes ramsden went on they came every year harry and emma and when father died they were in a position to help us out a great deal it was good for harry too his work at the university was too abstract too theoretical he published a book called the principles of industrial archaeology but what he really wanted was the opportunity to put those principles into practice university life didnt give him time enough to do that he fully intended to teach again you know but first he wanted to do some real pioneering work when he inherited the money all that became possible when i graduated i went to work for fisher and faulkner in london first then they opened the northern branch and offered me this job i missed the north and id always hoped to be able to make a living up here some day we published harolds second book and he and i developed a good working relationship the firm specializes in academic books as you can see he pointed towards the crowded bookshelves and most of the titles banks could make out had principles or a study of in them we do mostly literary criticism and local history ramsden went on next harry edited a book of local essays and since that weve been working on an exhaustive industrial history of the dale from preroman times to the present harry published occasional essays in scholarly journals but this was to be his major work everybody was looking forward to it tremendously what exactly is industrial archaeology banks asked ive heard the term quite often lately but ive only got a vague idea what it means your vague idea is probably as clear as anyone elses ramsden replied as yet its still an embryonic discipline basically the term was first used to describe the study of the machinery and methods of the industrial revolution but its been expanded a great deal to include other periods roman lead mines for example i suppose you could say its the study of industrial artefacts and processes but then you could argue for a month about how to define industrial to complicate matters even further its very hard to draw the line between the subject as a hobby and as an academic discipline for instance if someone happens to be interested in the history of steam trains he can still make a contribution to the field even though he actually works nine to five in a bank most days i see banks said so its a kind of hybrid area an open field thats about it nobodys yet come up with a final definition which is partly why its so exciting you dont think mr steadmans death could be in any way linked to his work do you ramsden shook his head slowly i cant see it no of course there are feuds and races just like in any other discipline but i cant see any of it going that far did he have rivals professionally yes the universities are full of them could he have uncovered something that someone might wish to keep quiet ramsden thought for a moment his sharp chin resting in his bony hand you mean the unsavoury past of a prominent family that kind of thing anything its an interesting theory i cant say for certain one way or the other if he had discovered something he didnt tell me its possible i suppose but were a long way from the industrial revolution youd have to dig back a very long way if you want to find a descendant of someone who made his fortune by exploiting child labour for example which wasnt entirely uncommon back then i dont think there are many direct descendants of the romans around who still have anything to hide banks smiled probably not what about enemies academic or otherwise harry good lord i shouldnt think so he wasnt the kind to make enemies again banks refrained from stating the obvious do you know anything about this business with teddy hackett he asked ramsden glanced sharply at him you dont miss much do you he said yes i know about it for what its worth theres a field in helmthorpe over the river near the cricket pitch its called crabtrees field because it used to belong to a farmer named crabtree hes long dead now though theres a small bridge which connects the field with the campsite on the other side and hackett wants to provide more facilities for the campers by which he no doubt means junk food and video games you must have noticed the increasing americanization of the english countryside chief inspector mcdonalds seems to be springing up everywhere now even in places as small as helmthorpe harold had good reason to suppose and ive heard his evidence that there was once a roman camp there it could be a very important discovery he was trying to persuade the local authorities to protect it for excavations naturally that caused a bit of friction between harry and teddy hackett but they remained friends i dont think it was a serious quarrel not serious enough to lead to murder not in my opinion no ramsden turned sideways again and looked out over the river at the shining minster towers they were quite close friends though god knows why seeing as their views on just about everything were always diametrically opposed harry enjoyed a good argument for its own sake that was the academic in him and hackett is at least a fairly intelligent if not a very tasteful adversary im afraid youll have to ask harrys friends in the village how serious the quarrel was i didnt get over there often enough i suppose youve met the good doctor and the resident scribbler banks nodded do you know them a little not very well though as i said i dont get to helmthorpe as often as id like doc barnes has been around as long as i can remember of course and ive had one or two beery evenings in the bridge naturally there was quite a bit of excitement when jack barker moved to gratly three or four years back but it soon settled down when he proved to be much like everyone else where did he come from what made him choose gratly havent a clue im afraid i have a vague notion hes from somewhere in cheshire but i couldnt swear to it youll have to ask him did he know mr steadman before he moved to gratly not as far as i know harry never mentioned him does your company publish his books lord no ramsden made curious snuffling noises through his nose and banks took the sound for laughter i told you what we specialize in i believe barker writes paperback originals did mr steadman ever say anything about dr barnes or jack barker he said a number of things yes what do you have in mind anything odd did he ever tell you anything about them that you thought they might not want to be common knowledge are you trying to suggest that harry was a blackmailer not at all but if he did know something they werent to know what hed do with the knowledge were they you say he was a decent upright man fair enough if he knew of anything illegal or immoral anyone was involved in what do you think he would have done i see what you mean ramsden tapped a yellow pencil on his bottom teeth hed have done the right thing of course gone to the authorities but i still cant help you he never indicated to me that either barker or barnes had ever been involved in anything untoward what about penny cartwright what about her harry certainly never spoke ill of penny what about your relationship with her ramsden paused im not sure its any of your business up to you banks said it was all a long time ago there was certainly nothing odd about it i dont see how knowing can possibly help you banks kept silent oh what the hell then ramsden said why not i told you we were good friends then we drifted apart we were both in london at roughly the same time but we moved in very different circles she was a singer so she hung around with musicians she was always a bit of a rebel too you know had to be different embraced all the causes she made a couple of records and even toured in europe and america i believe it was traditional folk music they played at first anyway but they jazzed it up with electronic instruments then she got tired of life in the fast lane and came home her father forgave her and she settled into her cottage apart from the old man getting a bit overprotective now and again she more or less gets on with her own life still sings a bit around the local pubs too whats her father like the major to do him justice he never really recovered from his wifes death hes a strange old bird lives right on high street with his dog has a flat over old thadtwistles bookshop there were rumours you know when penny left look im not sure i should be telling you this its just silly local gossip i shouldnt worry about that mr ramsden i know a hawk from a handsaw ramsden swallowed his adams apple bobbed up and down people said they were a bit too close father and daughter living together after the mother died they say the old man wanted her to take her mothers place in his bed and thats why she took off so young do you know what im saying its not entirely uncommon around these parts banks nodded do you believe it not for a moment you know how vindictive gossip can be but what did anyone have against the cartwrights ramsden picked up his pencil again and started rolling it between his fingers people thought they were a bit stuckup thats all the majors always been standoffish and his wife wasnt from around these parts people in the dale used to be a lot more parochial than they are now so many outsiders have moved in even now most of them think of penny as some kind of scarlet woman you were close to her did she say anything no she didnt and i think she would have done if anything unusual had been going on was she friendly with mr steadman yes they were very good friends penny knows a lot about folk traditions through her music you see and harold was always willing to learn she even taught him some guitar also she was very disorientated for a while after she came back from her brush with fame and fortune and i think harrys support meant a lot he thought the world of her they both loved going for long walks watching birds and wild flowers talking about the past there was plenty to follow up in that banks thought but he had no more questions to ask he already had more than enough information to digest and analyze he thanked ramsden said goodbye and walked back over the sluggish ouse to his car he stopped at the first likelylooking village inn he saw and enjoyed a late leisurely pub lunch of shepherds pie and a refreshing pint of shandy made from sam smiths old brewery bitter as he drove back to eastvale listening to purcells airs he began to go over the list of involved characters in his mind trying to imagine motives and opportunities first there was teddy hackett that field business might only be the tip of the iceberg and if steadman had been blocking similar projects hackett would have a good enough reason for wanting rid of him then there was jack barker no obvious motive there but no alibi either as barker himself had admitted on sunday evening his glance at penny cartwright in the bridge had spoken volumes and if there was more to her relationship with steadman than ramsden had told him then jealousy may have provided a very strong motive as for dr barnes his alibi hadnt been nearly as solid as he had seemed to think and though there was no motive apparent yet banks wasnt willing to consider him out of the running it seemed pointless to include emma steadman for one thing she was lefthanded and for another she had been watching television with mrs stanton all evening but there was the money she did have a great deal to gain from her husbands death especially if the two werent seeing eye to eye anymore she could possibly have hired someone it was unlikely but he couldnt rule it out ramsden seemed to have neither the motive nor the opportunity in a way steadman was his bread and butter an important client as well as an old friend perhaps he did envy steadman but that was no reason to kill him banks couldnt quite work ramsden out there was the business of the novel for a start he sensed that perhaps great things had been expected of ramsden artistically but had never really materialized why indolence lack of talent he seemed to have a rather precious personality and banks guessed that he had been pampered as a child most likely by his mother and led to believe that he was special and gifted now he was in his twenties and the talent hadnt really made itself manifest penny cartwright remained a grey area she might have had both motive and means but they had yet to be discovered banks wanted very much to talk to her and he decided to go to helmthorpe that evening he would have to see her father too at some point one problem was that there was so much time to account for if steadman had left the bridge at about a quarter to nine and his body had been dumped at twelve fourteen where had he been and what had he been doing during those three and a half hours surely someone must have seen him slowly bankss thoughts faded as the countertenor sang a mournful retird from any mortals sight and the poplars and privet hedges that lined the road gave way to the first houses in eastvale two so you told him everything then i didnt mean to kevin honest not your name and all but it just slipped out kevin leered and sallys expression darkened she elbowed him in the ribs youve got a filthy mind you have it was the time that did it twelve fourteen he could see i hadnt got a digital watch why do you have to wear that silly thing anyway kevin looked down at his watch as if examining it for faults i dont know he said it beeps every hour sally went on her voice softening no matter what youre doing kevin leaned forward and kissed her she squirmed beneath him and he slipped his hand under her blouse to hold her soft warm breast her body was pressed down hard against the ground and the moist sickly smell of grass filled the air insects buzzed and whined all around finally she broke away and gasped for breath kevin lay back with his hands behind his head and stared at the deepblue sky what did you think of him then this hotshot from london he asked sally snorted some hotshot fancy leaving london to come up here the bloke must be barmy kevin turned to face her leaning on one elbow and sticking a long stalk of grass between his teeth what did he say didnt seem very interested really he just asked me a lot of daft questions i dont know why i bothered i wont be so fast to go out of my way and help the police next time thats for sure what do you mean next time i mean if i find out anything else why should that happen it was only by chance we heard the car we didnt even know what it was but we do now arent you curious dont you want to know who did it kevin shrugged i wouldnt want to get involved leave all that to the police thats what they get paid for well isnt that a typical smallminded attitude sally said scornfully its a sensible one though so its no fun being sensible all the time what are you getting at nothing i just might do a bit of snooping on my own thats all ive lived here all my life i ought to know whats going on in the village what can you do that the police cant i dont know yet but i bet i can do better than them wouldnt it be exciting if i solved the case for them dont be an idiot sally weve been through this before you know what i think its dangerous how what if the killer knew what you were doing what if he thought you might be getting too close sally shivered ill be careful dont worry besides you never get anywhere if youre frightened of a bit of danger kevin gave up sally smoothed her skirt and lay on her back again they were high on the southern slope of the dale overlooking crossshaped gratly and helmthorpes chequerboard pattern of slate roofs sally plucked a buttercup and held it to her chin kevin took the flower from her hand and trailed it over her throat and collarbone she shuddered he kissed her again and put his other hand up her skirt to caress the tender flesh of her thighs just below her panties suddenly sally heard a sound a snapping twig or a thwacking branch she sat up quickly leaving kevin with his face in the grass someones coming she whispered a few moments later a figure appeared from the small copse by the beck side sally put her hand over her eyes to shield them from the sun and saw who it was hello miss cartwright she called out penny walked towards them knelt on the grass and tossed back her hair hello its a beautiful day isnt it yes answered sally were just having a breather weve been walking most of the afternoon i used to walk around these parts a lot too when i was your age penny said quietly almost to herself it seems like centuries ago now but it was only ten years youll be surprised how quickly time passes enjoy it while you can sally didnt know what to say she felt embarrassed after an uneasy silence she said im sorry about your friend mr steadman really i am he was a nice man penny seemed to return from a great distance to focus on her at first sally thought the commiseration had gone unheard but penny smiled warmly and said thank you yes he was then she got to her feet and brushed the scraps of grass from her long skirt i must be off anyway mustnt bore you young people with my memories in silence sally and kevin watched her walk up the hillside with a strong determined stride she looked a lonely wild figure sally thought like catherine in wuthering heights a woman of the moors spirit of the place then she felt kevins palm against her warm thigh again three further up the hillside penny paused as she stood on a stile and looked back on the dale she loved spread out below her there was the church by her cottage high street and the whitewashed frontage of the dog and gun on the other side of the river past the cricket pitch and crabtrees field the commons sloped up rougher and rougher to crow scar which that day was almost too bright to look at but she couldnt gaze long without thinking of harry for he was the one who had shown her swainsdales secrets given it depth and life beyond its superficial beauties and now she fancied she could see the collapsed section of tavistocks wall the stones that had been used to cover harrys body seemed darker than the rest looking back the way she had come penny saw the two young lovers fuse in a tight embrace on the grass she smiled sadly when shed first approached them she had noticed how flustered and embarrassed they had looked again she thought of harry suddenly the memory of a picnic theyd had ten years ago came into her mind it must have been on the exact spot where sally and kevin were lying she remembered the view of the village clearly and they had been near a small copse as emma had sat in the shade knitting the more she concentrated on it the more details came back it was just around the time when she and michael had started drifting apart he had been reading shelleys poetry penny could even remember the scuffed brown leather of the books cover it was a secondhand edition shed bought him for his birthday she and harry had spread the red checked cloth on the grass and started to unload the hamper somehow their hands had touched by accident penny remembered blushing and harry had busied himself looking for the corkscrew it was for the chablis yes they had drunk chablis a good vintage that day and now ten years later she felt the crisp flinty taste of the cool wine on her tongue again the picture faded as quickly as it had come how innocent it had all been how bloody innocent wiping the tears from her eyes with the back of her hand she jumped down from the stile and strode sharply on four hackett had already been waiting an hour when banks got back from york and he was not at all amused look here he protested as banks led him upstairs to the office you cant do this to me you cant just drag me in like this without an explanation ive got a business to run i told you everything last night you told me nothing last night banks took off his jacket and hung it on the back of the door sit down he said make yourself at home the room was stuffy so banks reopened the window and the smells of market street wafted up exhaust fumes freshbaked bread something sweet and sickly from the chocolate shop hackett sat rigidly in his chair and lapsed into a tense affronted silence theres nothing to get excited about banks told him taking out his pipe and fiddling with it over the wastepaper basket then why did your sergeant kidnap me like that and rush me over here eh i want my lawyer oh do relax mr hackett theres really no need for melodrama youve been watching far too many american films on television ive not brought you here to lay charges or anything like that im sorry if sergeant hatchley seemed a little brusque its just his manner ive got a few questions to ask you thats all he gave hackett a sharp glance just one or two little things wed like to get cleared up why pick on me what about jack or the doc do you know of any reason they might have had for killing mr steadman well no i didnt mean to imply that its just that did he ever say anything about them to you give you any reason to think one of them might want him out of the way no thats not what i meant anyway im not trying to put the blame on someone else i just want to know why you picked on me to haul in like this crabtrees field banks picked up his pipe and reached for the matches hackett sighed so thats it someones been telling tales i should have known youd have found out before long banks lit his pipe and gazed at the ceiling some old juices trickled down the stem and caught in his throat he coughed and pulled a face hackett looked at him angrily you dont give a damn do you anyway its nobodys bloody business its police business now mr hackett banks interrupted he put his pipe aside and drained the cold coffee left in his mug if its all the same to you the sooner we get it cleared up the better hackett shuffled in his chair and smoothed his droopy moustache it was nothing he said just a minor disagreement over an acre or two of land thats all countries have been invaded for less banks remarked and went on to give hackett the details as he had heard them yes hackett agreed thats more or less it but i wouldnt kill anyone for that let alone a close friend like harry even if he did want to wrap up the whole bloody dale and give it to the national trust i liked the man i respected his principles even though they werent the same as mine but you did argue about the field banks persisted we argued about it yes but it was half in fun the others will tell you harry liked a good argument as well as the next man it wasnt that important money is always important mr hackett how much did you expect to make from the land if you got it thats impossible to say i wouldnt stand to make anything for ages of course id be out of pocket in fact theres the purchase price construction publicity it could have been years before i started showing a profit so you were only in it for the fun not only that no i mean i like business its a way of life that suits me i like doing deals i like building things up but of course i wouldnt put out good money if i didnt think the eventual returns would be substantial can we agree banks asked that you did hope at some point to make a considerable amount from your investment hell yes eventually and now what about now i dont understand oh come on mr hackett dont play the innocent the pitch is clear now isnt it the fields yours hackett laughed and relaxed in his chair thats just where youre wrong im afraid you see i think harry pulled it off at least theres a freeze on the place right now i suppose young ramsden will carry on his masters work and wrap it up a bloody roman camp i ask you whats there but a few broken pots and stones no wonder the bloody economys in the state its in no room for initiative anymore oh said banks feigning surprise i thought our government wanted to encourage small businesses hackett glared at him whether for the slight about his fiscal proportions or for picking up a throwaway comment banks wasnt quite sure you know what i mean chief inspector were hamstrung by these historical societies and tourist boards theyre all a load of bloody romantics as far as i can see its all a myth the past wasnt like that it wasnt neat and tidy like they all seem to think for christs sake life was nasty brutish and short as the man said just because i never went to university it doesnt make me an ignoramus you know ive read books too if you ask me harry walked around seeing the past through rosecoloured glasses penny cartwright too in reality life must have been bloody misery back then imagine them poor roman sods freezing their balls off up north when they could have been lounging around in the sun on the seven hills drinking vino and rogering the local tarts and as for the bloody industrial revolution it was nothing but exploitation hard harsh work for most people no chief inspector harry hadnt a bloody clue about the past for all his degrees maybe you should move somewhere else banks suggested i doubt they care much for local history in wigan for example or huddersfield youd be surprised hackett said its all over the bloody place they call it civic pride theyre even flogging bradford as the gateway to bronte country now and if they can get away with that they can do anything besides i like it here dont think just because im a businessman i lack a finer appreciation of nature im as much for the environment as the next man what were you doing on saturday night banks asked renewing the attack on his pipe with a cleaner hackett scratched his receding hairline after i left the bridge i went to a new club in darlington i drove up there had a couple of drinks in a local then went on to the club i know the owner like weve done a bit of business together so you left the bridge at what time about half nine and drove straight to darlington well not exactly i went home first to get changed what time did you leave for darlington about ten to ten and arrived about half past twenty to eleven and you went to the club when half eleven quarter to twelve whats it called the kitkat klub only been open a few weeks its a sort of disco place but not too loud caters for the more mature crowd i suppose you knew people there people who can corroborate your story i talked to a few people yes and theres andy shaw the owner banks took down the details including the name of the pub and noticed how anxious hackett looked throughout the process anything else you can tell us mr hackett hackett chewed on his lower lip and frowned no nothing right then off you go banks said he stood up and walked over to open the door as soon as hackett was out of the building banks called sergeant hatchley in and asked if hed found anything in his search of steadmans study nowt much of interest no hatchley said a few manuscripts letters to historical preservation societies theyre on my desk if you want to look at them later and he had one of those fancy computers a word processor i suppose he had to spend his brass on something remember how much wheeling and dealing it took us to get central admin to let us have one downstairs banks nodded and now they send bloody richmond off t seaside to learn how to use the bugger hatchley shook his head slowly and left the office five it was about six thirty after what passed for rush hour in that part of the country when banks pulled into helmthorpes main car park he had attended the brief inquest given the press a snippet or two of information and managed a quick dinner at home with sandra and the kids penny cartwright was washing up the dinner dishes and enjoying the play of evening sunlight as it reflected from the shiny surfaces and skittered about the walls when she heard a knock at the front door she quickly wiped her hands on her apron and went to answer it she knew immediately that the darkhaired wiry man standing there was the policeman barker had told her about she hadnt expected him to be so goodlooking though and immediately felt unattractive in her apron with her hair tied back in a long ponytail youd better come in she said we wouldnt want to give the neighbours too much to talk about she pointed him to a worn armchair and slipped into the kitchen where she quickly divested herself of the stained apron untied her hair and brushed it swiftly so that it fell around her face and spilled over her shoulders if banks was struck by the abrupt casual manner of his hostess he was also struck by her beauty she looked good in closefitting jeans and her striking hair framed a proud highcheekboned face without a trace of makeup the combination of jetblack hair and sharp blue eyes added to the stunning effect penny sat in a straightbacked chair by a writing table and asked banks what she could do for him he began casually trying to establish a friendly tone maybe nothing miss cartwright im just talking to mr steadmans friends trying to get some idea of what he was like do you really need to know penny asked i mean do you care perhaps not in the way that you do banks admitted after all i didnt know him but it might help me to find out who killed him and i care about that obviously somebody did but all ive heard so far is how wonderful he was the kind of man who didnt have an enemy in the whole wide world what makes you think youll get anything different out of me penny asked her lips curved slightly in a mocking smile just fishing well you wont catch anything inspector not from me its all absolutely true i cant imagine for the life of me whod want to do a thing like that to him banks sighed it was going to be a difficult evening fortunately miss cartwright he said its not your life were concerned about its mr steadmans and somebody brought that to an abrupt and cruel end do you know anything about his business affairs do you mean that fuss over crabtrees field really inspector does teddy hackett strike you as the murdering kind he wouldnt have the guts to kill a worm if his life depended on it he might be a ruthless businessman though the competition around here isnt much cop and if you ask me hes got by more on good luck than good management but a killer hackett never stranger things have happened oh i know there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy she quoted it might not be a serious possibility banks went on but its the only one weve got so far typical bloody police that is penny mocked crucify the first poor bastard that comes out less than squeaky clean still she added hacketts no great loss to society not like harry how long had you known mr steadman banks asked depends on what you mean by know penny lit a long filter cigarette and went on i first met him years ago when i was a teenager and he and emma came up to gratly for their holidays theyd been two or three times before i got to know them through michael thats michael ramsden they stayed at his parents bedandbreakfast place the house they live in now i was about sixteen and michael and i were sweethearts at that time so naturally i saw them quite often banks nodded and sucked on his pipe that archaic word sweethearts sounded wonderfully erotic coming from pennys lips it seemed unselfconscious at odds with her tight and aggressive manner we went on walks together she continued harry knew a lot about the countryside and its history that was his real love and then well it was a beautiful summer but it passed as all summers do ah yes but where are the snows of yesteryear banks quoted back at her it was summer there wasnt much snow again banks noticed that tiny twitch of a smile at the corners of her pale lips that would be about ten years ago wouldnt it he asked penny nodded slowly ten years almost exactly yes but things changed michael went to university he was eighteen i went away years passed harry came into some money and bought the house id been back about eight months then sort of return of the prodigal daughter black sheep most people had no time for me but harry always did what do you mean they had no time for you where had you been why did you come back thats a long story inspector penny said and im not sure it comes under the heading of relevant information briefly though i spent about eight or nine years away in the music business mostly i was homesick despite all the fun and a moderate amount of acclaim finally i got very cynical and i decided it was time to come home people werent friendly because they cant accept anything modern around here and they no longer knew how to behave towards me im sure they made up stories to suit their opinions they didnt know who or what i was so they made a lot of assumptions based on what they read in the sunday papers about the music business and i dont mean the sunday times either to them i became a degenerate a scarlet woman in fact i always had been they couldnt admit theyd ever been wrong about me does that answer your questions she paused but didnt look at banks for a response it was very hard for my father but he took me back why dont i live with him is that what you were going to ask next for my sanity inspector my mental health hes just a bit too solicitous of my welfare shall we say and i think im a big girl now it seemed best for both of us if i took this little cottage surely you can understand that of course there were rumours too werent there penny laughed oh you know about that as well do you see what a nice close little community our village is well dont be embarrassed inspector ask me go on ask me her bright blue eyes glittered with anger banks said nothing finally penny gave him a scornful look and turned away to pull another cigarette from her packet so only your father and harold steadman were kind to you yes penny hesitated and jack barker too hed been here a year or so by then but he knew nothing of what had happened not that it would have mattered to him hes a friend too and now oh now penny laughed people are beginning to say hello again do you still see michael ramsden not much only when he calls in at the bridge or drops by with harry sometimes when you drift apart you never really drift back together and you cant think of any reason why anyone would want to harm mr steadman none at all ive told you pennys smooth brow creased in thought and she shook her head sadly he wasnt greedy or scheming he never cheated or lied what did his wife think of your relationship emma nothing much i should imagine probably glad to get him out of the way why do you say that were they unhappy together penny looked at him as if hed just crawled out from under a stone and blew her smoke out angrily how should i know ask her im asking you things were taking the kind of turn he had hoped to avoid but with someone as antiestablishment as penny cartwright he reflected it was bound to happen she had been toying with him all along he pressed on still no answer i told you i dont know she said for gods sake what do you want me to say was their marriage normal normal ha what the bloody hell does that mean yes i suppose so ive never been married myself so im hardly the best person to ask were they happy i should think so as i said i dont really know its not as if i was his confidante or his shoulder to cry on did he need one penny sighed and rested her head in her hands look she protested tiredly this is getting us nowhere what do you want from me banks ignored her question and pressed on what were you to mr steadman harry and i were friends just friends i told you we had interests in common and his wife didnt object she never said anything to me why should she harry never said anything either you do know her then of course i bloody well know her harry and i werent carrying on a clandestine relationship like you seem to think i went to their house for dinner plenty of times she was always very kind and charming she was a good cook too what did you talk about when emma was around yes nothing much just the usual stuff she didnt really share harrys passions she likes music mostly classical though christ what do you talk about when you go to someones house for dinner were you having an affair with harold steadman at last the inevitable question and banks felt a fool the moment it was out if he had been expecting a burst of pentup anger or a howl of derisive laughter in reply he couldnt have been more surprised his question seemed instead to deflate the interview of all its mounting tension and penny gazed at him steadily a spark of amusement in her sapphire eyes as if in fact she had goaded him into bluntness no inspector she said i was not having an affair with harry steadman or with anyone else for that matter in fact im not having an affair with emma steadman or with my father either everything is exactly as ive told you i just didnt feel that way about harry nor he about me as far as i could tell banks thought steadman must have been mad he didnt excite me physically she went on lighting another cigarette and walking around the small room as she smoked it only my mind my imagination and i liked him very much i think he was a good man a bright sweet person perhaps i even loved him in a platonic sort of way but thats as far as it went she tossed her hair back and sat down facing him chin held high bright tears shone in her eyes but they never began to flow there you are inspector she said with dignity ive bared my soul for you arent you pleased banks was moved by the obvious intensity of her feeling but he didnt want to let his disadvantage show when did you last see him he asked her eyes reflected a chain of options running through her mind it was a phenomenon banks had often observed in people who were trying to decide quickly whether to lie or tell the truth penny opened her mouth then closed it she took a final drag on her cigarette ground it out half smoked and whispered saturday saturday evening what time about nine after hed left the bridge yes he dropped by here then why the hell didnt you tell me before you knew damn well you were holding back important information penny shrugged you didnt ask me i didnt want to get involved didnt want to get involved banks echoed scornfully you say you liked the man that he helped you and you couldnt be bothered to help us try and find his killer penny sighed and began to wind a strand of hair around her index finger look inspector she said i know it sounds shabby but its true i dont see how his visit to me could help you in any way and dammit she flashed i dont think i owe the police any bloody favours thats not the point i dont care about your personal feelings towards the police what was important was the time if nothing else your information could help us pinpoint the time of the murder when did he leave about ten did he say where he was going i assumed he was going to york hed mentioned it but he didnt mention any other calls he wanted to make first any errands to run no it was another hour accounted for anyway banks had nothing more to say his session with penny had exhausted him she seemed irritated and the tension grew between them again as tangible as a tightening hacksaw blade finally penny broke it look she began im sorry i really am i do care about harry the thing is that in my life involvement with the police has always meant trouble ive never been involved in a murder investigation before so i dont know what matters and what doesnt when youre a musician young in with a certain crowd you get a very warped view of authority police customs men immigration officials security guards they all seem against you theyre all such a royal pain in the arse banks couldnt help but grin drugs he asked penny nodded not me i was never into it not in a heavy way but you know how it is in london theres drugs all around you whether you take them or not sure i smoked a joint or two maybe took some amphetamines to keep me awake on tour but never the heavy stuff try and tell the drug squad that banks wanted to argue to defend the police but he was too tired and he knew there would be no point anyway besides he also knew that the police were just like everyone else a lot were bastards and a few werent he had known a highranking officer in the drug squad who routinely planted illegal substances on people he wanted out of the way and that was by no means rare or unusual behaviour also he smelled something familiar in the air of pennys cottage he knew what it was but he didnt care to pursue the matter any more than he wanted to tell her that his full title was chief inspector people often got it wrong he stood up and penny walked to the door with him he felt that she was seeking some kind words of reassurance from him some forgiveness for acting in a way contrary to her feelings for steadman but he didnt know how to give it at the door he said i hear you sing miss cartwright actually its ms penny corrected him a playful smile lighting her eyes yes i sing locally sometimes im at the dog and gun this friday and saturday competing with the disco in the hare and hounds ill see if i can drop by then banks said if nothing turns up feel free there was a trace of doubt in pennys voice as if she couldnt quite believe that a policeman would be interested in traditional folk music or in any kind of music for that matter banks walked down the narrow cobbled street by the church wall and as soon as he got to the corner he heard a hissing sound behind him and turned an old woman stood at the door of the cottage next to pennys and beckoned him over when he got close enough she whispered youll be that there policeman theyre all talking about detective chief inspector banks he said reaching for his card at your service nay nay lad theres no need for that i believe thee she said waving it aside been talking to er ladyship next door i see she jerked a shrivelled thumb in the direction of pennys cottage puzzled banks nodded did she tell ee about satday night what about saturday night i thought she wouldnt the old woman said triumphantly crossing her arms with great satisfaction a proper ruckus there were t old major near flung im down t garden path flung who why im as got isself murdered she announced with obvious relish i dont old wi married men sniffing around young lasses and shes a flighty one yon missy is you mark my words there again though she laughed t majors mad as an atter isself what are you talking about mrs miss she said proudly lived seventyone years and never saw t need for a usband yet miss bamford it is young man and im talking about satday night when major cartwright popped in on is daughter and caught er wi that murdered chappie bout ten oclock it were now dont ask me what they was doing cos i couldnt say but e flew off t handle t old man did told im not to come around no more you mean the major physically threw mr steadman out of penny cartwrights house banks asked trying to get things straight he was sure that something was bound to have got lost in translation well not in so many words miss bamford backed down her chin retracted deep into the folds of her neck i couldnt see proper like pushed im though and that chap so pale and weakly from shutting imsen up wi books all day and night ill bet she didnt tell you about that did she yon lady muck banks had to admit that penny had not told him about that in fact he had backed away from the whole issue of her father after she had challenged him to be direct did she go out afterwards he asked er royal ighness no t door banged about eleven but that were t major surely theres a back door too oh aye miss bamford answered she hadnt missed his meaning banks thanked her with a smug smile on her wrinkled face the old woman shut her door after a quick and puzzled glance back at pennys cottage banks walked towards his car and drove home one so according to your mate in darlington sergeant balfour sir a good man according to your sergeant balfour banks went on hackett didnt arrive at the kitkat klub until after one oclock in the morning and nobody in the pub he mentioned remembered seeing him thats right the landlord said he often dropped by but last week it was on friday not saturday so the bastards been lying banks sighed he was becoming more and more irritated with the inhabitants of helmthorpe and as many london villains would testify the more annoyed he got the harder it was all round i suppose wed better have him in again no wait he glanced at his watch and stood up better still lets have a drive into helmthorpe theres a couple of things i want to do there sandra was using the cortina so they signed out a car from the pool and banks let hatchley drive the hedgerows by the river were dotted with clumps of white yellow and purple wild flowers none of which banks could name a few dark clouds skulked about the sky but the sun pierced through here and there in bright lances of light that picked out green patches on the shadowed dalesides the effect reminded banks of some paintings hed seen in a london gallery sandra had dragged him to but he couldnt remember the artists name turner gainsborough constable sandra would know he made a mental note to look into landscape painting a bit more closely what do you think then hatchley asked he drove with one hand and lit a cigarette from the glowing red circle of the dashboard lighter about hackett i mean could be our man hes certainly hiding something what about the others who were with steadman that night we just dont know do we any one of them could have done it theyve no real alibis not even barnes but what motive could he have for killing steadman hes got a good reputation locally always has had banks fiddled with his pipe could be blackmail maybe barnes had something on steadman or vice versa maybe steadman learned something that would ruin the doctors reputation its possible i suppose hatchley said but steadman was rich he didnt need to blackmail anyone surely and if he was paying barnes itd be daft to kill the goose that laid the golden egg wouldnt it agreed but it neednt have been money perhaps steadman felt morally bound to tell what he knew from all accounts he was just the kind of person who would i know its all speculation at this point but i still think we should look into the doctors finances and background and find out if steadman made any large bank withdrawals recently wont do any harm i suppose bloody hell hatchley swerved to avoid a wobbling cyclist and yelled out of the window watch where youre going bloody road hog banks tightened his seat belt he remembered one of the reasons why he preferred driving his own car on the job they arrived safely and parked by the river where steadman had left his car and walked up the alley to high street it was about midday tourists thronged the small icecream shop and the locals were out shopping or gossiping by cottage gates up the narrow cobbled side streets the two policemen were now well known in the village and voices lowered as they passed banks smiled to himself he enjoyed the effect his presence had on people in london nobody but the criminals hed put away more than once knew who he was they paused by a newsagents where racks of coloured postcards maps and local guidebooks outside on the pavement flapped in the light breeze lets take hackett together after lunch banks suggested all right hatchley looked at his watch want to eat now not yet why dont you drop in on weaver and see if anythings turned up i want a word with major cartwright then well have a pie and a pint at the bridge and work out how to tackle hackett hatchley agreed and walked off to the small local police station nobody banks thought could look more like a retired major than the man who opened the door next to thadtwistles bookshop he was elderly but trimlooking with silver hair a brickred complexion and a grey handlebar moustache after banks had identified himself the major grunted and led him up a narrow staircase the flat turned out to be directly above the bookshop banks followed him into a sitting room dominated by a huge framed reproduction of a barebreasted woman carrying a flag over a battlefield of dead and wounded soldiers she was accompanied by a small boy with a gun in each hand liberty leading the people the major said catching him staring at it delacroix thats what we were fighting for isnt it luckily banks could recognize a rhetorical question when he heard one he turned his attention to the terrier sniffing around his ankles and tried subtly shifting his feet to make it go away banks didnt like dogs if anything he was a cat man but he liked it even less when their proud owners expected him to fuss over the damned animals as if they were newborn babies kicking out a bit harder banks finally persuaded the pooch to slink off to its basket from where it gazed at him with an expression of resentment mingled with arrogance the major was pouring drinks so fortunately his back was turned stale smoke made the warm room stuffy banks spotted an antique pipe rack on the wall above the fireplace and hoping to establish a rapport he sat in a straightbacked chair and coaxed his own briar alight the major handed him a small whisky and soda took a larger one for himself and sat down in the scuffed leather armchair that had obviously been his since time immemorial some military types banks found regarded the police as fellow professionals colleaguesinarms almost but others looked upon them as upstarts petty dabblers who had not quite made the grade major cartwright seemed to be of the latter type he looked at banks with open hostility the purple veins around his nose showing a clear predilection for early morning snifters what is it then he asked as if he had been interrupted in the midst of planning a new assault on the boers banks explained about the murder drawing only grunts and sharp nods and tried as delicately as he could to mention that the major had probably been the last person apart from the killer to see steadman alive when would that be cartwright asked saturday night about ten oclock the major stared at him with icy blue eyes and sipped his whisky who told you that it doesnt matter who told me major is it true i suppose it was that busybody of a neighbour eh silly old biddy did you see him and did you have an argument you cant be suggesting im not suggesting anything im just asking you a simple question the major swirled the whisky in his glass for a moment then answered all right what if i did you tell me nothing to tell really found him hanging about my daughter again and told him to sling his hook why did you react so violently its not right cartwright leaned forward in his chair a married man older than her what would you do its not healthy he slumped back again did you assume they were having an affair now hold on a minute young man hold your horses i never said anything like that look banks pressed on im not making any accusations or charges im asking you what you thought if you didnt think your daughter was likely to be involved in anything unsavoury then why did you practically kick steadman down the street shes exaggerating the old bag cartwright sniffed he tossed back the rest of his drink then got up and picked an old briar from the rack and filled it with twist from a pouch we had words yes but i never laid a finger or a toe on him anyway its a matter of principle isnt it a married man people talk banks found it hard to see the link between principle and the fear of gossip but he ignored the issue is that why you objected to a harmless relationship that both parties seemed to enjoy he asked instead did you behave the same way over all your daughters friendships dammit the man was married the major repeated he was married ten years ago when they first met but you didnt object then did you that was all in the open always someone else around young michael she was just a girl look if they want to meet they can do it openly cant they in a pub with other people there for example no reason to shut themselves up in private like that theyre a sharptongued lot in this village lad you dont know the half of it were you worried that theyd talk like they did about you and your daughter is that what you wanted to protect her from the major whitened and sagged in his chair all of a sudden his belligerence seemed to desert him and he looked his age he got up slowly and mixed himself another drink heard about that did you banks nodded you werent there he said in a sad bitter tone you cant know what it was like for the two of us after my wife died i couldnt look after myself had to go into hospital for a while had to send penny away to the ramsdens but she came back and cared for me self lessly god bless her shes an only child you know and then the vicious gossip started it only takes one to start the rumour just one rotten bastard then it spreads like the plague until everyones had enough of it and something better comes along and its just a game to them they dont even care whether its true or not it just titillates their imaginations thats all i blame them for driving her away they said it wasnt natural the two of us together after she left i sold the house and moved here i thought she left to start a career in music oh shed have gone eventually but she was too young she shouldnt have gone so soon then things wouldnt have turned out the way they did for her she seems well enough adjusted to me maybe a little sharp at the edges you didnt know her before lost a lot of her spirit her joy too young to be a cynic anyway she couldnt stand it here with people staring at her that way took a lot of courage for her to come back so you forgave her nothing to forgive really she thought shed let me down leaving me like that thered been rows fights yes but i never stopped loving her steadman wasnt a bad sort i know that a bit wet i always thought but not a bad sort i just wanted to spare her it all again shes bitter enough already but its not the first time ive had words with him ask anyone my argument with steadman wasnt new what happened on saturday night nothing really i told him not to call on her alone after dark again id told him before i suppose i just made things worse drawing attention to it what did you do afterwards when hed gone yes i stayed and talked to penny for an hour or so she was a bit upset with me but we settled things amicably enough can you remember what time you left i can remember the church bells ringing eleven it wasnt long after that and steadman left at ten that was when i arrived yes did you notice anyone hanging around the area no it was quiet always is up there there were a few people on high street but nothing unusual did steadman say where he was going did he give you any idea at all what he intended to do next major cartwright shook his head no he just left sorry i cant be of more help to you inspector never mind thanks for your time anyway major cartwright turned and walked over to the drinks cabinet leaving banks to make his own way back downstairs two with her head propped up on cushions sally lay in the back garden sunbathing in her pale blue bikini it was a luxury she felt entitled to as she had made temporary peace with her parents by breaking a date with kevin the previous evening in order to visit boring aunt madge in skipton there she had sipped tea from tiny fragile china cups with gilded rims and red roses painted on their sides and had answered politely all the dull and predictable questions about her schoolwork at least the television had been on aunt madge never turned it off so she had been able to halfwatch an old elizabeth taylor film while pretending to pay attention to the conversation which ranged from the shocking state of the neighbours garden to news of a distant cousins hysterectomy the odd thing was that her parents hadnt seemed to enjoy the evening much either her father hardly said a word they all seemed relieved when the goodbyes had been said and they could troop out to the car with a sigh sally put down wuthering heights and rolled over on to her stomach her skin was already glowing pleasantly and even with the lotion she would have to be careful how long she spent outside she was puzzled and frustrated by the book in the film even the old black and white version with laurence olivier heathcliff had seemed so sexy and tragic she remembered sharing tissues with her mother while they watched it on television and her father had laughed at them but the book was different not the story that was basically the same but the character of heathcliff true he loved catherine passionately but in the book he was so much more cruel and violent he seemed to want to destroy everyone around him and worse he was even more interested in getting his hands on the house and property that was the real reason he married isabella though he did appear to be taking revenge for edgar marrying catherine and an obsession with acquiring property was hardly romantic he acted more like a demented and much more handsome teddy hackett than a true heroic figure she reached for her glass of perrier it was warm the ice had all melted and the sparkle had vanished pulling a face she rolled on to her back again and started thinking rather despondently about her sleuthing there wasnt much to think about she had no idea who the police suspected what clues they had what they knew about motives and opportunities all she had to go on was what anyone in the village would know about steadman that he seemed fond of penny cartwright much to her fathers chagrin that he worked a lot with michael ramsden that he had been able to help the ramsden family by buying the house when the father died that he was generally well liked that he drank in the bridge with jack barker teddy hackett and dr barnes he just didnt seem the type to go around inflaming peoples passions like heathcliff but he must have done somebody had killed him it had to be a man of that sally was sure steadman had been quite tall and must have weighed a bit no woman could have manoeuvred his body over the wall and all that way up the field but that still left too many suspects if only she had had the foresight to watch from the shelter that night sally began to apply her imagination to the facts everyone knew that michael ramsden had once courted penny cartwright what if he was still carrying a torch for her like heathcliff for catherine and was jealous of steadmans attentions but she remembered seeing ramsden and avoiding him that evening she went drinking in leeds with kevin he had been with a goodlooking woman and though sally had only got a fleeting glance while pulling kevin quickly back out through the door before they were seen she knew it wasnt penny and hed hardly be going out with someone else if he was still in love with her there was jack barker at first she hadnt suspected him but now she could see him acting in the heat of passion shed noticed how often hed been out walking with penny around the village lately and wondered if barker might have seen steadman as an obstacle he wrote detective stories after all so he must know all about murder even though he was a gentleman he would hardly stand there with the gun smoking in his hand and wait for the police to come surely he would try and get rid of the body so he could remain free and win pennys love she wondered if he had an alibi and if there was any way of finding out and then there was hackett no love interest there of course but shed heard rumours of arguments over property people certainly seemed to get all steamed up about such things in wuthering heights she reached out for her suntan lotion one more coat another hour or so then shed go in as far as catching the murderer was concerned all she could do was try to remember all shed seen and heard in the village since the steadmans came to gratly eighteen months ago maybe there was something shed overlooked a word or gesture that had meant nothing or made no sense at the time but took on more significance in the light of the murder she had a good visual memory it probably came from watching so many films so she could review facial expressions and body language maybe something would click if she worked at it the oil felt good as she massaged it slowly into her stomach and thighs and she wished kevins hands were rubbing it on her flushed skin a bee droned around the neck of the open bottle then floated away sally picked up her book again leaving oily fingerprints on the pages three the two men walked slowly along helmthorpe high street deep in conversation banks had one hand in his trouser pocket and the other held a light sports jacket slung casually over his shoulder the sleeves of his white shirt were rolled up above the elbows and he had loosened his tie enough to allow him to open his top button banks hated ties and wearing them loosely was his way of compromising he walked with his head bowed listening to hatchley who towered beside him the sergeant had both hands clasped behind his back and his head was tilted back on his thick neck as if he were examining the rooftops a well cultivated beer belly hung over his tight belt the weather was still undecided and the sun popped in and out between quickmoving clouds that raced over on the wind and cast their shadows across the bright face of crow scar said he was in a bit of a state hatchley went on shook up like downed a quick double scotch and went on his way the scrap of information constable weaver had been so eager to impart was that the barman of the dog and gun had told him steadman had dropped in just after ten oclock on saturday night he hadnt come forward earlier because he had been away fishing in scotland and hadnt even heard about the murder i can tell you the reason for that banks said and proceeded to tell hatchley about his interview with major cartwright this took some of the wind out of the sergeants sails and he muttered a surly no when banks asked him if there had been any other developments hatchley began to smile again however as soon as he sniffed the beer fumes and tobacco smoke in the bridge they sat at the same scarred table as they had on their previous visit and soon had two pints of theakstons bitter before them and two steak and mushroom pies on order steadman could have gone back to the cottage though couldnt he hatchley said maybe he came to the boil when he thought about how hed let the major walk all over him so he went back to settle things we cant rule him out yet or the girl no we cant steadman could have waited for the coast to clear and gone back to finish what he and penny had started before they were interrupted the majors certainly very protective towards her from what i hear hatchley said with relish she always was a bit of a wild un running off to london hanging about with those freaks and musicians there were probably drugs involved too and i doubt she was very careful about who she hopped in and out of bed with i think if she were a daughter of mine id keep her on a short leash after that but the womans twentysix years old besides steadman was a safe enough companion wasnt he hatchley shrugged as far as we know he was but there could be more to it oh theres more to it all right theres always more to things like this as far as penny cartwrights concerned there are two points in her favour first the old woman didnt hear anyone else call at the cottage later and she says penny didnt go out either and second i doubt that she was strong enough to drag the body to its hiding place banks was about to add that he had also been convinced by pennys genuine display of affection for steadman but he knew it wasnt the kind of evidence sergeant hatchley would appreciate besides the spell of her presence had worn off and he was beginning to wonder if she was not just a consummate actress still he went on she could have had help with the body and there is a back door so the old woman might not have heard if she was in the front room do you think the cartwright girl really was having it off with steadman then hatchley asked i dont know you can never tell about things like that sometimes couples can be having affairs for years and nobody knows why else would he be hanging around her there is such a thing as friendship you know in a pigs eye hatchley muttered the pies came and the two men ate silently until their plates were empty steadman had a lot of money banks said reaching for his second pint and his wife stands to inherit id say that was a pretty good motive wouldnt you but we know she couldnt have done it hatchley objected i mean why complicate something thats difficult enough already she could have hired someone but helmthorpe isnt new york or london doesnt matter i once knew of a chap in blackpool who had a price list arms fifty quid legs seventyfive and so on mind you his rates have probably gone up a bit with inflation now its naive to think that kind of thing is restricted to the south and you should bloody well know that as well as anyone are you telling me theres no one in eastvale would take a job like that what about eddie cockley for one or jimmy spinks hed slit his own mothers throat for the price of a pint aye said hatchley but how would a woman like mrs steadman get mixed up with the likes of cockley and spinks i admit its unlikely but hardly more than anything else in this bloody business put it this way we dont know much about the steadmans marriage it seemed ordinary enough on the surface but what did she think about him and penny cartwright for example maybe she was mad with jealousy we just dont know and even if we ask them theyll lie for some reason theyre all protecting one another perhaps they suspect each other i wouldnt be surprised hatchley guzzled his pint you know what the trouble with this case is sergeant banks went on everyone except major cartwright seems to think the sun shone out of steadmans arse hatchley grinned they drained their glasses and set off to see hackett four teddy hackett sat in his office part of an old mill that looked out on the river swain behind the garage the window was open and scents of flowers floated in with the sound of water rushing over pebbles occasionally a bee strayed from the clematis that clung to the stone wall buzzed into the room and finding nothing of interest in human affairs meandered out again hackett was nervous and sweaty right from the start he sat behind the defence of his cluttered desk back to the window and toyed with a letter opener as banks faced him from a chair hatchley leaned against the wall by the window banks filled his pipe got it going then brought up the subject of hacketts false alibi from what weve been able to discover you arrived at the kitkat klub alone and after one oclock a little later than you said hackett squirmed im not very good at times always late for appointments thats me banks smiled thats not a very good habit for a businessman is it still thats no concern of mine what i want to know is what you were doing before then i told you hackett said slapping his palm with the letter opener i went to a pub and had a couple of drinks but closing time on saturday is eleven oclock mr hackett even on the most liberal of premises youd be out in the street by eleven thirty what did you do between eleven thirty and one oclock hackett shifted his weight from cheek to cheek and rubbed his chin look i dont want to get anyone into trouble know what i mean but when you get pally with the bar staff you can sometimes get in an extra drink or two especially when the local coppers there too he winked i mean if young weaver ever wanted to i dont want to hear about constable weaver banks cut in i want to hear about you and im getting impatient what youre saying is that the publican broke the licensing laws by serving you after hours as late as one oclock is that what happened i wouldnt put it quite like that it was more in the nature of a drink or two together privacy of his own home like theres no law says a man cant have a mate in for a drink whenever he wants is there no not at all banks answered lets say you werent breaking any laws then if you were so pally with the manager youll remember the name of the pub wont you i thought i told you already didnt i banks shook his head i thought i did i meant to it was the cock and bull on arthur street near the club hackett put down his letter opener and lit a cigarette taking deep noisy drags no it wasnt said banks it wasnt the cock and bull on arthur street the manager says he knows you right enough and that youd been in on friday but not saturday where were you mr hackett hackett looked crestfallen he must have been mistaken got a bad memory old joey im sure if you ask him again jog his memory a bit hell remember hell tell you its true i was there come off it man tell us where you were hatchleys loud voice boomed out from behind hackett unnerving him completely during the preliminary part of the interrogation the sergeant had remained so quiet that hackett must have forgotten he was in the room now he halfturned and looked terrified to find a new more aggressive adversary towering over him he got to his feet but hackett still had the advantage of height i dont know what youre getting at were not getting at anything hatchley said were telling you loud and clear you never went to the cock and bull did you that was just a cock and bull story wasnt it you never went to any pub in darlington you waited for steadman outside the bridge followed him to penny cartwrights waited there then followed him to the dog and gun and back to the car park there where it was dark and quiet you hit him on the head and hid him in the boot of your car later when the whole village was asleep you dumped him in the field on your way over the dale to darlington didnt you the timings just right hackett weve checked what with all the lies youve told us and the traces well find in the boot of your car weve got you by the short and curlies mate hackett turned to banks for sympathy and support you cant let him bully me accuse me like this he spluttered its not not cricket said banks but you must admit mr hackett it is a possibility isnt it a very strong possibility hackett flopped back down into the chair behind his desk and hatchley walked over to stand in front of him look sir the sergeant began softly we know you didnt arrive at the club until after one oclock and that gives you plenty of time to dump steadmans body and get there dont you think it would be easier all round if you told us what happened perhaps it was manslaughter perhaps you had an argument and came to blows you didnt mean to kill him is that how it happened hackett stared at him wary of his apparent friendliness banks got up and walked over to the window through which he appeared to be gazing at the river i walked around hackett said thats all i set off for darlington as soon as id left the bridge and got changed then i stopped on the way it was a lovely evening i didnt feel like a drink just then so i went for a walk i wanted to be alone you and bloody greta garbo banks snarled from behind him turning quickly from the window and knocking his pipe out in the thick glass ashtray im fast losing patience with you he rushed on raising his voice and glaring it was a measure of hacketts terror and confusion that he now looked to the huge hatchley as a benign presence but i shut up banks ordered him i dont want to hear any more lies from you hackett get it if im not satisfied your next storys true ill have you in eastvale nick before your feet touch the ground understand hatchley enjoying himself tremendously played the role of kindly uncle best do as the chief inspector asks sir he advised the pale hackett im sure it cant do any harm if youve nothing to hide hackett stared at hatchley for a good halfminute then came that visible relaxation of tension the moment that signalled the truth banks could feel it in his veins he recognized it well from years of experience hackett was still so mixed up that he glowered at hatchley and directed his statement toward banks who smiled and nodded at various points with benevolent understanding all in all it was a great disappointment but it did get one red herring out of the way after leaving the bridge hackett had gone home to shower and change then he had driven to darlington where he first spent about two hours of uninhibited carnal bliss with a young married woman whose husband worked the night shift at the local colliery after that he had gone on to the kitkat klub alone because he didnt want to be seen with her locally people would talk banks finally extracted her name and address from him along with pleas and warnings about not letting her musclebound husband find out please he begged if you must talk to betty do it after ten at night ill get her to come in thatll be even better wont it if you dont mind mr hackett banks replied well do it our way have a heart chief inspector havent you ever had a bit on the side the muscles in bankss jaw tightened no he answered sharply and even if i had it wouldnt make a jot of difference to your situation he put his hands on the desk and leaned forward so that his face was only inches from hacketts what you dont seem to realize is that this is a murder investigation a friend of yours has been murdered or dont you remember and all youre concerned with is some bloody tart youve been poking in darlington shes not a tart and theres no reason to ruin a perfectly good marriage is there thats what youll be doing you know no thats what youve done its what shes done too if i thought for a moment that you cared more about the marriage than about your own skin i might just consider doing things differently banks nodded to hatchley and the two of them left hackett biting his fingernails and cursing the day he met nubile little betty fields in the cock and bull fancy a trip to darlington sergeant banks asked when they reached high street best if you check it out yourself yes sir hatchley replied grinning right then after ten oclock tonight if you can make it what but if you dont mind its not that i mind ive got a couple of mates up there ive not seen in a while but what about hackett simple really hacketts right i dont see any point putting unnecessary strain on a marriage even one as flimsy as betty fieldss but he doesnt know that does he by the next time he hears from his young lady hell be a gibbering wreck some of these miners are big chaps so ive heard he smiled as comprehension dawned on hatchley you have to balance your cruelty with compassion sergeant come on just one more visit to make then home and by the way yes sir that was a terrible pun back there cock and bull story oh i thought it was quite good myself taking advantage of the fine weather banks and hatchley walked to gratly they took the short cut through the cemetery and along a narrow path through a field lynchets led down to the beck like a broad flight of green velvet stairs sheep grazed under a clump of ash trees in the lush green grass by the water this time banks was struck by the tranquillity and individuality of gratly at the centre of the hamlet was a low stone bridge under which a broad stream ran over several abrupt terraces and descended in a series of small waterfalls past a disused mill and down the valley side to the allconsuming swain gratly itself radiated like a cross from this central point and ginnels and snickets here and there led to twisting backstreets and hidden outhouses the houses were all old built of local stone but their designs varied some originally weavers cottages had many windows in their upper stories while others looked like old farmhouses or labourers quarters the sun on the light stone and the steady music of water as it trickled relaxed banks and he found himself thinking that this was no day and no place for his kind of business the hamlet was silent and still there were no signs of life at all emma steadman wearing a brown apron over her shirt and slacks answered the door at the second ring and invited them inside apologizing for the mess she stopped at the entrance to the front room and ushered the two men in running a grimy hand over her moist brow banks saw immediately what she meant all steadmans books had been taken down from the shelves and stood in untidy precariously balanced piles on the floor the widow moved forlornly into the middle of the room and gestured around theyre all his i cant stand it having them all over the place i dont know what to do with them she seemed less frosty than when they had parted on monday afternoon vulnerable among the detritus of a shared life theres a book dealer in eastvale banks advised her im sure hell come out and appraise them if you give him a call hell give you a fair price or what about thadtwistle in helmthorpe yes thats an idea thank you mrs steadman sat down itll have to wait though im afraid i cant face that kind of thing yet i dont know what ill do with all his things i never realized hed collected so much junk i wish i could just get up and leave gratly go somewhere else youll not be staying here asked hatchley she shook her head no sergeant i dont think so theres nothing for me here it was harolds work really his place where will you go i havent really thought a city i suppose maybe london she looked at banks i shouldnt worry about it yet he said you need a bit of time itll all get taken care of silence followed mrs steadman offered to make a cup of tea but banks much to hatchleys distress refused for them both no thanks its just a flying visit we were in the area she raised her eyebrows hinting that he should get to the point its about penny cartwright banks began noting that her expression didnt alter a jot at the mention of the name i gather that she and your husband were rather close didnt that bother you at all what do you mean bother me well banks went on cautiously shes an attractive woman people talk people have talked about her before werent you worried that your husband might have been having an affair with her it was immediately clear that the suggestion surprised rather than annoyed emma steadman as if it were something she had never even thought of but theyd been friends for years she answered ever since she was a teenager when we first came up here for our holidays i dont i mean i never really thought of her as anything else really a teenager more like a daughter than a rival banks felt that it was shortsighted in the extreme to look upon a woman only twelve or thirteen years ones junior as a child especially if that woman was over the age of sixteen it didnt bother you at all then he went on it never caused any trouble any jealousy not on my part it didnt no as i said chief inspector shes been a friend of the family for years i suppose you know that she and michael ramsden used to go out together ages ago he brought her up here quite often after all it was his home then we were only summer visitors i think she had a lot in common with harry she looked up to him as a teacher a man of knowledge so did michael for that matter im sorry im afraid i cant really see what youre getting at i simply wondered whether you suspected your husband of having an affair with penny cartwright no i didnt first you cast doubts on my marriage now you accuse my husband of adultery whats going on what is all this about banks held up his hand wait a minute im not making any accusations im asking questions its my job thats what you said last time she said it didnt make me feel any better then either dont you realize theyre burying my husband tomorrow yes i do and im sorry but if you want us to carry out a thorough investigation into his death youve got to be prepared for some awkward questions we dont find the truth by skating over the surface or by skirting difficult patches mrs steadman sighed i understand that its just so soon did you see much of penny after she left helmthorpe banks asked not much no sometimes if we were in the same place london say wed have dinner together but you could count the times on the fingers of one hand what did she seem like during that period like herself she never seemed depressed on drugs strung out not when we saw her how well did your husband know jack barker jack id say they were fairly close as close as harry could be to someone who didnt share his enthusiasms how long had barker been living in gratly i dont really know before us three or four years how long had your husband known him they got to know each other over the past eighteen months wed met before on our visits here but it wasnt till we moved in that harold really spent much time with the locals where did barker come from hes from cheadle in cheshire but i think he lived in london for a while and neither your nor your husband knew him when you first visited gratly no i dont think anyone in helmthorpe or gratly did why this fascination with the past chief inspector banks frowned im not really sure mrs steadman im just trying to get a sense of the pattern of relationships exits and entrances and thats why you were asking me about harry and penny partly yes major cartwright didnt seem too pleased about their friendship mrs steadman made a sound halfway between a sneeze and a guffaw the major everybody knows hes a crackpot mad as a march hare shes all hes got you know and she did desert him for a long time you know about the rumours who doesnt but i dont think youll find anyone who takes them seriously these days forgiven and forgotten something like that people tire easily surely you dont think the major banks didnt answer you policemen have such wild imaginations emma steadman went on what do you think happened do you think the major found out about this mythical affair and killed harry to protect his daughters virtue or do you think i did it in a jealous rage you couldnt have done it could you you were watching television with your neighbour at the time we dont rely entirely on imagination mrs steadman i know its a difficult period for you right now and i apologize if i seem to be pestering you but im simply trying to build up as complete a picture as i can of your husband and his circle this is a difficult and vital time for us too memories fade and stories change with every hour that goes by as yet i dont know whats important and what isnt im sorry for mocking you mrs steadman apologized i know you have your job to do but it is upsetting you coming around talking about harold having affairs and suggesting our marriage was in trouble you must try and see it from my point of view its almost as if youre accusing me she paused and smiled weakly he just wasnt that kind of man and if youd known him youd see what i mean if theres anything harry was having an affair with it was his work in fact sometimes i thought he was married to his work and having an affair with me she said this with good humour not in bitterness and banks laughed politely im sure my wife thinks the same he said then called to hatchley who had turned to browse through the decimated bookshelves i wont trouble you any further banks said at the door but there is one small piece of information you might be able to help me with yes your husband taught at leeds in the history department am i right she nodded yes that was his field who were his colleagues who did he spend most time with during your years there she thought for a moment before replying we didnt socialize a great deal harry was too intent on his career but let me see there was tom darnley he was a fairly close friend and godfrey talbot i think he knew harry at cambridge too thats about all except for geoffrey baynes but he went off to teach in winnipeg in canada before harry left thats all i can think of thank you mrs steadman banks said as the door closed slowly thatll do fine for a start see you tomorrow they walked back the same way to the car which was hot from standing in the sun most of the day and drove back to eastvale banks regretted not having the cortina the landscape inspired him to listen to music instead hatchley drove too fast and droned on about never having seen so many bloody books outside gristhorpes office funny woman that mrs steadman dont you think he asked finally yes banks answered staring at a pattern of six trees on a distant drumlin all bent in the same direction she makes me uncomfortable ive got to admit i cant quite make her out one had an adventurous fellwalker found himself on top of crow scar at eleven oclock that thursday morning he would have seen to the south what looked like two shiny black beetles followed by green and red aphids make their way slowly down gratly hill and turn right at the bottom into helmthorpe village pedestrians on high street locals and tourists alike stopped as the funeral cortege crawled by some averted their gaze others doffed their caps and one or two clearly visitors from afar even crossed themselves harold steadman had been a believer because belief was for him inextricable from the men and the actions that had helped shape and mould the area he loved therefore the funeral was a traditional if nowadays rare graveside ceremony conducted by a visiting minister from lyndgarth on the hottest day of the year thus far the motley group stood uneasily around the grave as the reverend sidney caxton recited the traditional words in the midst of life we are in death of whom may we seek succour but thee o lord thou knowest lord the secrets of our hearts shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer but spare us lord most holy he followed this at mrs steadmans request with the twentythird psalm the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside still waters yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever it was a sombre and eerily appropriate farewell for a man like harold steadman to sally lumb representing eastvale comprehensive school along with hazel kathy anne and mr buxton the headmaster it was a gloomy and uncomfortable affair indeed for one thing in the tasteful navyblue outfit her mother had made her wear she was far too hot her blouse was absolutely stuck to her back and the beads of sweat that occasionally ran down her spine tickled like spiders reverend caxton took a handful of earth and cast it down on the coffin for as much as it hath pleased almighty god of his great mercy to receive unto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed we therefore commit his body to the ground to pass the time sally studied the others covertly penny cartwright was the most striking dressed in black from head to foot her pale face in stark contrast she wore just enough makeup to hide the bags under her eyes from all but the most discerning of onlookers and to highlight her tragic romantic cheekbones she really did look extraordinarily beautiful sally thought but in an intense frightening and overwhelming way on the other hand emma steadman in a conservative unfashionable charcoalgrey suit didnt look much she could have done herself up a bit at least for the funeral sally thought mentally adding a touch of blusher eyeliner and a slash of lipstick immediately though she felt ashamed of herself for thinking such worldly thoughts at a time like this after all mrs steadman had always been nice to her earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our lord jesus christ who shall change our mortal body between the two grieving women stood michael ramsden who looked to sally rather like one of those doomed tubercular young men in the black and white gothic films her mother liked to watch on channel four at pennys other side was jack barker in a dark suit with a black armband he really did look dashing and dangerous that errol flynn moustache the glint in his eyes and sally lost herself for a few moments in a swashbuckling fantasy the policeman banks didnt detain her for long true he was handsome in a lean and bony kind of way and the scar was mysterious but she had seen his true colours and found them lacking he was soft he had lived in london had adventure all around him countless opportunities for heroism and he had given it all up to retire to this godforsaken part of the country old before his time obviously dr barnes looked as grey and insignificant as ever and teddy hackett wore an ostentatious gold medallion which glinted in the sun against the background of his black shirt whenever he shifted from foot to foot that it may be like unto his glorious body according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself when sally turned her attention back to the ceremony it was all over slowly as if reluctant to leave the deceased once and for all the mourners edged away penny and emma had their handkerchiefs out and each hung on to the arm of the nearest man in pennys case that was jack barker and sally noticed what an attractive couple they made the others left in groups of two or three and the policeman sidled away alone harold steadman lowered to rest had become a part in death of the dale he had loved so much in life two at one oclock after having spent an hour discussing their lack of progress with constable weaver in the helmthorpe station banks sat alone at a white table in the back garden of the dog and gun sipping a pint of shandy the tables around him were all full tourists chatted about their holidays the weather their jobs or lack of them and children buzzed around unhindered like the wasps that flitted from glass rims to the remains of gateaux and sticky buns left on paper plates banks didnt mind the squealing and the chatter he was always able to shut out distracting background noise when he wanted to he sat in his shirtsleeves and fiddled with his pipe dark suit jacket slung over the back of a chair the pipe was a blasted nuisance it kept going out or getting clogged up and the bitter juices trickled down the stem on to his tongue it suited him though it was a gesture towards establishing the kind of identity and image he wanted to develop and project a wasp droned on to his sleeve he brushed it away across the dazzling river with its overgrown banks the local club was playing cricket on a field of freshly mown grass the slow pace of the game made it look like a renaissance pavane the harmony of white against green the sharp crack of willow against leather and the occasional smatterings of applause seemed to blend with the scent of the grass and enhance the sensation of peace he rarely went to matches these days and if he did got bored after a few overs but he remembered the famous england cricketers of his school days ted dexter fiery fred trueman ken barrington colin cowdrey and the classroom games he had played with dice and paper running his own county championship and test match series the cliches about cricket were true he reflected there was something about the game that was essentially english it made one feel that god was in his heaven and all was well with the empire far from it though he realized with a jolt beyond the pitch the valley side sloped up gently at first veined with drystone walls then steepened and peaked into the long sheer curve of limestone crow scar above which banks actually fancied he could see crows wheeling and about halfway between the pitch and the scar as far as the eyes imperfect perspective could make out was the spot where steadmans body had been found banks didnt like funerals and in a way it seemed a pointless convention to attend the funerals of people he had never known not once had he caught a murderer that way no graveside confessions no mysterious stranger lurking behind the yew trees still he did it and when he probed his motives he found that it was because of a strange and unique bond he felt with the dead man perhaps more intimate even than if he had known him in a sense banks saw himself as the victims appointed avenger and in an odd way he worked together with the dead man to redress the balance of nature they were coworkers of light against darkness in this case steadman was his guide from the spiritworld a silent and shapeless guide perhaps but present nonetheless banks looked back at the game just in time to see the batsman swipe a badly paced offspinner towards the boundary the bowler found his length in the next two deliveries though and play slowed down as the batsman was forced to switch to defensive tactics banks aided by the warm air drifted back into a reverie about his first year and a half in yorkshire the landscape it went without saying he found beautiful it was wild and rough unlike the southern downs but its scale inspired awe and the people whatever he had heard about the stubborn intractability of the yorkshire character the gruffness the slowness in taking to strangers was all true to some extent but like all generalizations didnt do justice to the full reality he had grown to appreciate the stoic humour the quick wit and instinctive good sense the friendliness beneath the crusty surface banks also liked the feeling of being an outsider not a stranger as he had been among the anonymous international crowds of london but an outsider he knew he always would be no matter how deep he put his roots knocking out his pipe he tried to bring his mind to bear on the case again it had the same sordid elements as any murder but in such an environment it seemed even more of a blasphemy the whole way of life in the small dale the people their priorities beliefs and concerns was different from that in london or even in eastvale gristhorpe had said that being an outsider would give him an advantage a fresh perspective but banks wasnt too sure he seemed to be getting nowhere fast he turned as a long shadow brushed across the white table and saw michael ramsden disappearing into the pub mr ramsden he called after him a word if youve got a moment to spare ramsden turned chief inspector banks i didnt see you there banks thought he was lying but it meant nothing as a policeman he was used to being avoided ramsden perched on the very edge of a chair indicating through his body language that he had no intention of staying for more than a minute or two i thought youd be at the funeral lunch banks said i was you know what those things are like all that false humour and bonhomie to cover up whats really happened and someone inevitably drinks too much and get silly he shrugged i left was there something you wanted to ask me yes are you certain you didnt go out on saturday night of course im certain ive already told you i know but i want to make absolutely sure not even for half an hour or so youve seen where i live where would i go banks smiled a walk a run ive heard that writers get blocked sometimes ramsden laughed thats true enough but no not me not on saturday anyway i was in all evening besides harry had a key he would have let himself in and waited had he done that before once yes when i had to work late at the office he wouldnt say visit another friend in the area and come back later i dont think harry really knew anyone else in the york area not well enough to drop in on at least why do you want to know all this if you dont mind me asking we need to know where mr steadman was between ten fifteen and the time of death but theres something else banks went on quickly sensing ramsdens restlessness id like to talk to you a bit more about the past your relationship with penny cartwright ramsden sighed and made himself more comfortable a whitecoated waiter passed by drink banks asked might as well if you intend to keep me here a while but its all so long ago i dont see how you expect me to remember and i cant imagine what any of it has to do with harrys death banks ordered two pints of lager just bear with me thats all ten years ago he went on was a very important time in your life it was summer and you were eighteen all set for university courting the prettiest girl in swainsdale harold and emma steadman came to stay at your parents guest house for a month as usual by all accounts that was a memorable summer long walks expeditions to local sites of interest surely you remember ramsden smiled yes of course i do now you put it like that i just hadnt realized it was so long ago he said wistfully time does seem to pass quickly banks agreed especially when you lose your sense of continuity then look back anyway it came to an end things changed what happened between you and penny ramsden sipped his lager and brushed away a troublesome wasp ive told you before like most teenage lovers we just drifted apart did you ever regret it what the turn of events perhaps you could have been happily married to penny now and none of this would ever have happened none of what i fail to see the connection everything pennys adventures in the music business your bachelorhood ramsden laughed you make it sound like a disease chief inspector i may be a bachelor but that doesnt mean i live a celibate life i have lovers a social life i enjoy myself as for penny well its her life whos to say things havent turned out for the best for her too banks tried to coax his pipe alight a baby in a high chair two tables away started to cry its cheeks were smeared with strawberry jam perhaps if steadman hadnt come along though and spirited her away what are you suggesting that harry and penny were involved well he was older more mature you have to admit its a possibility she certainly spent a lot of time with him isnt that why you split up didnt you argue about steadman ramsden was on the edge of his seat again no we didnt he said angrily look i dont know whos been telling you all this but its lies did you split up because penny wouldnt give you what you wanted maybe she was giving it to steadman this time ramsden seemed on the point of getting up and hitting banks but he took a deep breath scratched the back of his ear and smiled you know you really are irritating he said i should imagine people tell you things just to make you go away sometimes banks admitted go on maybe theres some truth in the first part of your question a man can only wait so long as you probably know yourself i was definitely ready and penny was a very beautiful girl its only natural isnt it we were both a bit naive scared of sex but it didnt help that she kept saying no banks laughed it certainly wouldnt he said knowingly i dare say id have been climbing the walls myself but why do you think she kept saying no was it something to do with steadman or did she have another boyfriend ramsden thought frowning before he answered no there wasnt another boyfriend im sure of that i think it was just a matter of morality penny was brought up to be a nice girl and nice girls dont as for harry i dont think he did what youre suggesting im sure id have known somehow i suppose at times i was a bit peeved about how close they were not that i thought there was anything going on mind but they did spend a lot of time together time she could have spent with me harry was so much more sure of himself than i was i was shy and clumsy so yes i might have been a bit envious but i didnt feel the kind of jealousy you have in mind oh what kind of jealousy do i have in mind you know the kind that eats away at you and ends in murder he answered deepening his voice for dramatic effect banks laughed ramsden had nearly finished his drink and looked anxious to leave but there were a couple more areas banks wanted to probe what about her father the major do you think he had anything to do with you two drifting apart i dont think so no as far as i know he approved of me hes a bit cracked but he never really gave us any trouble did you ever get together with penny again later you were both in london at times werent you i suppose so but i never saw her once it was over that was it what did you do while she was off with steadman it wasnt the way you make it sound chief inspector often we all went together sometimes i just didnt want to go with them i read a lot id just discovered the pleasures of literature my sixthform english teacher mr nixon was a brilliant inspiring man and he managed to undo in one year all the damage that the others had done for the first time i could enjoy shakespeare eliot lawrence keats and the rest with a joy id not known before what im saying is that i was a very romantic and introspective young man i was happy enough to sit by a babbling brook and read wordsworth when you werent trying to get penny into bed said banks who had once on gristhorpes recommendation tried wordsworth and found him an insufferable bore ramsden blushed yes well i was a normal adolescent i dont deny that he looked at his watch look i dont mean to seem rude but i do have to get back to the office tell me before i go why this fascination with past events im not really sure banks said reaching for his glass im just following my instincts and what do your instincts tell you that harold steadmans death wasnt a spurofthemoment affair it was premeditated and it probably had its roots in the past you see you were all together ten years ago you penny cartwright her father the steadmans and now youre all back in more or less the same place eighteen months after steadman comes to live in gratly hes dead doesnt that strike you as odd ramsden brushed back his forelock which this time actually had slipped over his eyes then he drained his glass and stood up put that way i suppose it does he said but i think your instinct is wrong things arent the same as they were before for one thing there are other people around now too if you think harrys death had anything to do with penny i suggest you follow your instinct to jack barker hes been hanging around with her a lot lately so i hear now good day chief inspector and thanks for the drink banks watched ramsden thread his way between the tables and turned his attention back to the cricket match just in time to see a wicket fall dramatically the bails flew high in the air and the bowler threw up his arms and yelled owzat banks thought about his talk with ramsden and wondered if there was anything in what hed said about barker men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love so his daughter tracy playing the fair rosalind had said in as you like it which had been eastvale comprehensives school play that term but it wasnt true many had killed and many had died for love and penny cartwright was certainly the kind of woman to stir up such strong feelings suddenly the air roared and screamed as two fs from a nearby us airbase shot overhead they flew so low that banks could almost see the pilots faces it was a common enough occurrence in the dales jet bombers frequently ripped through the peaceful landscape and shattered the idyll as they broke the sound barrier on the hillside below crow scar scared sheep huddled together and ran for the cover of a drystone wall people at the tables put their hands over their ears and screwed up their faces the planes broke the spell for banks there was paperwork to be done that afternoon grabbing his jacket he drained his glass and left the cricketers to finish their game three dinner in the banks household that evening was a lively affair it seemed like ages since the family had all sat down together and enjoyed one of sandras delicious concoctions chicken in tarragon and whitewine sauce she had a wonderful knack of making the most inexpensive cuts of meat taste like gourmet creations this skill banks thought was characteristic of someone with inborn good taste and a poor workingclass background all it took said sandra clearly delighted with the compliments was the right cooking method and a little care with the sauce most of the conversation was taken up by the childrens accounts of their day trip to york the minster was smashing enthused tracy the bright fourteenyearold with a passion for history do you know daddy theres more stained glass in there than in any other cathedral in europe banks expressed interest and surprise architecture had not so far been one of his interests but it was becoming more and more appealing at the moment he was still reading up on the geology of the dales and the five sisters are simply stunning tracy went on five sisters banks asked in a minster oh daddy tracy laughed you dont know anything do you the five sisters are lancet windows in the north transept theyre made of grisaille glass thirteenth century i think and the rose window it was boring cut in brian who all the while had been feeling left out just a lot of old statues of dead kings and stuff junk it was boring youre just a philistine tracy retorted pronouncing the word with both difficulty and authority ill bet you didnt even notice that monument to archbishop scrope scrope whos he banks asked while sympathizing with brian he didnt feel justified in cheating tracy out of her excitement she was at an age now when one of her great thrills was to educate her parents whom she thought dreadfully ignorant of the past that surrounded them very soon banks mused sadly all that would be forgotten at least for a few years and life would be all clothes pop music makeup hairstyles and boys he was a rebel tracy informed him henry the fourth had him executed in oh shut up with all them dates clever clogs brian burst out you think you know it all and before tracy could respond he turned to his father and launched into his own account we went on a boat down the river dad and she felt seasick he cast a look of pitying contempt at his sister and we passed this big chocolate factory me and some of the boys wanted to go on a tour but the teacher wouldnt let us she just wanted to show us history and stuff and all those silly old narrow streets the shambles tracy interrupted and stonegate and petergate anyway the chocolates would only have made you sick it didnt need chocolates to make you sick did it brian taunted her thats enough brian sandra cut in stop it both of you and so it went on brian sulked and tracy scowled at him until they both went upstairs to watch television while sandra cleared the table and banks helped her with the dishes finally still arguing they were packed off to bed and banks suggested a nightcap ive got a new job sandra said pouring the scotch well not really new just different banks asked what it was sandra worked as a dentists receptionist three mornings a week in eastvale mr maxwells going on holiday shutting up shop for three weeks and peggy matthews thats mr smedleys receptionist is off at the same time too not together i hope sandra laughed no fine bedfellows theyd make im sure maxwells going to the greek islands and peggys off to weymouth anyway apparently smedley asked if he could borrow me while the boss was away maxwell asked me and i said yes its all right isnt it i didnt think we had any plans yes its fine if you want to i cant really plan anything until this steadman business is settled good smedleys a real perfectionist so i hear especially when it comes to fitting caps and crowns matching the colours and all that they say hes one of the best in yorkshire you might get to meet the local gentry then who knows sandra laughed well peggy did say that mrs steadman goes there shes having some root canal work done shes a bit of a local celebrity now its amazing isnt it banks said the husband gets murdered and people suddenly line up to look at the wife as if she were bloody royalty its only natural though we all have some morbid curiosity not me look banks said we havent been out for a long time and theres supposed to be a good folk singer on in helmthorpe tomorrow do you fancy going changing the subject eh helmthorpe isnt that where the steadmans live yes this isnt work is it alan its not connected to the case cross my heart well just go and listen to some good folk music like weve done plenty of times before ask harriet and david along too if they can get a sitter its such short notice what about jenny fuller think she might like to come shes in france banks said dont you remember that winetasting tour took off as soon as term ended lucky her all right then ill call harriet as long as you promise its nothing to do with work i dont much fancy sitting there like a spare part while you grill some suspect scouts honour and im not sure i like what youre implying i dont grill people sandra smiled banks moved closer and put his arm around her you know he began ssshhh sandra put her finger to his lips lets go to bed whats wrong with the sofa banks asked and pulled her gently towards him four sally lumb was finding it difficult to get to sleep she had put aside wuthering heights because her eyes were getting tired but sleep just would not come first she thought of kevin she would have to give in soon or hed be off after someone more experienced he was right on the edge and she couldnt tease him for much longer she didnt want to anyway the last time theyd been together the day they saw penny cartwright she had let him put himself close to her sex she had felt his heat and hardness right at her very entrance and it made her tremble and go all wet just like it said in the books it had been cruel to stop him then she knew but they had no protection she didnt want to get pregnant there were ways around that though next time turning over and praying for sleep to come she started thinking about the implications of what she had remembered that afternoon not the car on saturday night that was nothing but something she hadnt fully perceived at the time that now had more sinister farreaching possibilities it was her first real clue and she had to decide what to do about it she wouldnt go to the police that was for certain a proper fool shed make of herself if she was wrong besides she was already determined to solve the affair herself perhaps she might even become a heroine and the police were fools anyway she could easily oneup them that man from london had treated her like a silly child and what had he done that was so wonderful given up an exciting metropolitan life for the boredom of swainsdale thats what hed done lord the man could have been working for scotland yard and so as her mind tossed and turned towards sleep the first step became clear if she was right then someone was in danger a warning had to be given she would arrange a secret meeting and maybe after that if her suspicions were proved correct she could go about setting a trap that thought worried her as she really would be making herself vulnerable but she could always rope kevin in he was a big strong lad and hed do anything for her as sally finally drifted into the dream world that usually puzzled and irritated her she could see the lights of london strung out before her like a diamond necklace why stop there the dream insisted and the images progressed built up from magazine photographs and television programmes vogue models sashayed down the champs elysees famous actresses stepped out of limousines under the neons of sunset strip and all the wellknown television personalities she had ever seen chatted over cocktails at a party in manhattan but soon it all faded and what she remembered in the morning was a rather absurd image of being in leeds a place she had visited several times on shopping expeditions with her mother in the dream it felt like a foreign city there were uniformed policemen all over the place and sally had to push her bicycle because she didnt have a licence at least not one that was valid in leeds she was there she vaguely remembered because she was searching for a bird a white one that had flown from her garden a vast dark expanse like a tilled field after rain she didnt know if the bird had been her pet her responsibility or just a wild creature she had taken a fancy to but it was important and she was there in an alien familiar city pushing her bicycle among the policemen looking for it five banks slipped finzis choral setting of intimations of immortality into the car stereo as he turned off the a at the wetherby roundabout and took the a to leeds it was eleven thirty on friday morning just five days after the discovery of steadmans body hatchley under the weather on thursday morning after his visit to darlington had checked hacketts alibi thoroughly and found that it held barnes too was out of the running though he was unmarried and had no one to confirm that he went straight home after visiting mrs gaskell his finances were in order and there had never been even the slightest hint of malpractice or wrongdoing of any kind during his twenty years as a doctor in helmthorpe in his office earlier that morning banks had completed the mass of paperwork he had started the day before transcripts of interviews maps and timetables of peoples movements lists of unasked or unanswered questions he had gone over the forensic evidence again but found nothing new constable weaver and his reinforcements were still asking questions around the village the campsite and outlying farms but the likelihood of their turning up new evidence after so long was fast diminishing the hushed choir entered repeating the opening theme there was a time when meadow grove and stream over the baritones solo line and banks forgot his frequently distasteful job for a few moments finzis music made wordsworths poem bearable the drive which he took slowly turned out to be quite pleasant once hed left the great north road and its neverending stream of lorries it was the quickest way the same route as he had taken on his last trip to leeds to interview a pawnbroker in connection with a series of robberies but that had been a grey rainy day in late october now it was summer and he drove through the kind of peaceful green countryside one so often finds close to large english cities banks puffed at his pipe as finzi played on not bothering to relight it after the second time it went out and soon found himself in the seacroft area he had to concentrate hard on directions the tower blocks all looked much the same and there were few landmarks to go by he came out finally through an underpass near the city centre and parked close to the town hall from there he could see the high white tower of the library building something gristhorpe had told him about that morning in his potted history of the city and its architecture banks had no fixed ideas about how to approach the academics he intended to play it by ear he had called earlier and arranged to have lunch with darnley and talbot in a pub near the university though term was officially over they still travelled to their offices almost every day to carry on with their research or simply to get out from under their wives feet darnley to whom banks had spoken seemed quite excited by the prospect of a chat with the police or so he had said in a rather detached way as if he were discussing the mating habits of lemurs banks still had an hour to kill so he decided to take gristhorpes advice and take a look at the town hall it was an impressive victorian edifice complete with fluted columns huge domed roof clock and a pair of lions guarding the entrance by the broad flight of stone steps the stone sandstone by the look of it seemed light and clean gristhorpe had told him it had been sandblasted a few years ago as few such structures had withstood a hundred years or more of industry without turning black banks admired the bulk of the place and the bold classical lines of its design he felt he could grasp just by looking some of the civic pride that had gone into its construction queen victoria herself had attended the grand opening she must have spent a lot of time opening buildings banks reflected he ventured inside past the statues of victoria and albert in the foyer and into the main hall which appeared to have been recently restored enormous pillars of what looked like marble streaked with pink green and blue were spaced along the walls and the ceiling was divided into brightly coloured square panels gilded around their edges mottoes and proverbs beloved of the pious victorians adorned the high places except the lord build the house they labour in vain that built it except the lord keep the city the watchman watcheth but in vain weave the truth with trust and labour omnia vincit at the end stood a majestic pipe organ banks glanced at his watch and walked out slowly his footsteps echoed in the silence yes it was impressive and he could begin to see what steadman found so fascinating about northern history but he also remembered hacketts outburst about false romanticized views of the past the wealthy city officials and merchants had gone to great trouble to make sure that queen victorias route avoided the more squalid areas of the city row upon row of overcrowded backtobacks with leaky roofs and damp walls where the nameless masses lived it was from their labours and in their name the name of civic pride that such glories as the town hall were built yet they were condemned to live in squalor and then accused of becoming animals there had even been one man a chemist according to gristhorpe who had perfumed the air outside his shop as the royal progress passed it all depended on what side you were on banks thought as to what your perspective was he consulted his pocket map and walked up between the town hall and the library carried on along caverley street past the civic hall a white building with twin pointed towers and colourful gardens then past the general infirmary and leeds polytechnic and into the outer reaches of the university campus finally he came to a quadrangle surrounded by modern officestyle buildings it was a long way from the dreaming spires of oxford and cambridge but leeds was supposed to be a redbrick university even if there were no red bricks in sight he found darnleys office in the history department with the help of an angular bespectacled secretary after a quick firm handshake darnley was ready for a pub lunch talbots going to meet us there he explained hes got a session with one of his doctoral students right now he led banks across a dirt path behind the building and on to a narrow cobbled street the pub was actually part of a hotel and it stood back from the road at the end of a short driveway as it was such a warm sunny day they sat at one of the outside tables darnley was a tall man about forty well built and fit he had a trace of a northern accent and did not seem at all the absentminded professor type that banks had expected his short brown hair was neatly combed and although his suit seemed half a size too big it was of good quality it had probably been a perfect fit when he bought it banks guessed but like many men of his age fearing heart attacks and other plagues of the sedentary life he had begun to exercise the two men sipped draught guinness squinting in the bright sun and banks laid his pipe tobacco and lighter on the table aha a pipesmoker i see darnley noted touch of the maigret eh thought of taking it up myself but its too much trouble wasted years trying to stop smoking cutting down switching to milder brands and in the end i found the only way to bloody well stop was cold turkey it cant have been as easy as you make it sound banks said stuffing his pipe with rubbed flake and tamping it gently no no it wasnt darnley laughed i had a few relapses but ive been playing a lot of squash and tennis lately and running a few miles each day youd be surprised how that kind of thing puts you off smoking youd never believe it but a year or so ago i was overweight drinking too much ugh doctors orders told me pointblank go on like you are doing and ill give you another ten years at most it was a tossup which would go first heart liver or lungs anyway he said if i shaped up the skys the limit well not in so many words but i got the point he watched banks light his pipe still he said i suppose you need props in your business false sense of security and all that banks smiled and admitted it helped he liked the look of curiosity and intelligence in darnleys eyes i hope you dont think you need it with me i mean im not a suspect am i he was smiling but the tension showed in the tight set of his lips not yet banks replied returning his gaze touche you mean if i start to put myself forward as one all offers are welcome i shouldnt worry about it banks assured him he was still trying to work out the best approach to this edgy intelligent man whose quick playful exterior no doubt masked a mind like a steel trap and covered up a complex perhaps even devious personality he decided to play along a little longer certain that the arrival of talbot would alter the lighthearted mood you might as well tell me where you were last saturday night though he asked darnley looked at him bright eyes twinkling but hard do you know chief inspector i have no alibi at all for last weekend i had a lot of work to do so i stayed in all saturday evening marking examination papers and reading a new account of the peterloo massacre of course my wife was at home too but i dont suppose she counts does she banks laughed i wouldnt know till i asked her would i youre a canny man as the scots say no i dont suppose you would why werent you at the funeral yesterday wasnt invited was i neither of us actually i didnt even know about it i only knew about harry because i read it in the yorkshire evening post youd lost touch sort of yes after a little more banter and a good draught of stout darnley seemed to relax more trying to establish the conversation as one between professionals banks asked the professor about his job i suppose you need props too it cant be easy standing up there alone in front of a hundred or so students and just talking for an hour put like that it does sound rather awful darnley conceded you get used to it of course but youre right theres always a bit of stage fright till you get going ive always got my notes to fall back on though no teacher worth his salt dries up in front of a class you can always waffle and students would never know the difference sometimes i think i could tell them that adolf hitler was one of the heroes of twentiethcentury politics and theyd just write it down without question but props yes one tends to find a position one is comfortable in funny thing that some people pace back and forth some hunch over the lectern and others sit on the edge of a desk and fold their arms one chap i knew always used to play with his keys while he was lecturing trouble was they were in his trouser pocket and the students all thought he was playing with himself they both laughed what about harry steadman banks asked casually darnley squinted harry was good he answered its true weve been out of touch and ive not seen much of him since he left but we were quite close at one time and i was sorry to hear about his death id say we were colleagues rather than friends if theres a difference he was exceptionally bright but i suppose you know that already ambitious yes but only in his field he genuinely believed in what he was doing teaching research breaking new ground he thought it all had some real value for society and believe me thats rare these days theres so much cynicism around in education especially as the government doesnt seem to set much store by us any more banks nodded its the same with crime youre fighting a losing battle or so it seems most of the time and thats no good for anyones professional pride but at least the government believes in your value pay rises recruitment modern equipment true banks agreed but its all long overdue he didnt want to get sidetracked into an argument especially as he had many objections to the way the government seemed to look upon the police as a private army of paid bully boys to pit against people with genuine grievances and a constitutional right to air them a copper with humanist socialist leanings would be a bit hard for darnley to take he thought besides he was a detective cid a paid thinker and he didnt have to go on crowd control bashing the bonces of the proletariat im envious darnley said thats all i just wish we could get a larger slice of the cake too academics are very big on pride as well believe me harry was a good lecturer and he always managed to stimulate enthusiasm among his students thats hard to do these days when youre in competition with television video games and god knows what stop me if im beginning to sound too much like a good reference for him but its true most of all he loved research real field work and thats why he left when he found himself with enough money to do as he pleased thats exactly what he did some chaps might have packed it all in and buggered off to the south of france for a life of idleness sin and luxury but not harry he was a dedicated man at this point they were joined by a smaller pudgy man bald except for a few wisps of grey hair above his ears he had a deeply ingrained frown in his broad brow and a tiny pursed mouth that gave him overall a surly and miserly look his cultured voice was surprisingly soft and banks wondered how he managed with a large room full of students he proved rather taciturn and after they had ordered roast beef sandwiches and another round of stout he simply sat and listened as banks and darnley went on talking i think ive got a fairly clear picture of mr steadmans professional life now banks said its something everyone seems to agree on bright dedicated obsessed even at this talbot tuttutted and when he spoke his voice was redolent of cambridge quadrangles effete dons and afternoon glasses of amontillado surely er chief inspector an obsession is something we might define as intrinsically unhealthy wouldnt you say i dont mean to nitpick over semantics of course but one must admit that the term has definite connotations of mental imbalance harold steadman was most certainly not unbalanced therefore he was not obsessed and all the time he talked he frowned as if the usage really upset him banks apologized i didnt mean to imply anything as drastic as that no i realize that theres a difference between dedication and obsession what id like to know is whether he found time for other pursuits social life for example did he mix go to parties drink talbot returned in moody silence to his drink perhaps to contemplate the exact oed definition of obsessed as if such eccentricities as social life were best left to the lower classes do you know godfrey darnley said cheerfully oblivious to his colleagues disdain the chief inspector might not be far wrong he turned to banks and winked yes harry liked a few drinks now and then and he went to the occasional faculty party but he was never really at ease socially especially when he was out of his element so to speak when there was nobody to talk to about his field he didnt care much for sports never watched television and he certainly wasnt a woman chaser do you mean he was uncomfortable in the presence of nonacademics oh no not that at all i didnt mean to give you that impression harry certainly wasnt an academic snob as a matter of fact he invited me up to gratly once shortly after hed moved and we spent a very pleasant evening in a dingy local with a thriller writer and some other chaps no harry would talk to anybody that was one of his beefs against academic life the rampant intellectual snobbery what i mean is that his heart was in his work and his work was basically to do with people so he enjoyed their company theres a strong human element in his field you know its not all abstract he was interested in ordinary people their background and ways of life i suppose you know that his main fields were industrial archaeology and the roman occupation but he also loved folk music local lore things like that he was fascinated by the history of trade unions the early working class radicals so you could say that harry was quite at home with the common man hed just no time for petty chitchat like you so often get at parties he always tended to edge conversations in the direction of his interests talbot nodded in grudging agreement and lit a cigarette let me put it this way chief inspector banks he said in a tone of professor to lowly student if you were to if you were able to sit down now and talk to harold steadman he would probably begin by asking you about your job how you feel about it just to get things going he would discover where you come from and find out about your family background then depending on how interesting he found all that he would either question you further say if your father had been a union man or a farm labourer in the dales or he would proceed to tell you about the history of your area how it fits in with the rest of the country what the romans did there and so on people usually enjoyed his company he could sense when he was becoming a bore and would usually stop and listen politely for a while of course talbot added with a deft flick of ash if he found you boring then you wouldnt get much out of him am i right darnley darnley nodded what about mrs steadman banks asked did you see much of her when she was in leeds he addressed the question to talbot who seemed to have become quite garrulous but it was darnley who answered at first we did yes quite a pretty little thing really naturally they were in a new environment and wanted to meet people and settle in but like many faculty wives she soon withdrew its common enough believe me my wife for example wouldnt be seen dead at an academic gathering these days it bores them you see and they let themselves go over the years you know not bothering much about their appearance any more banks couldnt be sure whether darnley was talking about his own wife or about emma steadman the conversation moved on to generalities again with darnley doing most of the entertaining and banks soon realized he wasnt going to learn anything more of value when he left he carried away with him the image of a young couple perhaps not unlike sandra and himself in the old days newly married the husband beginning what was likely to be a distinguished academic career there were long summer holidays in gratly at the ramsden house there was the young ambitious michael courting penny the flower of the dale it was pure peace and innocence with nothing but a bright future ahead for them all for steadman things seemed to get better and better for emma there was withdrawal from the dull academic life into domestic boredom for penny a wild exciting fling in the fast lane which left her isolated and cynical cut off from her roots and for ramsden a steady advance up the publishing ladder and a return to his beloved north it all sounded so idyllic but one of them was dead what had gone wrong and why an hour later he was no closer to the solution but his spirits felt lighter despite the clouds as he drove into the dales countryside and sang along with brittens versions of old english folk songs six they were sipping coke and talking about boys under the scornful lascivious eyes of the old greek hazel kirk had had her first date with terry preston son of the local grocer the previous night and she was titillating her friends with an account of her attempt to keep his wandering hands from her most private parts once in a while she would blush while describing the indefinable feelings she had had when she failed in her task but sally lumb usually so interested not to mention condescending during such discussions seemed preoccupied the others noticed but hazel for one was not going to be done out of her moment of glory simply because madam was sulking anne downes perhaps more sensitive to mood and certainly less interested in boys and their inexplicable desires waited patiently until kathy chalmers had stopped giggling and tried to change the subject they havent caught him yet you know she announced adjusting her glasses on the bridge of her nose who hazel asked abruptly annoyed at being dragged away from other more important thoughts the killer of course who else the man who killed mr steadman how do you know it was a man hazel asked it was a question shed heard on countless television programmes stands to reason doesnt it anne snorted itd have to be a pretty strong woman to slug him and carry him all the way up that field below crow scar mrs butterworth could have done it kathy chipped in they all giggled mrs butterworth was the butchers wife an enormous redfaced woman who towered above her meek hunched husband dont be silly anne said allowing herself a smile why should she do it besides the effort would probably give her a heart attack jimmy collins told me the police have been talking to penny cartwright and the major kathy said he said the old man didnt give them much time how would jimmy collins know anne asked he was in the shop downstairs where theres a will theres a way my mother always says i think penny did it i think her and mr steadman were having a torrid love affair and when she wanted him to leave his wife and marry her he wouldnt do it so she killed him dont be so stupid anne said if it was really like that shed have killed mrs steadman not him that silenced kathy but hazel picked up the thread well if that wasnt why she said there could have been plenty of other reasons everybody knows she went away for ages and took drugs and was pro prom promiscuous suggested anne yes promiscuous clever clogs thats what i said maybe she had his baby or he knew something about her past theyve known each other a long time you know the others were silent taking it all in you might be right about the last bit anne allowed but she wouldnt kill him just because she had his baby would she i think it was jack barker why would he do it kathy asked maybe he was just doing research for his next book hazel joked and maybe hes in love with penny cartwright and wanted to get mr steadman out of the way so he could have her all to himself anne said and theres another thing i heard the police gave teddy hackett a nasty time the other day he certainly looked a little pale when i saw him hazel added my dad heard them arguing a couple of weeks ago hackett and mr steadman anne said but they cant think he did it hazel reasoned or theyd have arrested him in custody by now i bet hes got a skintight alibi its watertight you fool anne laughed and he cant be arrested in custody only in custody all right miss knowitall so what i wonder who she was kathy said teddy hacketts alibi and they all laughed to them hackett with his droopy moustache receding hairline gold medallions and beer belly hanging over his fancy belt buckle was a figure of ridicule the male equivalent of mutton dressed as lamb what do you think sally anne asked youre very quiet today ive got a few ideas of my own sally replied slowly and quietly but ive got to check them out and with that she walked out leaving them all gaping again not knowing whether to believe her or not one by seven thirty the lounge bar of the dog and gun was almost full it was a long narrow room with only one vaguely demarcated aisle down the centre the audience was clustered around small tables and a whitejacketed waiter had been employed so that people wouldnt have to move about to get drinks he moved awkwardly among the crowd a tray of black and amber drinks tottering menacingly at shoulder height the jukebox had been unplugged for the evening and piped folk music played softly enough to make conversation easy dim wall lights gave the room a dark orange glow and at the bar the brass rail polished hand pumps and coloured bottles by the mirrors gleamed at the far end of the room was a low wooden platform too makeshift to be dignified with the name of a stage and on it stood a couple of microphones on stands two large speakers three stools and an amplifier with its red light on banks and sandra sat with harriet and david about halfway down the room on the righthand side harriet pixieish in looks animated and intelligent in character drove a mobile library around the more remote dales villages her husband david was an assistant bank manager in eastvale and if truth be told banks found him a bit of a bore david had clearly said something that required more than a mere nod in response but banks had been watching a freshfaced young camper probably under eighteen who was already displaying the effects of too much alcohol in his desire to show off to his girlfriend pardon banks said cupping his hand to his ear i said i suppose you know all about computers yourself being on the force david repeated im afraid ive been boring you not at all lied banks he tamped down the tobacco in his pipe and lit it in defiance of sandras sharply aimed frown no not at all but yes i know a little bit about computer languages that oldfashioned phrase on the force made him smile it was an odd way of looking at his job he thought on what force the forces of law and order no doubt may the force be with you the force of good against evil it was a stiff dry phrase that hardly did the job justice while telling david what little he did know about the subject banks noticed penny cartwright come in with jack barker the two of them made their way to the front where chairs had been saved for them shortly afterwards a nervous spotty young man took the stage tapped the microphones said testing in each one three or four times then welcomed everyone to folk night at the dog and gun one by one conversations died down until all that could be heard was the barman ringing up sales and the steady humming of the amplifier the microphone shrieked when the young man got too close and he backed off quickly pulling a face banks couldnt catch the names of all the scheduled performers but he gathered that penny was set to sing two fortyminute sets the first starting at eight thirty and the second at about ten fifteen after more notices and introductions a duo clambered on to the stage the boy had only a guitar but the girl spread several ancient and obscure stringed instruments on the floor around her first they launched into a bob dylan song and what they lacked in talent banks thought they made up for in enthusiasm after the applause the young man made jokes about the notes he had missed and apologized for the rawness of his technique it worked after that the audience wanted him to succeed and most people were willing to overlook the rough edges the girl said nothing but concentrated on tuning what looked to banks like a mandolin she played extremely well on the next number a medley of old english dances on the whole the audience was respectful and attentive but there were occasional unavoidable interruptions as the waiter passed by and more drinks were ordered someone told the inebriated young camper to shut up too banks and david seemed to have settled into buying rounds the two men drinking pints of bitter and the women lager and lime banks had to watch his intake because he didnt want to appear even slightly intoxicated in the village where he was conducting a murder investigation two pints in an hour and a half wasnt at all bad he told himself but it was only just after eight oclock he was aware that he tended to speed up towards closing time the first intermission came and people started making their ways to the toilets and the bar as he walked down the narrow aisle jack barker noticed bankss party and came over good evening he said extending his hand what a surprise to find you here id no idea you were a folkie there was just enough of a twinkle in his eye to make the irony apparent mind if i join you for a moment he grabbed a nearby chair and pulled it up before banks could object is it just miss cartwright youve come to hear actually its ms cartwright banks corrected him and yes ive heard shes very good his tone was brusque he wished barker would go away youre in for a real treat chief inspector a real treat people come from miles away to hear penny cartwright you know shes got a solid reputation in these parts especially since she gave up fame and fortune to return to her roots people appreciate that from what banks had heard appreciation wasnt quite the word for the gossip that had surrounded pennys return to her roots but he kept quiet barker obviously wanted to show off and short of being rude there was no way to stop him sandra returned from the ladies and looked at barker curiously there was no escape banks realized cursing himself he would have to introduce them barker favoured the women with what banks suspected was a wellpractised clark gable smile delighted he said theatrically taking sandras hand i never imagined a policemans wife could be so charming and so beautiful banks was irritated david simply looked on a vacant grin on his face it was not only barkers charm and social finesse that annoyed banks it was all very well socializing in the community but to be seen with his wife openly fraternizing with a suspect jarred against his deepest instincts as a detective it made him feel conspicuous for one thing and that was a feeling he disliked gristhorpes advice get in there and let them talk to you was all very well but a line had to be drawn he was off duty and the whole thing was just too pally for his taste he was sucking on his dead pipe glowering and contributing monosyllables only when necessary how do you manage to fit in here sandra asked after barker had told her his occupation arent writers usually regarded with a good deal of suspicion barker nodded true they didnt like me being here at first he replied not one bit youre right people dont trust writers in small communities and theyve good reason not to some communities have had bad experiences with chaps who live among them fit in then go and write devastating critiques hardly even bothering to disguise names and identities its like the way some indians see photographers people who steal their souls quite right too in my opinion the kind of writers they have in mind are unscrupulous they give us all a bad name but dont you think writers have to be a little ruthless harriet asked especially if theyre to tell the truth perhaps but the ones im talking about accept your hospitality then strip you naked on the page some writers even worm their way into peoples confidence and set up situations manipulate events just to see how their characters will react i knew one chap for example who used to throw regular parties this was in london real lavish dos they were no expense spared champers single malt scotch beluga caviar quail more than anyone could hope to devour in an evening when everyone got sozzled and started arguing crying or pawing other peoples partners there he was sober as a judge sitting in a corner making mental notes it took people a long time to figure out what was going on after all they were having a good time but sure enough theyd appear thinly disguised in stories published in magazines and their friends and colleagues would recognize them a couple of marriages broke up reputations were destroyed all in the name of art after a while attendance dropped dramatically what happened to him harriet asked sitting on the edge of her chair barker shrugged moved on i suppose ive no idea where he is now pastures new he still publishes regularly and is that what you do mr barker sandra asked move in on people and steal their souls barker laughed please call me jack he said and banks felt his upper lip begin to curl no thats not what i do at all at first everyone was suspicious of me but then they always are like that with incomers as they call us after a while out of curiosity i suppose someone read a couple of my books then someone else and their comments got around as soon as everyone realized i wrote hardboiled privateeye stories set in southern california in the thirties they decided i wasnt a threat believe it or not i even have a few fans here i know harriet said ive carried enough of your books around in the mobile library barker honoured her with a smile as soon as they get to know youre harmless he went on youre as close to being accepted as youll ever be it was the same with harry what about harry banks asked trying to sound casual but failing miserably sandra frowned at him for being a killjoy all i meant barker explained was that harry was a writer too in his way but nobody ever worried about him because he wrote about the romans and old lead mines i mean only people like penny and michael ramsden were interested that stuffs as dry as dust to most people he looked back at the ladies and smiled again clearly hoping to get off on another track do you know ramsden well banks asked unmoved by barkers discomfort and sandras piercing glances harriet and sandra began to chat between themselves and david looked on lost ive met him barker replied curtly what do you think of him pleasant enough fellow he said looking to the women for support in his levity but you can hardly expect a writer to say nice things about an editor can you i spend two days working on a fine descriptive paragraph and my editor wants it cut out because it slows the action ramsdens not your publisher though is he banks persisted good lord no he only deals with academic stuff did you know about ramsden and penny cartwright that was years ago what on earth are you getting at just trying to sort out the tangle of relationships banks answered smiling thats all look theyre starting again barker said rising please excuse me he gave a brief bow to harriet and sandra then made his way back to the front it was almost eight thirty as the lights dimmed banks saw him talking to penny and glancing back over his shoulder the last thing he noticed before it got too dim was barker whispering in pennys ear and penny looking behind her and laughing as the master of ceremonies began his rambling and incoherent introduction sandra leaned over to banks you were a bit sharp with him werent you she said was it really necessary you did promise we were having a social evening banks muttered a sullen apology and busied himself with his pipe it wasnt a new situation the job interfering with his personal life but it never ceased to cause friction perhaps sandra had expected the move to change all that a new life what rubbish banks thought different landscapes same old people with the same old failings he gestured to the waiter to bring another round bugger it let someone else drive home it was a social occasion after all he reminded himself ironically penny cartwright took the stage to much applause and several loud whistles from the back of the room banks was still furious with barker for being so damn charming and witty and with sandra for encouraging him and with himself for spoiling it he attacked the fresh pint of bitter with angry gusto and glared at his pipe as if it were at the root of all his troubles it had gone out yet again and he was sick to death of tamping emptying cleaning scraping and relighting it penny began with an unaccompanied ballad called still growing it was a sad tale about an arranged marriage between a woman and a boy on the edge of manhood the husband died young and the widow lamented o once i had a sweetheart but now i have none death has put an end to his growing the story was simply and economically told and banks found himself entering into the music as he did with opera his recent irritation wrapped up and put away in a dim corner of his mind her voice had both passion and control it was that of a survivor singing about the lost and the less fortunate with honest sympathy she was an alto pitched lower than banks had expected husky on the low notes but pure and clear in the higher range banks clapped loudly when she finished and sandra turned to him with raised eyebrows and a smile of appreciation other songs in the same traditional folk vein followed and sometimes penny accompanied herself on guitar while another young woman playing the flute or the fiddle joined her mixed in with the stories of demon lovers and forbidden affairs were lighthearted jigs and reels and sensational broadside ballads like the murder of maria marten despite his enjoyment of the music banks found his mind wandering back to barkers reaction to the mention of michael ramsden there had seemed to be a dislike beyond the general lack of love between writers and publishers ramsden had been a close friend of steadmans and had known penny cartwright since childhood did they still see each other despite what they said was barker simply jealous and if he was jealous of ramsden wasnt he also likely to have felt the same way about steadman banks looked at penny and noticed barkers finely chiselled handsome profile in silhouette he was in love with her of course ramsden had been right to suggest that possibility and who could blame him her beauty was radiant her talent was moving but she and ramsden had parted of course it had happened years ago before she had fully blossomed and it could only have been puppy love still such events endure in small communities perhaps to some of the more shrewish local gossips penny would always be known as a wayward lass who lost that nice michael ramsden who had gone on and done so well for himself and what did ramsden really feel about their parting banks laid his pipe to rest in the ashtray and penny announced like musgrave and lady barnard the last song of the set two at about nine oclock sally lumb left the house on hill road because it was friday her mother was at bingo in eastvale with mrs crawford and her father was down in the public bar of the bridge playing in a local darts match they wouldnt be back till about eleven oclock which gave her plenty of time there would be no awkward questions to answer despite the gathering clouds it was a warm evening a bit too hot and sticky if anything sally knew from experience that such signs meant a storm was on its way she walked down the hill and turned left by the bridge on to high street it was a quiet time in helmthorpe most people were either in the pubs or sat glued to the idiot box in their living rooms thered be nothing much stirring until closing time unless a party of campers got too rowdy at the hare and hounds disco and big cyril had to chuck them out she walked on down the street and paused outside the dog and gun the front door was open and she could hear singing from inside penny cartwright by the sound of it sally had heard her before but hadnt known she was singing in the village that evening she looked at her watch plenty of time the words of the song drifted out on the humid air a grave a grave lord barnard cried to put these lovers in but bury my lady on the top for she was of noble kin with the familiar tune in her mind sally walked on pausing for a moment to listen to the broad beck flowing under the bridge at the eastern end of high street she quickened her pace and leaving the road struck out up the long wild southern slope of the dale past where she and kevin had seen penny the other day she had an appointment to keep a warning to give everything would be sorted out soon three during the intermission penny cartwright walked by banks on her way out of the pub and flashed him a cool smile of acknowledgment barker following closely behind her nodded and bowed to harriet and sandra shes so talented and beautiful sandra said after theyd gone surely she cant be one of your suspects banks just told her that penny had been a friend of the victim and sandra left it at that the four chatted about the music which they had all enjoyed ordered more drinks suffered through a mercifully short set of contemporary protest folk music and awaited pennys second set she came back at ten fifteen and walked straight to the stage this time there was a new slightly distant quality in her performance she was still involved in what she did but it didnt have the same emotional cutting edge banks listened to the ballads and was struck by the parallel that he was dealing with exactly the same kinds of feelings and events that the old songs were forged from and he wondered how the ballad of harry steadman would end nobody would be hung high of course not these days but who would the killer turn out to be what was his motive and what would be bankss own part in the song all of a sudden it seemed as if he was in another century and that this beautiful young woman in the spotlight lifes disappointments and cruelties showing just enough in her voice to intensify her beauty was singing a tragic ballad about the murder of harry steadman the sharp change to a brisk singalong tune snapped him out of his reverie and he finished off his drink noting that he immediately felt impatient for another he was drunk or at least tipsy and it wasnt far off closing time if barker was in love with the girl and if there had been anything between her and steadman if ramsden still if mrs steadman knew if steadman and his wife hadnt been quite as close as everyone made out the random thoughts curled like pipe smoke and evaporated in the air when the set ended to loud and prolonged applause banks caught the passing waiter and ordered another pint for himself and a half for david sandra looked at him with a hint of reprimand in her eyes but he just shrugged and grinned foolishly he had never had a problem with alcohol but he knew he could sometimes be quite adolescent in his consumption of numerous pints he could tell that sandra was worried he might make an idiot of himself but he knew he could handle his drink he hadnt had all that much anyway there might even be room for another one if he had time four there was going to be a storm sally was sure of it she sat on the low packhorse bridge dangling her legs over the warm stone as she watched the sun go down when it had disappeared behind the hills leaving a halo of dark redgold it seemed to shine upwards from the depths of the earth and pick out the relief of the heavy grey clouds that massed high above insects buzzed on the still humid air it was an isolated spot ideal for such business barely even suitable for cars during her walk sally had enjoyed the peace and the strange tremors of excitement that the anticipation of a storm seemed to lay on the landscape the colours were richer the wild flowers and rough grass more vibrant and the clouds shadows seemed palpable masses on the distant valley side but now she was nervous and she didnt know why it was the coming storm she told herself the electricity in the air the isolation the gathering darkness soon the wind would shake the rough moorland grass and rain would lash the dale it was the perfect place for a secret meeting she understood that if they were seen together word might get back to the chief inspector and awkward questions would be asked she wanted to handle this herself perhaps save a life and catch a killer nonetheless she knew deep down that her shivers were not entirely due to the weather idly she cast a loose stone from the bridge into the shallow slowmoving beck after the rain she thought it would be swift sparkling and ringing with fresh water cascading down the valley side and right under helmthorpe high street she looked at her watch twenty to ten tired of waiting she wished it was all over the aftermath of sunset was quickly vanishing as the clouds thickened overhead a curlew called plaintively in the distance the place began to feel like a wilderness in a gothic romance it was creepy even though shed been there often enough a flock of rooks spun across the sky like oily rags sally became aware of a new sound throbbing through the silence a car she pricked up her ears cast another stone in the beck and stood to face the track yes she could see the headlights as they dipped and flashed on the winding road it wouldnt be long now five the storm finally broke at about five am sharp cracks of thunder woke banks from a vaguely unpleasant dream he had a dry mouth and a thick head so much for control but at least he hadnt made a fool of himself that he remembered careful not to disturb sandra he walked over to the window and looked out on the back garden just in time to see a jagged bolt of lightning streak from north to south across the sky the first few drops of rain fat and heavy came slowly they burst at intervals on the windowpane and smacked against the slates of the sloping tool shed roof then they came more quickly and slapped against the leaves of the trees that lined the back alley beyond the garden gate soon the rain was coursing down the window and over the slates into the gutter before it gurgled down the drainpipe banks made his way to the bathroom took two panadol tablets and went back to bed sandra hadnt woken and the children remained silent he remembered when tracy had been afraid of storms and had always run to her parents bed where she nestled between them and felt safe but now she knew what caused the electrical activity knew more about it than banks did and the fear had gone brian had never really cared either way except that an evening thunderstorm meant the television had to be unplugged sometimes in the middle of his favourite programme it was something bankss father had always done and banks followed suit without really knowing why the steady rhythm of the rain and the sudden release from tension that the start of a storm brings helped banks to drift uneasily off to sleep again only seconds later it seemed the alarm clock rang and it was time to get ready for work when banks arrived at the station he was surprised to find an unusual flurry of activity superintendent gristhorpe was waiting for him whats going on banks asked hanging his wet mackintosh in the cupboard a young girls been reported missing gristhorpe told him bushy eyebrows knitted together in a frown from eastvale get yourself some coffee lad then well talk about it banks took his mug to the small lunch room and poured himself a cup of fresh black coffee back in the office he sat behind his desk and sipped the hot drink waiting for gristhorpe to begin he knew there was never any point in hurrying the superintendent helmthorpe gristhorpe said finally local bobby down there constable weaver got woken up by worried parents just after the storm broke seems their young lass hadnt come home and they were worried the mother said she sometimes stayed out late she was at that age sixteen or so so they hadnt worried too much earlier but when the storm woke them and she still wasnt back apparently shes not done anything like that before whats the girls name sally lumb the words sounded flat and final in gristhorpes yorkshire accent banks rubbed his face and drank some more coffee i was talking to her just the other day he said at last in here she came to see me gristhorpe nodded i know i saw the report thats why i wanted to talk to you attractive young girl banks said almost to himself looked older than she was sixteen interested in acting she wanted to get away to the big city and all of a sudden he thought of penny cartwright who had been to so many big cities only to return to helmthorpe were covering that angle alan you know as well as i do how most of these cases turn out in all likelihood shes run off to manchester or london her mother told weaver thered been a few rows at home lately seems the lass didnt get on too well with her father she probably just took off somewhere banks nodded most likely but you dont believe it i didnt say that sir no but you sounded like it shock i suppose there could have been an accident she goes off with her boyfriend you know they find isolated places where they can kiss and cuddle that areas full of old lead mines and gullies aye its possible for the moment well just have to assume its either that or shes run off weve wired her description to all the big cities i just hope to god weve not got a sex killer on our hands he paused and looked through the window where the steady downpour had almost emptied market street and the square only a few shoppers soldiered on under umbrellas trouble is he went on we cant organize search parties in this kind of weather too bloody dangerous by far up on the moors and valley sides what do you thinks happened banks asked me gristhorpe shook his head i dont know alan like i told you ive been reading through that interview report again and i cant really see as she gave us any valuable information she just helped us pinpoint the time the body was dumped thats all she didnt actually see anything you mean she wasnt a danger to anyone to our killer aye naturally you make connections when something like this happens youd be a poor copper if you didnt but you cant let it get in the way as it stands now weve still got a murder to solve and weve got a missing girl to cope with too but you do think there might be a connection i hope not i bloody hope not its bad enough knowing theres someone who killed once out there but a hell of a lot worse thinking theyd go as far as to kill a kid too we cant be sure shes dead yet sir gristhorpe looked at banks steadily for a few moments then turned back to the window no he said was there anything else anything else to link her to the steadman case not that i know of the only time i saw her was when she came to tell me about hearing the car i got the impression that she went away distinctly dischuffed with me for giving up the bright lights we had willy fisher in at the time too he put up a bit of a struggle with two uniformed lads and i think that unnerved her a bit what are you getting at alan i dont know really but maybe if she did figure anything out she might not have come to me with it you cant blame yourself for that gristhorpe said rising wearily to leave lets hope shes run off somewhere the links got to be pursued though were you thinking of going to helmthorpe today no its so bloody miserable outside i thought id go over the paperwork again why the paperwork can wait id feel easier if you did go of course what do you want me to do have a word with the boyfriend for a start find out if he saw her last night or if not why not and weaver tells me she hung around the coffee bar with three other girls you might have a chat with them weaver will give you the names and details be as casual as you can if she knew anything or had any theories shes far more likely to have told her friends than her parents no need to trouble them banks was relieved twice before he had had to spend time with the parents of missing children and he could think of no worse task ill take care of the rest gristhorpe added well be getting search parties organized as soon as this rain slackens off a bit should i leave now banks asked no hurry in fact it might be better if you held off till midmorning i dont know a lot about teenage lasses but i shouldnt imagine theyll be up and about right now it might be best if you can find them in the coffee bar itll be a more comfortable environment for the kind of chat you want and youll get them all together banks nodded youll keep me up to date sir yes of course just check in with weaver ill send sergeant hatchley on later too hes busy getting the girls description around the country right now just a small point banks said but it might be a good idea if you had someone get in touch with theatre companies drama schools that kind of place if she has run off the odds are shes headed for the stage aye gristhorpe said ill do that then looking tired and worried he left the office outside it was still pouring bucketfuls on to market street and looked as if it would never stop banks stared down at the shifting pattern of umbrellas as pedestrians dodged one another crossing the square on the way to work he scratched his chin and found a rough patch the electric razor had missed gristhorpe was right they had to think in terms of a connection with the steadman business it had to be pursued quickly as well and the irony was that they had to hope they were wrong banks looked over sally lumbs interview transcript and tried to visualize her as she had sat before him was there something she hadnt told him as he read the printed words he had written up from his notes he tried to picture her face remembering pauses changes in expression no if there was anything else it must have occurred to her after the interview and she might then have gone to the wrong person with her information or ideas banks tried to stop himself imagining her battered body stuffed down a disused mineshaft but the images were hard to dismiss sally may have been eager to move away to the big city but she had struck him as a sensible girl even calculating the kind who would make a clean and open move when the right time came according to her mother nothing dramatic had happened at home to make her run away rows were common enough surely and if anything the parents seemed too liberal banks remembered the curfews broken many of them of his own adolescence as he tried to coax his pipe alight the blasted thing remained as reluctant as ever in a sudden flash of anger and frustration he threw it across the room and the stem snapped in two six as banks approached helmthorpe later that saturday morning the coloured tents across the river strained at their ropes in the wind and rain like the sails of hidden boats and the dark water danced wildly with ripples in such weather the houses themselves looked like dull outcrops of the stone they were built from and the valley sides were shrouded in haze a few locals and unfortunate holidaymakers tramped the streets banks pulled into the small parking space next to the police station and the first person he saw inside was pc weaver the constable looked pale and there were dark smudges under his eyes we cant even organize a search he said pointing out of the window our men would get bogged down on the moors and the visibilitys hopeless i know banks said any luck weaver shook his head her parents last saw her just before they went out for the evening at about seven thirty before that her friends saw her in the coffee bar earlier in the afternoon weve not had time to ask much yet sir ive still got some lads out there therell likely be more information coming in before long banks nodded and she didnt say to anyone where she was going no sir her mother thought she might have met her boyfriend somewhere did she he says not sir weaver pointed toward a bedraggled young man in a clinging wet tshirt and soggy jeans hair plastered down by the rain thats him there sir hes pretty upset and i see no reason not to believe him have you questioned him just talked to him really sir not questioned him proper i mean i thought id leave that thats fine constable banks said smiling his approval you did right he walked over to kevin who was staring fixedly at a crime doesnt pay poster and chewing his fingernails banks introduced himself and sat down on the bench how long have you known sally he asked kevin rubbed his eyes years i suppose we only started going out together this summer how do you feel about swainsdale what how do you feel about living in the dales your home sally doesnt like it much does she wasnt she always talking about going away oh aye she talked kevin said scornfully shes full of big talk is sally got a lot of grand ideas dont you think she might have run off to london or somewhere then kevin shook his head no i cant see her leaving like that thats why im worried shedve telled me perhaps shes running from you too dont be daft weve just started going together were in love he bent forward and put his head in his hands i love her were going to get married start a little farm i know sally and she just wouldnt run off without telling me she wouldnt banks held himself back from agreeing whatever kevin believed there was still hope he couldnt picture sally lumb settling down to domestic rural life in the dales though kevin had a lot to learn about women and about dreams but he seemed a decent and honest enough boy on the surface banks was inclined to agree with weaver and see no harm in him but he had to press on with the questioning did you talk to sally yesterday he asked kevin shook his head you didnt see her at all yesterday evening no i was playing cricket with some mates over in aykbridge did sally know about that didnt she expect to see you aye she knew you cant see each other every night can you he burst out youd soon get sick of each other then wouldnt you youve got to do other things sometimes dont you he was blaming himself and banks helped him fight back the guilt he wanted to ask him about the night he and sally had heard the car he wanted to know if she had said anything more about it or if either of them had noticed something they hadnt mentioned but if he did that he realized he would be putting ideas into kevins mind making him think that sallys disappearance was somehow related to steadmans murder he would have to do that eventually but it could wait if there was anything kevin would probably blurt it out himself in his attempt to help find sally it was almost noon if the girls were going to meet up as usual in the coffee bar theyd probably be there by now weaver told him banks dashed out to the car in good weather he would have walked the short distance but after only a moments exposure to the heavy rain droplets were running down his neck from his sodden collar the three girls sat in silence toying with straws angled in their coke cans banks told them who he was and pulled up a chair to the stained and cracked formica table the video games and pinball machine were silent do you think sallys the kind of girl to run away without telling anyone he asked first they all shook their heads slowly the plainlooking girl with thick glasses who had introduced herself as anne downes answered shes full of ideas is sally but thats all they are shes nowhere to run to she doesnt know anyone outside swainsdale was she doing well at school well enough replied kathy chalmers the one with the henna hair shes clever not a swot like she could always get away without studying much and get good marks shes bound to pass all her exams a sensible girl youd say as sensible as any of us teenagers anne downes answered and the irony wasnt lost on banks it depends on your point of view kathy gave a short giggle and blushed im sorry she apologized putting her hand over her mouth but her parents might not have thought she was sensible you know parents being one himself banks did but shes not the kind of girl to he paused searching for words to avoid the phrase get into trouble with all its connotations she doesnt cause trouble make a nuisance of herself kathy shook her head no not at all shes well behaved enough gets on well with most of the teachers shes just full of ideas like anne said a big dreamer she wouldnt do anything to hurt anybody banks wondered if the girls connected sallys disappearance with the steadman business her visit to the eastvale station was exactly the kind of thing shed tell them about and he wanted to know if she had made any remarks again the problem was to avoid alerting and alarming them i suppose you know she came to see me a few days ago he began casually and i agree she struck me as being exactly like you all say bright full of plans well behaved i didnt really get to hear much about any of her ideas though kathy chalmers blushed again the other girl hazel kirk who had so far sat silently throughout the conversation began to seem ill at ease again it was anne downes who answered with a forthrightness completely in harmony with her precocious intelligence take this murder business she began i suppose thats what she went to see you about banks nodded well she found it all rather glamorous exciting as if it was something she was watching on telly i dont mean to say she wasnt sorry about poor mr steadman we all were its just that she didnt see it from that point of view to sally it was an adventure do you know what i mean it was all a bit of a game with her as the heroine this was exactly what banks wanted he nodded in appreciation of annes observation did she talk about it much he asked only in a mysterious kind of way anne answered as if she knew something nobody else did yes exactly like that i think it made her feel important that shed noticed something and been to see you she thought you were rather dishy at first anne said this with a perfectly straight face as if she didnt quite know what the word meant then she seemed disappointed with your response i dont know what it was she didnt say but she got even more mysterious as the week went on did she say anything specific oh she tried to convince us that she was hot on the trail anne said adjusting her glasses that she had an idea who dunnit but thats all just hints she didnt do anything about it as far as i know banks was dreading the moment which surely couldnt be far off when anne would realize the significance of his line of questioning but luckily it didnt come he thanked the girls for their time and as he left noted again how distracted hazel kirk seemed to be instead of questioning her there and then he decided to leave it for a while and see what developed one it was time to concentrate on the steadman case again however disturbing her disappearance was banks thought sally lumb might turn up in birmingham or bristol any moment but steadman was dead and his killer was still free he told weaver where he was going and drove up the hill to gratly turning right after the small low bridge in the centre of the hamlet and pulling up outside jack barkers converted farmhouse by the side of the broad beck the water was already running faster and louder over the series of terraced falls in a day or two when the rain percolated down from the moorlands and higher slopes the stream would turn into a deafening torrent banks realized as he rang the doorbell that he had not visited barker at home before and he wondered what the house would reveal of the man oh its you chief inspector a puzzledlooking barker said after keeping banks waiting at the door for an unusually long time come in excuse my surprise but i dont get very many visitors banks took off his wet mac and shoes in the hall and followed barker inside although it wasnt cold the rain had certainly put a damp chill in the stone and banks decided to keep his jacket on do you mind if we talk in the study barker asked its warmer up there ive just been working and thats where the coffee pot is you look as if you could do with some good idea banks replied following his host through a sparsely furnished living room and up a very narrow flight of stone stairs into a cosy room that looked out on the fell sides at the back of the house two walls were lined with books and by a third where the door was stood a filing cabinet and a small desk stacked with papers barkers work table on which an electric typewriter hummed stood directly by the window through the streaming rain the sharply rising slope outside had the look of an impressionist painting at the centre of the room was a low coffee table the red light of the automatic dripfilter machine was on and the pyrex pot was half full of rich dark coffee by the table there were two small but comfortable armchairs the two men sat down with their coffee both took black no sugar im sorry to disturb you at work banks said sipping the refreshing liquid think nothing of it its an occupational hazard banks raised an eyebrow what i mean is barker explained that if you work at home youre at home arent you fair game for any salesman and bill collector somehow the old protestant work ethic wont allow most people to accept that writing books in the comfort of ones own home is really work if you see what i mean i cant think why mind you it was common enough for weavers and loom operators to work at home before the industrial revolution these days work has to be something we hate something we do in a noisy dirty factory or an antiseptic fluorescent office no offence but banks could tell by the sparkle in his eyes that barker was baiting him gently none taken he replied as a matter of fact id be happier to spend a bit more time in my office and less of it tramping about the dales in this weather barker smiled and reached for a cigarette from the packet on the table anyway he said i dont seem to get many visitors except salesmen i take the phone off the hook too work was going well id just got to a good part and its always been my practice to stop for a while when things get good that way i feel excited about going back to work later thats an interesting work habit banks remarked trying to ignore the craving he felt when barker lit his cigarette and inhaled deeply sorry barker said offering him a cigarette as if he had read his mind banks shook his head trying to stop of course youre a pipe man arent you please feel free pipe smoke doesnt bother me at all it broke after the two of them had laughed at the absurdity of the broken pipe banks gave in perhaps i will have a cigarette he said as he reached for one he noticed barker tense up to face the inevitable questions the cigarette tasted good every bit as good as he remembered he didnt cough or feel dizzy in fact he felt no indication that he had ever given up cigarettes in the first place it was like a reunion with a long lost friend so what can i do for you this time barker asked putting unnecessary emphasis on the last two words i suppose youve heard about the girl from the village sally lumb he asked no what about her you mean you dont know id have thought in a community this size the news would spread fast people certainly knew about harold steadman soon enough i havent been out since i walked penny home after the folk club last night the girls missing banks told him she didnt go home last night good lord barker said looking towards the window if shes wandered off and got lost in this weather what do you think its too early to know yet she could have got lost yes but she grew up around here and she seemed like a sensible girl run away another possibility were checking on it but you dont think so we just dont know have you got search parties out we cant in this weather but still somethings got to be done were doing all we can banks assured him did you know her barker narrowed his eyes i wouldnt say i really knew her no ive seen her around of course to say hello to and she once came to me about a school project pretty girl very banks agreed i dont suppose thats what you came to talk to me about though is it no banks stubbed out his cigarette i wanted to ask you about penny cartwright what about her are you in love with her barker laughed but banks could see the strain in his eyes what a question i dont know whether to tell you its none of your business or applaud your insight you are then ill admit im rather smitten with penny yes what redblooded young bachelor wouldnt be but i dont see what my feelings for her have to do with anything else was she having an affair with harold steadman do you think barker gazed at banks for a few moments not that i know he answered slowly but how would i know you knew the two of them quite well true but a mans private life and a womans if they wanted to conceal something like that from the world it wouldnt have been very difficult would it even here it could be done look if you want my answer to your question youll have to understand that its just an opinion like yours certainly neither of them confided in me or anything like that and id say no they werent having an affair as you guessed i am very fond of penny and given that id naturally be interested in her relationships as far as i can make out though their friendship was based on mutual respect and admiration not sexual desire this was almost exactly what banks had heard from penny herself and from emma steadman indeed the only person who seemed to think differently about penny and harold steadman was the major and he was very much a victim of his own obsessions but what if he was right you seemed rather sharp last night when i mentioned michael ramsden banks said changing tack do you have any particular reason to dislike him i dont dislike him i hardly even knew him hes been in the bridge a few times with harry and he always seemed pleasant enough i will admit that i found something a little sly about him a bit offputting but thats a minor personal reaction its neither here nor there i suppose you knew about his relationship with penny yes and im quite willing to confess to a touch of instinctive lovers jealousy come to that i may have been envious of her relationship with harry too it seemed so close and easy but ive no claim on pennys emotions sad to say and as far as ramsden was concerned that was years ago they cant have been more than kids where were you then what on the night of the twelfth of february nineteen sixtythree between the hours of you know what i mean ten years ago yes i lived in london then in a poky little bedsit in notting hill writing real novels that nobody wanted to buy penny wasnt around when i first came to gratly we didnt meet till she came back but i did see her play once down south why do you think ramsden and penny split up how should i know its not a question ive concerned myself with why does any young couple split up i suppose they felt themselves moving in different directions christ they were only kids that was when michael lived at home with his parents wasnt it in the same house steadman and his wife used to visit on holidays yes barker answered ten years ago it was just before ramsden went off to university penny was just discovering her talent then harry told me he used to teach her folk songs hed collected and the kids just drifted apart well michael went to university and penny went all over the place with the group that kind of folk music was still popular then it still is actually i mean theres always a sizeable audience for it how was penny discovered the usual way as far as i know an agent for a record company was scouting the provinces for new folk talent he offered her a chance to make a demo and off she went the rest is history as they say has she talked to you about the past much the time she spent away not a great deal no barker seemed interested in the conversation now despite himself he poured more coffee and banks cadged another cigarette im sure you know chief inspector he went on that we all have phases of our lives were not particularly proud of often circumstances give us the opportunity to behave in a careless irresponsible way and most of us take it it pains me to admit that i was once a very young teddy boy and i even ripped a few seats in the local fleapit he grinned you wont arrest me will you i think the statute of limitation has run out on seatripping banks answered smiling it would be rather difficult to prove too you make me feel old banks sighed but do you see what i mean penny was not only young and inexperienced she was also for the first time in her life fairly well off popular in with the in crowd i dont doubt that she tried drugs and that sex was a fairly casual matter make love not war as they used to say but the important thing is that she grew up left all that behind and pulled her life together plenty of people dont survive the modern music world you know penny did what id like to know is why on earth you seem so obsessed with the events of ten years ago i dont know banks answered scratching the scar at the side of his eye everybody speaks so highly of steadman he didnt seem to have an enemy in the world yet somebody murdered him dont you find that strange he wasnt robbed and his body was taken up to the hillside below crow scar we dont know where he was killed i suppose what im saying mr barker is that if the answer isnt in the present which it doesnt seem to be then it must be in the past however unlikely that may seem to you and has this background information given you any clues none at all not yet but theres one more thing thats been on my mind could harold steadman have been a homosexual barker almost choked on his coffee that takes the biscuit he spluttered wiping at the spilled liquid on his lap where on earth did you get a wild idea like that banks saw no reason to tell him that he had got the idea from sergeant hatchley who had said in the queens arms in his usual manner about this steadman business those weekend trips to ramsdens place do you think he was queer banks had admitted that it was an angle he had not considered he had taken steadmans dedication to work at face value and presumed that the overnight visits took place for the reasons ramsden and mrs steadman had given him even assuming youre right banks had said it doesnt really help us much does it his wife cant have killed him out of disgust she has an alibi and ramsden would hardly have killed his lover even if he could have theres blackmail though hatchley had suggested steadman was a rich man yes its a possibility who do you think was blackmailing him could have been anyone he knew barker the girl barnes one of his old mates from leeds well check it out then banks had said ask around about ramsden and ill ask some more questions in helmthorpe i wouldnt hold out too much hope though it doesnt feel right to me how did you ask someone if a friend was homosexual he wondered just come right out with it how would they know penny would certainly assume ramsden was straight if he had been ten years ago and there was still a chance that she knew more about steadmans sexual habits than she let on so now he sat in barkers study waiting for him to get over the shock and attempt an answer when it came it was disappointing barker simply denied the possibility and would only admit when pushed that anything however outlandish was possible but that didnt mean it was true look barker said leaning forward i realize that i must be a suspect in this business ive no alibi and i seem unable to convince you that i really had nothing against harry im not gay either just for the record but i assure you that i did not kill him and im perfectly willing to help in any way i can i just dont know how i can help and if you dont mind my saying so some of the directions youre pursuing seem to me to be quite silly i can understand that banks said but its for me to decide whats relevant and what isnt you pick up bits and pieces from everyone and put them together yes i suppose thats true none of us gets to touch any more than a small area of the elephant do we but you get to see the whole beast banks smiled at the analogy eventually yes he said i hope so what are you working on or dont you like to discuss work in progress i dont mind as a matter of fact youve just given me an idea all that about putting the pieces together i think i can use it its another in the kenny gibson series have you read any banks shook his head of course not barker said i ought to know by now that few real policemen read detective novels anyway kenny gibson is a private eye in the los angeles area period stuff the thirties i get most of my background information from raymond chandler and the old black mask magazines but dont tell anyone this time hes working for a rich society woman whose husband has disappeared the plots taken care of its the characters and atmosphere that are really hard to do sex and violence enough to sell a few thousand copies just out of interest banks asked as he got up to leave do you have it all planned out in advance the plot the solution good lord no barker answered following him down the stairs the plot takes care of itself as i go along at least i hope it does if its going well there are fewer and fewer options at each turn until its perfectly clear who the criminal is im never really sure where im going from one day to the next itd be boring any other way dont you think perhaps banks answered putting on his shoes and mac in writing yes in fiction but in real life im not so sure itd be a damn sight easier if i knew who the criminal was without having to write the whole book and make all the mistakes along the way anyway goodbye and thanks for your time my pleasure said barker and banks ducked quickly through the rain to his car two on high street banks glimpsed penny cartwright nipping into the bridge consulting his watch and his stomach he decided it was well past lunch time and he could do with a pie and a pint if the landlord had any food left penny was at the bar shaking her umbrella when she glanced over her shoulder and saw banks enter cant a lady indulge her alcoholic cravings without the police turning up she asked sharply of course banks replied as a matter of fact id be honoured if youd join me for a late lunch penny looked at him through narrowed eyes business or pleasure inspector just a chat for chat read interrogation ill bet go on then i must be a fool youre buying they were lucky enough to get two steak and mushroom pies and penny asked for a double scotch carrying the drinks banks followed her into the lounge why dont they do something with this place he asked looking around and turning his nose up why should they i wouldnt have taken you for one of these horsebrass and bedpan types penny stood her umbrella by the fireplace and sat down shaking her hair banks laughed i always thought they were bedwarmers and no im not not at all give me spittoons and sawdust any day i was simply thinking that the owner might see renovations as a way to do more business in the long run oh inspector banks i can see youre not a true yorkshireman yet we dont care about a speck or two of dirt in these parts its the company and the ale that count and this is one place the locals can count on for both banks grinned and accepted the criticism with a humble sigh so what is it you want to know this time penny asked lighting a cigarette and leaning back in her chair i enjoyed your performance last night i liked the songs and youve got a beautiful voice did she blush just a little banks couldnt be sure the lighting in the room was so dim but she faltered over accepting the compliment and was clearly embarrassed the pies arrived and they each took a few bites in silence before banks opened the conversation again im stuck im not getting anywhere and now theres a girl gone missing penny frowned yes ive heard do you know her what do you think might have happened i know sally a little yes she always wanted to know about the big wide world out there i think she was secretly a bit disappointed with me for leaving it behind and coming home but she struck me as a sensible girl i cant really picture her running off like that and she was born and raised in these parts like me she knows the countryside around here like the back of her hand so she wasnt likely to get lost either which leaves i dont like to think about it you hear of young girls going missing so often in the cities but here penny shuddered i suppose it could mean weve got a maniac in our midst what are the police doing apart from buying me lunch it was the second time banks had been asked that and he found it just as depressing to have so little to say in reply again but penny understood about the weather she knew how dangerous it made swainsdale and she showed a surprising amount of sympathy for bankss obvious frustration they sat in silence again and returned to their food when they had finished banks put his knife and fork down and faced penny tell me about your father he said you sound like a bloody psychiatrist what about him you must know better than anyone else what a hothead he is i probably gave him reason enough you mean the city the wild life she nodded but honestly you make it sound much worse than it was what would you do in that position everything was new i had money people i thought were my friends it was exciting then people were trying new things just for the hell of it my father didnt speak to me for a long time after i left i couldnt explain it was just too claustrophobic at home but when i came back he was kind to me and helped me to get set up in the cottage he takes it upon himself to act as my protector i know and yes he has a temper but hes harmless you cant seriously suspect him of harming harry can you banks shook his head not any more no i think it was too well planned to be his kind of crime i just wanted to know how you saw things tell me more about michael ramsden flustered penny reached for another cigarette what about him you used to go out with him didnt you can i have one of those sure penny gave him a silk cut you know i used to go out with him so what it was years ago another lifetime were you in love in love inspector its easy to be in love when youre sixteen especially when everybody wants you to be michael was the bright boy of the village and i was the talented lass it was one match my father didnt oppose and hes always held it against me that we didnt marry did you think of marrying we were talking about getting engaged like kids do thats as far as it went look i was young and innocent michael was just a boy thats all there is to it penny shifted in her seat and pushed her hair back over her shoulders was it a sexual relationship none of your bloody business did he ditch you we just drifted apart is that all its all youre getting penny stood up to leave but banks reached out and grabbed her arm she stared at him angrily and he let go as if he had received an electric shock she rubbed the muscle im sorry he said please sit down again i havent finished yet look you might think im just prying into your personal life for the fun of it but im not i dont give a damn who youve slept with and who you havent slept with what drugs youve taken and what you havent taken unless it relates to harold steadmans murder is that clear i dont even care how much hash you smoke now penny eyed banks shrewdly finally she nodded so why did you split up banks asked buy me another drink and ill tell you same again banks got up to go to the bar penny nodded i cant promise itll be interesting though she called after him there was nothing mature about our relationship she said as banks sat down with a pint and a double scotch neither of us really knew anything different until something else came along another man no not until later much later you mean university for michael and a singing career for you yes partly but it wasnt as simple as that what do you mean penny frowned as if she had just thought of something or tried to grasp the shadow of a memory i dont know we just drifted apart thats all there is to it it was summer ten years ago every bit as hot as this one i told you it wasnt exciting but there must have been a reason why do you want to know because i think the answer to steadmans death lies in the past and i want to know as much about it as possible why do you think that im asking the questions did he dump you because you wouldnt have sex with him penny blew out a stream of smoke all right so i wouldnt let him fuck me is that what you want to hear the word was clearly meant to shock banks you tell me oh this is bloody insufferable here she tossed him another cigarette maybe sex was part of it he was certainly getting persistent perhaps i should have let him i dont know im sure i was ready but then he seemed different he got more withdrawn and distant things just felt strange i was changing too i was singing in the village pubs and michael was studying to go to university harry and emma were up for quite a while and it was hot very hot emma would hardly go outside because her skin burned so easily harry and i spent quite a bit of time at the roman site near fortford it was just being excavated then we went for walks as well long walks in the sun did michael go with you sometimes but he wasnt very interested in that kind of thing then hed just discovered the joys of english literature it was all shelley keats wordsworth and d h lawrence for him he spent most of the time with his nose stuck in a book of poems whether he was with us or not thats when he wasnt trying to stick his hands up my skirt must have been lawrences influence pennys lips twitched in a brief smile she put her hand to her forehead and swept back her hair maybe and mrs steadman as i said she didnt like the sun sometimes shed come if we went in the car and sit under a makeshift parasol by the side of the road while we had a picnic like characters from a jane austen novel but she wasnt really interested in the romans or folk traditions either maybe it wasnt the best of marriages i dont know lord knows they didnt have much in common but they put up with it and i dont think they treated each other unkindly harry shouldnt have married really he was far too dedicated to his work mostly i just remember him and me tramping over the moors and naming wild flowers steadman must have been in his early thirties then banks calculated and penny was sixteen that wasnt such an age difference to make attraction impossible quite the contrary he was exactly the age a girl of sixteen might be attracted to and steadman had certainly been handsome in a scholarly kind of way right up to the end didnt you have a crush on harry he asked surely it would have been perfectly natural perhaps but the main thing the thing you dont seem able to understand is that harry really wasnt like that he wasnt sexy i suppose more like an uncle i know it must be hard for you to believe but its true if i dont believe it banks thought its not for want of people trying to convince me dont you think michael might have seen the relationship differently he suggested a threat perhaps an older more experienced man might that not have been why he seemed strange i cant say i ever thought of it that way penny answered banks wasnt sure whether he believed her or not she lied and evaded issues so often he was becoming more and more convinced that she was an actress as well as a singer its possible though isnt it she nodded i guess so but he never said anything to me youd think he would have wouldnt you you didnt argue michael never said anything about you going off with harry he didnt always insist on accompanying you penny shook her head at each question he was very shy and awkward she said it was very difficult for him to express himself emotionally if he did think anything he kept it to himself and suffered in silence banks sipped his pint of theakstons brooding on how best to put his next question penny offered him another silk cut if i read you right inspector she said you seem to be implying that michael ramsden might have killed harry am i come on why all the questions about him being jealous banks said nothing they became great friends you know penny went on when michael graduated and got interested in local history he helped harry a lot he even persuaded his firm to publish harrys books it was more than just a publisherauthor relationship thats what i was wondering banks cut in seizing his opportunity is there any possibility of a homosexual relationship between them i know it sounds odd but think about it unlike barker penny took the question seriously before concluding that she doubted it very much this had better not be a trick she said i hope youre not trying to trap me into admitting intimate knowledge of harrys sexual preferences banks laughed im not half as devious as you make out her eyes narrowed sharply ill bet anyway she went on i really cant help you youd think youd know all about a friend youve known for years but its just not so harry could have been gay for all i know michael on the other hand seemed very much like a normal adolescent but theres no reason why he couldnt have been bi who can tell these days and she was right banks had known a sergeant on the metropolitan force for six years a married man with two children before finding out at the inquest into his suicide that he had been homosexual you still seem to be saying michael did it she said in fact youre hounding all of us his friends why why pick on us what about his enemies couldnt it have been somebody just passing through who killed harry banks shook his head contrary to popular belief he said very few murders happen that way i think the myth of the wandering vagrant killer was invented by the aristocracy to keep suspicion away from their own doorsteps most often people are killed by family or friends and motives are usually money sex revenge or the need to cover up damaging facts in harold steadmans case we found no evidence of robbery and weve had no luck so far in digging up an enemy from his past believe me ms cartwright we dig deep weve been checking the alibis of anyone outside his immediate circle who might have had even the remotest reason for killing him really not many people walk around the country bashing others on the head for no reason so far statistics and evidence point to someone closer to home according to his friends though he was too damn perfect to have an enemy so where am i supposed to look obviously mr steadman was a far more complicated man than most people have admitted and his network of relationships wasnt a simple one either his murder wasnt a spur of the moment job or at least the killer was frightened or coldblooded enough to throw us off the scent by moving the body and youre not going to stop pestering us until you know who it is no are you close i cant see it if i am but detection doesnt work like that anyway its not a matter of getting closer like a zoom lens but of getting enough bits and pieces to transform chaos into a recognizable pattern and you never know when you have enough yes but you cant predict when that moment will come it could be in the next ten seconds or the next ten years you dont know what the pattern will look like when its there so you might not even recognize it at first but soon enough youll know youve got a design and not just a filing cabinet full of odds and sods what about money as a motive penny asked harry was very well off he didnt leave a will which was foolish of him naturally it all goes to mrs steadman it would have been more convenient for us if hed left it all to the national trust and we could have pulled in the first nutty conservationist we could find but life isnt as easy as fiction motive and opportunity just dont seem to go together in this case well thats your problem isnt it yes have i explained why im pestering you so much now very clearly thank you penny said giving him a mock bow you dont see michael much these days no not often occasionally in the bridge he was always especially awkward with me after we split up though youre not suggesting that michael is still in love with me are you let me get this right he thought harry and i were having an affair all those years ago and backed off but all the time hes been holding a grudge he worked his way into harrys confidence over the years just looking for an opportunity to do away with him and finally took his revenge am i right banks laughed but it sounded hollow perhaps ramsden did have sufficient motive but he would have been hardpushed to make an opportunity first of all he could hardly come to helmthorpe and hang around in the car park all evening waiting even if he was certain steadman would be going there and if steadman had gone to york how did his car get back to helmthorpe ramsden could hardly have driven two cars and he would have needed his own to get home there were certainly no buses at that time of night and he would not have risked arranging for a taxi its ludicrous penny said as if she had been listening in on bankss thoughts i see what you mean when you say youre stuck she finished her drink put down the glass and stood up to leave banks stayed on drinking rather gloomily and craving another cigarette then hatchley walked in the sergeant brought two pints over and wedged himself into the chair penny had just left any developments banks asked weavers men have talked to someone who saw sally lumb in the public call box on hill road at four oclock friday afternoon hatchley reported and someone else thinks he saw her walking along helmthorpe high street at about nine oclock what direction east she could have been going anywhere except west hatchley said by the way ive been in touch with a mate of mine in york keeps tabs on all the queers and perverts down there and theres nothing on ramsden at all not a dicky bird i didnt think there would be banks said glumly were barking up the wrong tree sergeant thats as maybe but whos going to lead us to the right un banks watched the rain stream down the dirty windowpane and sighed do you think the two are linked he asked steadman and the lumb girl hatchley wiped his lips with the back of his hand and burped bit of a coincidence isnt it the girl has the only piece of real information we get about the dumping of steadmans body and she goes missing but shed already told us what she knew did the killer know that hatchley asked it doesnt matter does it he didnt even know anybody had heard him burying steadman below crow scar unless unless the girl let him know right either intentionally or otherwise but that still assumes she knew more than she told us that she knew who it was not if it was unintentional hatchley pointed out a girl like that tells all her friends maybe hints that she knows more than she does this is a small place remember its not like london its easy to be overheard here and word travels quickly the coffee bar banks muttered come again the coffee bar the place she hung around with her friends come on wed better question those girls again if they know what sally knew they could be in danger as well i didnt want them to think that sally had been killed or that her disappearance had anything to do with steadman but theres no time for softlysoftly any more hatchley gulped down the rest of his pint then dragged himself to his feet and plodded along behind one anne downes was both nervous and excited to find herself in the police station not that it was much of a place but it was alive with important activity people coming and going phones ringing the ancient telex machine clattering the two other girls paid less attention to their surroundings and seemed more preoccupied with their internal sense of unease hazel was the worst biting her nails and shifting position as if she had st vituss dance kathy pretended to lounge coolly casually uninterested in the whole affair but she was biting her lower lip so hard it turned red the policewoman had been friendly enough when shed picked them up at the coffee bar and driven them the short distance to the station and the small attractive chief inspector had smiled and said he wouldnt keep them long but they all knew there was something going on anne was the first to be called into the tiny interview room its walls were bare and the mere two chairs and a table made the place seem overfurnished it was the kind of room that made you claustrophobic banks sat opposite anne and a policewoman with a notebook in her hand stood in the corner by a narrow barred window id just like to ask you a few questions anne banks began she looked at him quizzically from behind the thick lenses and nodded first of all i suppose you know why i want to see you again yes anne replied you think sallys been murdered because of something she knew banks taken aback by her directness asked what her opinion was id say its possible yes anne answered her young brow furrowed in thought ive already told you that i dont believe shes run away or got lost and that doesnt leave much more to choose from does it especially with this other business going on shed make a good detective banks thought quick perceptive logical have you got any other ideas he asked maybe i was wrong anne said her voice beginning to shake wrong about what when i said sally was all talk all big ideas maybe she really did know something maybe she thought shed make a name for herself by following it up why should she do that anne adjusted her glasses and shook her head the thick lenses magnified the tears forming in her eyes i dont know she answered did she tell you anything at all that indicated she knew who the person was think about it anything anne thought and the tears held off no she said finally she just hinted that she knew things that shed solved some kind of mystery i mean yes she did sort of say that she knew who it was but she didnt give us any names or anything she said she had to make sure she didnt want to cause any trouble do sallys parents have a telephone yes theyve had one for ages why can you think of any reason why sally would use a public phone box on friday afternoon no not even if she wanted to call kevin or some other boyfriend i know that parents arent always understanding there was only kevin and sallys mum and dad knew about him they werent a hundred per cent keen but hes a nice enough boy so they didnt make a fuss about it did sally say where she was going on friday evening no id no idea she was going anywhere thank you very much anne banks said the policewoman showed her out and brought kathy chalmers in next kathy was upset by then but there were no tears and although she seemed to realize dimly what it was all about she had nothing to add the last girl hazel kirk was another matter she knew as well as the others what was going on but she pretended ignorance she said she couldnt even remember whether sally had said anything about knowing who the killer was the more banks questioned her the more fidgety and edgy she became finally she burst into tears and told banks to leave her alone he nodded to the policewoman who moved forward to speak to her and left the room sergeant hatchley was sitting on the edge of weavers desk looking over reports from provincial police and railway authorities he glanced up as banks approached any luck banks shook his head the first ones the most intelligent but even she couldnt tell us much what she did say confirms our suspicions though if sally thought she knew who the killer was and arranged for a meeting then we can be pretty sure whats happened to her it must have been someone she knew someone she wasnt afraid of theres got to be a motive dammit and its got to be right before our eyes he banged his fist on the desk surprising hatchley with the sudden violence it reminded the sergeant that his boss came from a tough patch he wasnt a plodder he was used to action got a cigarette banks asked thought youd stopped and taken up pipe puffing hatchley said handing over his packet of senior service not any more i never could stand the blasted thing hatchley smiled and gave him a light then i suggest sir he said that you start buying your own the door of the interview room opened and a pacified hazel kirk came out to rejoin her waiting friends who had all been whispering wondering what was going on the policewoman looking concerned stood in the doorway and beckoned banks over what is it he asked closing the door behind him the girl sir the pc began why she was upset it might mean something well go on sorry sir she got upset because sally had told her she thought she knew who the killer was and when she got home hazel told her parents she paused and banks drew on his cigarette waiting for her to continue they just laughed and said sally lumb always did have an overactive imagination but the girls father had had a bit of a runin with steadman a few weeks ago and hazel thought yes i can imagine what she thought banks said for all his virtues steadman had certainly been a thorn in the side of some locals what was it this time he asked arguments over land or charges of moral laxity sir sorry it doesnt matter banks said go on whats the background she didnt say sir wouldnt im brought in from wensleydale constable weaver might know something yes of course thank you very much constable smithies sir thank you very much constable smithies you did a good job calming her down and getting her to open up like that banks said then left her blushing in the interview room weaver was on the phone when banks reached the desk but he cut the conversation short the weather people from reckston moor sir he explained they say itd be madness to send out search parties on the moors for at least twentyfour hours bloody northern weather banks cursed hatchley eavesdropping grinned and winked at weaver who ignored him they dont expect the rain to let up for a while and the lands boggy visibility is as bad as you can get up the valley sides its all moorland above there sir both ways miles of it yes i know banks said and theres nothing we can do about it is there just make sure everythings set to go the minute the situation improves have you arranged for helicopters yes sir superintendent gristhorpes handling it but they cant go out in this weather no of course not look you know that girl who was in here a few minutes ago weaver nodded hazel kirk yes know anything about her father robert kirk familys been here for generations came from scotland originally what does he do he works at nobles in eastvale you know the big shoe shop in that new shopping centre near the bus station i know it anything else hes very active in the local church sir weaver went on one or two people think hes a bit of a religious nutter if you know what i mean touch of the fire and brimstone strong presbyterian streak his ancestors brought it with them from scotland if you ask me anyway hes always writing letters to the papers about too much sex on television his latest fad is a campaign to ban rock videos and bring censorship into the music business theres not much support for that round here though sir nobody really cares one way or another whats your opinion of him nutty but harmless certain weaver nodded never been in trouble with us sir and he is very religious like wouldnt harm a fly religious people are often the most violent arent the iranians religious anyway have a chat with him would you and ask him what he argued with harold steadman about there wasnt any argument sir weaver replied kirk complained to the headmaster of eastvale comprehensive about letting someone with such lax moral standards as harold steadman mix with teenage girls what its true sir weaver went on grinning hed seen steadman with penny cartwright now and then and to kirk she was nothing less than the whore of babylon remember he was around when penny left helmthorpe in the first place all those rumours of incest then the sodom and gomorrah of the music business steadman would sometimes give hazel and the other girls a ride home from school and hed take them on field trips and invite them to his house kirk complained nobody took him seriously of course i even overheard steadman and his mates having a good chuckle over the business in the bridge one night why didnt you tell me this before banks asked there was something in the icy quietness of his tone that sent danger signals to weaver i it didnt seem important sir didnt seem important banks repeated were investigating a murder laddie do you realize that everythings important even if its not important its important if it has anything to do with the victim and his circle do you understand yes sir weaver said shakily will that be all sir is that all sir is there anything else you ought to tell me no sir i dont think so sir then thats all come on sergeant hatchley lets get back to civilization bit rough on him werent you sir said hatchley as they turned up their collars and walked to their cars it wont kill him think theres owt in it this kirk business no no more than there was in the major unless kirks a serious nutter and weaver assures me he isnt like nearly everything else in this case theres just too much damn gossip thats why its hard to tell the lies from the truth kirk major cartwright nothing but gossip better run a check on his background though just to make sure i suppose he thinks steadman was trying to corrupt his angelic young hazel i wouldnt blame him hatchley said the jeans these kids wear nowadays youd need a bloody shoehorn to get into them banks laughed enough lewd thoughts about teenagers sergeant aye hatchley said its a bloody good job we cant be arrested for what we think look sir theres a tobacconists and its open two it was late sunday afternoon before the rain stopped completely but the first search parties set out at midmorning by then it was only drizzling the clouds had thinned promising a fine day and visibility was good plenty of locals had been willing to go out on saturday despite the weather conditions but they had been warned against doing so the sunday search was coordinated by superintendent gristhorpe who had marked out areas on ordnance survey maps and assigned these to each small party he directed operations from the communications room in eastvale regional headquarters and as the reports came in he shaded the ground that had been covered meanwhile enquiries continued in the major cities in addition to their regular duties police on car and foot patrols in newcastle leeds london liverpool manchester birmingham and other large cities were also keeping an eye out for the young blonde girl theatres drama companies and acting schools were all checked carefully and though numerous sightings were called in and followed up they all proved to be false closer to home robert kirk was investigated questioned and let go for one thing he couldnt drive and certainly nobody had carried harold steadman all the way from helmthorpe to crow scar sallys father enraged with grief after receiving a letter from the marion boyars academy of theatre arts saying they would be pleased to accept sally as a student had begun his search alone on saturday in the rain the weather so affected his rheumatism and his spirits that he was confined to bed by dr barnes the following day charles lumb knew that sally hadnt run away despite their differences anxiety and anger gave way to resignation even if the searchers did find her what state would she be in after three or more nights out in the wilds on sunday the first area searched was the wide stretch of moorland to the north of helmthorpe above crow scar gristhorpe in making his decision realized he might have been influenced by the fact that steadmans body had been found on the northern slopes but he reasoned that the area was after all the wildest spread of countryside seven miles of rough high moors before the next dale and had the greatest number of hiding places old mines steep quarries potholes the only result of sundays effort was an accident in which a police constable drafted in from askrigg fell down a twentyfoot bell pit fortunately his fall was broken by accumulated water and mud but it took over two hours of valuable time to rig up ropes and pull him out up on the moorland two small parties got so bogged down in mud that they were unable to continue and progress everywhere was slow by monday the sun was out to stay and conditions had improved gristhorpe who had been up since five in the morning sat redeyed in the communications room logging checkin calls from search parties and the map before him soon began to look like a chessboard this was one task he refused to delegate at about three oclock the superintendent took sergeant rowes advice and dropped by bankss office to suggest a walk they walked into market street which was crowded with tourists from the nearby cities who seeing an end to the rain had decided on an afternoon out it was also market day and the cobbled square in front of the church was thronged with colourful stalls selling everything from marks and spencer rejects to dinner sets and toiletbowl brushes there were stalls of secondhand paperbacks yards of plain and patterned material cotton linen muslin rayon denim cheesecloth spilling over almost to the ground and stalls piled with crockery and cutlery skilled vendors drew crowds by shouting out the virtues of their wares as they juggled plates and saucers the people milled around to listen take photographs and occasionally to buy things in the narrow twisting side streets around the central market square old alleys where the sun never penetrated and you could shake hands across secondstorey bay windows the small souvenir and local delicacy shops with magnifyingglass windows did good business everything from toffee and tea to spoons and fluffy toys was labelled yorkshire no matter where it had actually been made gristhorpe directed banks to a small tea shop and the two of them settled down to tea and buns gristhorpe ran his hand through his thick messy mop of grey hair and smiled weakly had to get out for a bit he said spooning sugar into his mug it gets so damn stuffy in that little room you look allin banks said lighting a benson and hedges special mild perhaps you should go home and get some sleep gristhorpe grunted and waved away the smoke thought youd given that filthy habit up he grumbled anyway i suppose i am tired im not as young as i used to be but its not just tiredness alan have you ever taken part in an operation like this before not a search in open country no ive looked for missing teens in soho but nothing like this in these conditions do you think theres any hope gristhorpe shook his head slowly no i think the girls been killed stupid bloody kid why couldnt she have come to us banks had no answer have you been involved in this kind of search before he asked more than twenty years ago now gristhorpe said adding an extra spoonful of sugar to his tea and this makes it feel like only yesterday who was it young girl called lesley ann downey only ten and a lad called john kilbride twelve youll have heard about all that though brady and hindley the moors murders you were in on that manchester brought some of us in for the search its not that far away you know still that was different sir brady and hindley were involved in nazism torture fetishism you name it this time its more calculated if were right i dont know which is worse the results the same aye gristhorpe gulped some tea and nibbled at his bun getting anywhere banks shook his head nothing new hacketts in the clear now barnes too by the looks of it were stuck its always like that when the trail goes cold you know that as well as i do alan if the answer isnt staring you in the face within twentyfour hours the whole thing goes stale when you get stuck you just have to push a bit harder thats all sometimes you get lucky ive been thinking about the time of sally lumbs disappearance banks said trying to waft his smoke away from gristhorpe she was last seen on helmthorpe high street walking east around nine oclock on friday evening well i was in helmthorpe at that time in the dog and gun with sandra and a couple of friends we went to listen to penny cartwright sing jack barker was there too so that lets them off the hook no sir thats just it she finished her first set just after nine then she and barker disappeared from the pub for about an hour right after sally had been seen in the village yes better follow it up then what do you think ive talked to them both a couple of times theyre difficult sharp if i were easily swayed by sentiment id say no not a chance penny cartwright seems sincere and barkers a clever bugger but likeable enough when you take the time to chat to him he swears blind hed nothing to do with steadmans death but ive met some damn good liars in my time hes got no alibi and he might have been jealous about steadman and the cartwright woman gristhorpe ate the final few crumbs of his bun and suggested they carry on walking they headed east and looped down by the river near the terraced gardens the swains filling up gristhorpe said i hope we dont have a bloody flood to contend with too does that happen often often enough usually at spring thaw after a particularly snowy winter but if you get enough water channelled down from the dales it might break the banks here they turned up a dank waterside alley where moss and lichen grew on the rough stone skirted the base of castle hill and arrived back at the market square gristhorpe headed straight for the communications room and banks accompanied him there was nothing new three even purcells hail bright cecilia failed to cheer banks up as he drove into helmthorpe that evening when he walked along high street past the gift shop with its revolving racks of postcards and the small newsagents with the evening papers outside fluttering in the light breeze he could sense the mood of the village nothing was obvious people went about their business as usual shutting up shop for the day and coming home from work but it felt like a place that had drawn in on itself even the air despite the wind seemed tight and grim the small noises footsteps doors opening distant telephones ringing sounded eerie and isolated against the backdrop of the silent green valley sides and massive brow of crow scar bright in the evening sun push gristhorpe had said so push he would push hard enough in the right places and something would give push those closest to steadman penny ramsden emma barker for if none of them had actually done it banks was sure that one of them knew who had he would probably have to revisit darnley and talbot too there was something one of them had said a chance remark a throwaway line that banks felt was important but he couldnt remember what it was it would return to him in time he knew but he couldnt afford to sit and wait he had to push would sally lumb have confronted any of them with her evidence he asked himself as he took the short cut through the cemetery and turned right along the pathway to gratly it didnt seem likely she wasnt a fool but she had phoned someone and had used a public call box for privacy it must then have been someone she knew someone she had no reason to fear the sheep on his right fled and stood facing the drystone wall their backs to him the ones on his left scampered down the grassy terraces to the stream and stood bleating under the willows funny creatures banks thought if theyre frightened they simply run a short distance and turn their backs it might be effective against people who wish them no harm but he doubted if it would deter a hungry wolf emma steadman was watching television but turned the sound down after banks followed her into the living room the place was much barer now that most of the books and records were gone it was more of an empty shell than a home banks waited until emma had made some tea then sat opposite her at the low table ive been meaning to ask you a few things for a while now he said mostly to do with the past the past yes those wonderful summers you used to have up here when the ramsden family ran the guest house what about them you dont mind do you she asked picking up some knitting it helps me relax takes my mind off things sorry go ahead not at all its just that the impression i got was of your husband running around the dales with penny cartwright while michael ramsden buried his head in his books emma smiled but said nothing and you never thought anything of it perhaps if youd known my husband chief inspector you wouldnt think anything of it either but somethings missing what you what were you doing emma sighed and put her knitting down on her lap contrary to what you seem to believe im not simply a passive housewife i did have and still do have interests of my own back in leeds i was involved in amateur dramatics for a while on holidays in gratly i used to knit and read i even tried my hand at writing a few short stories unsuccessfully im afraid but i cant prove it i threw them away i also went for walks alone yes alone is that so strange banks shrugged what you seem to forget is that we were only up here for a month or so at a time during that period i spent a lot more time with my husband than you think i did accompany them sometimes especially if they went by car but im very susceptible to the sun so i never ventured far on sunny days unless i could find some shade i still fail to see why you find all this so fascinating sometimes present events have their roots in the past did you enjoy your visits they made a nice break leeds isnt the cleanest city in the world i enjoyed the fresh air the landscape one more thing ive been given to believe that your husband was universally liked even teddy hackett who had good reason to disagree with him thought of him as a friend since ive been looking into his death though ive found at least two people who didnt feel the same way major cartwright and robert kirk we might regard them as cranks but im beginning to wonder if theres anyone else someone i dont know about you were a close group all those years ago and your husband was still close to michael ramsden and penny cartwright when he died was there anybody else around anybody who might have held a grudge emma steadman pursed her lips and shook her head slowly think about it i am of course there were other people around but i cant imagine any of them had a reason to harm harold the point is mrs steadman that somebody did and if none of you can help me find out who it was i dont know who can is there any reason why he was killed at this particular time rather than say a year ago or five years ago ive no idea you must know something about his affairs was he planning to do anything with his money write a will leave it to the national trust or something was there any other land he was after anyone elses toes he was treading on no no to all those questions and i think i would have known yes well that doesnt leave much does it you think one of us did it dont you banks kept silent do you think i did it for his money you couldnt have could you maybe you think mrs stanton was lying to give me an alibi no then why keep bothering me i only buried my husband a few days ago as banks could think of no answer to that question he sighed and got up to leave before emma closed the door on him he turned and spoke again just consider what i said will you try to remember any enemies your husband might have made however insignificant they might have seemed at the time think about it ill be back penny cartwright was listening to music and when she grudgingly let banks in flashing him a you again look she didnt bother to turn it down i wont keep you banks said sitting on a hardbacked chair by the window and lighting a cigarette its just about the other night what night theres been a lot lately penny said pouring herself a drink friday night what about it you were singing at the dog and gun remember penny scowled at him of course i remember you were there too what is this just refreshing your memory between sets you went off with jack barker you were gone for about an hour where were you whats that got to do with anything look its about time you got this right i ask the questions you answer understand oh poor inspector banks penny cooed have i been undermining your authority her eyes challenged him what was the question again friday night between sets where were you we went for a walk where oh hither and thither can you be more specific not really i go for a lot of walks theres a lot of places to walk around helmthorpe thats why so many tourists come here in summer stop the games and tell me where you went or else after a thirtysecond staring match penny looked away and reached for a cigarette all right she said we came here what for what do you think sex thats not the kind of question a lady answers and its nothing to do with your investigation banks leaned forward and spoke quietly would it interest you to know that ive got a damned good idea why you came here and ive got some colleagues back in eastvale whod be more than happy to come out here and prove it for me help me and you help yourself im not admitting anything where were you at four oclock on friday afternoon i was here practising why anybody with you no there usually isnt when i practise did you receive any telephone calls penny looked confused telephone calls no what are you getting at and you refuse to tell me what you did during the interval on friday evening wait a minute sally sally lumb she disappeared on friday didnt she christ you bastard she glared at banks angry tears made her eyes glitter are you implying that i had something to do with that what did you do if you already know why do you want me to tell you i need to hear it from you penny sagged in her chair and looked away all right so we came back here and smoked a couple of joints big deal is that what you wanted to hear what are you going to do now bring in the dogs and tear the place apart banks stood up to leave im not going to do anything i remember the difference between the last set and the first how you seemed more remote detached if its any consolation to you he said opening the door i believe you and im glad i was right but penny didnt move or say anything to make his exit easier four later as penny lay in bed that night unable to sleep the images came again just as they had been coming ever since harold steadmans death those summers so long ago innocent idyllic or so they had seemed it was a time she had had neither reason nor inclination to think about over the past ten years the kind of period like an idealized childhood that one looks back on when one gets older and life loses its edge life had been too busy too exciting and when she finally had crashed she had been as far in her mind from idyllic summers as ever a person could be it had seemed then that her earlier life had been lived by somebody else next she had come back to helmthorpe where they were all together again now harold was dead and that wretched detective was probing asking questions churning up memories like tides stir sand so she reexamined it she reran the walks to wensleydale along the pennine way and the drives to richmond or the lake district in harolds old morris like old movies and she spotted things she had never noticed at the time little things vague and unclear but certainly disturbing and the more she thought about old times the less she liked what she was thinking she turned over again and tried to cast the images from her mind they were like dreams she told herself she had taken the truth in all its purity and warped it in her imagination that must be what had happened the problem was that now these dreams seemed so real she couldnt shake them and she wouldnt rest until she knew what was fantasy and what was reality how could the past something that had really happened become so altered so unclear and as she finally drifted towards sleep she began to wonder what she should do about it one the numerous becks that ran down the slopes of swainsdale to the river were flowing copiously bringing rainwater from the higher land a fine mist like babys hair rose from the valley sides as the sun warmed the waterlogged earth the colours were newly rinsed too fresh vibrant greens sloped up from the road and bright skullcaps of purple heather softened by the thin veil of mist fringed the peaks penny walking with jack barker along high street was the first to notice a small crowd gathered on the bridge under which a combination of becks grown almost to the strength of a river themselves cascaded from the southern heights down to the swain a woman in a sleeveless yellow dress was pointing up the valley side and the others followed her gaze leaning over the low stone parapet penny and barker soon reached the spot and stopped to see what the excitement was they had an uninterrupted view up the dale side along the becks course on to which backed several gardens full of bright flowers some distance away they could see what looked like a childs rag doll tumbling recklessly down the swollen stream it was hypnotic penny thought to watch the thing turn cartwheels and flail snag on the rocks and break free as the water pushed and dragged it then the woman in the yellow dress put her hand over her mouth and gasped the others including penny whose longdistance eyesight had never been good leaned further over and screwed up their eyes to peer more closely it was only after the shock wave had rippled through the crowd that penny realized what was happening it was not a rag doll that came head over heels down the stream but a body tufts of clothing still clung to the torn flesh it looked raw like a side of beef in a butchers window patches of skin had been ripped clean off hair torn away from the scalp and splintered bones stuck through at elbows and shins there was no face to recognize but penny knew as did all the other locals on the bridge that it was the body of sally lumb come back to the village where she was born penny wrenched her eyes away while barker and the others still stared in disbelief somebody mentioned an ambulance somebody else the police and the group split up in chaos penny and barker walked in a daze until they got to the hare and hounds then they went inside and ordered double scotches seen a ghost the barman asked something like that barker said and gave a garbled version of what had happened soon customers went streaming out to look leaving drinks on tables cardigans and handbags on chairs the barman gave them each another double scotch on the house and rushed off to see himself the pub was empty anybody could have walked in and robbed the place blind but nobody did penny downed the fiery whisky she was aware of her hand gripping barkers so tight that the nails must have dug into his flesh two its a bugger alan gristhorpe said rubbing his eyes which had lost much of their childlike innocence through lack of sleep he looked tired pale and hurt as if the whole affair done right on his doorstep was a personal affront a bugger they were in the queens arms opposite the station and it was almost afternoon closing time only a few dedicated drinkers and tourists in need of a late sandwich and shandy sat scattered around the lounge weve got nothing so far the superintendent went on sniffing as banks lit a cigarette the body was so bloody waterlogged and badly battered glendenning couldnt give us any idea of what killed her for all he can say she might have fallen in and hit her head or just drowned a full autopsys going to take time and even then they cant promise owt whats glendenning doing now you know him alan couldnt wait to get at it stomach contents organs tissue samples god knows theyve got to keep looking it could even be poison what do you think banks asked sipping his pint of theakstons bitter gristhorpe shook his head i dont know theyve got their jobs to do does it matter what killed her at this point if were right and its what we think it is there was probably just a blow to the head like steadman glendenning might not even be able to verify that i just wish we knew a bit more about why it happened banks said certainly i think theres a connection to the steadman case has to be i just dont know what it is the girl knew something and instead of coming to me she confronted the killer i suppose she wasnt sure and simply wanted to find out for herself add it all up and weve still got nothing so she knew something what she phoned someone who why they met where we might be able to answer that last one soon gristhorpe said ive got men following the becks all the way up the hillside looking for physical evidence therell be some kind of grisly map of her progress three thats scotched work for today jack barker punned weakly as he accepted his third refill from penny it was over two hours since they had seen the wreckage of sally lumb tumble down the valley side penny had stopped after her second drink but barker was still at it maybe you shouldnt penny warned him its already too late thanks for your concern though when penny looked down at barker she felt the stirring of something like love whatever it was the feeling disoriented her and she was angry with herself for not knowing what to do though it had felt good at first when they had come back to the cottage and he had held her she hated the feelings of weakness that came with it she knew that her feelings for him were not platonic but instead of reaching out she drew in and strengthened her shell barker seemed to sense something of her chaotic emotions she thought when he reached out again for her hand which she allowed him to hold lightly i suppose i always did have a weak stomach he said pathetic really isnt it here i am writing about blood and guts for a living and as soon as i see his words trailed off and he started to shake he put his glass on the table spilling some scotch as he did so then penny sat beside him and held him it seemed ages to her before either of them moved and each would have said the other broke away first you should get some sleep jack penny said softly what the hells going on penny he asked whats happening to this place i dont know penny answered stroking his hair at least i what nothing she said or maybe nothing i dont know but its got to stop four under a packhorse bridge banks said thats what the super told me on the south slope what does that mean sandra asked they were having an early evening drink in the queens arms sandra had just finished shopping and banks had suggested that as they had seen so little of one another the past few days they meet for a chat brian and tracy were old enough to manage on their own for an hour or two it means he was wrong about where to look first and hes kicking himself for that but he couldnt have known sandra said it made perfect sense to look on the north side first thats what everyone says but you know what hes like yes just like you stubborn takes it all on himself hell get over it banks said anyway they found clothes fibres on the stones under this bridge she must have been hidden there and covered with stones then when the heavy rains came some of the stones were washed aside and she was carried down the valley theyve not found any traces above the bridge and it looked like an ideal place isolated but accessible by car just does it help finding the body not really not the state its in and too much time has gone by well ask around of course anybody heading that way or back but we cant expect too much whoever were dealing with is smart and hes not likely to make silly mistakes this probably had to be done in a hurry though sandra reminded him there wouldnt have been much time for planning still its not going to be easy is it ever banks shrugged and lit a cigarette by the way sandra said i havent had a chance to say so before now but im glad you got rid of that bloody pipe it didnt suit me no too country life sandra laughed yes id say so youd not fool many though least of all yourself theres not many would say theyre glad to see a person smoke either banks said holding out the pack while sandra an occasional smoker helped herself but i do intend to cut down and stick to these mild things promises the girl you know banks said after a brief pause was a virgin as far as forensic could make out hadnt been shot stabbed poisoned or sexually assaulted virgin i wonder if thats a good thing sandra asked what that she hadnt been assaulted no that she died a virgin it wont make any difference to her now poor beggar said banks and i doubt its the kind of thing they inscribe on tombstones but at least we can be sure she wasnt tormented or tortured she probably died very quickly without even knowing what was happening are you going to get the killer soon alan sandra asked swirling the smooth fragments of ice in the bottom of her glass and dont treat me like a reporter be honest id like to say yes but weve got so damn little to go on we can trace the girls movements until about nine oclock friday evening and thats it while we were at the folk club yes sandra shivered we were so close does that make a difference its just a funny feeling thats all what about the writer and the singer she could be protecting him or they could be working together its hard to know what to believe when things are clouded by so much gossip the others all go back so far too lord knows what complex webs of feelings theyve set up between one another over the years it seems to me that in a place like helmthorpe emotions go deeper and last longer than in a big city nonsense think about all those feuds and gang rivalries in london thats business in a way i mean the ordinary things between people who had the best motive sandra asked the one with the least opportunity banks smiled at the irony thats if you call a lot of money a good motive there could also be all kinds of jealousies involved thats why i cant leave barker and penny cartwright out of it altogether the wife inherits yes she came in for some bridge work yesterday what did you think of her i didnt see much of her really only when she came to the window to confirm her appointment she seemed quite an attractive woman she didnt look much to me thats typical of a man sandra said all you can see is the surface but you must admit shes let herself go it looks like it yes sandra said slowly but i dont think so its all there shes fine under all those awful clothes her bone structures good too of course if youd known her before or not seen her for a long time shed definitely look as if shed gone downhill i suppose a pretty young thing pardon oh nothing banks said just remembering something go on all im saying is the potentials there for her to be an attractive woman she cant be much older than me late thirties well then she must only look plain because she wants to because it doesnt matter to her not all women are obsessed with their looks you know perhaps there are other things more important to her perhaps what youre saying banks went on slowly is that with the right hairstyle good clothes and a little makeup she could be quite a stunner yes five penny was at the stove roasting spices for a curry when barker made his way down the narrow stairs so the sleeper awakes she greeted him what time is it seven oclock at night yes its still the same day hungry i shouldnt think so with a hangover like you must have anyway im making a curry take it or leave it your generosity and grace overwhelm me barker said as a matter of fact i dont feel too bad ive just got a hell of a headache aspirins in the bathroom cabinet what happened barker asked you mean you dont remember not after the third drink or was it the fourth he rubbed his eyes with his knuckles you really dont remember penny repeated sounding shocked well thats a fine compliment isnt it you mean penny laughed dont be a fool jack im only kidding you got tired and i helped you upstairs to sleep it off thats all all yes you dont think id fall into bed with you the way you were earlier do you ill get some aspirin jack said and made his painful way back upstairs to the bathroom well let that simmer for a while penny said when he came back and have a sitdown drink my god no barker groaned but on the other hand hair of the dog and all that not whisky though beer do yes sam smiths fine good its all ive got chilled too penny got the beer and barker sat on the sofa drinking out of the bottle what you said penny he began about not you know sleeping with me in a state like that i doubt youd have been able to get it up would you she mocked a mischievous smile crinkling the corners of her mouth i might be a bit slow barker replied but are you implying that if id been sober i mean you might actually you know penny put her finger to his lips and stopped him thats for me to know and you to find out she said dammit penny he said you cant just ignore me half the time and then tease me the rest its not fair im upset enough as it is about the girl floating down and all that im sorry jack it just doesnt come out right i stop one game and start another dont i thats how it seems why dont you give me a straight answer whats the question ive already asked you oh that im glad you were drunk jack because no i dont think i would have is that straight enough it seems to be barker said disappointment clear in his tone penny went on quickly its not as simple as you think what i mean is im glad i wasnt forced into making a decision there and then im weak i might have said yes and regretted it it would have been so easy then so natural to make love after being confronted with death but i wouldnt have been able to get sally out of my mind that awful torn body i understand that but why would you regret it penny shrugged lots of reasons so much has happened its too quick too soon it would be easy to jump into bed with you youre an attractive man but i want more than that jack i dont just want to be like one of the bimbos you sleep with when youre down in london publicizing your books i dont and you never could be whatever ive had enough disappointments in my life i want some stability i know it sounds conventional and corny but i want to settle down and i think i might be better off doing it by myself im not one of these women who depends on a man its just as well im hardly dependable barker lit a cigarette and coughed look he said i dont care whether this is the right place and time or what it is but i love you penny thats what im trying to get at not whether youll sleep with me or not there ive said it maybe ive made a fool of myself penny looked at him carefully for a long time then she said i dont know if i can handle being in love try it barker said leaning forward and stroking her hair you never know you might like it penny looked away barker moved closer and took her in his arms she tensed but didnt break the embrace finally she disengaged herself and looked at him seriously dont expect too much of me she said im used to fending for myself and i like it you and i jack said weve been living alone so long its frightening to think about change so lets just take it easy slowly a bell rang in the kitchen thats telling me the currys ready penny got up barker followed her into the kitchen and leaned in the narrow doorway as she stirred the pungent sauce do you know he said it took that bloody policeman as you call him to make me realize that i was jealous of you and harry i wondered why the hell should you give so much of yourself to him and so little to me thats not fair jack pennys face darkened as she turned to him dont talk like that you sound just like banks im sorry barker apologized i didnt mean anything by it forget it the past wont go away penny barker said theres a lot of things need explaining like what penny asked suspiciously taking the pot off the ring you know more about it than i do more about what everything thats happened come on penny dont tell me you havent got any ideas you know more about this business than youre letting on why should you think that i dont really know barker answered its just that youve been awfully mysterious and touchy about it these past few days penny turned back to the curry in silence well barker asked well what do you do i what oh come on you know what i mean do you know something i dont how do i know what you know i dont know anything do you of course not penny said putting the curry into dishes its your imagination jack you writers dont you think if i knew something id tell you as a matter of fact i dont sally lumb didnt tell anyone either or she told the wrong person and you think it was me dont be ridiculous go on you might as well say it penny shouted brandishing the spoon like a club just like banks go on i dont know what youre talking about friday evening when she disappeared but we were in the dog and gun not all the time so you came home for a rest and i went for a walk so what you dont know know what banks hasnt been to pester you about what thats when sally was last seen while we were away somebody saw her in high street about nine oclock so banks thinks penny shrugged he asked me you no ive not seen him for a few days you will hes getting very pushy i suppose he must be desperate surely you dont think i was implying you had anything to do with it well werent you id hardly declare my undying love to someone i thought was a murderess would i penny smiled and what about you he went on do you believe me about what that i just went for a walk well yes of course i do i dont even remember how all this started i was simply asking you if you knew anything you hadnt told me thats all and i thought id answered that penny said her dark eyes narrowing ive been no more mysterious about it than you have oh come off it penny you cant get out of it that easily youve been around here much longer than i have youre bound to know more about what goes on than i do you seem to be treating me like a criminal jack is this your idea of love if this is what it comes down to just how bloody jealous were you forget it barker sighed just forget i opened my mouth id like to jack i really would they eyed each other warily then penny broke off to carry the bowls through to the dining table she pushed one towards barker who sat down to eat youve put me in a right mood for a romantic candlelight dinner you have she complained im not even hungry now try some barker said offering her a spoonful its very good ive lost my appetite penny reached for a cigarette then changed her mind and picked up her jacket im going out but you cant barker protested weve got a lot to talk about what about the candles youve made dinner eat it yourself penny told him opening the door eat the bloody candles too for all i care barker half rose from the table but where are you going to see a man about a dog she said and slammed the door behind her six though the sun still lingered low on the horizon it was dark on market street in the shadow of the buildings on the western side and the cobbled square was deserted banks hadnt even bothered to turn on his office light after returning to go over his notes sandra had gone home to assure brian and tracy that they werent becoming latchkey children the door was closed and the dark room was full of smoke occasionally he heard footsteps in the corridor outside but nobody seemed to know he was there as was his habit when a case felt near to its end he sat by the window smoking and rearranged the details in his mind four or five times after about an hour things still looked the same the pattern the picture was complete and however unbelievable it was it had to be right eliminate the impossible and whatever is left however improbable must be the truth or so sherlock holmes had said it was time for action banks played no music as he drove towards the purplishred sunset west along swainsdale his mind was far too active to take in anything more finally he swung up the hill to gratly turned sharp left after the bridge and pulled up outside the steadman house there were no lights on banks cursed and walked down the path to mrs stantons oh hello inspector she greeted him i didnt expect to see you again please come in thank you very much banks said but i dont think i will im a bit pushed for time if you could just answer a couple of quick questions mrs stanton frowned and nodded first of all have you any idea where mrs steadman is no i havent i think i heard her car about an hour or so ago but ive no idea where she was going did you see her no i wasnt looking even if i was it wouldnt matter though theyve got a door from the kitchen goes straight into the garage money she said theyve even got those automatic doors just press a button which direction did she drive off in well she didnt come past here so she went east aye do you remember that saturday you spent watching television with her mrs stanton nodded slowly do you know if she went out again after she got home mrs stanton shook her head i certainly didnt hear her and i was up for more than an hour pottering around last friday night did she go out at all couldnt tell you inspector that was my bingo night your husband pub as usual this was a regular friday night arrangement ha for him its a reglar every night arrangement and you aye i go to bingo every friday so does half of swainsdale mrs steadman never not her not that shes a snob mind what pleases some folks leaves others cold each to his own is what i say thank you very much mrs stanton banks said leaving her mystified as he got back into the cortina and set off toward helmthorpe he parked illegally in high street by the church right at the bottom of pennys street there was a light on in her front room banks walked quickly up the path and knocked he was surprised when jack barker answered the door come in chief inspector barker said pennys not here im afraid or have you come to ask me where i was on friday evening banks ignored the taunt he had no time for games has she said anything odd lately about the steadman business he asked puzzled barker shook his head no why because i got the impression she was holding something back something she might not have been sure about herself i was hoping i could persuade her to tell me what it was barker lit a cigarette as a matter of fact he said penny has been a bit strange the few times ive seen her lately secretive and touchy she hasnt said anything though banks sat down and began tapping the frayed arm of the chair you two he said looking around the room are you er playing house not really no such luck i was here for dinner we just had a bit of a row about the very thing you just mentioned actually she left and im waiting for her to come back oh i suggested she knew more than she was letting on and she accused me of treating her like a criminal just like you did thats what she thinks well you have been giving her a rough time you cant deny it banks looked at his watch is she coming back soon ive no idea no idea where is she i told you barker said we had a row and she stormed out where to i dont know did she say anything she said she was going to see a man about a dog a lot of help that is just what i thought and youd been on at her about knowing something yes did she take the car yes right banks got to his feet come on without thinking barker jumped up and obeyed the command banks only gave him time to blow out the candles and lock the door look whats going on barker asked as they shot into the darkening dale youre driving like a bloody lunatic is something wrong is penny in danger why should she be for christs sake i dont know but youre behaving damned oddly if you ask me what the hells happening banks didnt reply he focused all his concentration on driving and the silence intensified as darkness grew on the northern outskirts of eastvale he turned on to the york road where are we going barker asked a few minutes later almost there banks replied and i want you to do exactly as i say remember that ive only brought you with me because i know youre fond of penny and you happened to be in her house id no time to waste and you might be some use but do as i say he broke off to overtake a lorry barker gripped the dashboard so youve not brought me along for the pleasure of my company give me a break seriously chief inspector is she in danger i dont know i dont know what were going to find dont worry though it wont be long now he said and the tyres squealed as he turned sharp left about a quarter of a mile along the bumpy minor road banks pulled into a driveway and barker pointed and said thats her car thats pennys car a face peered through a chink in the curtains as they jumped out of the cortina and hurried towards the door no time for pleasantries banks said after trying the handle to no avail he stood back and gave a hard kick which splintered the wood around the lock and sent the door flying open with barker close behind he rushed into the living room and quickly took in the strange tableau there were three people michael ramsden stood facing banks whitefaced and slackjawed penny lay inert on the couch and a woman stood with her back to them all in a split second it came to life barker gasped and ran over to penny and ramsden started to shake my god he groaned i knew this would happen i knew it shut up the woman said and turned to face banks she wore a clinging red dress that accentuated her curves her hair was drawn back into a tight v on her forehead and carefully applied blusher highlighted the cheekbones of her heartshaped face but the most striking thing about her was her eyes before banks had only seen them watery and distorted through thick lenses but now she was wearing contacts they were the chilly green of moss on stones and the power that shone through them was hard and piercing it was emma steadman transformed almost beyond recognition ramsden collapsed into an armchair head in hands whimpering while emma continued to glare at banks you bastard she said and spat at him you ruined it all then she lapsed into a silence he never heard her break one but ramsden talked as willingly as a sinner in the confessional and what he said over the first two hours following his arrest gave the police enough evidence to charge both of them banks was astonished at ramsdens compulsion to unburden himself and realized only then what terrible pressure the man must have been under what inner control he must have exerted as for penny she said she had been doing a great deal of thinking over the last few days steadmans death bankss questions and sallys disappearance had all forced her to look more deeply into a past she had ignored for so long and especially into the events of a summer ten years ago at first she remembered nothing she hadnt lied everything had seemed innocent to her but then she said the more she found herself dwelling on the memory the more little things seemed to take on greater significance than they had done at the time glances exchanged between emma steadman and michael ramsden had they really happened or were they just her imagination ramsdens insistent overtures then his increasing lack of interest again had it really happened that way was there perhaps a simple explanation all these things had inflamed her curiosity finally after the argument with jack barker she knew it wouldnt all just go away she had to do something or her doubts about the past would poison any chance of a future so she went to visit ramsden to find out if there was any truth in her suspicions yes she knew what had happened to sally lumb and she also knew the police linked the girls death to steadmans but she honestly didnt believe she had anything to fear from michael ramsden after all theyd known each other off and on since childhood she questioned ramsden and finding his responses nervous and evasive pushed even harder they drank tea and ate biscuits and ramsden tried to convince her that there was nothing in her fears eventually she found difficulty focusing the room darkened and she felt as if she were looking at it through the wrong end of a telescope then penny fell asleep when she awoke she was in barkers arms and it was all over banks told her that ramsden had sworn he wouldnt have hurt her true he had drugged her with some prescription nembutal and driven to the public telephone on the main road to send for emma but only because he was confused and didnt know what to do when emma had insisted that they would have to kill penny because she knew too much ramsden claimed that he had tried to stand up to her she had called him weak and said she would do what was necessary if he wasnt man enough she said it would be easy to arrange an accident according to ramsden they were still arguing when banks and barker arrived penny listened to all this at about one oclock in the morning over a pot of fresh coffee in bankss smoky office all she could say when he had finished was i was right wasnt i he wouldnt have hurt me banks shook his head he would he insisted if emma steadman told him to two it was a couple of days before all the loose ends were tied up hatchley made notes and wrote up the statements complaining all the while about dc richmond sunning himself in surrey and gristhorpe went over the details emma steadman said nothing she didnt even bother to deny ramsdens accusations to banks she was a woman who had risked everything and lost there was no room for regret or recrimination now it was all over later in the week banks took sandra over to helmthorpe where they heard penny sing at a special memorial concert for sally lumb afterwards as it was a warm night and the show ended early they went with penny and jack barker for a drink in the beer garden of the dog and gun crow scar gathered the failing light and gleamed as the hills around it fell into shadow it looked like a pale curtain hanging in the sky sandra and the others pressed banks for an explanation of the steadman business and though he felt very uncomfortable in the role they forced on him he did feel he owed barker and penny something nor had he had much time to talk to sandra since the arrests and she had helped him arrive at the correct pattern when did it start sandra asked first about ten years back banks told her that makes penny here sixteen michael ramsden eighteen steadman about thirtythree and his wife just twentyeight harold steadman had a promising career as a university lecturer if he wasnt exactly rich he was certainly comfortably off and he did have the inheritance to look forward to emma too must have been quite pleased with life in those days but i imagine she quickly got bored she was beginning to fade into the background like so many faculty wives when i talked to talbot and darnley two of steadmans colleagues at leeds university one of them remembered emma as a pretty young thing at first then she just seemed to disappear into the woodwork i dare say shed have liked to go abroad for her holidays more often but no steadman had discovered helmthorpe gratly rather and that satisfied all his requirements for a busmans holiday so that was that for emma life seemed to be passing by too quickly and too dully and she felt too young to give it all up that summer was beautiful just like this one banks paused to look around at the other drinkers with their jackets and cardigans hung on the backs of chairs how often can you do this in england he asked sipping chilled lager especially in yorkshire anyway penny and michael were the pride of the village two bright kids with their whole lives ahead of them michael was a lean serious romantic young fellow and if he imagined he was losing penny to an older wiser man then he still had a steady diet of keats and shelley to keep him nicely melancholy penny here simply enjoyed steadmans company as shes told me often enough they had a lot in common and there were no amorous inclinations on either side or if there were they were well repressed he glanced at penny who looked down into her beer so banks went on after a deep breath one sunny day pennys out with steadman looking at the roman excavations in fortford say and michaels languishing in the garden reading ode to a nightingale or something his parents are out shopping in leeds or york and wont be back till its time to prepare the evening meal emma steadman is moping around the place staying out of the sun and probably feeling bored and neglected im making this up by the way ramsden didnt give me a blow by blow account anyway emma seduces young michael not so difficult when you consider his age and his obsession with sex surely its every schoolboys fantasy the experienced older woman to emma he must have seemed like a younger more vital version of her husband perhaps he wrote poetry for her he was certainly gawky and shy and she gave him his first sexual experience most people probably thought of emma steadman as a married woman going quickly to seed but michael made her feel wanted and then she began to see definite advantages in not being thought particularly attractive that way nobody would think of her as the type to be having an affair banks stopped to drink some more lager pleased to see that he hadnt lost his audience the affair went on over the years he continued there were gaps and breaks of course but ramsden told us they often got together in london when emma went down for a weekends shopping or when she went to norwich to visit her family i dont think her husband paid her a great deal of attention he was far too busy poring over ruins anyway emma developed a powerful hold over michael as his first lover she had a natural advantage she taught him all he knew and he was still shy in company and found it hard to meet girls his own age but why bother emma was there and she gave him all he needed far more than the inexperienced girls of his own age group could have given him and in turn he made her feel young sexy and powerful they fed off each other i suppose over the years emma developed two distinct personalities now im not suggesting for a moment that shes mentally ill theres nothing at all clinically wrong with her all her actions were deliberate willed calculated but she had one face for the world and another for ramsden if you think about it it wasnt that difficult for her to change her appearance she only had to do it to please ramsden and he was strongly under her influence anyway visiting him in london would have been no problem of course but even after she moved to gratly and he moved to york it was simple enough she could easily do herself up a bit in the car on the way to see him a little makeup a hairbrush she could even change her clothes after she arrived if she wanted with harold gone it was even easier her neighbour told me theres a door from the kitchen right into the garage and its a lonely road over the moors to ramsdens place but it wasnt just looks it was attitude too with ramsden she felt her sexual power something that was more or less turned off the rest of the time as time went by everything she expected to happen happened steadman threw himself more and more into his work and she found herself except for ramsden increasingly isolated why did she stay with her husband im only guessing here but i can think of two good reasons first of all security and secondly the promise of the inheritance the possibility that things might improve when they became rich and what happens the money comes through all right but nothing changes in fact things get worse and here i can sympathize with her to some extent shes a woman with dreams travel excitement wealth a social life but all that happens is her husband buys the ramsden house and she ends up even more bored and cut off while he spends the money on historical research a dedicated man even though i cant condone what she did to him i can understand why she was driven to it steadman wasnt exactly sensitive to her needs emotional or material he was selfish and mean there they were rich as bloody croesus and he spends his time drinking in the bridge and his money on his work im sure emma steadman would have preferred the country club in fact she was little more than a prisoner and the only person her husband was really close to was penny again thats not quite true penny said he was close to michael he liked him yes banks agreed but that was much more of a working relationship michael was of use to him i think they were colleagues or partners rather than friends dont forget michael killed him she made him yes but he did it a waiter came out and they ordered another round go on penny urged him after the drinks arrived michael ramsden is ambitious but hes weak hes not good with people he shared steadmans interests yes but he wasnt obsessed a word that offended one of steadmans colleagues but apt i think also ramsden resented harold steadman and this really had nothing to do with you penny even if he did feel jealous all those years ago no he resented steadman in the way many of us come to detest people we first set up as examples models call them what you will he hated always playing second fiddle the publisher the assistant never the creative one the leader although he was busy working on a novel himself emma must have played on this i think dwelling on her husbands bad points when she was with ramsden playing on michaels growing resentment towards his mentor soon he began to recognize steadmans meanness and his lack of consideration for anybody with interests other than his own i think too that he was always deep down irritated at the way harold could communicate so easily with penny how fond they were of one another anyway this animosity grew and grew over the years fuelled by sexual desire for emma and finally there came a chance to get rich to take it all emma steadman used ramsden manipulated him without a doubt but that doesnt absolve him from blame slowly she introduced the idea of murder to him helped him over his initial resistance and nervousness she did this partly by playing on his existing feelings about her husband and partly through sex denial satisfaction more denial greater satisfaction than hed ever had before thats what he told me anyway hes not a fool he knew what was happening and he went along with it together they killed harold steadman naturally as emma stood to inherit shed be the first suspect so she had to be sure of an airtight alibi which she had also ramsden seemed to have neither motive nor opportunity no matter how i went at him until the connection with emma finally came into focus there were also a number of other possibilities i had to pursue both barker and penny looked at him reprovingly as he said this yes he went on acknowledging them you two hackett for a while barnes even the major and robert kirk fleetingly believe me i blame myself for not arriving at the answer before sally lumb had to die too but i couldnt see the truth for the gossip or the past for the present why did sally have to die barker asked surely she couldnt have been a threat what could she have known sally was older than her years in many ways banks replied she misread the situation but ill get back to her a bit later on the saturday that steadman was killed ramsden drove close to gratly he parked his car in one of those derelict old barns on the minor road just east of the steadman house the one emma always used to get to york remember ramsden had been brought up in gratly he knew every twist and dip in the dale but how did he get back penny asked its an impossibly long walk and the only bus to eastvale goes early in the morning easy banks answered he wouldnt have taken the bus anyway too many people might have noticed him emma steadman drove him back she picked him up on the road at a prearranged time a fairly isolated spot so thered be no chance of their being seen then she dropped him off at the end of his lane and went shopping in york weve checked on that now and her neighbour remembers it because emma brought back some material shed asked for there was nothing unusual in all that emma steadman often spent afternoons shopping in york after all she was a lady of leisure they just had to be careful not to be seen and even if they had been ramsden looked enough like steadman from a distance through a car window so nobody would have thought twice about seeing them what about that night penny asked after harry had the row with my father thats another thing hindsight tells me i should have known banks answered there was only one place steadman would have gone after the argument and thats exactly where he intended to go in the first place to ramsdens remember he was a dedicated man and you penny were the only person he allowed to make emotional inroads into his valuable time so he did exactly what he intended he drove to york and ramsden killed him it was all planned in advance perhaps even rehearsed ramsden already had plastic sheeting on the floor because he was painting his living room he hit steadman from behind with a hammer wrapped his body in the sheet bundled it in the boot of steadmans own car drove it up near crow scar and buried it he couldnt bury him in the plastic because that might have given too much away but he told us where he buried it and weve dug it up penny put her head in her hands and barker put his arms around her im sorry penny banks said i know it sounds brutal but it was penny nodded and took a sip of her drink then reached for a cigarette i know she said its not your fault im sorry to be such a crybaby its just the shock please go on it was well after midnight and the village was deserted he put steadmans car back in the car park cut through the graveyard and over the beck then drove his own car home to york all he had to worry about was getting stopped on the way but the road he chose made that most unlikely as i said the whole thing was carefully planned to throw all suspicion away from ramsden and emma steadman who had the best motive it even helped them that steadmans car was a beige sierra theyre quite common around here i looked in the car park myself yesterday and saw three of them and there are others that look much the same especially in dim light allegros for example of course there were minor risks but there was a hell of a lot at stake it was worth it what about sally then sandra asked how does she fit into it she wasnt part of the plan at all banks said she was just one of the innocent bystanders whose memory got jogged too much for her own good like penny here there but for the grace of god penny muttered too true banks agreed whatever you believe emma would have convinced ramsden it was necessary to get rid of you shed probably have had to do it herself but he wouldnt have stopped her he was too far gone you said he seemed almost glad when you arrived penny said yes in a way it was the end he was free i really think he was relieved anyway according to ramsden sally said she saw him and emma together in leeds they were very careful theyd never think of going out in york or eastvale but leeds seemed safe enough none of steadmans old colleagues would have recognized emma and she knew the kind of places they went to the places to avoid sally was there with her boyfriend ive talked to him again and he said they did go to leeds once when he borrowed a friends car and sally pulled him out of a pub whitelocks pretty sharpish when she spotted someone she knew but she didnt realize who it was at the time she was more concerned with ramsden not seeing her than about who he was with i suspect she and kevin went to quite a few pubs sally certainly looked old enough to pass for eighteen but she was under age so she couldnt afford to get caught now most people would have just thought that michael ramsden had got himself a goodlooking girlfriend and im sure thats what sally believed until events in helmthorpe made her start reexamining little things like that she was perceptive and imaginative but it wasnt until id managed to link emma and ramsden that i knew how sally fitted in at all one thing i noticed when i saw her was that she seemed very skilled with makeup for a girl of her age and she was interested in acting the theatre she had seen ramsden in leeds with an attractive woman forgotten about it then seen the image again when her mind was on the steadman business maybe at the funeral when she had plenty of time to examine what everyone was wearing and how they looked i was there too and i noticed how she seemed to be scrutinizing us all though it didnt mean anything to me at the time however it happened she remembered and she became convinced it was emma carefully made up she had seen with ramsden so sally phoned her that was where she went wrong emma steadman told ramsden later that sally had gone on about wuthering heights on the phone and about how she thought ramsden had killed harold steadman so he could marry emma just to get his hands on the house and money sally was convinced that ramsden would murder emma too after he had married her she seemed to think the ramsdens had gone down in the world and that michael must resent steadman tremendously for buying the house from his family and taking over she suggested a secret meeting to discuss things and see if they could find a way to deal with the situation she thought that together they could solve the case and make the police look silly emma was terrified of anything that could link her with ramsden so she killed the girl emma killed sally lumb penny repeated numbly yes up by the packhorse bridge on friday night she hid the body under the bridge the water was low then and piled stones on it but why on earth did sally meet her like that barker asked she must have known it might be dangerous not at all as far as sally was concerned she was simply warning emma saving her life besides even if she did have second thoughts ask penny she was about to do much the same thing and she never seriously considered that ramsden would harm her but that was different penny argued id known michael all my life i knew he wouldnt hurt me even if what i thought was true somebody would have hurt you banks replied you wouldnt find much comfort in being right about ramsden while emma was killing you it wouldnt matter then would it only to the police i suppose youre wrong about that banks said leaning forward and looking straight into her eyes it matters to everyone except the corpse murder is the one crime that cant be put right it upsets the balance the dead cant be restored like stolen property death doesnt heal like physical or emotional scars left by assault or rape its final the end sally lumb made a mistake and she died for it she was reading the wrong book barker said and misreading it at that she should have been reading madame bovary thats about a woman who considers murdering her husband banks hadnt read madame bovary but made a mental note to do so as soon as possible when the waiter reappeared banks and penny were the only ones to order more drinks banks lit another cigarette ramsden got really scared after emma killed sally he said but life went on and no thunderbolts from heaven struck him down then penny started to figure things out you know the rest penny shivered and draped her shawl over her shoulders emma steadman was far more powerful than any of us had imagined banks said she also had a solid alibi for her husbands murder there was no way she could have done that and though i flirted with the idea that she might have paid someone it didnt seem likely sergeant hatchley was right she wouldnt have known how to contact a hired killer besides if she had it would have meant someone else to fear someone who knew about her and what shed done ramsden was ideal emma could control him and he stood to gain too sally knew that mrs steadman couldnt have carried the body up tavistocks field another reason not to fear her but she didnt know that ramsden seemed to have a perfect alibi i certainly didnt tell her and i dont think anyone else did i was thinking about all the wrong combinations he said to penny you and steadman you and ramsden you and barker here for a while i even wondered whether ramsden and steadman were homosexually involved like everyone else i was taken in by emma steadmans outer drabness i just couldnt picture her as a woman of passion and power i didnt even try but she had the most dangerous combination of all a passionate and calculating nature what did make you think of her asked barker id never have got it in a million years thats because you only write books banks joked while i do the real work touche but really im curious tell me didnt you ever notice anything odd about emma steadman barker thought for a while no he answered i cant say i did i didnt really see a lot of her when i did i always felt a bit uneasy why i dont know there are some women just make you feel like that you didnt tell me that when i asked you about her never really thought of it till you mentioned it just now barker said besides what difference would it have made none i suppose banks admitted its just that i felt uneasy with her too claustrophobic even it was a kind of gut reaction and i ought to know better than that but what did it mean barker asked this is all hindsight banks said so it did me no good until it was too late but i think i was responding to her sexual power unconsciously and i was put off by her appearance i couldnt accept being attracted to her so i felt dislike revulsion it might sound silly but i couldnt see beneath the surface still that was the last thing i realized first of all there was something darnley had said in leeds that i couldnt for the life of me remember it was just the kind of casual throwaway remark anyone might overlook what was it penny asked he said that emma had been a pretty little thing at first in leeds of course that meant nothing at the time then sally disappeared i thought she must be connected in some way to the steadman business but i couldnt figure out how i knew about her theatrical interests but there was no way of getting from that to seeing michael ramsden as steadmans killer besides i was still too busy looking in every direction but the right one i was blinded by emmas alibi too finally sandra said shed seen emma and noticed that she still looked pretty good that was when the bits and pieces seemed to fit together a pretty young thing sallys skill at makeup which is just altering appearances when you get right down to it and emma steadman as the outline still of an attractive woman and she did tell me shed been involved in amateur dramatics when i thought about what others had told me about emma i realized that nobody had ever mentioned her being attractive penny wouldnt of course like her husband i dont think you ever really noticed emma and jack here hadnt known her that far back ramsden never said that she was attractive either and that finally seemed odd then i got to thinking about ramsden alone with her at the house that summer about how he suddenly seemed to drift away from penny id always seen him as a kind of pale loiterer but it took me a long time to see emma steadman as a belle dame my view of the past was wrong just like teddy hackett said steadmans was and everyone else seemed to look back on that summer through rosetinted glasses if truth be told it was a period of desire greed deception adultery hardly an idyll at all even sally got it wrong when i asked my questions i never had ramsden and emma in mind but it was easy enough to review what id learned in the light of a new perspective once id got that far it seemed possible two people working together could have handled the steadman killing while both seeming to have solid alibis sally could have posed a threat to emma if she had seen her transformed from the drab housewife into the sexy siren with michael ramsden all i had to do then was go and push even harder at least i knew i was going in the right direction but events turned out differently you were certainly fixed in your ideas about me and harry penny said yes banks agreed maybe ramsden and emma was a combination i shouldnt have overlooked but its easy to say that now its over whenever i thought of that summer i knew there was something missing so i assumed that people had been lying to me hiding something they hadnt as far as you knew it had all happened the way you told me almost all anyway dont blame yourself sandra said to him winking at penny after all youre only a man ill drink to that penny said raising her glass and nudging jack barker while banks joined in the toast and the chitchat that followed he thought deep guilty thoughts about sally lumb who had seen beneath the surface only to find yet another romantic illusion above them as all traces of the sun disappeared crow scar began to gleam like bone in the light of the rising moon
