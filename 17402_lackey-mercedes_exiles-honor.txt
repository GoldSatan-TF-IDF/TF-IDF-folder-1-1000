donald burns exiles honor prologue silver stamped restively as another horse on the picket line shifted and blundered into his hindquarters alberich clucked to quiet him and patted the stallions neck the beast swung his head about to blow softly into the young captains hair alberich smiled a little thinking wistfully that the stallion was perhaps the only creature in the entire camp that felt anything like friendship for him and possibly the only creature that isnt waiting for me to fail hoping that i will and ready to pounce on me and cut me to pieces when i do life for an officer of karsite troops was spent half in defeating the enemies of karse and half in watching his own back amazingly gentle for a stallion silver had caused no problems either in combat or here on the picket line which was just as well for if he had alberich would have had him gelded or traded off for a more tractable mount gift of the voice of vkandis sunlord or no alberich had enough troubles without worrying about the behavior of his beast he wasnt sure where the handsome and muscular creature had come from shinainbred theyd told him the voice had chosen the beast especially for him out of a string of animals liberated from the enemy which meant war booty of course from one of the constant conflicts along the borders silver hadnt come from one of the bandit nests that was sure the only beasts the bandits owned were as disreputable as their owners horses liberated from the bandits usually werent worth keeping they were so rundown and illtreated silver probably came from menmellith via rethwellan the king was rumored to have some kind of connection with the horsebreeding bloodthirsty shinain nomads whatever when alberich lost his faithful old smoke a few weeks ago he hadnt expected to get anything better than the obstinate intractable gelding hed taken from its bandit owner but fate ruled otherwise the voice chose to honor him with a superior replacement along with his commission the letter that accompanied the paper pointing out that silver was the perfect mount for a captain of light cavalry it was also another evidence of favoritism from above with the implication that he had earned that favoritism outside of performance in the field talk about a doubleedged blade both the commission and the horse came with burdens of their own not a gift that was likely to increase his popularity with some of the men under his command and a beast that was going to make him pretty damned conspicuous in any encounter with the enemy a white horse might as well paint a target on his back and have done with it plus thats an unlucky color those witchyheralds of valdemar ride white horses and the blueeyed beasts may be demons or witches too for all i know the priests say they are the priests call their owners the demonriders the horse nuzzled him again showing as sweet a temper as any ladys mare he scratched its nose and it sighed with content he wished he could be as contented things had been bad enough before getting this commission now there was an uneasy prickly sensation between his shoulder blades as he went back to brushing down his new mount he glanced over his shoulder to intercept the glare of leftenant herdahl the man dropped his gaze and brushed his horses flank vigorously but not quickly enough to prevent alberich from seeing the hate and anger in the hot blue eyes no indeed the voice had done alberich no favors in rewarding him with the captaincy and this prize mount passing over herdahl and klaus both his seniors in years of service if not in experience neither of them had expected that he would be promoted over their heads during the weeks wait for word to come from headquarters they had saved their rivalry for each other too bad they didnt murder each other he thought resentfully then suppressed the rest of the thought it was said that some of the priests of vkandis could pluck the thoughts from a mans head it could have been thoughts like that one that had led to herdahls being passed over for promotion but it could also be that this was a test a way of flinging the ambitious young leftenant alberich into deep water to see if he would survive the experience if he did well and good he was of suitable material to continue to advance perhaps even to the rank of commander if he did notwell that was too bad if his ambition undid him or if he wasnt clever enough to see and avoid the machinations of those below him then he wasnt fit enough for the post that was the way of things in the armies of karse you rose by watching your back and if the occasion arose sticking careful knives into the backs of your lesscautious fellows and ensuring other enemies took the punishment all the while the priests of the sunlord the ones who were truly in charge watched and smiled and dispensed favors and punishments with the same dispassionate aloofness displayed by the one god karse was a hard land and the sunlord a hard god the sunpriests were as hard as both but alberich had given a good account of himself along the border at the corner where karse met menmellith and the witchnation valdemar in the campaign against the bandits there frankly herdahl and klaus put together hadnt been half as effective or as energetic as hed been hed earned his rank he told himself once again as silver stamped and shifted his weight beneath the strokes of alberichs brush the spring sun burned down on his head hotter than he expected without the breeze to cool him hot as herdahls angry glare demons take herdahl there was no reason to feel as if hed cheated to get where he was hed led more successful sorties against the bandits in his first year in the field than the other two had achieved in their entire careers hed cleared more territory than anyone of leftenant rank ever had in that space of timeand when captain anberg had met with one too many arrows the men had seemed perfectly willing to follow him when the voice chose him over the other two candidates it had been the policy of late to permit the brigands to flourish provided they confined their attentions to valdemar and the menmellith peasantry and left the inhabitants of karse unmolested a stupid policy in alberichs opinion you couldnt trust bandits that was the whole reason why they became bandits in the first place if they could be trusted theyd be in the army themselves or in the temple guard or even have turned mercenary hed seen the danger back when he was a youngster in the academy in his first tactics classes hed even said as much to one of his teachersphrased as a question of course since cadets were not permitted to have opinions the question had been totally ignored perhaps because it wasnt wise to so much as hint that the decisions of the sunpriests were anything other than divinely inspired but as alberich had predicted there had been trouble from the brigands once they began to multiply problems that escalated far far past the point where their use as an irritant to valdemar was outweighed by their effect as a scourge on karse with complete disregard for the unwritten agreements between them and karse they struck everyone and when they finally began attacking villages instead of just robbing solitary travelers or going after single farms the authorities deemed it time they were disposed of alberich had spent a good part of his young life in the karsite military schools and had just finished cavalry training as an officer when the troubles broke out the ultimate authority was in the hands of the voices of course the highest anyone not of the priesthood could expect to rise was to commander but officers were never taken from the ranks many of the rankandfile were conscripts and although it was never openly stated the voices did not trust their continued loyalty if they were given power alberich and many others like him had been selected at the age of thirteen by a voice sent every year to search out young male children strong of body and quick of mind to school into officers and there was one other qualificationthat at least half of them be lowborn so that they were appropriately grateful to the voices for their opportunity to rise in rank and station alberich had all those qualities developing expertise in many weapons with an ease that was the envy of his classmates picking up his lessons in academic subjects with what seemed to be equal ease it wasnt ease it was the fact that alberich studied long and hard knowing that there was no way for the bastard son of a tavern wench to advance in karse except in the army there was no place for him to go no way to get into a trade no hope for any but the most menial of jobs the voices didnt care about a mans parentage once he was chosen as an officer they cared only about his abilities and whether or not he would use them in service to his god and country it was a lonely life though his mother had loved and cared for him to the best of her abilities and hed had friends among the other children of similar circumstances when he came to the academy he had no friends and his mother was not permitted to contact him lest she distract him or contaminate his purity of purpose alberich had never seen her again but both of them had known this was the only way for him to live a better life than she had and there had been a halfpromisewhich he had no way of knowing was keptthat if he did well at the academy his mother would be rewarded perhaps with a little house of her own if she could manage to keep herself from further sin he had trusted in that particular voice though the priest had no reason to lie to himand every reason to give his mother that reward after all karse needed officers willing officers and young boys eager to throw themselves into their studies with all the enthusiasm of youth in order to become those willing officers knowing that their parents would be taken care of provided plenty of incentive and he had done better than well he had pushed himself harder than any of his classmates pushed themselves friends when did i have the time for friends up before dawn for extra exercise all my spare time practicing against the older boys and after dinner studying by the light of vkandis lamps in the temple until the priests came in for midnight prayers alberich had no illusions about the purity of the one gods priesthood there were as many corrupt and venal priests as there were upright and more fanatic than there were forgiving he had seen plenty of the venal kind in the tavern when they passed through his little mountain village on the way to greater places had hidden from one or two that had come seeking pleasures strictly forbidden by the one gods edicts he had known they were coming looking for him and had managed to make himself scarce long before they arrived just as somehow he had known when the voice was coming to look for young male children for the academy and had made certain he was noticed and questioned and that he had known which customers it was safe to cadge for a penny in return for running errands or that he had known that drunk was going to try to set the stable afire oh that had been a tricky thing to manageto stay awake despite aching eyes that threatened to close long enough to be able to stumble out of bed and into the courtyard in search of a drink from the pump just in time to see the first flames no matter how much noise is in a tavern the sound of a childs shrill scream will penetrate it no matter how drunk the inhabitants the cry of fire will get the appropriate response somehow that was alberichs secret he knew things were going to happen that was a witchpower and forbidden by the voices of the one god if anyone knew he had it the fires and the cleansing oh of course those whom the one god favors are supposed to be able to endure the fires and walk from the ashes cleansed not that anyone has ever seen that happen but he had also known from the time that the visions first came on him as surely as he had known all the rest that he had to conceal the fact that he had this power even before he knew the law against it hed succeeded fairly well over the years though it was getting harder and harder all the time the power struggled inside him wanting to break free once or twice overwhelming him with visions so intense that for a moment he was blind and deaf to everything else it was getting harder to concoct reasons for knowing things he had no business knowing like the hiding places of the bandits they were chasing the boltholes and escape routes but it was harder still to ignore them especially when subsequent visions showed him innocent people suffering because he didnt act on what he knew he brushed silvers neck vigorously the dust tickling his nose and making him want to sneeze and between one brush stroke and the next he lost his sense of balance went lightheaded and the dazzle that heralded a visiontocome sparkled between his eyes and silvers neck not here he thought desperately clinging to silvers mane and trying to pretend there was nothing wrong not now not with herdahl watching but the witchpower would not obey him not this time nosunlord help me not now he believed in the sunlord in his power and goodness if not in the goodness of those who said they spoke for him a flash of blue light blinding him then came sight again but not of the picket line but another place where where sunlord where the bandits hed thought were south had slipped behind him into the north joining with two more packs of the curs becoming a group large enough to take on his troops and give them an even fight but first they wanted a secure base they were going to make alberich meet them on ground of their choosing fortified ground that this ground was already occupied was only a minor inconvenience one that would soon be dealt with he fought free of the vision for a moment clinging to silvers shoulder like a drowning man both hands full of the beasts silky mane while the horse curved his head back and looked at him curiously the big brown eyes flickered blue briefly like a halfhidden flash of lightning reflecting another burst of sapphire and now now he knew where the bandits target was a fortified village a small one built on the top of a hill above the farm fields ordinarily these people would have no difficulty in holding off a score of bandits but there were three times that number ranged against them and a recent edict from the high temple decreed that no one but the temple guard and the army could possess anything but the simplest of weapons not three weeks ago a detachment of priests and a voice had come through here divesting them of everything but knives farm implements and such simple bows and arrows as were suitable for waterfowl and small game and while they were at it a third of the ablebodied men had been conscripted for the regular army alberichs own troops had acted as silent guards for the process to ensure that there were no incidents while the conscripts were marched away while the weapons were taken or destroyed yes he knew this place knew it too well these people didnt have a chance the bandits drew closer under the cover of a brushfilled ravine alberich found himself on silvers back without knowing how hed gotten there without remembering that hed flung saddle and bridle back on the beast no not bridle silver still wore the halter hed had on the picket line alberichs bugle was in his hand presumably hed blown the muster for his men were running toward him buckling on swords and slinging quivers over their shoulders blinding flash of sapphirethrowing him back into the vision showing him what he would rather not see he knew what was coming so why must he see it the bandits attacked the village walls overpowering the poor man who was trying to bar the gate against them and swarming inside he couldnt close his eyes to it the vision came through eyes closed or open he would look because he had no choice it hadnt happened yet he knew that with the surety with which he knew his own name it wasnt even going to happen in the next few moments but it was going to happen soon they poured inside cutting down anyone who resisted them then throwing off what little restraint they had shown and launching into an orgy of looting and rapine alberich gagged as one of them grabbed a pregnant woman and with a single slash of his sword murdered the child that ran to try and protect her followed through to her the vision released him and he found himself surrounded by dust and thunder still on silvers back but leaning over the stallions neck as now he led his troops up the road to the village of sunsdale at full gallop hooves pounded the packed earth of the road making it impossible to hear or speak the vibration thrummed into his bones as he shifted his weight with the stallions turns silver ran easily with no sign of distress though all around him and behind him the other horses streamed saliva from the corners of their mouths and their flanks ran with sweat and foam as they strained to keep up the lack of a bit didnt seem to make any difference to the stallion he answered to neckrein and knee so readily he might have been anticipating alberichs thoughts alberich dismissed the uneasy feelings that prompted better not to think that he might have a second witchpower along with the first hed never shown any ability to control beasts by thought before there was no reason to think he could now the stallion was just superbly trained that was all and he had more important things to worry about they topped the crest of a hill sunsdale lay atop the next one just as he had seen in his vision and the brushfilled ravine beyond it there was no sign of trouble this time its been a wild hare he thought and his skin crawled at the thought that hed roused the men and sent them here at the gallop and there were sure to be questions asked for which he had no answers and i answer what that i wanted to see how quick theyd respond to an emergency that would hardly serve he was just about to pull silver up and bring the rest of his men to a haltno point in them running their horses into foundering when a flash of sunlight on metal betrayed the bandits location alberich grabbed for the bugle dangling from his left wrist instead and pulled his blade with the right he sounded the charge and led the entire troop down the hill an unstoppable torrent of hooves and steel hitting the brigands hidden line like an avalanche sword in hand alberich limped wearily to another body sprawled amid the rocks and trampled weeds of the ravine and thrust it through to make death certain his sword felt heavy and unwieldy his stomach churned and there was a sour taste in his mouth he didnt think he was going to lose control of his guts but he was glad he was almost at the end of the battle line he hated this part of the fightingwhich wasnt fighting at all it was nothing more than butchery but it was necessary this scum was just as likely to be feigning death as to actually be dead other officers hadnt been that thoroughand hadnt lived long enough to regret it silver was being fed and watered along with the rest of the mounts by the youngsters of sunsdale the finest fodder and clearest spring water and a round dozen young boys to brush and curry them clean and the men were being fed and made much of by the older villagers gratitude had made them forgetful of the loss of their weapons and many of their men suddenly the army that had conscripted their relatives was no longer their adversary or else since the troops had arrived out of nowhere like vengeance of the sunlord himself they assumed the one god had a hand in it and it would be prudent to resign themselves to the sacrifice and meanwhile the instrument of their rescue probably ought to be well treated except for the captain who was doing a dirty job he refused to assign to anyone else alberich made certain of two more corpses and looked dully around for more there werent any and he decided when he spotted a pool of clear rainwater a little farther down the ravine that he had to wash he had to get the blood off his hands and the stink of death out of his nostrils he picked his way down the rocks to the poolnot rainwater after all but fed by a tiny trickle of a spring a mere thread of clear water that didnt even stir the surface of the pool he bent over it and caught his own reflection staring back at him a sober fellow with a face of sharp planes and uncompromising angles a stubborn mouth his mother had always said and eyes that stared unnervingly back at him hawk eyes said some with a fierce and direct gaze dark hair cut as short as possible to fit beneath a helms padding skin burned dark by the sun he looked at the reflection as if he was looking at a stranger hunting forwhat the taint of witchery he saw only a toughened man with eyes that lookedperhapsa trifle haunted suddenly he didnt want to look anymoreor more closely introspection is for poets not men like me he bent quickly to wash disrupting the reflection when he straightened to shake the water off his arms and face he saw to his surprise that the sun was hardly more than a fingers breadth from the horizon shadows already filled the ravine the evening breeze had picked up and it was getting chilly last years weeds tossed in the freshening wind as he gazed around at the long shadows cast by the scrubby trees more time had passed than he thought and if he didnt hurry he was going to be late for sundescending he scrambled over the slippery rocks of the ravine cursing under his breath as his boots meant for riding skidded on the smooth rounded boulders the last thing he needed now was to be late for a holy service especially this one the priest here was bound to ask him for a thanksprayer for the victory if he was late it would look as if he was arrogantly attributing the victory to his own abilities and not the hand of the sunlord and with an accusation like that hanging over his head hed be in danger not only of being deprived of his current rank but of being demoted into the ranks with no chance of promotion a step up from stablehand but not a big one he fought his way over the edge and halfran halflimped to the village gates reaching them just as the sun touched the horizon he put a little more speed into his weary aching legs and got to the edge of the crowd in the village square a scant breath before the priest began the first chant he bowed his head with the others and not until he raised his head at the end of it did he realize that the robes the priest wore were not black but red this was no mere village priestthis was a voice he suppressed his start of surprise and the shiver of fear that followed it he didnt know what this village meant or what had happened to require posting a voice here but there was little wonder now why they had submitted so tamely to the taking of their men and the confiscation of their weapons no one sane would contradict a voice the voice held up his hand and got instant silence a silence so profound that the sounds of the horses stamping and whickering on the picket line came clearly over the walls in the distance a few lonely birds called and the breeze rustled through the new leaves of the trees in the ravine alberich longed suddenly to be able to mount silver and ride away from here far away from the machinations of voices and the omnipresent smell of death and blood he yearned for somewhere clean somewhere that he wouldnt have to guard his back from those he should be able to trust today this village was saved from certain destruction the voice said his words ringing out but without passion without any inflection whatsoever and for that we offer thanksgiving to vkandis sunlord most high one god to whom all things are known the instrument of that salvation was captain alberich who mustered his men in time to catch our attackers in the very act it seems a miracle during the speech some of the men had been moving closer to alberich grouping themselves around him to bask in the admiration of the villagers or so he thought until the voices tone hardened and his next words proved their real intent it seems a miraclebut it was not he thundered you were saved by the power of the one god whose wrath destroyed the bandits but alberich betrayed the sunlord by using the unholy powers of witchcraft seize him his heart froze but his body acted and he whirled the men grabbed him as he turned to run throwing him to the ground and pinning him with superior numbers he fought them anyway struggling furiously until someone brought the hilt of a knife down on the back of his head he didnt black out altogether but he couldnt move or see his eyes wouldnt focus and a gray film obscured everything he felt himself being dragged off by the armsheaved into darknessfelt himself hitting a hard surfaceheard the slamming of a door then heard only confused murmurs as he lay in shadows trying to regain his senses and his strength gradually his sight cleared and he could make out walls on all sides of him close enough to touch the last light of dusk made thin blue lines of the cracks between each board he raised his aching head cautiously and made out the dim outline of an illfitting door the floor clearly was dirt and smelled unmistakably of other fowl birds they must have thrown him into some kind of shed something that had once held chickens or pigeons it didnt now for the dirt floor was clean and packed as hard as rock he was under no illusions that this meant his prison would be easy to escape out here the chickensheds were frequently built better than the houses for chickens were more valuable than children children ate chickens and eggs were to be eaten still once darkness descended it might be possible to get away if he could overpower whatever guards the voice had placed around him if he could find a way out of the shed if he could get past the voice himself there were stories that the voices had other powers than plucking the thoughts from a mans headstories that they commanded the services of demons tamed by the sunlordand he knew those stories were true hed heard the nightdemons ranging through the dark off in the far distance no dog ever produced those wails no wolf howled like that and no owl conjured those bonechilling shrieks from its throat and once from a distance hed seen the result of one of those hunts whatever the demons had left behind wasnt human anymore while he lay there gathering his wits another smell invaded the shed overpowering even the stench of old birddroppings a sharp thick smell it took a moment for him to recognize it but when he did he clawed his way up the wall hed been thrown against to stand wideeyed in the darkness nails digging into the wood behind him heart pounding with stark terror oil they had poured earthoil the kind that bubbled up in black sticky pools around here around the foundations splashed it up against the sides of the shed and now he heard them out there bringing piles of dry brush and wood to stack against the walls the punishment for witchery was burning and they were taking no chances they were going to burn him now the noises outside stopped the murmur of voices faded as his captors moved away then the voice called out oncea set of three sharp angry words and every crack and crevice in the building was outlined in yellow and red as the entire shed was engulfed in flames from outside alberich cried out and staggered away from the wall hed been leaning against the shed was bigger than hed thoughtbut not big enough to protect him the oil theyd spread so profligately made the flames burn hotter and the wood of the shed was old weathered and probably dry within moments the very air scorched him he hid his mouth in a fold of his shirt but his lungs burned with every breath his eyes streamed tears of pain as he turned burning staggering searching for an escape that didnt exist one of the walls burned through showing the flames leaping from the wood and brush piled beyond it he couldnt hear anything but the roar of the flames at any moment now the roof would cave in burying him in burning debris look out how he heard the warningor how he knew to stagger back as far as he could without being incinerated on the spot he did not know but a heartbeat after that warning shout in his mind a hole opened up in the side of the shed with a crash then a huge silverwhite shadow lofted through the hole in the burning wall and landed beside him it was still wearing his saddle and hackamore and it turned huge impossibly blue eyes on him as he stood there gaping at it it no him on the stallion snapped at him the roofs about to go whatever fear he had of the beast he was more afraid of a death by burning with hands that screamed with pain he grabbed the saddlebow and threw himself onto it he hadnt even found the stirrups when the stallion turned on his hind feet there was a crack of collapsing wood as fire engulfed them burning thatch fell before and behind them sparks showering as the air was sucked into the blaze hotter but amazingly no fire licked at his flesh once he had mounted alberich sobbed with relief as the cool air surged into his lungsthe stallions hooves hit the ground beyond the flames and he gasped with pain as he was flung forward against the saddlebow then the real pain began the torture of halfscorched skin and the broken bones of his capture jarred into agony by the stallions headlong gallop into the night the beast thundered toward the villagers and they screamed and parted before it soldiers and voice alike were caught unaware and not one of them raised a weapon in time to stop the flight stay on the stallion ordered grimly into his mind as the darkness was shattered by the red lightning of his own pain stay on stay with me we have a long way to go before were safe stay with me safe where he wanted to ask but there was no way to ask around the pain all he could do was to hang on and hope he could do what the horse wanted through the darkness under a moonless sky through cold that froze him as his burns made him feverish pain became a constant hed have screamed but he hadnt the strength wept but his eyes were too sore and dry yet alberich was no stranger to pain it could be endured and he would endure it it could be conquered he would not allow it to conquer him somewhere in the midst of the living nightmare came the thought that if he lived through this his own mother would never recognize him hed been burned so badly he would forever wear a face seamed by scars an eternity laterdawn rising as red as the flames that had nearly killed himthe stallion had slowed to a walk dawn was on their right which meant that the stallion was heading north across the border into the witchkingdom of valdemar which only made sense since what hed thought was a horse had turned out to be one of the blueeyed witchbeasts none of it mattered now that the stallion had slowed to a walk his pain had dulled but he was exhausted and out of any energy to think or even feel with what could the witches do to him after all kill him at the moment that would be a kindness and anyway it was only what his own people wanted to do to him the stallion stopped and he looked up trying to see through the film that had come over his vision at first he thought he was seeing double two white witchbeasts and two whiteclad riders blocked the road but then he realized that there were two of them hastily dismounting reaching for him he let himself slide down into their hands hearing nothing he could understand only a babble of strange syllables then in his mind can you hear me iwhat he replied without thinking taver says his names alberich came a second voice in his head alberich can you stay with us a little longer we need to get you to a healer youre going into shock fight it for us your companion will help you if you let him his what he shook his head not in negation in puzzlement where was he all his life hed heard that the witches of valdemar were evilbut and all our lives weve heard that nothing comes out of karse but brigands and bad weather said the first voice full of concern but with an edge of humor to it he shook his head again and peered up at the person supporting him on his right a woman older than he with many laugh lines etched around her generous mouth she seemed to fit that first voice in his head somehow she was smaller than he diminutive in fact but she had an aura of authority that was all out of proportion to her height so which are you alberich she asked as he fought to stay awake feeling the presence of the stallion his companion like a steady shoulder to lean against deep inside his soul brigand or bad weather neither i hope he replied absently clinging to consciousness as shed asked good id hate to think of a companion choosing a brigand to be a herald she said with her mouth twitching a little as if she was holding back a grin and a thunderstorm in human guise would make uncomfortable company choosing he asked whatwhat do you mean i mean that youre a herald my friend she told him somehow your companion managed to insinuate himself across the border to get you too thats how heralds of valdemar are made companions choose them she looked up and away from him and relief and satisfaction spread over her face at whatever it was she saw and the rest of it can wait arens brought the healer we sent him for when taver told us you were coming go ahead and let go well take over from here if a healer cant save you with three heralds to support him then hes not worth the robe he wears he took her at her word and let the darkness take him but her last words followed him down into the shadows and instead of bringing the fear they should have given him they brought him comfort and a peace he never expected its a hell of a greeting herald alberich and a hell of a way to get herebut welcome to valdemar brother welcome part one exiles choice he was not dead that much at least he was certain of at times between the long moments when he was unaware of anything he hurt quite enough to be in hell but hell was cold and dark and he wasnt cold and the few times he was able to open his eyes the room he was in was bathed in sunlight he couldnt be in heaven either if he was in heaven he wouldnt hurt that was one thing that everyone agreed on in heaven was an end to all pain and sorrow pain he had in plenty and as for sorrowwell hed consider sorrow when the pain ended therefore he must be alive the rest of what was going on around himwell it was a mix of what he thought was hallucination and what surely must be madness now that fit with hell except that there werent any demons tormenting him only his own flesh around him voices muttered in a tongue he did not understand but inside his head another voice murmured imparting to him the sense of what he heard and that was where the madness came in that voice low and strong and uncompromisingly masculine informed him that he alberich sworn to the service of karse and vkandis sunlord the one god was now a herald of valdemar and the voice belonged to his companion one kantor impossible not at all the voice insisted it began to wear at his stubborn refusal he could feel his objection thinning it clearly was not impossible because it had happened he might not like it but it was not impossible he slept woke hurting was murmured over and moved fed and cleaned the pain ebbed and he slept again from time to time the bandages on his face were taken off and he could open his eyes for a little he was in was a cheerful room that seemed to be tiled and the bed he was on was soft and comfortablewhich was good because his face and arms were in agony his lungs stabbed with every breath he took and if he didnt have broken collarbones they were at least cracked when he could see there were generally two or three greenclad people in the room with him and he seemed to recall that outside of karse there were healers who generally wore green so apparentlyif he wasnt delirioushe was being tended to outside of karse by foreign healers so whatever had happened he wasnt in heaven or hell or prisonwhich had been a third option after all over and over he slept to wake in pain was given something that stopped the pain and slept again there was no way to tell how much time had passed and no way to sort what he knew had happened from what the voice was telling him except that bit by bit the words being spoken over his head became more intelligible as if the language was slowly seeping into his feverravaged brain this tonguethis arcane languagewas like nothing he could have imagined the syntax was all wrong for one thing these people spokebackward sort of not that he was any kind of a linguist but for a long time he was confused as much by the order of the words as the words themselves he must be in valdemar the language was as twisted about as the demonriders and their hellhorses with the verbs coming in the middle instead of properly at the end how could you tell what a sentence was truly about if you stuck the verb in the middle the meaning could be entirely reversed by what came afterward how was he learning these things what demonic magic was putting them inside his brain or was this all a fever dream and was he lying in the embers of the chickenshed dying of his burns conjuring all of this up he had saved the village with his witchpower he had been condemned to burn by a voice he had been imprisoned and his prison set afire but after that madness illusion hallucination delirium surely but the voice in his head told him otherwise and as the moments of his lucidity came more and more often it began to tell him things he could verify for himselflittle things but none of which he could have hallucinated for himself that for instance the reason why he was not able to open his eyes very often was because they had been bandaged shutat first the skin of his face hurt so much he hadnt actually felt the bandages and the skin of his hands was in such agony that he tried not to move them to touch anything much less his face which he wouldnt have wanted to touch anyway given how much it hurt the voice warned him when he was to be fed and what they were going to give himall soup of course and juices and very very often the voice warned him when his bandages were to be changedlong before one of those healerpeople even got within hearing distance and the voice told him about a great many other things there is a large crow outside your window chosen it would say it is about to sound an alert so do not be startled and jump or you will hurt and sure enough a crow would burst out with a raucous shout but since hed been warned he was able to keep still or the healers have come with a new potion for you to soothe your burns they think this will hurt so much that they intend to give you an especially strong dose of painmedicine and indeed he would then hear footsteps feel himself tilted up and he would drink what was put to his lips quickly because the last time they had come up with a new potion for his burns the pain had been excruciating he had always been a great believer in empirical evidence and here it was slowly and with great reluctance he began to sort through his confused memories with even greater reluctance he had to accept that what he thought was madness and delirium was nothing of the sort so during one of his moments of relative lucidity he steeled himself and confronted the voice relative was the operative termhe felt that he should be angry embittered but there were drugs interfering with those emotions keeping him oddly detached perhaps that was just as well he needed to think clearly unemotionally and this was as close to doing so as he was likely to manage he coughed hoping to clear his throat but the voice in his head forestalled his attempt to speak aloud dont chosen you dont need to actually say anything just think it think it well he talked to himself in his mind all the time this shouldnt be any different it isnt except that when you get an answer you neednt be concerned that madness runs in your bloodline not that its likely that it was true madness that struck your father all things considered if it were my case to judge i would have looked very carefully at his wifes family and considered all the reasons they might have had for saying he was mad hed have winced if he hadnt known how much wincing would hurt how had this voice kantor alberich my name is kantor kantor then how had this being known about his past youve been quite generous in sharing your memories a hint of dry irony actually youve been shoving them down my throat i know that your mother was not married that your father was a prominent man in your village and she anything but i know that he was her only lover and that at some point when you were very young he was sent away with your priests supposedly mad alberich would have been flushing had his face not been so painful he was embarrassedbut embarrassed because he had been essentially blurting out every detail of his past life to a stranger like the sort of drunk who would sit down next to you and begin telling you everything you didnt want to know the very idea made him a little sick not that i mind truly the voice continued earnestly its only that herald and companion usually grow to know each other in a more leisurely mannerand as yet you know very little of me another suppressed wince he didnt really want to know anything about thiscompaniondid he no he didnt this was a place full of witches of which you might be one and demons and vkandis only knew what other sorts of horrible creatureswasnt it surely it was nonsense you may be many things alberich but a coward isnt one of them ive asked the healers to halve your painmedicines so that we can have this little discussion without the drugs interfering there are several truths that you will have to face today and the first of them is that virtually everything you think you know about valdemar is wrong actually the unsteady realization of that had been trickling down into his mind for the pasthowever long it had been it had probably started when hed fallen into the arms of those whiteclad riders just over the border if theyd been half as evil as the priests painted them hed have been roasting in chains right now with demons nibbling at his soul excellent thats another thing that you arentstupid those werent just any heralds by the way one was the kings own herald talamir and the other was the lord marshals herald joyeaus we stumbled onto the end of a rather sensitive diplomatic mission it seems there was a hint of a chuckle and alberich got the distinct impression that they hadnt merely stumbled into those particular heraldsthat kantor had aimed himself quite deliberately in their direction well no harm done he gathered his wits and thought a question i do not suppose that the rank of our rescuers has anything to do with the speed with which i was taken to further help the impression of a knowing smile not entirely all heralds are considered highly important even the newly chosen he let that settle into his mind even karsites well since weve never had a karsite herald before theres no basis for comparison there was a definite undertone there alberich decided that he was getting rapidly better at reading around what kantor was actually telling him to what kantor would rather justimply the undertone was that not everyone would have been as open to the possibility of an ally out of karse as heralds talamir and joyeaus excellent again i do believe we are rather wellmatched chosen i would not go so far as to say that other heralds would have run you through on sightbut we have been fighting a rather nasty undeclared war with you for some time and there are some hard feelings on our side of the border as well as yours even among heralds a sense of pondering followed that statement in truth especially among heralds since your lot enjoys killing us so very much now no herald would ever slaughter someone who had been chosen outofhandbut there are many many of them who are not going to welcome you as a longlost sibling just his good fortune that hed never led troops against anything other than bandits then at least no one would be holding a personal grudge against him he licked lips that were dry and cracked and stared into the darkness behind his bandages inexorably it was creeping up on him acceptance that he could never go home again he was in the enemys land he was exiled inexorably from his own he had witchpowers and they were not the curse hed been taught that they were and one of the hellhorseswhich were not hellish at all apparentlyhad selected him to become one of the demonriders please alberich heralds not demonriders and as for my being hellish a pregnant pause well although the people of valdemar would say that we companions are the sweetest most marvelous of creatures i suspect that the several of your men who got in my way would agree that i am hellish assuming any of them survived the experience oh on the other hand if one of them had been that voice he was came the reply with a certain grim glee though i am not certain that anyone like that voice of yourssomeone who goes about blithely burning people alivehas any right to make any judgments about who is hellish and who isnt ah the fact that you have never personally fought against us will be useful towards having you accepted kantor agreed and there is at least one thing i can promise you we will never ever under any circumstances ask or require you to do anything against your conscience with regard to your homeland i shant promise we wont ask you to act against those in power there just at the moment hed rather like to have the skinny or fat necks of some of those in power between his hands well put kantor seemed satisfied with his answer now the healers will have my tail for a banner if i dont let them drug you again so ill ask you to mull this discussion over while you drowse and well have another little talk in a bit he couldnt have objected if hed wanted to and he didnt want to because the pain was getting unbearable and he heard the welcome footsteps of someone bringing him relief after a quick nastytasting draught he was drifting again cast loose from consciousness and what hed always thought of as the truth a state in which it was easier to contemplate a new set of truthsor at least truismsin place of the old he dreamed he sat in the midst of a vast expanse of flowering meadow flooded in a haze of light that made it difficult to see for any great distance he was warm comfortable without pain of any kind andcompletely alone he rose and started to walk wading kneedeep through wildflowers and herbs that gave off a hundred luscious scents as he brushed them aside no matter how far he walked however the scene never changed and he never found a path the only living things were the plants there were not even insects or birds he felt no hunger no thirst no weariness this fit every description of paradise that hed ever heardexcept that there was no one in this paradise but himself as beautiful and peaceful as this place washe was trapped here and he came to realize as he walked on in the thick golden light that the peace came at the price of being unable to escape and completely alone not paradise not even close that was the end of the dream as abruptly as it had begun it was over and alberich dropped out of the meadow and into the usual fever dreams that he had fought since being brought here from fever dream he moved into welcome dreamlessness and from then into the pain that always woke him when his medicines wore off but it was not as bad as it had been and he knew that the drugs being given him were not as strong as theyd been at first someone gave him a differenttasting drink then and he drowsed for a bit sometime later he woke to the sound of someoneno two peoplewalking into his room is he awake asked a voice that was strange to him he should be i gave him a draught that shouldwellsober him up completely replied one that was more familiarone of the healers who spent a great deal of alberichs waking time with him there was a touch on his chest where there were no bandages other than the ones holding his cracked ribs in place sir i am going to take off the bandages on your eyes and leave them off the skin there is healed enough that you neednt have them on anymore i understand he said stumbling over the foreign words the healer moved him as gently as could be propped him up with cushions and took off the bandages alberich blinked and squinted in the sunlight taking his first proper look at the room hed been in forwell he didnt know how long and now that he was thinking clearly the very first thing he felt was a smoldering resentment a shaggyhaired man in stained and wellworn green robes was coiling up bandages at the foot of the bed but alberich had very little interest in him or in the room itself at the moment it was the other occupant of the room the one sitting right beside him that captured his attention this was a demonrider this is talamir the kings own herald kantor corrected gently speaking into his mind for the first time since hed awakened alberichs jaw tightened but he tried to look at the man rather than react to him what he saw was a tall a very tall thin man with graying brown hair perhaps forty or fifty years old if alberichs judgment was any good his was a careworn lean face overlaid with gentle good humor but with a strong chin that suggested a stubborn streak and a determination it would not be wise to invoke if you intended to quarrel with him and of course he wore that dreaded white uniform the emblem of the enemya more elaborate version than alberich thought prudent or practical for a fighting man those are formal whites talamir has just come from a council session at the kings side defending your presence here in valdemar in haven in the ranks of the heralds themselves may i add alberich refused to be distracted from his careful scrutiny the uniformi would never don anything like this he told himself fiercelya silverlaced whitevelvet tunic with silver embroidery at the hems over a heavy white samite shirt with wide sleeves caught in deep cuffs at the wrists and white satin breeches a wide white leather belt ornamented with hammered silver supported a dagger in a matching sheath hed have called it foppish except that it wasnt but he could not imagine himself ever wearing anything so extravagant the fabric alone if sold could feed a family for a year ah and of course the nobles of karse the wealthy merchants the ranking captains and above all the voices of the sunlord dress and live so very austerely came the unwelcome reminder well you have been here some two weeks sir talamir said his hazel eyes scrutinizing alberich just as closely as alberich was examining him im sure you have been wondering wondering yes alberich replied giving away nothing conceding nothing offering nothing talamir sighed you could be more gracious alberichyes we know what your name isyou must know that my taver has been talking virtually nonstop to your kantor and what kantor knows about you so do i talamirs eyes became very penetrating i know very well that you have a good command of our tongue now and furthermore your kantor can easily explain anything you dont understand immediately i should prefer not to spend this entire first interview fencing with you if you please well that gave him the opening hed been looking for my kantor it is he asked resentfully and when was there asking on my part for this choosing this socalled honor talamir shrugged you could be dead right now he pointed out whether you consider it an honor or not kantor saved your life for which blessing to serve my enemy i am bound there was a sour taste in his mouth and his stomach muscles were so tight as to make his cracked ribs ache in protest hed not only been kidnapped he had been reduced to simplemindedness with drugsbut now that he was himself again he had no intention of rolling over like a cowed dog and licking the hands of his captors i was not aware that valdemar had personally done you harm said talamir nor was i aware that any citizen of valdemar had hurt you i was under the impression that everything untoward that had happened to you was the responsibility of the denizens of your own land if you can point out to me who and what on this side of the border has wronged you i assure you it will be dealt with to your satisfaction even if it kantor is he asked and looked talamir straight in the eyes there was silence in his mind kantor talamir gazed on him with astonishment your companion who under false pretenses and a disguise attached himself to me who carried me off who brought me here where i would not have gone had i a choice been given whoperhapshad to do somewhat with my witchsight coming so clear and in front of a voice he saw talamir wince and felt his own mouth tighten in grim satisfaction who therefore could the cause be that the voice to the fires condemned me you would be dead right now talamir repeated uncomfortably you couldnt have denied your gift with or without kantor sooner or later it would have betrayed you and you would still have gone to the fires but my own death it was and mine was the choice to face or to escape it he pointed out anger and resentment coloring every word that choice from me was taken perhaps the witchsight i could have fought taken from me also was the option to try and in the first place had not the witchsight come upon me when and where it did condemned i should not have been a village might have gone under the sword though the silence that fell between them was as heavy and uncompromising as lead but it was not talamir who answered him i am sorry alberich said the voice in his mind humbly and full of contrition you are absolutely in the right you had a life and choices and i took them from you i shant even bother to make all of the arguments that a valdemaran would accept you arent a valdemaran and there is no reason you should accept them for you my actions were nothing less than arrogance and a smug certainty that i was in the right to run roughshod over you all i can do is apologize and try to make it right with you he closed his eyes his own heart contracting at the hurt and pain in that voice armoring himself against it with the anger and resentment in his a better way there could have been found he said aloud in a sense talamir replied quietly this is between you and kantor but ultimately all of us are responsible so i must apologize as well we take such pride in our freedom hereand then we turned around and robbed you of yours with the best intentions in the world even the voice that to the fires sent me good intentions may have had alberich retorted opening his eyes again if not to save my soul then those souls about me again talamir winced served my people did i and served them well he continued bitterness overflowing at the thought that he had been forced to abandon those villagers who depended on him to stand vigilant guard over their safety who now protect them will the voices ha those who willed in my place to stand he glared daring talamir to answer him i do not know talamir admitted quietly but i have already offered any remedy that you could ask what do you suggest name it and i will do my personal best to see it done in the face of such a reasonable answer alberichs anger suddenly collapsed like an inflated bladder with a pin put to it i he began and rubbed his eyes faced with uncertainty of monumental proportions i know not would you have us undo what we have done talamir persisted alberich snorted and how return i cannot notorious i am doubtless if ever a time for remedy was it now long past is talamir sighed we tell our youngsters that companions choice is irrevocable and for life but that is notaltogethertrue the bond can be broken between you if you both want it broken badly enough it will leave youdamaged but it can be broken that held him silent for a moment there was a bond between them and if breaking it would leave him damaged what would it do to kantor he thought about the pain in kantors mental words when the companion apologized and winced away from the very idea no matter what had happened to him he could not be responsible for creating more pain this moots nothing he replied stalling nowhere to go now have i talamir nodded well in light of thatwould you consider giving usgiving life herea trial period surely no choice can properly be made without all the information you need once you know us as we are i believe you will choose to remain in valdemar to choose the heralds he opened his mouth and closed it again because logically and unemotionally speaking he honestly could not think of a good reason why he shouldnt do as the herald asked i wish you would said the wistful voice in his mind in the sunlord i still believe he began bringing up the only remaining stumbling block that occurred to him that is not an issue talamir waved that objection aside it never was but perhaps you would rather hear that from a true priest of the sunlord he blinked a voice of vkandis here not a voice alberichbut i should let him speak for himself talamir murmured something to the healer who nodded and went to the door of this room he passed out of it and another much older man stepped inside accompanied by a second about alberichs age talamir rose and offered his seat to the older man who took it this is alberich father henrick he said alberich this is father henrick and acolyte gerichen his assistant alberich eyed them both with caution neither wore the red robes of a voice nor the black of an ordinary priest instead the older man sported a similarly cut gown of fine creamcolored wool and the younger a plainer robe of unbleached linen both had the familiar disk of the sunlord on a chain that hung down over the breast of their robes however you serve vkandis sunlord he asked rather doubtfully father henrick nodded gravely i was born in asherbeg captain he said in unaccented karsite i was taken into the service of the sunlord when i was eight and made a full priest at twenty even as you i am a child of karsite soil and i still serve the sunlord and at twentyonei was ordered to cleanse three children from the border village to which i had been assigned alberich went very still and he asked the priest made a rude noise what sort of monster do you take me for captain he asked i couldnt of course they were children guilty of nothing more than having powers that the voices find inconvenient instead of cleansing them i took them and escaped over the border with them where i met with a herald who in turn took me to the temple here we dont call it the temple of vkandis of course we refer to it as the temple of the lord of lightbut those who attend know it and us for what we are powers alberich said feeling very stupid all of a sudden as his anger and resentment drained away leaving nothing behind inconvenient father henrick looked as if he had gotten a mouthful of green mead those abilities that you have been taught are witchpowers and signs of the contamination of demons are nothing more thanthan inborn powers that a child has no more control over than he does over whether or not he will be a great musician or a great cook or a great swordsman he doesnt alberich asked dumbly of course not the priest snapped and when these powers are something that the voices find useful if the child is young enough to be trained it is whisked into the temple rather than being burned it is only those whose powers are of no use to the son of the sun or who are too old to be molded into a pleasing shape that are sent to the flames alberich was glad that he was propped up by pillows else he would have been reeling the priest looked as if he had plenty more to say but his assistant placed a cautionary hand on his arm father enough the younger man said in valdemaran this poor fellow looks as if you had just stunned him with a club in truth that is exactly what alberich felt like i he faltered ihad no notion you are not a stupid man captain the old priest said roughly and you have a mind young enough to be flexible if you will it try opening it he flushed at the rebuke and felt horribly uncomfortable this priest reminded him all too clearly of the old priest of his home a crusty old man who had the respect of everyone in the village and whose speech was as blunt as his common sense was good so well was he regarded despite a short temper and curmudgeonly demeanor that when a voice wished to have him replaced by a younger man the entire village rose up in protest and the scheme was abandoned but he began in an attempt to explain himself that he knew before he started would be futile but indeed you have been given a great gift alberich of karse a gift that can serve you and our people an opportunity that will leadwell i cannot tell where it will lead the old man glared at him from beneath bushy eyebrows there is a reason for all of this i am sure of it as sure as i am that it is men and not the sunlord who have made karse and valdemar enemies you say that you want to help our people our people are led by frauds and charlatans half if not more of the voices are false and every highranking priest is corrupt and now this happens a soldier of karse is chosen to be a herald of valdemar and i doubt not it is by the will of the sunlord himself does that not seem like the hand of the sunlord himself to you alberich was covered in confusion i cannot tell well then trust that i can the old man snapped this is a gift an opportunity beyond price if you piss it away i shall be most angry with you and rest assured that when the time comes and you stand before vkandis throne he will ask you why you threw away the gift he placed in your hands for the gods sake man cant you see your sacred duty when it stares you in the face faced with that stern face of authorityof legitimate authoritywhat could he do or say he tried to wrench his gaze away from the priests eyes so that he could thinkand found that he couldnt but i was given no choice he tried to protest the priest snorted dont be daft he retorted you could have stayed there to die and you didnt you made your choice when you sensibly took the rescue that was offered and as for having your life interfered with balderdash if your companion had never sought you out and that particular voice hadnt discovered your giftthe thing you call a witchpoweranother would have only this time there would have been no rescue and what is more your socalled guilt could have been used to bring others to the fires others who were innocent of anything except supporting you talamir was standing very patiently to one side pretending to pay no attention to what was going on althoughalberich had to wonder given what hed said about the companions talking to one another and to him if he wasnt managing to follow the entire conversation despite having no working knowledge of karsite the priest glared a moment longer then abruptly his expression softened lad youre angry and resentful that your life has been turned upside down you wouldnt be human if you werent youre bitter and in despair at being betrayed you should be but be bitter at the right people not those who want only your welfare if youre not frightened at being caught up in something you dont understand id be very much surprised and id suspect that one of those blows to your head had addled your wits now you think youre utterly alone well youre not i didnt know about you until a moment ago alberich began the old man shook his head that wasnt what i meant ive been living here for better than forty years and ive learned a thing or two about heralds noi meant something else entirely open your heartand i mean really open itto your companion and youll see what i mean alberich meant to shake his head in denial but another stern look from the priest killed the gesture before he could make it dont argue he said dont think of an excuse just do it and while youre at it open your mind as well as your heart the old man rose ill be going now but if you need me they know where to find me or where to send you if youd prefer once youre on your feet for that matter im sure your companion would have no difficulty finding me wherever i happened to be without you having to ask anyone but him with that he nodded to talamir and shuffled out followed by his acolyte the door closed behind them and alberich stifled a sound that was midway between a sigh and a groan his sacred duty to join the heralds was it hard words thrown in the face of one who had lived his life by cleaving to duty sacred or not hard words spoken by one who had been forced to abandon a potentially better life than anything ahead of alberich because he could not reconcile orders with duty if anyone had a right to be bitter it was the priest but there was no bitterness behind that roughhewn exterior manner and no duplicity either nothing but unvarnished unadorned truth as the old man had seen it as he sees it but with forty years more experience of this place than alberich had he swore under his breath pardon talamir said i didnt quite hear what you said alberich was going to growl nothing and then changed his mind i said make a trial of you i shall he answeredso brusquely even rudely that he was surprised that talamir didnt take offense but the herald didnt good he said instead and moved to follow in the steps of the priest and his helper but he turned when he got the door opened in that case there is one thing i should like to ask you to do he said with another of those measuring looks before the healer returns should like you to open your mind to kantor completely i thinki hope it will make a difference to you he left the room then without waiting for alberichs answer but then given that the priest had virtually ordered alberich to do the same thing he probably didnt need to wait he already knew thateventually at leastalberich would make a trial of that too eventually in his own time the healer fussed over him for a bit then prepared to leave on a low table within easy reach were a pitcher of water a cup and a vial of one of the painkilling potions take it when you need it and are ready to sleep the healer told him or not at all if thats your choice but drink the water alberich couldnt tell if the mans brusque manner was his ordinary demeanor or due to discovering where alberich had come from it could be both and maybe now that he knew alberich was from karse he might be having second thoughts maybe that wasnt just an ordinary painkilling potion on the other hand the man was leaving him with the potion and giving him the option of drinking it or not unlikely that it was poisonwhy waste all that time and effort in healing him just to poison him if the situations were reversed a guest of the sunpriests would likely not be treated at all much less given a comfortable room and painkilling drugs the potion will wear off about dinnertime if you choose to drink it the healer continued its about time for you to start feeding yourself again instead of having someone ladle broth into you evidently they were ready to see the last of him well the feeling was mutual alberich was more than ready to do without healers altogether already hed had more attention for his injuries now than hed ever had for every other injury in his life combined then the man left closing the door behind him leaving alberich alone in his tiny cell of a room not that his quarters in the barrackswhen hed actually been in them which was rarewere any larger but the two rooms could not have been more different the outer wall of this room held a large window with actual glass panes in it the wall directly opposite held the door the other two walls were blank and the room was tiled in a pale graygreen a restful color if a trifle dull tiles on a wall though that was something odd for furnishings well there were the bed he was on a little threelegged table and a stool to match not much need for a clothes chest in a sickroom he supposed he was he discovered wearing only smallclothes beneath his blankets and sheet and they werent even his smallclothes everything about him that was karsite was gone on the other hand perhaps that was just as well the less to mark him as the enemy the better from where he was lying in bed all he could see was a single white cloud a mere wisp of a thing drifting from one side to the other not a very inspiring view in fact there was nothing much in this place to occupy the mind suddenly he wanted to actually look out that window he wanted to see more than just sky and clouds he felt stifled this was the longest period of time that he had spent without seeing the outside world sincewell he couldnt remember even when hed been a cadet hed been outside riding exercising training even when hed been hurt before hed been in his own quarters ableindeed expectedto get about and take up light duties his hands were still bandaged but lightly and they didnt hurt so much anymore he could use themcarefully well the sooner he got out of bed the sooner hed finish healing gingerly he slid his legs out from under the covers and put his feet on the cold tiled floor sitting straight up on the edge of the bed there was a painful twinge in his chest an ungentle reminder of broken ribs nothing wrong with my legs anyway there were some pink patcheshealing burnsbut at least no one had broken any foot or leg bones when theyd beaten him a good thing tooif his leg had been broken hed never have been able to get onto kantors back now would he hed been hurt in the line of duty often enough to know to pause after every movement to see how badly he felt there was no point in undoing the work of healing by passing out and falling on the floor because he tried to leap out of bed like a healthy person so he hesitated for a moment with his feet chilling on the tiles testing for a sign of weakness waiting for his vision to blur or fade out but other than those twinges he was fine so far so good now the true test standing up if that didnt make him pass out nothing would it didnt now to get to the window moments latermoments that had felt like far longer as halfhealed bits of him protested his movement vehemently with every stephe stood at the window sweating shaking but looking out what he saw was not what he had expected he supposed he would look out on an enclosed courtyard certainly something with high walls around it surely they would not have put him inside anything less secure instead he saw gardens wonderful gardens and they were extensive enough that he couldnt see the walls that must certainly be there these were no common pleasure parks or bits of waste ground for just anyone to stroll about on directly beneath his window was a graveled path bordered on either side with a low herbaceous hedge to either side of that were trees in ornamental clumps with planted beds of foliage arranged around and among them the gardens themselves must have been very old for the trees looked ancient the grass as smooth and even as plush the bushes and flowering plants as if they had been there since the beginning of time there were stone benches and individual seats placed to best enjoy sun or shade and lanterns hung from wroughtmetal stands beside the benches nowhere were there fences to keep people away from the plantings or even confine them to the paths except for that little hedge and it wasnt even kneehigh once or twice alberich had seen gardens like this behind the homes of the wealthy but never this extensive his room was on the second floor of this building giving him an elevated view it was a uniquely advantageous one for determining what his surroundings were like there must have been a door directly below his window for the path led up to it and people were entering and leaving from directly below where he stood young people he saw with a start they wore tunics and trews or long robes in a paler color of green than the healer he had seen some of them couldnt be older than ten those are healertrainees said kantor tentatively where we areits healers collegium where young healers are taught as well as being a house of healing youre on the grounds of a complex that includes heralds collegium where the heralds are trained healers collegium and bardic collegium and the palace thats why all the gardens of course the pleasure gardens for the palace the herb gardens for the healers and kitchen gardens theyre open to everyone within the walls the palace they allowed him a karsite to be within the same walls that enclosed the palace granted he was hurt but stillif he were an assassin he wouldnt let a little thing like that stop him and most of the time he was unwatched unguardedhow could they possibly trust him youre with me kantor replied simply the simple bald statement took him utterly by surprise he was with kantorand these people considered that to be enough to trust him within reach of the rulers of their land he recalled the attitude of the healer and revised that some of them considered that to be enough or maybe he is just like that with all of his patients he looked out on the gardens for a little before answering so these people train healers in one central place mostly sometimes they apprentice with an older healer or are trained at one of the temples of healing especially if they are uneasy about leaving their homes but thats rare we prefer that our healers come here to learn so that we know that theyve gotten a standard educationand any special training that their gifts and talents might warrant kantor paused would you rather that i not speak to you this way he thought about it for a moment it seemed to him that this sharing of thoughts should have seemed like a violation yet it didnt he couldnt account for that very foreign feelingunless perhaps hed gotten used to it while he was semiconscious so now it just didnt raise the instinctive alarm in him that it ordinarily would have and he could not deny how useful it was to be able to silently speak and ask questions about this place and these people noi would rather you helped me i said that i would give all of you a trial i dont know that i can manage that without you butwhere are you right here he would not have believed that anything as big as a horse could have hidden itself virtually in plain sightbut there was just a little movement and kantor stepped into view through a screen of bushes he was followed by two more of the white companions then another two they all stood just below his window to one side of the path looking up at him with eyes so vivid a blue that even from here they struck him with their intensity were all five of us waiting for our chosen to heal in there he said with wry humor heralds have a habit of winding up in the hands of healers these people permitted horses in their formal gardens he could just imagine the mess that would have caused in the garden of the son of the sun we arent exactly horses kantor reminded him and here at the collegia people know they can trust us not to step on or eat the rosesor in this case rosemary everyone here knows exactly what we are and we can pretty much go where we wish and do what we want even into the palace if we need to alberich looked down on them with reluctant interest now with four more of these companions to compare kantor with it was very clear that kantor was distinct among his kind it hadnt been obvious how powerful he was when alberich had only been comparing him with ordinary horses there was some illusion on my part as well kantor admitted sheepishly i hid my eye color for one thing but the other four werewell like graceful acrobats or dancers kantor was far more muscular his head perhaps a bit blockier his neck arched and strong his hindquarters and chest definitely deeper and with fantastically developed muscles i am a warrior companion to a warrior my friends need speed and endurance more than they need strength i need strength and sheer power as well as stamina no matter where your duties take you i will always be able to fight at your side and guard your back kantor seemed very proud of that and for the first time alberich felt himself warm to the creature just a little they had that much in common at least a warrior companion to a warrior at the moment he felt rather less than half of that there was a growing feeling in his gut as if he should be trembling as if in a moment he would he knew that feeling it meant he was coming to the end of his reserves in fact it was becoming rather urgent to sit down he was not going to be able to stand at all soon maybe he shouldnt be surprised considering all that had been done to him and how recently but it did seem as if his reserves of strength were not what they should have been then it dawned on him why it was that he should feel weaker than expectedit had been a healer a real healer in the room with him presumably the others who had cared for him were healers as well he hadnt just been physicked and doctored hed been healed as he would have been under the skilled ministrations of a healerpriest in a temple and that shocked him they had actually gone so far as to have him healed not just wait for him to get better on his own as had always happened in the past except for one single time when he had been badly hurt in traininga pure accident when a bolt of lightning hit the training field killed three horses outright and sent the rest into a blind panic and hed been thrown and trampled so no wonder he felt shaky and weak in the knees healing took of your own strength and resources speeding up what normally took days and weeks into hours and days he probably even weighed a great deal less than he had when theyd brought him here small wonder the healer wanted him to start feeding himself there was no way that he could get enough nourishment to sustain healing on broth you should go back to bed kantor admonished i believe that i will and take that pain potion the healer left for me while im at it he knew that part of the drill well enough it wasnt the first time hed been hurt though it was the first time it had been at the hands of his own people and that well just at the moment he would rather go back to bed and to the oblivion promised by the pain potion than think about it herald talamir finished his informal report on the karsite and waited to see what his king would make of it so our newest trainee is not at all pleased about being chosen eh king sendar askedor rather stated this was no formal audience it wasnt even witnessed by another herald unless one counted the presence of sendars heir his daughter selenay who was halfway through her training as a herald they were all in sendars study in the royal suite in the palacethe private study not the one where those who were not intimate with the royal family would see the king privately this room had been the queens solar until sendar appropriated it for himself it faced south and looked out into the queens garden a courtyard that had no other entrance than the one in this room roses still bloomed out there beyond the glass late though it was in the season and it was home to other flowers and plants that needed tender sheltering from the worst of winters wrath it made a tranquil retreat for a harried monarch who wanted some peacealthough there really was no way that sendar could escape altogether from the troubles of the realm talamir shook his head no sire hes not the kings own replied regretfully i must confess im at a loss as to how to proceed with him this was hardly the response i expected he knew sendar better than anyone else in valdemarprobably better even than the late queen hadbut sendar surprised him with his dry chuckle im not the king said truth to tell im glad to hear it im not certain id trust someone who would abandon everything hes believed in until now just because a talking horse tells him that hes been chosen to join the enemy oh talamir replied blinking buthis own people nearly killed him in their firesi thought his own people had a perfectly good reason to burn him in their fires by their lights sendar pointed out raising his eyebrow and sooner or later hell think of that for himself assuming he hasnt already fine perhaps kantor has managed to insinuate enough into his head while hes been healing to make him a bit more receptive to us but a thinking man doesnt just suddenly go over to the enemy without reasoning things through for himself and it will eventually occur to him that just because kantor is mindspeaking to him it doesnt necessarily follow that kantor is telling him the truth i would bet on that talamir sensed tavers surge of indignation at any such notionand more remotely sensed sendars lorenils amusement at both of them well lorenil always had possessed a strong sense of irony not to mention a sense of humor that was positively sardonic rather like young kantor in that regard were going to have to win this young fellow to us old friend sendar said as if he was completely comfortable with the notion well have to be completely honest with him or hell figure out weve been shading the truth for his benefitbut well also have to show him why were trustworthy and his own people arent hell have to come to the conclusion that were telling him the truth and that he has a real and compelling reason to give us his loyalty all by himself anything heavyhanded and well lose him sendar leaned back in his chaira modest affair of simple design and unornamented wood and leather chosen for comfort rather than ostentation and bestowed a penetrating look on the kings own herald he and talamir had known each other and been friends for a very very long time in fact their friendship dated from the hour that talamir had been chosen by taver as kings own herald on the death of his predecessora premature death brought on by too much stress too much work and a brainstorm talamir had been so young uncertain in his office and disoriented by the bond with taver which was so strong and so lifealtering sendar on the other hand had been a very young king but not at all uncertain in his office young he might have been but hed been schooled in his duties since he could toddle hed been a handsome young man then blond and tall and strong with chiseled features worthy of a god and an idealistic nature tempered with that finelyhoned sense of irony he was handsome still though there was as much gray in his hair as gold and age and care had continued to wield a cruel hand against those features chiseling lines of worry that gave him a rather stern look kingly but there was no doubt that people found him intimidating on occasion his own sardonic sense of humor didnt help on those occasions he rather enjoyed being intimidating now and again he promised that he would give us a trial talamir told the king knowing how sendar would react sendar liked audaciousness hed loved it in his queen who had boldly proposed to him rather than the other way around who had met every challenge even the illness that killed her with spirit and determination sendar laughed as talamir had expected a dry little chuckle his daughter princess selenay who had been staring rather fixedly at nothing at all as she listened made a face i dont see whats so funny she objected selenay might one day grow into the dry wit her father possessed but at the moment she was in a stage where she took everything quite seriously and earnestly talamir found that uniquely endearing as did her father not funny my dearironic sendar told her a karsite of all things giving us a chance to prove our good intentions if youll recall your history youll know why that seems ironic selenay hesitated toying with the end of her single braid then evidently decided to be as forthright as her father he must be a man of honor or kantor wouldnt have chosen him so why should that be ironic cant karsites have men of honor too it seems to me he has every right to require us to prove ourselves perhaps because the karsite leaders have broken every pact they ever madeand have even made war on their own people sendar suggested mildly she flushed as talamir gave her an opaque look but persisted why should that mean he shouldnt demand we prove ourselves though the karsiteswell how much do we know about them next to nothing maybe in their minds they had honorable reasons to break their pacts i mean i should think that this man would have more reason to be suspicious sendar shook his head chosen dont just dismiss her because shes young taver cautioned clearly this had gone from a discussion of one man to a more abstract problem well i still dont see why just because there are a few bad people in charge of things in karse we should assume that nearly everyone that comes from there is bad she said stubbornly well look one of them has just been chosen i dont see why there shouldnt be as many men of honor there as here the problem with that assumption is that once a man of honor sees what his leaders are doing is wrong shouldnt it be incumbent on him to do something about it talamir asked the princess who made a little grimace of impatience with the sorts of things that the sunpriests have been doing even the most devout worshiper of vkandis is going to run out of excuses for their excesses what if he cant she asked do something about it i mean if nothing else he should leave sendar pointed out by giving his support to a bad leader he reinforces the position of that leader people see that he is good and since he continues to act in support of the leader however inadvertently they assume there is must be very compelling reasons for the leader to act as he is and they continue to bear the intolerable talamir nodded selenay looked uncertain but not entirely convinced shell learn he decided experience that was what she needed the point is that its rather ironic that this karsite who has already had his own leaders turn against him and try to execute him for the use of a gift that has been the saving of their own people should then expect us to prove ourselves to him not that we blame him at all we just find it ironic i can see that the girl replied with a frown but i can also see why he has even more reason to want us to prove ourselves what do you propose we do with this fellow sendar asked changing the subject there are bound to be objections to his presence once more people discover where hes from i dont see any point in even trying to keep that a secret talamir replied shaking his head itll be out no matter what we do its a pretty problem and one that isnt easily going to be solved we can hardly expect people to set aside old grievances its one i wish we didnt have sendar looked as if he was getting a headache i suppose all these things happen for a reason but i would be happy enough for this to be occurring in someone elses reign everyone always says that taver observed taver should know i suppose they do so so so you and i have enough on our plate i would say without complicating our lives with this most difficult of trainees sendar pursed his lips who can we delegate to bring the young fellow over to our side and make him admit to himself that his own leaders didnt deserve his loyalty gerichen talamir said instantly that young sunpriest hes he groped for words hes transparent eventually i suppose hell learn to mask what hes thinking but for now his openness will work for us all very well but what about within the collegium sendar persisted we need a herald jadus i think hes taking a turn at instructor this term and elcarth both of them are so utterly different from anyone alberich will have encountered before he thought for a moment longer ill have to keep an eye on things though the instructors can hardly be expected to act as nursemaids to him id like to assign another trainee to him but there just arent any that are adult at the moment i cant have anyone younger acting as his guide hell resent it sendar nodded but selenay spoke up make him my bodyguard she suggested they both turned to stare at her well she said defensively if you make him my bodyguard i can help him to settle in he wont be offended and in fact hell probably be flattered after all it isnt as if a mere captain would ever be made the personal guard to anyone important in karse making him my guard will show that we trust him and i think that could be very important in making him trust us dont you think actually sendar said slowly yes i do and while hes at it he can teach me karsite someone ought to know how to speak it brilliant taver enthused absolutely brilliant even if the rest of the council will have apoplexy talamir asked dubiously selenay raised her chin yes and i think you ought to tell them that this was my idea they might as well get used to the notion that i can think for myself im too old to be chucked under the chin and called little one and told not to bother my pretty head about things which is going to come as a shock to no few of them talamir kept his sighs strictly mental evidently the gods had decided that he was going to have to make do with fewer candlemarks of rest from now onbecause he certainly was not going to leave all of this to the sole attention of heralds elcarth and jadus worthy though they might be so be it sendar gave his blessing and dismissal all in one despite talamirs misgivings admittedly though the misgivings were all concerned with other peoples reactions to alberich and not anything having to do with alberichs trustworthiness kantor was convinced so was taver that was all that talamir needed talamir id like you to organize elcarth and jadus let them recruit priest gerichen not you oh that shouldnt be difficult talamir admitted i suspect that gerichens superior already has something like that in mind since he brought the fellow along this afternoon on his official pastoral visit then once hes on his feet and ready to be integrated into the collegium selenay id like you to see to the bodyguard business sendar continued his daughter nodded her eyes bright easily done she replied confidently she looked like a cat that had just made off with an entire jug full of cream and a brace of trout to boot very pleased with herself she should be taver put in perhapsbut she still seemed very young to him too young to be so closely involved with this potentially dangerous situation he could readily foresee council members suspecting that alberich was subverting the young heir yes but thats supposed to be what she is going to do to him replied taver really chosen if you think that a healthy young man is going to be indifferent to an intelligent and attractive young lady and isnt going to be influenced by her youre very much mistaken you have a point and im sure the thought has crossed her fathers mind as well he admitted he sensed tavers amusement there you have it if you take that line with the council it will be clear that sendar believes selenay can handle the responsibility true that would be all to the good and if you point out it was her idea it gives her more validity in her own right also true he was glad that sendar was seeing to it that selenay was brought along as the heirinfact as well as the heirinname but it meant a lot of work still better a lot of work now than trying to bring her up to the job later in a crisis because kings even the kings of valdemar were mortal and no matter what the circumstances king sendars death would precipitate a crisis now is there any sign of a repercussion down there along the karse border from this incident sendar asked and talamir gladly turned the subject to the simpler one of espionage reports and troop movements well relatively simpler at the moment the best guess is that the incident has been completely suppressed talamir replied there are no reports not even rumors from what our informants can tell us we dont even really know which little village kantor won him out of theyre keeping it so quiet we think its sunsdale because thats the only one that recently beat off bandits but theres no word of anyone escaping the fires from there it must be an acute embarrassment to them sendar speculated good lets hope it stays that way i would rather they didnt have any more excuses to prod at us down there you have a talent for understatement majesty talamir replied rubbing his brow absently with one knuckle prod is not precisely how i would put it but the mission you sent me on in the first place is a complete success joyeaus has got a borderwatch based on the old firewatchtowers everywhere along the border except on holderkin landsand theres enough overlap that nothing larger than a bandit troop is going to slip past even there then the damned stiffnecked holderkin can fight off their own bandits sendar growled and may they wallow in their pride until they choke on it her fathers outburst caught selenay by surprise and she directed a look of shock at talamir talamir just raised his eyebrows in a silent signal that promised ill tell you later she nodded very slightly joyeaus promised that she can have word to haven of real troop movements within half a day at the worst he continued it isnt just on our side of the border that those old watchtowers exist we can see theirs and they can see ours and there has been unofficial cooperation among the foresters for generations about alerting each other to forest fires sendar snorted fire doesnt stop at the border no matter how many guards you post talamir nodded the point is of course that we can see their watchtowers and now ours will be manned in or out of fire season and weve got one more safeguard in place if one of our informants has a message too urgent to be sent by hand and he can get to one of the fire towers hell light a fire beacon or flash a mirroron their side not a big one or for long but it will be a signal that will warn the local highborn that something is coming and from what direction which means well have even earlier warning if not the specifics remind me to find some appropriate way to thank my idiot southborder highborn for having the sense to cooperate with each other for a change sendar growled though to talamirs ears the growl sounded pleased and relieved remind me actually meant talamir go figure it out for me of course this time however it was a request that had been anticipated from the moment that joyeaus had gotten all of the heads of the noble families to sit down at the same table and begin ironing out their differences that young woman had the most remarkable talent for diplomatic maneuvering and soothing ruffled feathers that talamir had ever seen a touch of empathy helped of course but mostly it was a knack for saying exactly the right thing at the right time and being exquisitely sensitive to interpersonal nuances shed been utterly wasted on riding circuits ill see to it majesty talamir murmured glad that there was at least one small task that would be relatively easy to discharge unlike the untimely arrival of that unlikeliest of trainees now what about that tannery that lord wordercan wants to put in sendar continued hes been nagging at me for the last week i know its something he wants but im not sure the market can absorb that much more leather talamir bent his mind to the business of the kingdom allowing himself to put the matter of trainee alberich aside for the momentuntimely unlikely and oh so inconvenient as he was alberich looked dubiously into the mirror at himself the healers had done a better job on his face than he ever would have thought possible but nevertheless he was scarred and scarred badly he looked as if someone had beaten his face with a redhot whip several years ago at least the scars werent a livid halfhealed red or hed be frightening children and horses his weathered tan had faded as well in the time hed spent recovering and he was thinner not that hed been carrying any extra weight before his cheekbones seemed especially prominent and his mouth still stubborn and theyd damned well better read it that way he was wearing what was apparently the standard uniform for a valdemaran cadet a heraldtrainee kantor corrected i dont believe that you will find that cadets and trainees are at all equivalent this uniform was very new and in fact had been made to his measure while he was still staggering about trying to get his strength back some strange little fellow had invaded his sickroom one day asked him to stand measured him all over took tracings of his feet and vanished again today one of these uniforms had appeared along with a gentlefaced herald he didnt know and herald talamir the cut and design of this uniform was identical to the heralds uniformswell all of the ones hed seen other than talamirs the difference was the colora dark gray alberich approved of that color it was a great deal less conspicuous than spotless white it also suited his own somber disposition you cut a good figure talamir said approvingly but then again we dont often tailor a trainees new outfits to him it would be a waste of time and effort since most of them are youngsters still growing this isnt the usual color for a trainee the strange herald who had been introduced as jadus said apologetically were apparently out of the usual materials at the moment and im afraid that youre a bit larger than our run of usual newlychosen so you wouldnt fit into the old ones from the common stock the man was older than alberich approaching middle age with sandy hair and expressive features so open and honest that alberich knew he would never hold his own in a game of chance but the one thing that alberich noticed most about him were his hands graceful flexible strong but not powerful they were not the hands of a fighter not even an archer the new herald smiled and shrugged i suppose youre lucky actually when i say common stock its because the uniforms are all parceled out by general sizes handmedowns to be honest worn until they arent fit to wear anymore and cycled among all of those who wear the same size we find that its not a bad thing given that highborns or their families might be inclined to embellish any uniforms that were actually their property which negates the whole point of having a uniform in the first place keeping to these i think i will be alberich replied and shrugged conspicuous already i am true enough talamir agreed and perhaps by making you a trifle more conspicuous we will at least make it evident that we arent trying to hide you alberich flexed his arms and legs experimentally it might be new but this uniform had been laundered several times to soften the fabric linen shirt a fine pair of wellfitting boots heavy canvastwill trews and tunic at least it was a comfortable uniform practical and easy to move in it could have been much worse he supposed that these garments would have to be made to take a considerable beating if they were to serve several sets of trainees in their usual lifespan certainly sunsguard cadets were hard on their uniforms and he doubted that valdemaran boys would be any different and girls kantor reminded him talamir excused himself he had after all only come along to effect the introduction of alberich to jadus that left the two men alone in an awkward moment of silence alberich stared at the older man wondering what he saw alberich could no more disguise what he was than jadus could disguise what he felt so alberich observed finally my keeper you are to his surprise jadus laughed hardly that no actually im one of your instructors and since i have a smatteringa mere smattering mind youof karsite i was nominated to take you around to the collegium get you settled in and introduce you to the rest of your instructors alberich tried to keep his expression a neutral one but he still wasnt at all happy about this whole collegium business he was the one giving them a trial after allso why all this business of putting him into the collegium why couldnt he simply observe quietly so he could make an informed decision about what he would do next why start him on classes when in a moon or two he might be shaking the dust of this place from his shoes it seemed to be an exercise in futility and one that might have a negative effect on people who would be wondering how much effort they should put into teaching him when the next day he might be gone yet even as he thought that he wondered as he recovered hed had several visits from the earnest young gerichen who seemed convinced that none of this had been an accident that the sunlord himself was behind all of this for some inscrutable purpose known only to the one god he was trying in his own selfdeprecating fashion to convince alberich of this notion alberich was in something of a quandary over this on the one hand he had difficulty imagining why the sunlord would choose to put one of his karsite people in valdemar as a herald when there were better candidates who were born here surely someone who was valdemaran was a better choice hed speak the language already hed know all about heralds and probably be thrilled to be chosen and there would be no question of his being accepted by other valdemarans on the other hand vkandis did not move to interfere in the lives of his worshipers often but when he didthere was a reason and who was alberich to try and understand or secondguess the motives and actions of the one god that would be hubris of the worst sort if a sunpriest thought he saw the hand of the sunlord in this he might be right in that case the wisest and best thing that alberich could do would be to humbly bow his head and accept what vkandis intended for him but gerichen was young he might be right he might be divinely inspired but he might well be merely enthusiastic as for settling in that was proving far more difficult than any valdemaran would be willing to accept alberich feltwell he couldnt put a name to it dislocated and adrift was part of it unsettled far too mild utterly alien came close but didnt address the feeling of having no support beneath him as if he were at the halfway point of a blind leap it was far too late to go back but he wasnt sure hed land safely and he certainly didnt know what hed find if he did and that went for how he felt about the one god too for the first time hed had leisure to think about his religion and his own faith he had questions a great many of them and none of them had answers for instance if vkandis wished to make peace between karse and valdemar why not simply appear as he used to in the great temple why go to the trouble of having one single minor officer in the sunsguard chosen it seemed an unreasonably convoluted path to follow to him but on the other handonce again the biggest stumbling blockwho was he to be asking questions like that he was only one man one among many who wasnt even a priest how could he possibly know what was best for karse but why had vkandis sunlord left his land to fester on its own for so long what had happened to all the miracles the appearances of the ancient days where was the sunlord that he allowed his shepherds to turn wolf and prey upon their flocks he wrenched his mind away from the doubts and questions and turned it squarely to face the hereandnow you say the rest of my instructors he repeated carefully and it will take how long to learn to a herald be if i ever wish to do so that is there was one clear answer to why this jadus had been chosen to play guide to him there was nothing intimidating at all about the man and nothing of duplicity either at least they were holding to their promise they would let him decide for himself with no pressure on their part the herald rubbed the side of his nose with one long finger for the usual chosen who come in here at about age thirteen or fourteen and who arelacking in a lot of skills you already haveit takes about five years for you though i dont know jadus replied honestly nobody will know until we find out just how much you know plus there is a very great deal about the heralds and this land that you absolutely must know before you can serve in the field and he paused and looked thoughtful for a moment as if he had suddenly come up with a novel idea actually that may not quite be true something just occurred to meand we might as well see if my option is a sound one right away the herald smiled warmly lets trot you around alberich and see what comes of it the person i want you to see is on the way to the collegium anyway well enough alberich replied with resignation lead i follow it was not his first excursion out into the grounds within the palace walls but it would be the farthest he had gone since hed been encouraged to start leaving his bed the healers and his own caution kept him close to the building he had not wanted to risk running into anyone who had the potential to be overtly hostile hed already had enough sour or sorrowful looks from some of the healers and healertrainees hed encountered once it was widely known that he was karsite wellno one was claiming that valdemarans were without prejudice or incapable of holding a grudge though in this case he could hardly blame them so he had gone out but hadnt taken the kind of long arduous hikes he would have done had he been conditioning himself at home not that he was weak and shaky hed been putting himself through a course of physical exercise since that first hour of getting himself out of bed and looking out the window he knew far better than the healers did what he was and was not capable of and he knew very well that he was still young enough that his body would respond to being pushed to the limit by increasing where that limit stood so at this moment he was as fit as he had ever been if a bit thinner and paler as it turned out it was a very good thing that he was jadus led him through the gardens to a long low building set off by itself he had very little attention to spare for what were probably quite lovely gardens once he realized just what that building was there was really no mistaking it not when he saw the practice field laid out beside it with archery targets pells and other equipment then the lack of ordinary windows and the placement of clerestory windows instead made sense this was a salle a building devoted to the teaching and practice of arms the kind of building that had been home to him for longer than any actual homethree years in the little hut hed shared with his mother then the rest of the time in the little inn where she worked as a serving girl and cooks helper indeed he must have spent half his life in a similar building as a cadet he had divided all of his waking hours among formal classes reading and studying on his own and weaponswork he had never really taken any time for the recreation that the others did as a lowborn bastard he was not the social equal of any of the others in his year and he had figured out quite early that if he excelled in fighting no one would bother him he had already had a certain advantage in knowing all the dirty tricks he could pick up in the alleys and stables it wasnt long before the rest of the cadets knew better than to pick on him and while no one was particularly friendly with him they treated him with respect two of the weapons instructors seeing his diligence actually unbent enough to act as his mentors it wasnt exactly paternal since they were still very strict with him but friendly in a distant fashion and certainly encouraging when it came down to it probably hed spent the best times of his cadet period in the salle there was a line of solemnfaced children in gray uniforms practicing archery under the supervision of an older boy he clearly knew what he was doing alberich noted with approvalcorrecting the stance of one the grip of another the aim of a third but he hadnt been brought here to watch them jadus led him into the building itself without a pause it was of a pattern with every other salle that he had ever been inside from the sanded wooden floors to the mirrored wall to the clerestory windows above it was superior to the salle he had been trained in for the mirrors were silvered glass rather than polished metal but the furnishings were exactly the same dented and chipped wooden benches and storage boxes that doubled as seating practice armor of padded leather hung on the wall racks of wooden blades were beside the armor even the smell was the same clean sweat leather leather oil a hint of sawdust the salle was empty except for a single herald an old grayhaired man slightly twisted and with swollen arthritic joints he sat on a bench with some of the padded armor over his legs a threaded leather needle in his hand and looked up as they entered jadus he acknowledged thats the new one weaponsmaster dethor jadus nodded this is heraldtrainee alberich chosen of kantor kantor hmm sensible lad that one cant see him making a mistake well jadus what did you have in mind besides the usual the weaponsmaster stood up and alberich winced inwardly the man was in painhiding it but clear enough to alberichs eyes hed seen this before in men whod fought too many fights the joints would only take so much damage too much and as the years set in and the pains of old age crept on all the places that had been abused would suddenly become doubly painful swelling until it hurt to move even a little since he was a captain of the karsite light cavalry i did have a notion about him test him and well both see if im right was the enigmatic reply isnt kimel about hes usually here this time of day instead of answering directly the old man barked kimel need your arm out here alberich expected another herald but instead what appeared from a door at the back of the room was a man in a midnightblue uniform similar to the heralds in cut but trimmed in silver i was about to go back to the barracks weaponsmaster the man said unless youve found someone to bout with me after all the old man jerked his chin at alberich dont know need this one tested jadus seems to thinkwell just arm up and well see the man glanced at alberich then did a doubletake eyes widening alberich braced himself for a negative reaction but the man showed nothing interesting to see which rumor is true sir was all the man said and motioned to alberich if you would suit up and standard sword and shield first the weaponsmaster directed and put his mending aside his eyes narrowed and attentive in a lean lined hard face alberich might look just like him one day he hoped he would not have the swollen joints to match he pushed that thought aside and selected leather practice armor and a wooden sword there was more of the former to choose from than hed thought evidently this man kimel wasnt the only adult coming out here to practice the wooden swords and shields were much of a muchness nothing to choose among them except for weight and alberich picked ones that were the most comfortable for him then he walked warily to the center of the room to face his opponent alberich then went through the most exhausting weapons session hed had since hed graduated from cadet training it began with sword and shield progressing through every other practice weapon stored in the salle and their corresponding styles then as he waited to see what else the old man wanted him to do the herald directed jadus to lock the doors alberich was sweating like a horse at this point a bit tired but by no means exhausted and he gave the weaponsmaster a startled glance live steel next the old herald said shortly in answer to the unspoken question i dont want some idiot child wandering in here with live steel out and two real fighters having at each other ah alberich was perfectly satisfied with that answer the weaponsmaster was right if mere untutored children had access to the salle and he assumed they must since having a weaponsmaster implied that all of the young trainees got some sort of weapons training there was always the chance that one would blunder into the place at the worst possible time even in a bout rather than a real fight he knew his concentration was focused and he wouldnt necessarily notice anything but his opponent until it was too late he followed kimel to the cabinets on the wall and took out real armor and real weapons working with live steel always gave him an extrathe pun was inevitableedge his awareness went up a degree and everything seemed just that much clearer and sharper even his reflexes seemed to improve he suited up took the rapier in his hand and faced his opponent with energy renewed he assumed that he was expected to pull his blows when necessary and given the way that the bouts had gone so far he knew it was going to be necessary kimel was good very very good in fact alberich was better and kimel was tiring faster he wasnt going to be able to ward off everything that alberich could throw at him and he didnt alberich had chosen the rapier for that reason the lightest of the real swords it was the easiest to pull when a blow actually fell instead of being countered the weaponsmaster called a halt to the bouting when kimel was clearly on his last legs that enough practice for you my lad he asked a certain ironic amusement in his voice the young man pulled off his helm showing that his dark hair had gone black with his sweat enough weaponsmaster he admitted no matter what else you do please make sure this fellow has a candlemark or so free every couple of days so i have someone to bout with from now on im getting soft and by the havens it shows he actually smiled briefly at alberich ill do that the old man said with immense satisfaction its about time i found someone to put you on your mettle he turned to alberich as the young man dragged himself toward the storage lockers to divest himself of his armor well he barked are you too tired for more work whatever was in this mans mind alberich was determined not to disappoint him no he said shortly then added sir good jadus you can unlock the door trainee well see how you are with distance weapons ah alberich was already impressed with this weaponsmaster he had to assume the man had trained kimel and kimel was good not quite as good as alberich but then his own weaponsmasters had trained many boys that were good but few as dedicated to their craft as alberich there were those that were naturals at the art of war and alberich was one of thembut being naturally good at something only took one to a certain point it was dedication and practice that took one beyond that point or as his own weaponsmaster had said genius will only take you to good practice will take you to master now this dethor was a master it showed not only in that he had trained kimel but how he was testing alberichs level of stamina strength and expertise the point here was that the weaponsmaster had waited until alberich was tired to test him at distance weapons when his aim might be compromised by arms that shook with weariness and eyes blurred with exhaustion clever very clever now under the curious eyes of the youngsters as well as the critical eye of the old man alberich showed his mettlewith the longbow with the shorter horsebow then finally with spear javelin ax sling and knife he always hit the targetnot always in the black but he always hit the target by now he had an audience of wideeyed youngsters ranging in age from child to young adult it wasnt likely that they were in awe of his targeting skills it wasnt as if he was putting missile after missile into the same spot presumably they were dazzled because they had never seen one man use so many different distance weapons before youre enjoying yourself kantor remarked with pleasure and to his surprise alberich realized that the companion was right thisis what i do well he admitted i am not ashamed of doing it well did i suggest you should be kantor retorted you are what you are a warrior some must be warriors that others may live in peace you do not enjoy killing but you are proud of your skill i see no difficulty with this a thoughtful pause better that you should be proud of your skill when need drives you cannot hold back sensible quite sensible he placed a final knife in the center of the target and turned to jadus and dethor jadus was looking at dethor with an expression of expectation dethor was looking at alberich right he said karsite whats the job of a weaponsmaster so that those he teaches killed or injured are not alberich said instantly and bluntly however whatever works so that learn they do and well shouts scolds b he paused not beating perhaps sometimes gentle not often out in the world there will no gentleness be better harshness to see here and live than softness and die na thesere none of your karsite thugs no beatings but all else aye and treat em gentle only when theyre little scared sparrows gentle pats and cossetingthats for them as will never need to fight for life he turned a somewhat grim smile on jadus and the eyes of the childrenthe traineeswere getting round and apprehensive right by the havens ive got one now and whod have thought itd be softhanded peaceminded jadus whod be the one to find him realize what he was good for and bring him to me alberich was beginning to get the glimmer of an idea of what was up and the weaponsmasters next words clinched it dethor turned to him trainee alberich youre on notice therell be no riding circuit for you and no riding internship youll be interning starting now with me as the next weaponsmaster call itwell its no apprenticeship for youre nothing like an apprentice call it whatever you like youre going to be a trainee in name only butthe classes he managed as the children looked even more apprehensive if that was possible dethor flapped his hand dismissing the entire curriculum of the collegium as inconsequential oh youll take em you see to it jadus but no more than three classes in a day and id prefer one or two rather than three and no housekeeping chores and no dormitory for him eitherwell have him out here in my quarters and he can start doing what i cant anymore kernos bones what you thought youd be doing putting a grown man in amongst a lot of boys anyway its been done before jadus ventured dethor just snorted and looked alberich pointedly up and downthen at the children who had put a careful space between himself and them ah jadus said and grimaced as alberich had expected the herald was utterly transparent when it came to his feelings and what he was thinking and right now he realized just how wary even frightened all those young trainees might be of alberich i suppose hes right alberich i dont think you would fit in very well with the rest of the boys i think not alberich agreed quietly although he did not know this man dethorhe knew the species another warrior someone who would think as he thought as comfortable a valdemaran to share living space with as he was likely to find then have them fetch his things over as of now hes an internee with classes i know the rules as well as you but rules are made to be broken now and then just tell talamir what ive done sendar will decree it and therell be an end to argument this is better than i had hoped for kantor said sounding pleased dethor fought on the border you see we werent altogether certain what hed think of you why didnt you ask his companion alberich asked because dethor doesnt have much consistency in the way of mindspeech pahshen doesnt always know what hes thinking the bond is there and they do just fine but when dethor closes upwell hes unreadable and hes been completely unreadable where you are concerned ah that put a different complexion on things ill see to it jadus said and turned to look at the gaping children shouldnt you be practicing he asked pointedly they flushed and looked guilty especially the eldest and gathered up their equipment and went back to the archery field alberich followed dethor back into the building at the back wall was a door half hidden in the paneling the same door that kimel the man in the blue uniform had come through alberich followed dethor through that door as well into a long and narrow room with seating and a wall of windows that looked out on a rather unprepossessing stretch of meadow and bushes come in here and ill show you how to clean up the old man said waving him on apparently there was an entire suite of rooms here behind the salle through another door alberich found dethor waiting in a tiny room tiled floortoceiling in white ceramic holding a lit fireplace squib take this reach up and light that the old man said pointing to a metal container that looked very like a candle with an enormously fat wick pipes led up through the ceiling and also from the bottom of the drum across to a perforated disk suspended from the middle of the ceiling then turn that spigot and youll get a warm rain shower out of that plate theres a box of soap there and ill bring you a towel by the time youre clean jadus will have brought your things here and ill have a new uniform for you then we can talk then we can talk words both ominous and positive this man had fought against karse on the borderbut he had just brought alberich into his personal quarters and he was going to talk we are both warriors he reminded himself we speak a common language that has nothing to do with valdemaran syntax and karsite verbs alberich stripped off his sweatsodden uniform and turned the spigot on the wall and just as dethor had said a rain of warm water came down from the perforated plate draining away through a grate in the floor this was an infinitely faster way of getting clean than a bath not as luxurious but much more efficient there was a second door into this chamber but for now alberich figured he could wait to discover what lay behind it dethor was as good as his word by the time alberich cautiously opened the door to the little room there was a folded uniform and a towel in a pile beside it he snuffed the contrivance that heated the water then lost no time in toweling himself off and getting into a brand new uniform for the second time that day it felt good to be clean to have all his muscles achingjust a littlefrom the exertion for the first time since hed come here he felt entirely like himself he joined his new mentor in the sitting area hair still damp take a seat the old man said alberich gingerly chose a chair facing his new mentor now before we start out i want everything straight between us said dethor forthrightly i dont particularly like karsites he sucked in his lower lip mind its the ones in charge ive got a bone to pick with your sunpriests just the karsite ones mind weve got a little sect of your lot on this side of the border and ive no quarrel with them alberich nodded cautiously now youre a soldier reckon that mostly what you did was take orders question ive got for you isjust how much did you think about them orders when you got em dethor gave him a sharp look much alberich replied immediately without even thinking about it very long look youmy dutyto what it was my god and my people he decided that he would leave his duty to vkandis between himself and the god my people to protect not to the fires to feed them not to bandits to leave them and if them priests had told you to attack us youd have done it dethor persisted alberich could only shrug then you demonriders lovers of demons with witchpowers and witchways yes a threat i saw you hmph honest at least now dethor asked nowthere i am not here i am he shrugged what was the point in asking such a question already he was an entirely different person from captain alberich of the sunsguard tomorrow he might be a different person from today dethor sighed with some exaggeration all im asking is are you going to knife me in my sleep because i killed a bakers dozen of your folk and a couple of your priests a while back alberich gave dethor the same answer he had given alberich you a soldier are and your duty to your king and your people this i understand and if he asked me about questioning orders i would suspect he thought about his before he obeyed them farmers killed you he persisted craftsmen he hunted for the word kantor helped civilians civilians never dethor replied with such matteroffactness that alberich couldnt doubt him unless you count the priests alberich dismissed the sunpriests out of hand then no quarrel have i with you reckon youre ready to help me beat some skill into a pack of puppies that never saw blood dethor asked the wrinkles around his eyes relaxing and a hint of ease creeping into his voice some of whom may grow up to slay more karsites a question he asked and picked his words with care the answer on your honor swear do you of valdemardo you make war and unleash demons my people upon no dethor said with such force that alberich started back in his chair his hand reaching automatically for a knife that wasnt there no the weaponsmaster repeated without the heat i swear to you on my honor on my gods on my life we do nothing of the sort well defend ourselvesand theres bandits along the border that prey on both sides of it as i assume you know well enoughbut never once in my time have we even pursued an invading army past the border once we reached it you already know that what you call white demons are nothing but our companions if there are demons preying on your people by night and a knowing glance told alberich that this man knew that there were then i say look to your own priests we dont have anything or anyone that calls up the likes of demons and even if we did wed not set them on ordinary folk who just have the misfortune to live in the wrong place dethors suggestion that alberich look to the sunpriests for those who let demons prowl the night was not unexpectedand it was true this was a thought that had already passed through alberichs mind more than once he nodded and he thought of those freshfaced youngsters at the archery field how unless someone taught them all of the thousands of ways in which they could die and how to counter their opponents and save themselvesthen they would die for no more crime than serving their people as he had this man would not have taken him a foreigner to apprentice as his replacement if hed had any other choice he could turn dethor down and have all those needless deaths on his own conscience or he could accept the position and accept that he was going to stay you are needed here kantor said simply perhaps only a handful of people even among the heralds know thisbut you are needed here whatever else comes whether your god had a hand in bringing you here whether or not he has further plans for you here there is that no one else can do what you can dethor has looked a long long time for his replacement and you are his last best choice thenyes he replied answering both dethor and kantor yes learn i will and teach then heres my hand on it dethor held out his swordcallused palm and alberich clasped it a powerful and strong hand that one had been it was strong still under the swollen joints and past the pain now let me show you your quarters dethor got up out of his chair alberich forbore to offer him a hand there would be a time for that later right now dethor could manage and as long as he could manage alone he would want to alberich rose and followed in the old mans footsteps the quarters behind the salle turned out to be a series of interconnected rooms with no space wasted on halls this was a sitting room primarily the sun came in here on winter afternoons which probably made it a good place for dethor to sit and bask his bones at the rear it led into the showering room which had a cistern on the roof that fed both it and a privy on the other side of the roomwhich was where that second door led on the other side of that was dethors bedroom then a second room which looked mostly unused but which did have a bed and a wooden chest in it then storage grooms and an office which led in turn back into the salle if one followed a path around it would be in the shape of a u with the two points of the letter representing the two doors into the salle a pile of clothing and gear lay on the bed in the second room which alberich assumed was going to be his jadus worked quickly it seemed the arrangement suited him actually and comforted him there would be no one sleeping between him and a direct line out of here oh there were windows to climb out of but that was awkward and had the potential to be very noisy this has always been laid out with the idea that the weaponsmaster shares quarters with his second dethor told him then grinned evilly the seconds closer to the salle so if theres a crisis in the middle of the night the second the one who answers is alberich said with mock resignation master exactly just got one question for you i have em bring my meals over from the collegiumtheres a fireplace in the sitting room where things can be kept hot wastes my time to be hauling myself over there and back three times a day but youyou might be wanting to be around people more its too painful for him to be dragging himself back and forth alberich found it very easy to read between those lines buthes lonely no i wont desert him not even for meals if you my master and teacher will be herethen going there of what use is he asked logically a waste of my time asking questions having advice i could be besides soldiers are we understand each other we do was it his imagination or did dethor actually soften a bit youll find that boy kimel is another of our sort he said head of his majestys personal guard that boy and hard on himself always after someone to make him better and keener but he just hasnt whats needed to be weaponsmaster trained him myself though then on himself he would hard be alberich knew that much for certain like master like man at home we say we say the same thing here dethor replied and it seemed with some content not so different after all in some things at least no alberich agreed right i have a gaggle of youngsters coming in a moment you get this room arranged to your liking then come out and give me a hand with em no time like the present to start once again dethor was all brisk business and as he limped out alberich made haste to follow his orders he made up the bed with the linens and blankets he found in the chest and put his things away not that he had a great deal to put awaythose uniforms light ones for summer heavier materials for winter a cloaksome toiletries which he was pleased enough to see he took the opportunity to give his shortcut hair a good combing thinking as he did so that he probably ought to let it grow out now longer hair seemed to be the fashion in valdemar and there was no use in looking more conspicuous than he already did youve decided to stay kantor exuded satisfaction yes he knew he had made up his mind that the socalled trial was over probably the instant that he realized dethor wanted him to train as a replacement weaponsmaster maybe that was all it had really taken the knowledge that they werent going to make work for him and fit him in somehow but that there already was a place here that was crying out for someone like him yes he repeated it seems im needed which was by no means a bad thing not at all jadus returned about noon as alberich and dethor were picking up the discarded bits of armor and practice weapons in the salle and putting things away with jadus was a young man in yet another sort of uniformthis time including a tabard with the valdemar winged horse on it belted on over his clothing a servant it seemed so since the fellow was carrying a set of stacked metal containers that fitted neatly into a common wovenstraw cover jadus and dethor led the young man through the door into the living quarters while alberich put the last few bits in a cupboard and followed them the young man opened up the straw cover and took out the metal containers one by one and opened them in turn to disclose the components of their meal kept hot clever that alberich admired the arrangement certainly the collegium was seeing to it that dethor didnt suffer for taking his meals away from the rest by alberichs standards of camp cookery it was a sumptuous meal all of it was laid out in the sitting room with cutlery and plates that dethor produced out of a cupboard that alberich hadnt noticed until dethor opened it the servant departed but jadus did not evidently he intended to share their meal there were four different dishes plus bread and butter alberich took an equal portion of each something like a stew some sliced vegetable beans and what appeared to be baked apples the flavors were goodwhen in the hands of the healers hed first noticed that the food was goodbut not quite familiar the spices were all different flavors he was used to were missing new ones added and these people didnt seem to use as much spice as karsites did it was good butnot exactly right even the bread was lighter in taste texture and color than karsite bread and not as chewy as much as the language the food brought it home to him that he was on alien soil your classes wont start for another three days alberich jadus said when the edge had been taken off alberichs hunger dethor up at the collegium weve decided that you should establish a schedule with alberich first and well work his classes in around that the herald sighed gustily at the moment there are so many classes he will need to take it wont be a problem to work a schedule of three in around whatever you set him up for dethor nodded and refilled all their cups alberich was mildly surprised to find that they were drinking not beer or common wine but some rather tasty herb tisane tisanewell that just wasnt what a soldier generally drank not that alberich had any objections to the beverage after all most of the beer hed gotten over the years was indifferent at best and vile at worst and all of the wine had been harsh and rough stilltisane it conjured up images in his mind of little old ladies puttering at sewing and gossiping perhaps it was meant to serve as a good example to all those children populating the place if sowell if he was allowed to leave this place he suspected he would be finding a tavern fairly soon perhaps if he asked someone would find him a little cask of some good strong ale at any rate you wont be seeing nearly as much of me alberich jadus continued youve got another guide coming a fellow called elcarth a bit of a scholar you see we reckoned hed be the best one to help you over some of the classes im hopeless at im to bring him around to meet you in the morning which really means what he asked kantor what isnt he telling me that you arent everyones favorite trainee kantor replied promptly elcarth is in line to become the deanthats the headof the collegium within the next ten years or so he doesnt look like much but hes as sharp as a poniard and nothing gets past him if he approves of you no one is going to openly contest your being here kantor paused and alberich felt him ruminating our kings and queens you see dont rule so much as reign and not at all autocratically king sendar will probably have trouble over you with his council for some time to come but elcarthwell elcarth comes from one of the most powerful families in the land and he has a reputation for sharpness as i told you the dean has a traditional place on the council but elcarth is the one whos actually taking the seat for the dean in absentia that gives us a majority if we need it alberich kept his face straight and showed no sign that kantor had imparted this amazing information to him but he had a very hard time doing so the priests of vkandis had things so completely under their hands and wills that he couldnt imagine a ruler who didnt rule completely oh of course there was a king in karse too but he was no more than an impotent figure who didnt rule so much as preside over a gaggle of wealthy aristocrats and wouldbe aristocrats with nothing better to do with their time than vie for position in a donothing court that was little better than an elaborate social club it was the son of the sun who held the real reins of power and behind him so far as alberich knew ranged the solid phalanx of the sunpriests who fulfilled the son of the suns orders with nary a murmur of discontent then again what do i know of what goes on behind the closed doors of the temple it might be the same there really the most astonishing thing might not be so much that there was contention in the kings court but that ordinary people seemed to know about it that would be unheard of in karse so much had happened to him in a few short marks this morning he had been quite willing to walk out of here forever now he wasnt merely a trainee he had a real position here it felt a bit dreamlike as if days had passed in the course of the morning he had gone straight into the life of this place without a pause for breath that wasnt like him it made no sense there was only one way to account for it that blasted kantor me his his companion replied oozing innocence dont go laying your socalled conversion at my doorstep i gave you every opportunity to escape i even had talamir tell you the great secretthat you could have shaken our bonding loose if you really decided you couldnt bear this life how many people have been told that in the course of our history how should i know alberich asked rhetorically i was about to tell you no more than a dozen thats what youre here now because you laid a trap for me you and your precious heralds and baited it with the one thing id find irresistible then that leaves him free this afternoon dethor asked gesturing with a slice of buttered bread good well start you in as my assistant right now alberich get the youngsters used to seeing you as my assistant first before they start hearing rumors about the evil karsite trainee alberich nodded well what else was he to do he knew it was going to happenthe evil karsite trainee business how could it not if the situations were reversed not that they could be the first sight of a white uniform and the wearer of that uniform would find himself the object of target practice thoughtfully he bit off a hangnail the difference i see not he offered the weaponsmaster if good he be always hated is dethor smiled wickedly better to have em hating you as the tyrannical weapons second the brutal taskmaster that way therell be no room in those rattling little skulls for the evil karsite trainee he finished his bread in a way that suggested the devouring of small children alberich smiled just a little the weaponsmaster was absolutely right of course childrenand to be fair a great many adultswere apt to label people and stick with the first label theyd come up with a brutal taskmaster i surely will be as ever he replied with a touch of grim humor my recruits ask dethor rubbed his hands together ill keep the small ones but youah you i intend to unleash on the older ones ive been easy on emtoo damned easy tell the truth i cant bout em anymore and theres never anyone here consistently that can give em proper workouts andoh gloryyouve fought real fights none of this court fencing oh no thats the trouble with the teachers the highborn have they learn to duel to do fancy court fighting but not how to fight plenty of heralds do of course most of em trained by me but theyre needed out there and cant be spared he shook his head reluctantly and truth to tell it takes more than knowing how to fight to make a weaponsmaster kantor put in a few words of his own the older ones the best fighters among them anyway have been getting above themselves lately we have a flock of them that are one maybe two years from getting their whites that were almost all out of the highborn noble families before they were chosen they got private swordsmanship lessons and those continued even after they think theyre masters of the sword now because theyre so much better than the rest of the trainees dethor cant give them the sort of workout they need to show them that they arent alberich knew exactly what kantor meant and was beginning to warm to his new task and as for dethor well it was clear that he was doing more than merely warm to the task he bordered on gleeful alberich caught some of his spirit it wasnt malicious but there was a certain edge that suggested that there were a couple of these adolescent heraldsintraining who were due for a comeuppance thought themselves immortal and invincible and it would have to get pounded into their skulls that they werent the usual adolescent hubris of course over and over they came into the sunsguard sure of their skill and thinking only of glory and fame time after time if they didnt learn that war against bandits was dirty perilous and inglorious they got their fame by having their names inscribed on the tablets of the fallen in the great temple at least none of these youngsters would be looking to make a name for himself by taking their officer out in a practice boutor worse worse was an ambitious and unscrupulous recruit who was hoping to advance himself by removing the obstacle that alberich represented or to do the same at the behest of one of alberichs underofficers that sort i have seen he said shortly and left it at that but he did get a bit of a shock when they finished their meala relatively light one appropriate for two men who would be doing very physical work shortlyand he followed dethor out into the salle again of the six adolescents choosing practice weapons or limbering up two were female girls true one of the heralds that had first found him had been a womanhe vaguely recalled that nowbut it hadnt really occurred to him intellectually even though kantor had reminded him of that fact that he would be teaching girls females just didnt put themselves forward not in karse anyway females had very clearly defined roles in karse which did not include being fighters dont hold back with them kantor said instantly you wont be doing them any favors and when he still hesitated kantor added sharply there are barbarians in the north pirates and slavers in the west and bandits in the south and they will probably face all three before theyre middleaged if they live that long it will be one woman and one companion out there alone and you have to prepare them for that yes i do see that it made him feel a little sick but kantor was right they were trainees they would be heralds and he would do them no favors at all by going easy with them in fact he might well kill them or worse there was always the probability of an or worse it was a simple fact that the probability was higher for a female or both kantor added grimly they cant be as strong as the boys youll have to give them skill to make up for that if anything the girls will need your skills more than the boys well trainees i have a little surprise for you dethor said cheerfully he gestured at alberich who lingered near the door this is my new secondand from now on hell be putting you through your paces while i watch alberich had no difficulty in keeping his face expressionless this was no different than facing a line of new recruits even the ages werent that dissimilar he guessed these youngsters to be between sixteen and eighteen years of age hed had recruits that young although since hed been in the mounted troops theyd all come from some background where theyd been riding since they could walk and mostly the cavalry came from recruits rather than conscripts he supposed trainees probably fell under the same banner as recruits surely he was the only trainee who had ever felt as if hed been conscripted against his will not exactly the only one but very nearly kantor said in their turn they eyed him without any shame mostly with curiosity although two of the boys had challenge in their eyes well theyd soon see what he was made of they were the two oldest he guessed definitely the two tallest one very dark muscular and blocky the other half a head taller with brown hair and knowing eyes of the other four the girls were a pretty creature blueeyed with a smooth cap of brown hair cut no longer than her earlobes and a smaller lighter girl with blue eyes a generous mouth and blond hair done in a knot on the top of her head the boys were both brownhaired one of medium height and one short both with grave faces but it was the first two that held alberichs attention just as you thought those are two of your problem children mind all you need to do is disillusion them theyve got good hearts theyre just well arrogant in some ways because theyre ignorant and dont know it he supplied exactly i can tell you that they are currently the despair of their companions nothing trevor and mik can say shakes them out of their conviction that they are never going to find themselves in trouble that they cant come out of covered in glory at least he wouldnt have the problem with these boys that he often had with recruitsbad attitude bad breeding either spoiled by indulgent parents and thinking that everything should be given to them or beaten as youngsters figuring it was every man for himself too many of the sunsguard troops were like that hardened with no morals to speak of why choseni believe you are beginning to like your decision to stay with us kantor said with gentle mockery alberich ignored him i alberich am he said gravely and waited for dethor to give him his direction dethor after all was the weaponsmaster here it was dethor who should set the lessons and alberich who should carry them out he didnt notice any reaction to his name which was nothing like a valdemaran name or at least so he supposed it is the new weapons second i am he continued meeting their eyes each in turn chosen by master dethor himself who now direct us will dethor quickly divided the group into pairs and set them working with each other interestingly he paired the girls not with each other but with two of the brownhaired boys the last twothe boys alberich had marked as being a possible source of troubledethor motioned to join alberich sword and shield and make them work alberich he said shortly these lads are ahead of the rest by a bit treat them as trained because they are they can go twoonone against you the boys exchanged a look the darker more muscular one with a touch of smug glee the other the one who was taller less blocky and brownhaired with a look of dawning misgiving which was replaced by anticipation when he saw the expression on his friends face his friend was wildly optimistic about their chances and he had come to trust his friends judgment alberich knew that look of old overconfidence poor young fools because they were large dogs in a pack of small dogs and had never been shown any better they thought that they were the kings of the world and immortal an attitude like that would get them killed unless dethor and i can knock some better sense into their heads sir alberich acknowledged and picked up a practice sword and shield from the piles at the side of the salle while the boys did the same they looked cocky alberich figured that they must have had sword training from the time they were barely old enough to hold a practice sword and shield five or six maybe from families of wealth or the nobility he figured these were part of that flock of youngsters that kantor had described they had that particular healthy confident wellfed look that only being wellnourished from infancy imparted maybe only someone who as a child had never been certain whether there would be a next meal would have noticed the difference but alberich had learned early which were the wellfed children and thus dangerous for they could bully him with impunity and which the starvelings like himself which he could defend himself against without fear of retribution standard orspecial sir he asked dethor when the boys had finished arming themselves he had not bothered with padding arm or shinguards or even a helmet they had prudently taken advantage of all of these at least that showed some sense of selfpreservation they were shortly going to be very glad of every bit of that protection oh special second dethor replied airilyand he must have known or guessed just what alberich meant by special tammas and jahan have had plenty of standard training i believe its time they learned what real field fighting is like sir alberich replied and without a pause whirled and laid into the nearest he didnt go at them as if this was a pitched battle because hed have taken them both out in moments theyd been expecting the usual polite exchange of salutes followed by a measured opening to the boutnot an attack right out of nowhere with no warning and that had been enough of a shock for them he didnt need to go after them fullout and the way they reacted was telling they both stood their ground but neither close enough to defend each other nor far enough apart to make him work harder to reach both of them they might think they were trained but they werent not really so alberich knocked the first ones shield aside with a brutal blow that nearly knocked it from his arm without regard for lines and the rules of swordplay he followed it up by ramming the boy with his own shield the lad stumbled backward and before his friend could come to the rescue alberich sidestepped made a wide low sweep with the flat of his practice blade and knocked his legs right out from under him it was a good thing the boy was wearing shinguardsthough he couldnt have been expecting the low blow or hed have guarded against it he turned back toward the first as the second scrambled to his feet once again alberich rushed the boy this time herding him toward his friend with a flurry of blows predictably they got tangled up with each other and he backed off to let them sort themselves out though the next time he did this he wouldnt give them the respite then he simply chased them around the salle for a full circuit of the place using all the dirty tactics he knew and hitting them just hard enough that they would have bruises to show for it even under the padding and protection he made their ears ring a time or two as well with unexpected blows to the helm neither of them of course got so much as a love tap on him he hadnt bothered with a helm because he wanted to be able to see them easily he trusted to his reflexes to keep him out of trouble oddly enough he would have worn the helm and padding had they been utterly untrained for there would be no predicting what they would do part of their problem now was that they were rather too welltrained if they were going to come up against lads whod been trained by fighting and killing instead of by selfstyled masters of the sword or fellows with equally fancy titles they were going to have to unlearn some of what was now ingrained good habitsif all you were doing was fighting other gentlemen but very bad if you were going out to kill brigands by this time he was just feeling warmed up and beginning to enjoy himself not a chance that they could even get a tap on him not only because he was a far better fighter but because they were so shocked by his tactics that they couldnt think they were shocked the patterns they knew were all disrupted and they hadnt yet seen that what appeared to be random attacks had patterns of their own more primitive and brutal but the patterns were there not that fightingin the frontline basic dirty fightinghad much to do with thinking it was all muscle memory at that point because before a mark was up youd be so tired that it had better be your muscles that remembered what to doyour mind would be numb with fatigue and no longer working properly but what alberich was doing was what any good bandit fighter would do twoagainstone he certainly wouldnt stand in one place and slug it out nor would he move forward and back in a single straight line the other trainees stopped their practice and watched him chase his two victims around the perimeter of the salle they watched with their mouths hanging open in amazement and no little shock and surprise dethor didnt make them go back to trading blows so alberich concluded that this and not what theyd been assigned to do was the real lesson today good let them think about it not nowthey were as shocked as his two victimsbut they would remember and talk about this in their rooms together later if they were smart enough they would learn from what they watched now and the next pair he chased around the salle would be better prepared for what he was going to do to them he drove the boys back for a good while which probably felt like an eternity to them taking on first one then the other they fought as two separate individuals rather than a pair another mistake for he could hack at one long enough for the other to take heart and try something then move on the second boy before hed rightly got his move started and oh they were not anticipating the shrewd blows to shins the absolutely rude blows to the groin the latter he pulled and pulled hard he didnt want to lay them out he just wanted them to know what he could do if he wished and what a bandit would do when they came up against him and if hed wanted to lay them outhelmets or no hed have had them measuring their length on the floor first thing the ringing blows he landed on their helms he hoped would tell them that he used the flat of his blade on the helmets rather than the edge but one day when they were better prepared to counter him hed use the proper weapon against a heavily armored man the mace against them hed known men to die of mace blows to the helm with blood pouring from their noses and ears then he feigned getting tired though he was barely warmed upwhich since they were feeling the strain themselves they fell for they pushed him for a few paces right into the position he wanted them whereupon he turned the tables on them and dashed right between the two of them catching both of them with blows in the back as he passed then he ran them around the salle in the opposite direction they had probably thought they were fit and by most standards they were they were no match for a man who had spent the last seven years fighting and riding and living hard and years before that in an infinitely harder school than this one never mind the past sennights hed been flat on his back with the healers hed been in top condition before that and since hed been allowed up hed been regaining what hed lost besides these two were nothing like a challenge he took pity on them when he caught the telltale signs of true exhaustionthe stumbling the uncertain aim the trembling hands he backed offand they didnt follow they just stood there like a pair of horses that had been run off their feet and just couldnt go another step their weapons hung from hands that were probably numb and their heads drooped in a moment if he let them theyd collapse on the floor where they stood enough said dethor with immense satisfaction in his voice the moment before alberich would have said the same now this my lads is what ive been too creaky and gouty and damned old to do to you youve just faced a real fighting man in his full fit trim and whats more before luncheon he was giving one of the guard a similar workout this is what youll be fighting when it comes to it my children he continued raising his voice so that it carried to the rest of the salle this is what youd better be ready to face when youre given your whites and this is why alberich is now my second and it will be his job to see to it that you can stand against him before you go out in the field any questions silence broken only by the panting of the two boys that alberich had just finished with right then you two dethor gestured at the young men off with the armor and walk laps around the salle until youre cool then you can go back to the collegium and clean up not before you walk out of my door sore but if you walk out stiff it wont be my fault a groan issued forth from one of the helmets but both youngsters did as they were told alberich almost felt sorry for them hard luck on them to be used as examples but they must have warranted the treatment or dethor wouldnt have set them up to be knocked down a peg the way he had alberich recalled the expressions that they had worn when the exercise began and stopped feeling sorry for them now alberichdo you note my children that he isnt even sweating heavilytake young theela here and show her what shes doing wrong young theela the girl with the short hair looked as if she would much rather have died than have alberich show her anything at all but her problem of telegraphing certain overhand blows was quickly sorted and alberich went on to the next problem at dethors direction and while alberich was dealing out lessons to each youngster in turn dethor was keeping an eye on the first two recipients of alberichs attention making them stop and do stretches at intervals to keep from stiffening up as the lesson wore on alberich paid attention to what dethor did and said and when whether or not it was addressed to alberich himself dethor was brilliant really despite that alberich was doing the handson work of instructing the trainees he was in control of the salle and the trainees there was never any doubt of that alberich was merely an extension of his will precisely as a good second should be but alberich had to admire the man for he manipulated the youngsters and the situation flawlessly invisible they never even guessed they were being manipulated by the time the weaponsmaster was ready to let them go it was time for all of them to return to the collegium so if the two young men had thought they were going to get off early and sneak off to some sport or other they were sadly disappointed a great bell rang somewhere outside which was evidently the signal for the next class this lot was off like a flight of arrows from bows even as the first tone still shivered the air alberich looked sideways at dethor who chuckled now why do i think that my new second is going to be the least popular instructor in the collegium the weaponsmaster asked the empty air barring me of course the weaponsmaster popularity cannot afford alberich said dryly as he began picking up discarded weapons and returning them to their places true my friend very true and what did you think of the two young colts who think theyre stallions dethor asked that was easy to answer all spirit no sense he replied shortly ah but can you drive some sense into them thats what i want to know dethor waited for his answer head to one side and interest in his eyes alberich snorted not i bruises pain teaches what i cannot and dethor laughed but yes learn they will he continued stupid they are not nor stubborn illtaught or mistaught but unlearn they can the next class was one in archery for younger children and dethor took this one himself although he commended one young lad to alberich for some special attentions precisely because the youngster was a natural marksman alberich soon had him shooting from several different positions and helped him find ways of getting a full draw even when shooting from a prone partly hidden posture following that class was another like the first weaponswork in the salle with slightly younger trainees this time there was a change in the uniforms however among the heraldtrainee grays was a boy in pale blue a boy in a sort of brickcolor and a girl in healertrainee pale green the boy in orange was quick but not very strong the girl slow but patient and deliberate neither were very good but eventually their determination would enable them to hit what they aimed at though for now as many arrows flew over the targets or buried themselves in the grass in front of it as actually hit at least they were both trying to the best of their ability which was more than could be said for the third child that was not in trainee gray the boy in blue looked bored and not at all interested in trying he played at the archery shooting haphazardly not really aiming alberich waited for dethor to say something or assign more special attention to that boy but dethor never did and alberich concluded that there must be something special about the blue uniform there is kantor said into his mind startling him for the companion had been silent for most of the day hes not a trainee at all the students in light blue are the children of some of the nobles in attendance on the king their parents dont see any reason to hire tutors when the collegium is here and perfectly capable of educating their children but the blues dont have any real consequences to not learning if their parents dont care about their progress so the pause invited him to draw his own conclusions ah that certainly explained things are there consequences for beating their backsides with the flat of a practice blade alas yes kantor said political consequences i fear now the ones in that orangered sort of shade are bardictrainees they arent required to learn weaponswork but they are encouraged to do so bards are often out in the wilds and in dangerous placesand while most of them can talk or entertain themselves out of trouble its a good idea to be able to fight your way out as well but when you work with them be very very careful of their hands the last thing you want to do is injure the hands of a bard it would be a catastrophe for them you could set their musical training back a fortnight or more depending on how badly the hand was hurt he made a mental note of it interesting he knew what bards were of course but he had never seen one much less heard one something more to look into he ignored the boy in blue but once it was clear that alberich wasnt going to single him out for attention the boy watched him with a kind of speculation in his eyes alberich wondered if rumor had already begun to spread that the dreaded karsite trainee was one and the same with dethors new weapons second it has kantor confirmed although i dont know that he would have heard it yet the youngsters from your first class are beginning to put two and two together i suspect that it will be one of the main topics of conversation over dinner certainly by nightfall the whole collegium will know unfortunately it wouldnt stay there and once it got out into the court the nobles and the rest who hung about here well things were likely to get very interesting things are interesting now kantor said if alberich had been a stag hed have thrown up his head and sniffed the breeze at that trying to find the scent of trouble the statement boded no good no matter what language it was spoken in just what does that mean he thought probingly at kantor ill tell you later kantor promised but that was all that the companion would say and eventually alberich gave up trying to extract something from him easier to pound sense into a foolish trainee so alberich set about doing just that but it was going to be a long afternoon the sunset outside the sittingroom window made a fine backdrop for the meal that another servant had brought them there were not too many different ways that one could roast a pig nor stew apples in honey and beans were beans no matter what you did to them so at least this dinner had not left alberich with that particularly odd feeling of dislocation when flavors he expected werent there a remarkable first day dethor said with more than a hint of satisfaction hand me those plates would you alberich handed over the stack of soiled plates and dethor packed them neatly in a straw container like the one that their dinner had come in the servant that had appeared just after darkness fell waited patiently to take it away the clean plates it contained evidently meant for tomorrow so that was where they came from were already stowed in dethors sittingroom cupboard alberich could only shrug and i would know this how he asked logically dethor laughed a sight which would no doubt have astonished his pupils weaponsmasters of course never laughed they also according to popular repute never ate never slept and were possessed of the ability to know instantly whenever one of their pupils had done something he shouldnt because he was always punished for it with an extrahard lesson the next day it obviously never occurred to boys that their guilty expressions always gave them away dont get coy with me my lad dethor replied you know very well how remarkable it was alberich gave the servant a sidelong glance the man took the hint picked up the carrier and took himself off dethor sat down beside the fireplace and motioned to alberich to take his own seat ii feelunsettled alberich said at last i am treated as if i belongyet i do not i should not so how comes it that it is as if i do and how comes it that it feels to me as if i should i wish i could tell you lad dethor sighed and stared out the window at the darkening trees if i could well i suspect wed not be at odds with your land youre not the first karsite to come over the border as you knowthough i suspect you didnt until you found it out here youre not even the first karsite to be chosen though all of the rest were tiny children when they escaped and were basically valdemaran when they became trainees but you are the first adult karsite ever chosen and i have to think that its something in you that makes you different from your fellows well that answered one questionwhy vkandis if indeed his hand was behind all of this hadnt arranged for one or another of the former karsite children to be chosen clearly he had and clearly whatever he wanted from such an arrangement hadnt happened alberich stared at the fire in the fireplace but it is to karseto the sunlordthat i belong he said softly he knew that it was at the core of him nothing about that part of him had changed if that part had changed he would no longer be himself your god is no issue to us we respect a man who keeps to his own gods and it makes no difference to the heralds who another herald gives his soul to but are you vowed to karse dethor asked shrewdly or to your people thats two very different things my lad a countrywellthat can be a lot of things to different people some would say its the land itself but land can change hands some say its the leaders but leaders die or the religionbut ill tell you something youll never have heard in karseand thats this religions change ive seen it happen and ill bet my boots that if you ask your priestly friends down in the city theyll tell you that yours has changed from what it was that was such an astonishing statement that alberich could only stare at him change how could a religion change didnt truth come directly from god dethor poked at a log sticking out on the hearth with his toe dont look at me that way ask your priests and see if im not right he said calmly ah this is daft im only giving you too much to think about look alberich i know this isnt easy for you and there isnt much i can do about that youll have to reckon out whats important to you and stick to that do that and youll have one thing you can hang onto no matter how unsettled you feel thatll give you a bit of firm ground to hold to as it were and once youve got that you can take the time to figure out more he raised an eyebrow have you one thing right this minute thats worth everything to you honor alberich said promptly without thinking without having to think which meant he realized even as the word left his lips that the choice was right then you stick to that and youll be all right and eventually youll find your feet under you again dethor told him and yawned me im off for bed i may not have chased lads around the salle today but its been a long one for me anyway he laughed again good thing i dont get fighting karsites turn up to become my seconds every day alberich immediately got up but dethor waved at him to seat himself again now that doesnt mean you need to maybe you wear grays but youre no trainee you set your own hours only so i alert and awake will be when first arrives the class alberich replied dryly dethor chuckled under his breath got stiffly out of his chair and shuffled off into the shadows alberich sagged back into his own chair but in the next moment he was on his feet staring broodingly into the fire he wasnt tired not even physicallythat single workout with the young guardsman had been good but he was used to that sort of exercise all day long when he wasnt drilling or actually fighting he was riding in all weathers without the luxury of hot meals and showering baths he was used to going perpetually short of sleep riding before dawn and not finding his bedroll until after hed stood first watch when he got a bath it was usually out of a stream or a rain barrel when he got a meal it was field rations augmented by whatever someone had managed to shoot or buy from a farmer no he wasnt tired not physically and certainly not mentally he hadnt heard anything in the back of his head from kantor for a while not since that class of children at archery practice on the whole that suited him kantor was very facile very persuasive and he didnt want any interference with his own thoughts right now he wanted to work through them on his own he turned away from the fire clasped his hands behind his back and began to pace up and down the long sitting room he didnt trouble to light any of the lamps he was used to firelight and his night vision was very good a suite of roomseven a bedi havent slept in a bed for so long that its going to feel strange the last time hed been in a bedthe one at the house of healing didnt counthad been just over a year ago and he hadnt had possession of it for more than a single watch before hed been turned out by the man he was relieving it hadnt been much of a bed just a sack filled with straw in a box on four legs but it had been better than sleeping in the mud that had passed for ground around there beds hot meals willing pupils to teach pupils who with rare exceptions were singularly devoid of attitude oh this place these peoplethey were so very seductive if he could have said this is what is wrong with my life and this and i would change this and this is what i want above all else and then have all of that come to pass in a single stroke this is what he would have picked as the way to spend the rest of his life the only trouble was he wasnt where he should have been and he was irrevocably bonded to a white demon he wasnt in karse these people were not his people their gods were not his god all right it wasnt a white demon it was a companion but kantor was still keeping out of his sight because he still got a reflexive chill whenever he saw the creature unexpectedly and yet and yet if kantor wasnt the best friend he had never had before he was certainly the next thing to it uncanny that wasthe way they fit together it was not unnerving but that was only because kantors personality seemed to fit into his without a single rough edge strange yet completely familiar and the longer that this day had gone the less possible it seemed that he could ever properly live without the companions presence in the back of his mind he paused staring blindly out the window full dark it was out there and as a consequence what he saw was himself outlined by the fire reflected in the glass outlined in firewell that was appropriate in a sense he had gone from one fire into another as for the life hed been offeredwell it was all there virtually everything he could have asked for even the fact that he was not being asked to fight anymore at least not for the moment though that could change and he was too wise in the ways of conflict not to know that he hated fighting oh not the physical exercise that he loved he loved the feel of a solid hit the surety of a stroke the way that his body knew what to do without his head having to tell it perhaps it would be better to say that he hated killing despised hurting people even when he was ridding the world of bastards that pillaged and raped helpless villagers left without even the means to defend themselves he hated it intellectually speaking there had to be a better way of dealing with those mad twolegged dogs than killing them practically speaking there wasnt of course not really it was kill them or face the consequences of not killing them and know that they would go on doing what they had been at before you caught themknowing that even if you locked them up eventually theyd either get loose or kill themselves and probably others trying to escape then the deaths of people who absolutely did not deserve it were on your head so he had long ago resigned himself to that fact and concentrated on ridding the world of murderers as expediently dispassionately and humanely as possible but there was a part of him that had uncomfortable questions about that questions he had tried not to think about until this moment brigands were not the only creatures that preyed on his people yes indeed when tax and tithecollectors strip folk of all but the bare essentials leaving them sometimes not even that and what of the sunpriests and their fires hmm shouldnt you have thought about ridding the world of them too the fire popped and crackled as he passed it as if his thought of the sunpriests fires had somehow roused it he shuddered as the memory of flame licking over his own flesh interposed itself between then and now before this moment before he had crossed the border into this strange land he had shied away from that question he had told himself that priestly business was none of his concernwell except for the uneasy knowledge that they might one day come for him but in truth he had tried not to think about that at all tried to focus on his duty his men the job at hand and getting on with it was that cowardice he had to admit that it probably was and he was ashamed of it but what could he one single man have done more than he had been doing other than declare himself against the priests be denounced and sent to the fires himself and that was even if they hadnt learned what he was the powers he harbored anathema unclean if thine eye gaze upon the forbidden put it out with thine own hand lest ye be tempted that was the writ and rule and he had not obeyed it yet how could he have eliminated something over which hed had no control except by denouncing himself and if hed done thathed have done the enemys work for it taking a competent fighter a good officer out of the fighting had he put so much effort into being a perfect soldier in vkandis service so that he might somehow expiate the fact that he had those witchpowers which arent evil you know they arent evil and you knew it then no matter what the priests claimed you had no control over those dreams and visionsand what was more the things they showed you actually helped you to protect vkandis people so why would the sunpriests say they were evilunless there was something about those powers that they were afraid of was it that they feared one day you might see something about them that you shouldnt it was twenty paces from one end of the sitting room to the other and he measured it a hundred times with his restless walking he had prided himself to a certain extent on being brave he just hadnt been brave enough honor dethor asked me what i cherished above everything else and i said honor but what did i mean when i said that he fretted and gnawed at his own soul tearing into it obsessively digging deeper than he had ever done before he had never had so much time to think yes hed done a fair amount of contemplation while in the keeping of the healers but most of that had been spent in fighting the assumption that everyone else here had taken as a given that he should be pleased even thrilled with this whole business of being chosen hed been so concerned with resentment that he hadnt really put any time into thinking about his position kicking against the traces oh what an image that conjured up the warhorse pulling the cart and fighting every step of the way and such a cart as he was hitched to now the entire burden of accepting companion title of herald and all but it included something he had wanted for so very long yes i hitched myself to it i walked into the harness willingly because the harness was so handsome to become a weaponsmastersunlord if anyone had ever asked him what he would have chosen to be above all thingsto emulate the men he had most admired from the day he had stepped into the cadet corps those competent strong men who when he was a cadet had offered their own austere brand of distant affection to him who had counseled him and given guidance and an example to followwho had given him when he was forced to bid farewell to his mother enough to feed his hungry heart they must have taken the place of the father he had never known and he wanted to be like them had wanted it then and wanted it now others had called them heartless but he knew and he had always known that they were anything but heartless they held themselves apart not because they did not care but because they feared to care too much even for himthough that resolution had not been proof against his need and theirs there had been two of them two he would have done anything for men he would have rather died than disappoint berthold aged berthold whitehaired but still strong and vigorous able to hold his own with men half his agehe was the man who was weaponsmaster to the youngest boys the ones who barely knew which end of a blade to hold he was patient but unforgiving when it came to slackers he had seen how alberich was trying watched him though alberich hadnt known it at the time when alberich had slipped into the unoccupied salle for extra exercise and practice he had chanced upon one of those practices and from that moment on had made certain that alberich never had to practice alone a pat on the back or the head a few wellchosen words of praise or condolencethat was all the physical demonstration of affection he ever allowed himself but alberich would have gone through fire for such rewards and when alberich passed out of the junior class into the senior cadets so berthold had seen to it that his student aksel took up alberichs education where berthold had left off aksel a powerful little man as flexible as he was strong probably knew more about fighting styles and weapons than any twelve ordinary fighters in the sunsguard his first words to alberich were berthold thinks you have it in you if its there well bring it out together alberich had never known just what it was supposed to be but aksel offered instruction and approval in equal measure and alberich had drunk it in as thirsty ground drank rain they were the finest two men that alberich had ever known and they taught me what honor was which might be why when dethor had asked what he most valued it was honor he had seized on instantly he had learned from their example as much as from anything they actually said to him honor was never taking the easy way when it was also the wrong one never telling a falsehood unless the truth was painful and unnecessary or a lie was necessary to save others never manipulating the truth to serve only yourself protecting the weak and helpless standing fast even when fear made you weak keeping your word perhaps that was all part of the problem serving the sunpriests had turned him away from the path of honor how was it protecting the weak and helpless when he and his troops were turned aside from their duties on the border to shepherd a tithe collector and his treasure boxes from village to village how could he keep his word when those about him were making idle promises that he was expected to fulfill promises that again took him away from real duty to satisfy some idiotic whim or moment of vainglory how could he speak the truth when the truth would simply have gotten him thrown to the fires in the simpler world of the cadet corps no such compromises had ever entered into his personal equation they only came when he left that world perhaps that was why aksel and berthold hadnt left it themselves perhaps they had known in their heart of hearts that going out into the world would only begin a long train of broken vows vows like the ones he broke when he accepted his place here his position as the partner of a companion but a vow went both ways he had pledged himself to the service of karse and the god only later were vows required that he pledge to obey the word of any priest and hed had misgivings but it was too late to try and back out at that point at that same ceremony though there had been another set of vowsthe priest who administered the oaths to the new officers had pledged on behalf of all priests to regard the new officers as vkandis chosen to stand beside them if accused and succor them in need and he had quickly learned how little they honored those oaths the sunpriests broke their vows to me long before i ever broke mine to them did that mean the pact between him and them was also broken was it wrong of him to feel that their betrayal released him from his oath or was he just trying to rationalize his own sins he realized belatedly that all this pacing was probably keeping poor dethor awake a glance outside showed him that the moon was well up and there was plenty of moonlight silvering the grass outside more than enough for him to pace all he wanted to without tripping over something in the dark with a silent apology he let himself out through the salle pacing across the wooden floor by the light entering through the clerestory windows opening the outer door and stepping out into the waiting embrace of the night the chill air carried a hint of damp and a scent of grass from the distance came the sounds of voices too far off to be more than a murmur but the very cadences were strange to his ear and he felt an involuntary shiver of alarm he couldnt suppress oh these valdemarans not four marks into his first real day among themhe couldnt count the time spent with the healersand look what had happened they had told him the one thing he longed to hear and had not realized that he longed to hear itthat he was needed they offered for his inspection a gaggle of green children good children and told him that these young people would go out unprepared against the kind of animals he had fought againstunless he helped train them and howhowcould he not have responded to that to defend the weak and helplesshow much better could he do that by training others to do the same job how could he allow anyone to send the weak and helplesswell all right the halftrainedout to throw themselves down and be trampled on when he knew he could remedy the situation there was nothing dishonorable about taking that job there was nothing honorable in refusing it yes but these are not your people so where does your honor come into it or is there some reason why it doesnt further break your vows to train valdemarans but then came additional questions when he already knew from the evidence of his own experience how utterly wrong some of the things hed taken as truth were why should it when had that definition of honor ever demanded absolute adherence to the sunpriests of karse just because the sunpriests would have put any valdemaran they found to the fire and swordwell he knew how wrong the sunpriests could be he had found a sunpriest here an upright man who everything in him cried out to trust who had told him in no uncertain words that the valdemarans were good and true and that it was his duty to vkandis himself to ally himself with them so where did that leave his vows and his honor he did not realize how fast he had walked or how far until an angry snort brought his attention back to his surroundings he looked up and found he was in the middle of a meadow or clearing ringed with trees from where he stood he could see some lights a few through the trees to his right but otherwise he could just as well have been in the middle of a meadow in farming country the snort had come from a very large white fourlegged creature just under the trees in front of him it moved out into the moonlight and quickly resolved itself into a familiar shape a companion it wasnt kantor it wasnt stocky enough and besides it didnt feel like kantor there was in fact a disturbing absence of feeling about this companion as if there was a wall between him and it a moment later it was joined by a secondthen a third a fourth and a fifth they moved toward him slowly but deliberately and he hadnt spent most of his life around horses not to recognize the menace in their movement every muscle was tense they werent so much walking as stalking toward him their narrowed eyes glittering in the moonlight there was no mistaking their hostility and he was the object of it a chill ran down his back as he turned slowly preparing to go back the way he had comeonly to find his path to escape blocked by another pair of companions he turned back to see that the rest had spread themselves out and were encircling him in an alltoofamiliar pincer movement a moment later he was surrounded they were huge creatures and came armed with their own hooves their weightan ordinary horse in a panic could easily kill and trample a mana trained warhorse was as formidable an opponent as any warrior that rode him how much more dangerous would companions be who had minds and intelligence of their own his heart hammered with a surge of fear and his throat tightened your pardon i beg he said aloud cautiously as all the stories of white demons rose again in his mind no longer tales to frighten a child into obedience but very tangible intrude i did not intend his words had no effect none at all these creatures were so full of deadly malice that he could feel it where he stood he didnt know what they intended to do to him but their eyes glittered anger at him and he felt exactly as he had at the moment that the sunpriest denounced him like the sunpriest these creatures looked at him and condemned him like the sunpriest they fully intended to wipe him from the earth sunlord shield mesuddenly he heard the angry trumpet of a stallion and the thunder of hooves behind him and dropped instinctively to his knees knowing it would do no good but trying to make himself less of a target anyway the trumpet turned to a scream and as he winced away a new companion pounded out of the night hooves throwing up clods of sod as it pounded toward him but the new one charged through the enclosing circle and brutally smashed his full weight into the shoulder of the nearest companion threatening alberich knocking it half off of its feet whirling to lash at another with flailing hooves snaking his neck around to snap at the neck of a third the new companion skidded to a halt beside himand kantor stood with his chosen snorting defiantly pawing the torn earth in challenge instantly alberich rose to his feet taking his stance at kantors shoulder what did i do what do they think i did he asked as the other companions laid back their ears and tore the ground with their own hooves why are they so angry at me its nothing you did kantor replied shortly and rumbled warningly when another stepped forward a pace his own ears were so flat to his head it looked as if theyd been cropped its what you are karsite which they young fools that they are will not abide kantor whipped his head around baring his teeth at all of the others screaming defiance with voice and mind but you are my chosen and they will not touch you nor will they reach you except going through me but the others seemed just as angryand just as determined and there were seven of them to kantors one they snorted and added their trumpeting to kantors pawing up the sod savagely come then kantor shouted so that alberich winced at the strength of the voice in his mind following the mental shout with a challenging scream try and take me if you dare you impudent young puppies tryand see what fools you are kantor no he protested knowing that no matter how formidable his companion was he was still no match for the power of so many dont stop the single word rang in his head like a gong completely driving out everything else so powerful was it for a moment it was as if hed been punched in the gut unable even to breathe he was blinded and deafened and when he was able to think again he found himself on his knees as if the word had driven him there he wasnt the only one so affected kantor stood with head hanging and eyes glazed and the others were shaking their heads staggering about looking utterly dazed he had recovered first and so he was the one who saw the final companion come pacing into the meadow striding as a king would stride across a royal carpet spread for his pleasure thisthis newcomer was the very essence of companion his shining coat glowed pearly and silken in the moonlight his mane and tail fell like waterfalls of silver and his eyes held the wisdom of ages past and the knowledge of ages to comeand alberich knew in that moment when he looked into the stallions eyes that the knowledge held as much sorrow as joy the stallion swung his head about to stare at the othersall but kantor that iswith the kind of look that aksel and berthold would give pupils who had gone so far beyond merely disappointing their teachers that even the most irrepressible or arrogant of boys could not have gone unaffected what is this the newcomer askednodemanded in tones of disgust what do i find here companionsthreatening someone elses chosen what were you thinking how could you one of alberichs attackers raised his head and stared at the stallion alberich heard nothing but he got the distinct impression that the other was trying to justify his actions rather like a defiant little boy who knows very well hes in the wrong but simply cannot bear to admit it the others were making no such attempts if a companion could have flushed or paled with shame these would have done so the stallion gave the defiant one short shrift enough he said but the effect on the other companion was as if hed been struck between the eyes with a hammer he literally dropped to his knees as the others winced you jasker the stallion said more in sorrow than anger what you and yours have endured is no excuse what happened to these others is no excuse either you should have learned that by now the stallion swung his head around and again alberich felt the full force of his gaze you alberichchosen of kantorhave you yourself ever brought harm to a single soul of valdemar not unless bandits they were and with a band of brigands riding alberich said truthfully claim i cannot that my men and i did not make it so that others freed were to come against your folkbut never a valdemaran i touched nor did any of those under my command so i thought the stallion turned his attention back to the errant one who had all but shrunk into a mere pony beneath that gaze well it was very clear that the defiant one was the target of a scathing lecture he was not to hear what the stallion said to the other but it made the formerly defiant one shrink even further and if something the size and shape of a horse could have been said to slink on its belly then that was precisely what the companion didtoward alberich i beg your pardon the young one saidwhispered rather i cant hear you the stallion rumbled like a storm on the horizon imost humbly beg your pardon and ask your forgiveness came the humiliated response chosen of kantor i acted vilely i am unworthy i should say so kantor snorted ears laid back and teeth bared arrogant little beast i should kantor the stallion said warningly but kantor only raised his head and looked the other in the face with no sign of the profound shame they displayed i only said that i should taver i should thrash this little cretin around companions field twicebut i wont i wont ever because im stronger and a better fighter and it would be no contest between us so long as it was a fair fight and not a case of a mob against one somehow the others head drooped even lower kantor i beg your pardon too came the sad voiceif a voice in the mind could sob alberich sensed that this one was on the verge of just that alberich decided that enough was enough for whatever reason this boyand it might look like a horse but it acted like a boyhad a grudge against all karsites apparently he had decided on his own that kantor had been deceived or subverted and he elected to take out his grievances on this karsitealberichwho had somehow come within his reach why the child felt this way alberich had no ideabut it was apparently a driving passion and had driven him to gather up a pack of his cronies to act when alberich had unwittingly put himself in a position where he could be attacked with relative impunity but there was also no doubt in his mind that the boycolthad been forcibly shown the error of his ways and that his contrition was real his repentance sincere his shame overwhelming and there was only one answer that alberich could make to that he stepped forward and put a hand under the colts chin the companion started at his touch and began to shake his skin shivering with reaction as alberich forced his head up so that he could look into the colts eyes pardon i give freely he said as he felt the colt fighting to keep from bolting but more forgiveness i give also jasker prompted the stallion the youngster blinked and alberich was startled to see two crystal teardrops form in his eyes and slide down his pale moonsilvered cheeks i am so sorrythank you from you i will have a promise in exchange alberich replied grimly never again to act without due thought or so terribly without honor i promise the young one replied ferventlybut alberich was not finished and youthe rest he continued raking them with as i stern a gaze as the stallions never ever again to let one with passion lead you to unreason he heard murmurs of assent so subdued that he could only hearken back to the day when berthold had discovered that some of the cadets had slipped into his personal quarters to assuage their curiosity and had been caught rifling through his possessions not alberichbut he had witnessed the tail end of that confrontation when the miscreants had been brought up before the entire corps then your punishment to this gentleman i leave he said my forgiveness you have hisyou must earn i suspect the stallion nodded gravely a few more moments passed during which there were no doubt a few more silent exchanges then the others slunk away the stallion turned his attention toward alberich and kantor brave kantor and very wise to call me rather than take them on yourself i am glad you took no longer to arrive kantor bowed his head taver they are childrenand we both know how jasker well one of us elders should have seen to him before this we are fortunate that nothing worse came of this probably the stallions flanks heaved with a sigh one cannot foresee everything no one cannot thank you taver the stallion turned to alberich and suddenly he knew why he had that nagging sense of familiarity you are of talamir bonded no he asked i am and the chief of the companions and as such it was by my neglect that this child was able to menace you so i too ask your forgiveness but alberich interrupted him with a shaky chuckle nah who can tell what in a boys head will be no need there is and no harm either but i think good it would be to return to my place tavers ears pricked forward you are gracious i am tired alberich corrected and late it is good night i bid you good night and know that after this you will find a warmer welcome among us no matter who else troubles you you will always be welcome among the companions the great stallion ghosted off after the others leaving alberich alone with kantor thank you he said to his companion kantor tossed up his head and looked satisfied if still a bit ruffled jaskerunderwent much horror at the hands of the sunpriests kantor explained he and all his family all lost and in great fear and pain family companions have families he supposed on second thought they had to come from somewhere and to lose ones whole family nightdemons he asked with a shiver he had seen what nightdemons left behind or at least that was what he had been told had happened and had heard the things only once off in the far distance he never wished to come that close again the sunpriests claimed that nightdemons were sent only against the traitors and heretics and enemies of karsebut alberich could not imagine how those ravening horrors could determine just who was a traitor or a heretic yes kantor replied simply then i understand the nightdemons did not leave very much to bury often it was only enough to tell whether the victim had been male or female and sometimes not even that much i hope that taver will not be too hard on him shall we go back to the salle you do have the first class in the morning kantor reminded him i believe it would be wise then very quietly you are a man of much honor chosen alberich started then slowly smiled i hope i may be he said after a moment i only hope i may be alberich contemplated a substantial pile of books waiting beside his chair in the sitting room with a sigh if hed seen half that number of books in the past several years hed have been very much surprised lessons classes at his age still only fool wishes to stop learning and he needed these classes if he was going to understand these valdemarans he had two of these classes not three for now both of which entailed an enormous amount of reading in the interests of preserving his authority as dethors second however he was not having his classes his lessons with the rest of the trainees that idea had been suggested and discarded within two days of being officially appointed and functioning as the weaponsmasters secondfour days after actually accepting the job dethor had been the one insisting on some alternate form of tutoring though alberich hadnt had anything to do with that particular decision not that hed been particularly enamored of squeezing himself into a desk beside a lot of children it wasnt just that it was undignified it was that he needed to impress those same children with his authority and he wasnt going to do that if he was bumbling through classes as one of their peers evidently dethor felt exactly the same and had gotten rather testy about it in fact he hadnt even seen the collegium yet all of his time had been spent in or around the salle when he wasnt kicking youngsters into shape he was catching up on the thousand and one little things that dethor hadnt been able to get to for the past few years since the boneaches got into his hands he tried sunlord knew but he had to do things slowly and the work built up faster than he could do it and often enough he couldnt do it at all there was a shed full of practice armor and real armor discarded by the guard and heralds that needed only a bit of mending to be useful again shoulder plates and elbow and knee protection just needed broken leather straps or the padding replaced the bit of chain lying about could be repaired with a few new rings and some patient weaving practice armor of leather and canvas generally had to have the same treatment or tears mended it took a little bit of skill and strong fingers nothing more then there were practice weapons in need of mending and archery targets to be salvaged the things that got mended soonest tended to be in the sizes that everyone could use which left children who were smaller taller or thinner than the usual struggling with poorlyfitting armor he was fixing the oddsized items first and had the satisfaction of seeing at least two of his smallest pupils looking comfortable in practice in the shed he had also uncovered two or three crates of oddments the oddments were very odd indeed and unlike the things needing mending had been packed carefully away alberich hadnt had a chance to do more than look into the crates but it almost appeared as if the weaponsmasters of the past had been collecting and storing anything that ever came into their hands that might have been a weapon on the chance that someday someone might be able to add it to the weaponry lessons now alberich just might be that someone for weaponsmaster aksel had learned a great many strange forms of weaponswork over the years and had passed it all on to alberichat least in the form of knowing what a particular piece was for and how it was handled if not in expertise he wanted very badly to go delving into those chests but the collegium had other ideas for his socalled free time those lessons for instance the first of which was history not only of valdemar which he had expected but also some of the history of their neighbors it was a good thing that the understanding of the written language had come part and parcel with the spoken word or he would have been floundering though how something that looked like a horse could come to know how to reador have any reason towas beyond him at the moment he wasnt asking many questions of his world he was just taking things at face value and trying not to think too hard about them it wasnt that he didnt want the answers it was that the answers only led to more questions and those to more in their turn he needed to budget his time carefully he needed to concentrate his mind and his questions on the matters at hand his history tutor was yet another herald a little bird of a man called elcarth who had probably read more books in the past year than alberich and any two other karsite officers combined had seen in their lives he did have a knack with history though being able to get at the story behind the historyand breezing right past the things that didnt have a lot of relevance to what was going on in the world at the moment hed concentrated on the founding of valdemar in regard to baron valdemars issues with the great empire and his decision to flee with his people then skipped over all the years between settling and the coming of the companions with a dismissive hardship suffering sacrifice the usual sort of tales of our heroic ancestors that youd expect to see and you can read about it all later then stopped on the tale of how valdemar had prayed to all gods for help in ensuring that his kingdom was well led after his death the answer had taken the form of the companions which had given alberich a double shock for elcarth had unearthed a dusty account of the event too tattered and ancient to have been created just for alberichs benefit if it didnt date all the way back to king valdemar it was old enough to have been copied directly from a document of that time and in that account was the supposed litany of all of the gods that valdemar had prayed to one of them had been vkandis sunlord which implied that either valdemar had been familiar with alberichs god or the author of the account had been now in either case the further implication was that vkandis would be favorably inclined to valdemar and her king oh there were a lot more implications than just that one but that single suggestion was enough to undermine everything he had thought of as history but alberich wasnt allowed to dwell on that for elcarth had accelerated past the rest of valdemars reign and that of the next few of his descendants with there are a great many legends songs and tales and you can look into them at your leisure settling into the point where valdemarans first encountered folk who were as strong or stronger than they were who were selfsufficient and selfgoverning and had no interest in uniting with them up until that point as they expanded their borders all they had come in contact with were small and isolated settlements that were perfectly happy to have the protection of the kingdom of valdemar or countries more like counties seeing that some of them could have been crossed in a day that were willing to ally and later be absorbed by the greater nation it was the kingdom of hardorn that they initially contacted in a cautious probe back in the direction from which they had come and that was the chapter that alberich was dealing with now the other class was concerned with the government of valdemar and how it worked a good bit drier this was hed been given the books yesterday by elcarth with instructions to read the first twenty pages or so apparently his tutor would turn up this afternoon when dethor would be instructing the youngest of the trainees in their first lessons in edged weapons hed read the first twenty pages as hed been told and found it all rather different a complete contrast with karse which was ruled by the son of the sun who was in turn selected from the priesthood by the sunlord himself supposedly alberich had never been near the great temple himself never seen any of the priests of the upper hierarchies or their ilk nor had anyone he had ever met not bloody likely he ever would have either the common folk were not supposed to trouble themselves about such things writ and rule said that the son of the sun was selected by the sunlord and that was the extent of his personal knowledge he had suspicions of course that the sunlord had as much to do with the selection of his highest representative in karse as he did in selecting dethors favorite hat when had there last been a son of the sun selected from the village priests for instance they all seemed to come from among the highranking lot that never stirred out of sunhame and were everincreasingly out of touch with what was going on among the common people karse actually had a king but the position was purely symbolic and had been for centuries king ortrech largely presided over a court concerned with the social functions of the old nobility and moneyed classes the sunpriests made all the real decisions insofar as the actual running of karse the king merely ratified what the priests decided and occasionally the priests would in turn implement some small thing that the king wanted such as the creation of a new title or the granting of property to make a court noble into a landed one this of course was probably one of the causes of strife between the two landsthat valdemar was ruled by a purely secular figure and karse by supposedly a divinelyguided one alberich wished that he was far enough along in the history classes to see what had happened when the borders of karse and valdemar first met had that been the primal cause of the enmity or had it been something else the first few pages of the text on valdemaran law and government had been perfectly straightforward but then toward the end of the assigned segment he encountered a passage that left him blinking of course in the circumstance which has only occurred three times in our recorded histories that there have been no children of the reigning monarch that were chosen it falls to the nearest blood relative who is also a herald to take up the crown the text had gone on to describe how such a selection was made based less upon the degree of consanguinity than of ability most of that had seemed irrelevant to alberichuntil he came to the part that said and the vote of the heraldic circle as a bloc in the election of a new monarchprovided that the candidate is at least a trainee if not a full heraldcomprises one third of the total with that of the council comprising two thirds ordinary heralds got a onethird vote in the selection of a king that was tantamount to the officers of the sunsguard having a say in the selection of the son of the sun he didnt know quite what to think about that there was no question however that the heralds had as much to do with creating the laws and government as they did in disseminating and dispensing it the morning classes kept him too busy to worry about all that however and by the time his putative tutor showed up theoretical questions about the government of valdemar had been pushed so far to the back of his mind that they didnt impinge on his thoughts in the least then when he saw his tutor the question foremost was if someone at the collegium intended to mock him the tutor was a young woman in student grays slim and blonde with a determined jaw and bluegray eyes that considered him thoughtfully he recognized her from the advanced weaponry class held at the very end of the day although dethor had never yet assigned alberich to work directly with her you might not remember me from the afternoon classes alberich the girl said in a matteroffact manner as she held out her hand im selenay my tutor you are he replied clasping her hand briefly he didnt bother to hide the doubt in his voice she laughed which surprised him a little unlikely i know but the powers that be intend for you to get a practical exposure to how things are done in valdemar and they decided that we might as wellas the saying here goesshoot two ducks with one arrow you see im the heir princess selenay and every other afternoon i serve in the city courts no one likes me being there without a bodyguard and with you as my bodyguard you can observeas elcarth put itgovernment in action anything you dont understand i can explain or kantor can meanwhile your presence will make the council less nervous about my being there in the first place alberich controlled his expression and managed not to splutter at your side the presence of the karsite less nervous will make them but they wont know its the karsite whos my bodyguard she replied with a bare hint of irony who i pickwith the senior collegium staffs recommendations of courseto act as my bodyguard is entirely the collegiums business not the councils all they will know unless one of them decides to observe me is that ive got someone in grays to keep a weathereye on my safety theyll rightly assume that since dethor must have had a hand in picking him my escort will be quite competent oh eventually theyll find out you cant keep anything like that a secret but by that time it will be so long established that objecting to my choice would make them look like idiots dont spoil her fun shes been planning this for a fortnight kantor advised butto trust me with the safety of the heir he was utterly flabbergasted he might have to look as if all this was just a matter of course but at least he could drop any pretense of composure with kantor and he did so arent you trustworthy kantor countered i know you would be the best person for the task no one would take it as seriously as you will because the heralds all have a blind spot where the safety of selenay is concerned they believe that no one realizes that trainee selenay and the heir are the same person which is ridiculousits not exactly a secret and even if it was you couldnt keep information like that secure for very long not very bright of them and just because no one has tried to harm her no one ever will hmm he replied perhaps it does take someone from outside to see the danger too true i fear and that isnt all of course you need to see how we work so to speak and youll learn more from watching a common heralds court than you ever would from books but when the great men find out who it is that is standing guard over their princess by that time youll have proved yourself and no one will think anything of it kantor sounded very certain of himself alberich wasnt certain of anything except that there would be repercussions but who would be the ones facing the repercussions not i no that would be dethortalamir the king your father he ventured knows he of this of course he was the first one i suggested this to i suppose youre ready selenay asked as calm and casual as if hed asked what time of day it was ready what was he supposed to be ready for youre coming down into the city with me correct as my bodyguard you might as well start right now she looked him up and down critically that set of grays should do i suppose they dont look quite like trainee grays but theyll be all right are there any particular weapons youd like to carry weapons i would like to carry he repeated feeling as if hed been run over by something ahknives a sword well lets get them and get on our way selenay waited for him to collect a set of plain knives and a common sword that he had just finished working on hed found them in that shed and he had liked the balance immediately and had taken extra care with them rewrapping the grips cleaning polishing and sharpening they were of sound make and good steel and if old and muchabused at least he knew they were in decent shape with no hidden weakness in tang or blade and he had never been the sort who got attached to a particular chunk of metal as far as he was concerned one blade was as good as another so long as it was balanced and sharp hed never had any patience with those sagas wherein the hero found was given or created a famous blade with a name of its own ridiculous these things were just pieces of steel not something sentient and when you focused too much on my famous blade gazornenplatz you were apt to forget that it was a tool to be used and as readily left behind if need be aksel had felt the same and when hed caught cadets naming their blades and refusing to use any other he often took the weapons in question to the forge himself and had them melted down if they happened to have come out of the common arsenal there wasnt a great deal he could do about heirloom blades or gifts other than to ban them from the salle but thats exactly what he had done fortunately the question hadnt yet come up here but if it ever did alberich intended to follow aksels example alberich got sheaths and a belt and armed himself while selenay waited with no signs of impatience when they left the salle he discovered that kantor had managed somehow to get himself saddled and bridled and was waiting with a companion mare in similar tack how had he done that easy enough when we show up at the stable door the helpers know to get us tacked up dont forget here everyone realizes very well that we arent horses and treats us accordingly alberich shook his head a little and mounted selenay was already in the saddle the two companions wheeled and trotted away from the salle toward the collegium im on a longtrack internship just as you are selenay explained over the chime of bridle bells when he looked at her without understanding she quickly explained when a trainee is considered ready to become a herald normally theyre given the white uniforms and theyre sent out along with an older experienced herald as a mentor at first all they do is observe and discuss what the mentor did afterward then over the course of a year and a half they gradually begin to take on every task that the older herald does until they are doing all the work and its the mentor thats observing but i cant do that not wise the heir out alone with only one other to have as guardian and not possible ordinary to be a troop of guards trailing alberich observed not wise as well the heir to be out of reach the countryside in but worse the heir to be unguarded a strange city within therefore here the only option is she nodded exactly the heralds and some of the council assume that staying within the city is safe enough but not even the most optimistic of them is mad enough to send me out in the field on internship and because im the heir once i put on whites i need to have every bit of the authority and experience of a seasoned herald the moment im a full herald ill have a council seat and a lot of responsibility so instead of doing a regular internship in whites im on a longtrack internship in grays i go sit in on herald mirilins sessions of the court of justice and every so often he asks me to make a judgment or take an action rendering justice is a lot of what a herald does you see and you can study it all you like in books but you never really understand it until you see it done and do it yourself justice isnt just laws its people by this time they were approaching the graveled road that ran beside the enormous building of the collegium a herald waited for them there a nondescript man with long brown hair in a single braid down his back and a small beard he eyed alberich with a stony expression the new trainee selenay he asked and my bodyguard herald mirilin she replied with perfect composure this is alberich and actually hes on a long internship just like i am i should think so mirilin replied giving him another stonefaced look i will be interested in trying a blade against you at some point alberich alberich just bowed slightly the herald wasnt being actively unfriendly so there was certainly no point in taking exception with his passive hostility when all that alberich was there for was to observe and watch out for young selenay at your convenience sir he replied making certain that his voice was absolutely neutral they rode down into the city in silence alberich didnt care that herald mirilin made no effort at conversation most of his attention was taken up with watching for troublefor if the council was nervous about selenay going out in public unguarded there must be at least some reason for their concern what little of his attention was left over was involved in simple observation even if he had not known very well where he was he would have known immediately that this was not karse nearest to the palace and the collegium just outside the complex walls were the manors of the nobility and wealthy in karse such buildings were the property of the priesthood each holding the staff and acolytes of one or another of the highranking sunpriests there was a great deal of difference between these places that held secular families and those manses for one thingsounds no sounds of prayer chanting that sort of thing dogs barking occasional voices of children and young people and also the sounds of domestic animals some homes had music drifting from them some the sounds of a party or friendly gathering coming out of the gardens the farther the three of them got from the palace following a road that wound back and forth in a manner of which alberich strongly approved defensively it made sense not to have a direct path to the palace the less expensive and more crowded the buildings became and soon after that rows of shops anchored by taverns cookshops or inns began to displace houses and temple facades poked in among the shops with shrines in city squares or on corners the noise level increased with increasing traffic and population of course but again it was obvious that this wasnt karse because there were so many different temples and shrines and as he noticed on closer observation not all of the things that had appeared to be shrines were anything of the sort some were public fountains some statues that so far as he could tell had no religious significance whatsoever some were clearly statues of valdemaran heroes and it was no surprise that a great many of them were heralds who were invariably shown with their companions not all however which was interesting equally interesting were the statues that almost always surmounted the public fountains which were not martial in any way in fact given that the figures were dressed in quite elaborate clothing and often held tools or implements he had a guessa quite astonishing guess since nothing of the sort would have been permitted in karse common artisans and merchants no matter how wealthy or talented should never be allowed to exalt themselves to the point of putting up public statues of themselves vkandis frowned on spending money putting up vainglorious statues when the same money could be given to the temple and at any rate exalting yourself or your ancestors in such a fashion was an indulgence in the sin of pride that is who he asked finally catching selenays eye and nodding at a statue of a round balding little man who clutched a plumbbob and compass and beamed at passersby alberich rather liked his statue for not only was there the usual spigot and basin of the public fountain but the upper basin spilled over into a trough at street level just the right height for dogs and cats to drink from selenay followed his gaze and smiled i dont know who that is but i know what he is and why hes there she said these statues began going up in elspeth the peacemakers time valdemar had been pretty much at peace for more than a generation and a lot of people were getting very prosperous so they started putting up statues of themselves which rather annoyed my ancestor who thought it was a silly waste of money she made a law forbidding people to put up privatelyowned statues on public streets so theyd have the statues put up then give them to the city so she had another law made that forbade the putting up of anything on public streets unless it served a practical use and was for the public good and being able to tie a horse to it didnt count oh and you had to leave money in your will to see anything you put up was kept clean and in working order alberich smiled at that clever that was he responded and good for the city folk selenay grinned especially since the corners in the best part of the city went early so people who wanted to do things had to take what they could get most people went for fountains and water pumps the queen said it was a pity that we were stuck with all those statues of a lot of vain old men but at least now every street had a public water supply without taxes going to pay for it mirilin overheard them and unbent enough to smile slightly a wise woman your ancestor he said mildly if she had taxed them to pay for such things they would have been calling for her head but when they were able to make them into selfaggrandizing statuary they were climbing all over themselves to oblige probably selenay shrugged i think she said something like that herself at any rate youll find statues like that all over haven now when they arent fountains and pumps they can be almost anything useful after a while the artists that people hired to put up such things got to enjoy thinking up practical purposes theres a clever basin over in the square where pitcher and bright cross where women can wash clothingit was made that way on purpose and theres dry mangers with stone canopies over them for feeding your horses or whatever at nearly every market square there are covered benches too with inscriptions instead of statues and an enormous public pigeon cote which serves the purpose of giving poor people a place for birds for their pot and gives the birds a place to go besides making nests in peoples roofs both of them looked at him clearly expecting some sort of comment from him he thought about the larger towns in karse that he had been in nothing this size of course but the only public sources of water were the wells in temple courtyards and to use them to be fair there were plenty of sunpriests who encouraged all comers to take the water freely butwell it seemed to him there were fewer of the generous ones from year to year and more who at the least if they did not exact a tithe of work cash or goods for the water insisted on daily attendance at one of the services before you got your water that might not sound like much but in the day of a busy woman there were not many marks to spare and in order to fetch her water she might face a choice between leaving some task undone or walking farther to fetch water from another source one wishes he said slowly that all leaders likeminded were selenay beamed mirilin grunted but at least he didnt seem displeased the court of justice was held in a building over the corn marketliterally over it for it stood on four pillars above the valuable stall space if the courtroom was filled this covered space belowused on market days for the most valuable of merchandise and food vendorsenabled people who were waiting their turn to wait out of the weather or sun herald mirilin was the sole arbiter here those who brought grievances to him either had tried the regular courts and were unsatisfied or felt that a regular court would not be as responsive to their grievances as a single herald would the herald sat at a table at the back of the room within a sort of partition that took up the back fifth or so divided from the rest of room by a low balustrade those whose cases were being heard stood before him while those still waiting and interested parties sat on rows of backless benches on the other side of the railing selenay sat beside mirilin industriously taking notes while alberich stood behind them both and attempted to look like a superfluous statue as far as alberich could judge the people here ranged in income level from welloff to impoverished in age they tended to be middleaged folk with a sprinkling of elders the cases were astonishingly petty which surprised him someone had loaned an object or money and the person to whom it had been lent now claimed it was a gift a child had vandalized something and the parents disclaimed responsibility a dog was permitted to run loose and had bitten someone a chicken flew into a yard and ate seeds and young plants the angry householder caught killed and ate it and the owner claimed compensation none of this was earth shattering and all of it would have been settled in karse with some form of personal confrontation among the parties concerned in a village it was usually the responsibility of the headman or council of elders to sort it all outin a city well it generally came to blows alberich wasnt quite sure why anyone official was involved in these cases at all and even if the idea was to keep public fighting at a minimum there were courts to handle these cases according to selenay why were heralds concerned with these ridiculous little domestic problems at all more importantly at least as far as this bodyguard business was concerned what was selenay learning here that was vital enough to put her here where she was very vulnerable his questions remained unanswered for the moment but he did gradually begin to see the shape of what was called justice in valdemar when a grievance was between a rich person and a poor one it was settled in the favor of the poor one as often as not in the villages of karse rich men had influence no one wanted to get on their bad side for the most part they might be cordially loathed but no one dared to offend them at least no one dared except the sunpriestsbut even they tended not to upset the best source of their golden tithes so justice tended especially in small matters to weigh in on the side of the fellow with the most coin and in the cities of karse justice was for open sale as often as not but here to his bemusement justice was simply that but the poor man didnt always win not when the poor man was in the wrong there was a case of a shabby shiftyeyed fellow claiming that a merchants horse had trampled him and broken his leg and the merchants coachman had agreed that yes that was what had happenedwhen the shifty fellow had thrown himself deliberately under the horses hooves that was when mirilin glanced over at the princess truth spell please selenay he murmured watch this chosen kantor said instantly this is important selenay nodded and closed her eyes a tiny frown of concentration on her face and slowly a faint blue glow began to gather over the heads of both parties growing stronger and stronger until it stood out clearly even in the welllit courtroom alberich kept his face expressionless but he felt the hair standing up on the back of his neck when anyone in karse used magicwell the only people who did were sunpriests and the very few times they ever did so outside of the inner sanctum of a temple someone usually died now said mirilin to the coachman tell me again what happened precisely the coachman an earnest old gentleman who kept his gaze fastened on mirilin the entire time repeated his story virtually wordforword while the light about him glowed steadily he didnt even seem aware of it although those in the courtroom who were paying attention to this case murmured with satisfaction and now sir would you tell me what happened again mirilin continued with a courteous nod to the shabby fellow nah lookit me leg the fellow bleated indignantly gesturing at the limb in question which was splinted and bound with clean ragsthe only things that were clean about him anyun with af an eye kin tell whats what nevertheless please tell me again mirilin replied with far more patience than alberich would have shown the man began his tale with ill grace but the moment he got to an i stepped inter the street an this bastid comes whippin up is orses the light went out although the man clearly was unaware that anything had happened at all the onlookers saw what alberich had a gaspnot of surprise but of satisfactionwent up and mirilin cut the rest of the mans speech off with a wave of his hand sir you are lying and this man is telling the truth he owes you nothing mirilin glanced meaningfully at the constables that waited just beyond the barrier now the penalties for perjury are substantial in a regular court but since this is a heraldic hearing and i have discretion i shall allow you to leave in peaceproviding you do leave quietly i suggest that you find a more honest means of employing yourself from here on because you are now in the official records as a perjurer and the next court you bring yourself before will take that into account the man followed mirilins glance and set his jaw angrily but didnt even try to dispute the judgment instead he shuffled off quickly getting himself out of the door or at least as quickly as a splinted and wrapped leg would allow while the coachman thanked mirilin effusively but mirilin waved him off with a slight sign of irritation do not thank me for simple justice he said now please we have a heavy docket to see the coachman took the hint and followed in the path of his accuser that was the truth spell chosen kantor said with satisfaction and it is nearly the only sort of magic that you will ever see a herald using theres mindmagic of course which is things like mindspeech foreseeing and farseeing but unless you are the herald doing the mindmagic well you arent going to actually see anything mirilin is better at the truth spell than selenay but he wants her to have the practice in setting it because when she needs to use it shell be doing so with many more eyes on her is that all it does he asked just show which person is telling the truth there is a more powerful version that can compel the truth but its not likely to be used here kantor replied as an old woman with a cat came hobbling up to the table thats saved for things that are a great deal more serious and not all heralds can invoke it you have to have a very strong gift and it usually has to be one like mindspeech will i he began and stopped you will youll probably be very good at it but kantor was evidently sensitive to feelings as well as actual thoughts for he quickly added but given that youre going to be the weaponsmaster i doubt youll be called upon to do it much if at all the afternoon trundled on under its own momentum of petty grievances minor misunderstandings rancor greed selfishnessand bewilderment hurt feelings a certain amount of genuine grief and the genuine trust that a herald would put things right as the afternoon went on there were several inheritance cases that came up and in one mirilin worked something like a miracle not only getting compromise but in getting all of the aggrieved parties to apologize to each other and reconcile sometimes both parties were equally right and wrong and it was then that mirilin truly showed his worth somehow he always managed to get both sides to see the rights as well as the wrongs of the case and for the most part managed to get them to work out a solution without having to have him decree one for them that was sheer genius and alberich did not see how he managed it astonishing no wonder hes assigned to this alberich thought more than once as mirilin played nearinvisible midwife to yet another compromise in many ways selenay will have to do exactly this when she is queen kantor pointed out a court is a little like a village or a neighborhood everyone knows everyone else everyone has his own particular agenda to pursue there is an entire pecking order within the group that outsiders would never be aware of and above all you can never forget that someone has to be aware of all of the undercurrents and keep conflicts from breaking out into actual feuding the actual complaints here will be different from those within the court but the dynamics of personality are fundamentally the same so that was what selenay was learning here perhaps these people werent as daft as he thought the court was closed around dinnertime with a backlog of people still waiting but no one complained overmuch perhaps because mirilin had kept things moving fairly briskly on the way back selenay and her mentor discussed the intricacies of case and personality with great animation alberich achieved his goal of becoming unnoticeable as he rode behind them this was good he actually learned far more than he had expected as mirilin offered the fruits of his hardearned experience to selenay and when selenay took her leave of alberich he found that he was looking forward to the next session down in haven if mirilin hadnt exactly warmed to alberich at least he hadnt rejected alberich out of hand he returned to the salle and headed for his shared living quarters with the feeling on the whole that he was rather pleased than otherwise with the way that the day had gone but dethors first words spoken as he walked into the midst of a conversation that had certainly been going on for at least a mark before he arrived put a chill on his good humor there you are dethor said as the other two heralds in the room looked up at his entrance what do you know about a group that calls themselves the tedrel mercenaries what of the tedrels do i know huh nothing good alberich replied but only after standing there for a moment blinking stupidly such a completely unexpected question left him feeling slightly stunned the tedrels what on earth could that sinister group have to do with valdemar and why ask him about them why he asked as the others sat there looking at him waiting for him to say something more because theres word karse is hiring them dethors eyes could have pierced a hole in steel but evidently alberichs reaction of further shock pleased him for his expression softened immediately the tedrels why would karse hire them who could have learned of them to hire them in the first place most people in karse had never heard of them let alone anyone this far north the only reason he knew anything about them was because of aksel and the only reason that aksel knew anything about them was because he still had contacts within the mercenary guild friendly contacts which was not within the norm for anyone in the sunsguard one evening aksel had told him that the mercenary guild was issuing warnings about the tedrel companies since that was just before alberich was commissioned out of the cadets aksel had seen fit to warn his protege in case he came up against any tedrels in the course of his duties hed shown alberich the broadside carrying the message in fact dont trust them said those warnings dont fight with them and dont take a fight against them and the reasons for these flat edicts had been chilling now karse was not in good odor with the mercenary guild the sunpriests expected men to fight for the glory of the sunlord and not for such venial considerations as money and booty they had on two separate occasions hired guild companies and then reneged on the contract they had paid for those mistakes with full guild backing enough caravans led by karsite merchants crossing the southern border of karse had been confiscated to pay for the arrearsand since it had been highranking sunpriests who had backed those caravans with their personal fortunes the bird of ill luck had come home to roost in the right nest but the guild companies now refused any and all overtures from the sunpriests and of all of the military leaders in karse only akselwho was not a leader as suchstill had friends in the guild that had all fallen out while alberich was still sweeping out the stables to earn extra coppers for his mother by the time he was in the cadet academy karse was learning that not even nonguild mercenaries would take their coin being cut off from the guild left karse without a reliable source for extra troops being refused by nearly everyone left them forced to supply their needs from within and therein lay the rub the regular troops were few standing armies were expensive beasts to maintain men had to be recruited or conscriptedand if you took too many men off the land who would till and plant and harvest the fields or tend the herds once you had the men you had to train them and house and feed them while you were training them then when they werent actually fighting which was most of the time you still had to feed and house them the sunpriests might be able to induce religious fervor enough to get their men to fight without pay or at least with minimal pay but they still couldnt get by without food and shelter no matter how fanatic or pious or even desirous of paradise they were and besides that there was a limit to how many troops you could recruit in the first place many places in karse had poor soil poor soil meant that a great deal of work had to be put into a farm to make it prosper the boys might get dreams of glory in the sunsguard but their fathers would see to it that they didnt run off when they were needed at home no matter how hungry for the land and riches of other realms the sunpriests were they were not mad enough to deplete their own land of the very people needed to keep the farms going by the time alberich was about to get his first commission they had conscripted so many of the poor in the cities that there was an actual labor shortage and women were taking jobs that once only men had filled that had been the reasoning behind permitting bandits to use karse as a base to raid into valdemar bandits didnt require the support of the state and they kept up the ongoing feud with valdemar withoutin theory at leastcosting karse anything except that of course bandits didnt keep their bargains which had required the sunpriests use all of their sunsguard to quell them leaving no fighters for any other little projects they might have in mind which left hiring troops as the only viable option if troops were needed for a campaign against anyone that meant either mercenary guild companies which were trustworthy would not loot or otherwise molest your people and in general were welcome in the lands of those who hired themor nonguild troops which were unpredictable at best and a hazard to those who hired them at worst by betraying the mercenary guild the sunpriests had shaved those options to a narrow little rind because not even the nonguild companies operating anywhere near karse would touch a contract of course the only reason why you would need more troops was if you were going to start a war the last time when the rulers karse had reneged on a guild contractthe war had been internal some madman out of the hills had decided that vkandis spoke through him without any evidence or real miracles to back up his assertions but his cause was convenient for some of the nobles moneyed merchants and even a few priests so they backed him and began a civil war both sides of the conflict had been decimated which was in part how a bastardborn peasant like alberich had managed to get into cadet training and if it came to more than border skirmishing frankly in alberichs opinion karse couldnt possibly raise the troops needed from among its own people if karse was planning a real war again nonguild mercenaries were the only way in which an army could be raised in a hurry butthe tedrels could they possibly be mad enough to use the tedrels a war with whom rethwellan perhaps in the last conflict rethwellan had seized the opportunity to increase its borders and the sunpriests badly wanted the province of menmellith not valdemar surely notsurely the lessons learned in the past were enough by now no matter how fanatically the sunpriests hated valdemar and the demonriders surely they knew better than to engage in open warfare now rethwellanthat made more sense and there was some justification for warfare with that land menmellith had once been karsite very very long ago of course but the sunpriests had long memories butto use the tedrels the very idea made him feel a little sick honor it was hardly honorable to hire creatures like the tedrels for anything they followed none of the laws of combat they were more apt to turn to massacre civilians than they were to fight the battles for which theyd been hired but little i know alberich said slowly and that hearsay for the most part is figure we know less dethor said settling back in his chair and motioning for alberich to take the one remaining seat left alberich did so but not with any feeling of ease he sat on the very edge back straight muscles tense it is said he began and long ago this wasthree perhaps four generationsthat a war there was in a land south and far far east of karse brother fought brother in a cause none now recall but those who the tedrels became lost that war and instead of surrender into exile went determined they were to gain back what lost had beena land their own to call where called they no man lord but nothing they hadexcept their skill at arms and so mercenaries they became all of them company after company after company which even in defeat enough men was to fill up a country now it was his turn to watch as dethors eyes bulged just a little with shock an entire nation of mercenaries the weaponsmaster asked aghast alberich nodded interesting that dethor had not known that which was the thing most notable about the tedrel companies now that was long and long ago and wanderers they became as well no wives would they take except those who would wander and consent to being the property of who could hold them and no women in their ranks as fighters at all camp followers only have they decreed that women may be and he found this next part difficult to articulate but he tried theyaltered it is said in what way one of the others asked abruptly cutting into his narrative it was the kings own talamir not in one of his more elaborate uniforms but in a set of whites like everyone elses no wonder alberich hadnt noticed him until he spoke talamir here and waiting to hear what i know it may be rumor but they are taking the rumor seriously once they had honor and purpose and things they would not do now he shrugged nothing there is they will not do should the reward be high anything for loot war they bring against the unarmed as well as fighting true battles i have hearddreadful things he had to pause shaking his head with no wives only women held by the strongest no families their ranks then grew but slowly and difficult it was to replace those who fell so now anyone they take into their ranks who presents himselfthief murderer it matters not has he a strong arm and thus cruelty upon cruelty piles dethor and talamir exchanged a worried look but alberich wasnt quite finished the greatest change is this no more seeking the home they look only for a home should any offer a new land in reward it is saidit is said that there is nothing they would not do he gnawed his lower lip thinking about the coldblooded killers that aksel had described and what they would willingly do for anyone who was so foolish as to offer them a new homeland his blood ran cold at the very idea but this hearsay only is he amended none i know has seen them spoken to them fought against them nor with them should any in valdemar seek them to hire warned they should be it is said moreover that no sworn word do they truly hold by but their own to their own and they can and have turned against those who hired them someone had better find a way to get that message across to your own people dethor replied grimly because word has reached us that theyre thinking about hiring the tedrel companies and not just one of em all of em now alberich went icy cold all over with sudden dread and was glad he was sitting down hiring one or two of the tedrel companies he could just barely see aksel was not high enough in the ranks for his warnings to be heeded overmuch on that score but all of them there was only one reward that would tempt all of them together madness he said flatly surely not surely not even the maddest and most fanatical of priests would hazard all to cast their lot with the tedrels that would be insane as aksel had described them having the tedrels in ones midst was like playing host to a large pack of wild dogs so long as they were fullbellied and content the worst that would happen was that there would be a little damage to small towns here and there if the scum that now filled out the ranks of the tedrels grew bored perhaps rape a bit of looting possibly a few houses burned the worst that would happen if they are satisfied rape looting oh my poor people his stomach turned over he thought about his border villages and his throat and chest tightened his gut roiling no worse perhaps than the bandits were already doing on the borders but to face it from bandits and then receive worse from those beastswho in turn were hired by the priests supposed to protect them that would be bad enough but if the paychests were not as full as promised or stopped altogetherthe pack would turn and fire and the sword would reign at least until the paychests came again his chest felt too tight his heart ached at the mere thought if this were true the only way to hire the whole nation was to promise a homeland would karse offer menmellith possibly menmellith was no great prize but would karse then want the tedrels as neighbors so it would be valdemar the priests hate valdemar enough to allow anything so long as valdemar is left gutted kingless and without the heralds karse as a new homeland probably would not tempt them it was too hard a land they wanted something like that dream that their land had become for them a place fat and rich soft and sweet but they would take out their spleen on karse if it promised them such a homeland and failed to deliver it into their hands thats what weve heard dethor said shrugging anything more you can tell us alberich shook his head what more could he say dread was a sickening lump in his belly this rumori hope it false proves our sources are good was all that talamir would say the third man who was not in whites and did not identify himself only grunted he looked about as friendly as mirilinwhich was to say not at all there was no doubt in alberichs mind that the third man did not trust him and why should he if even some if not most of the heralds were ambivalent about alberich but we arent kantor said with some force the warmth that followed that pronouncement made the cold nausea lift a little and eased some of the churning of his gut it certainly made him feel less as if he was standing alone facing a suspicious mob i know thank you knowing that the companions now accepted him helped a little but he knew what he wanted to saythat he had given up everything everything when he was brought here that he had thrown his lot in with valdemar given his word and that word was not given lightly couldnt they see that this unknown man who watched him from under furrowed brows didnt he realize that and he wanted to say thatif his own people had sunk so low as to hire the tedrels to do their dirty work then surely even the sunlord would abandon them but he said none of this for it would not matter if he did instead he sat stonefaced and silent and waited for the others to say something even if it was only to suggest that he leave finally dethor hissed a little between his teeth i dont sppose he said carefully that youd know anybody likely towellbe helpful inside karse that is wed like to know more about these rumors from someone with good hard facts that was a little better even if it sniffed around the edges of that promise theyd made him the promise never to ask him to work against his own people but if those who are supposed to lead my people have already betrayed them how can knowing if that betrayal is true or false be acting against the people depend it does alberich replied just as carefully on what it is by helpful you mean information talamir said nothing more and nothing that would hurt karse only what will protect us without hurting your people alberich turned talamirs words over and over in his mind as the other three watched him because he did know someone who mightjust mightbe willing to be helpful of all the people that alberich knew aksel tarselein was the most likely to be enraged and offended if this tale of hiring the tedrels was true and was because of his own contacts the most likely to know if it was truth or rumor spread to discomfit the enemies of karse for aksel tarselein trainer of cadets had already been a deeply troubled man when alberich knew him someoneanother young highborn officerhad once described him with a sneer as one of the old school as if being a man of honor and integrity whose word was seldom given and always kept was somehow unfashionable and oldfashioned and the shifts to which the son of the sun had fallen by the time alberich had been commissioned had left aksel profoundly disturbed he was glad he had confessed to the younger alberich when the two of them had shared a farewell flask on the night of alberichs commission that he was no longer in a position where he found himself forced to obey orders which went against his conscience and it is a harder world today he had said sadly staring at the last few drops in the bottom of his flagon you may discover that you have to stop thinkingor stop obeying i hope that the sunlord will guide you young one he had said no more on the subject but alberich knew which path he had taken though not without qualms and not without remorse i stopped thinking at least until kantor came to me just as he knew that aksel had not stopped thinking that was not aksels way but as long as aksel remained a weaponsmaster to cadets he would never be given an order that forced him to disobey either aksel held fast to his own honor only by making sure he was in a place where he would not have to sacrifice it which of them had been given the easier path was it better to obey and not think or think and try to ignore and be glad you personally didnt have to disobey possible it is he said very slowly that there is a man but possible it is not directly to approach him friends he keeps in the mercenary guild there it is you must go speak with you he may deny you he may alberich shrugged i cannot say his own decision he must make fair enough and weve got enough friendly contacts with the guild to ferret out whoever knows him dethor said nodding agreement his name aksel tarselein weaponsmaster to the sunsguard cadets once again dethor and talamir exchanged a look this time a startled one should he add something from himself so that aksel knew who had revealed him do you think your name would make aksel change his mind kantor asked it might the nowfamiliar sickness rose in him again and would you want it to kantor continued or would you rather i would rather there was no pressure on my old teacher but that of his own thoughts alberich said firmly kantor let the matter drop and to his immense relief dethor made no request for some token from alberich nor did the third manwho felt perhaps that a message from one already branded as a traitor would do his cause with aksel no good aksel tarselein dethor and the third man exchanged a look and the third man grunted thats one name more than we had before especially if he decides to talk yes alberich didnt elaborate dethor didnt pressure him to the third man got up to leave dethor poured a tankard full of beer and pushed it across the table to alberich as the third man turned at the door gave talamir and dethor a little nod and walked out alberich picked up the tankard and drained half of it in one gulp he felt a great need of it at that moment and it did a little a very little to settle his unsettled stomach and nerves it is only a rumor kantor said suddenly that is all no matter that this spy of sendars has convinced everyone that it is more than that he has no proof he has only heard stories and a name for no one he has spoken to has seen the tedrels or their captains or even an agent that may be said to come from them relief made alberichs hands a little steadier as he put down the tankard if anyone will know the truth of the rumor it will be aksel he replied and if it is true i believe that aksel will speak and in any case it is out of your hands well no matter what talamir its out of our hands dethor sighed echoing kantors words this is a thing for those with talents you and i dont have nor alberich either alberich regarded him broodingly i could but a pledge you made to me and well keep it talamir said with finality though i will admit to you freely that this is one reason why the lord marshals man was here he wanted us to pressure you into crossing the border again to spy for valdemar wordlessly alberich shook his head dethor snorted aye we told him as much then asked him to his face if hed really trust you if you agreed and he had to admit that he wouldnt so whats the point we know youre sound as a good apple but to the likes of him a man that turns may well turn again gods help us though i sometimes wonder what were to do with you alberich eased his dry mouth with another swallow what you have done there is what else to do to bring trust where there is none not much doubters cant accuse you of much here with my eye on you and keeping you apart from the rest means that nobodys going to try and make trouble for you what dye think of young selenay an abrupt change of subject but alberich answered it quickly enough steady thoughtful careful and untried he saw the questions in dethor and talamirs eyes and tried to answer them no opposition has she met no loss no pain no great joys either no love with the single eye she sees nowclearly in black and white as young things do until she has more wisdom well who knows how she will see then when great events come upon herthen will you see of what she is made not until but the makings of a king she has and she thinks which with more than most young things is not the case told you so dethor said in an aside to talamir the kings own just shrugged dethor turned back to alberich she came up with this bodyguard notion on her own but i think its no bad idea having you instead of one of the guard especially when shes with mirilin lad in a guard uniform puts people on edge fellow in whites makes em wonder if the heralds have some reason to haul in more than one for a simple heralds court but a fellow in grays nah that makes em relax we want someone with her to keep her back covered without making people nervous that hes there people dont necessarily expect a fellow in grays to be much of a fighter and they dont think of him as a fancier sort of constable they take you ill be bound for another trainee on internship maybe another highborn alberich smiled slowly seeing what dethor was getting at talamir only looked strained but once the council finds out there will be difficulties the kings own said reluctantly then shook his head yes and i admit it is my responsibility to smooth them out well the easiest way will be by simply not saying anything for now i suppose ill have a word with mirilin we already have via estan and he wont be mentioning alberichs presence as the heirs bodyguard to anyone not even to other heralds kantor said promptly and by the sudden startled look on talamirs face taver must have said the same thing at the same moment dethor laughed aloud the word must have reached him as well talamir coughed well apparently you have far more friends here than i had thought alberich so unless someone from the council actually sees you at selenays back and realizes who you are apparently well keep that much from their attention for a while his face grew distant again for a moment and he added long enough that perhaps by the time the council realizes just who selenays bodyguard is there will be far fewer doubts about you occurred to you had it that we being managed are alberich asked him in a moment of stark frankness by them they knew who he meantthe companions he half expected kantor to be annoyed by the statement but he sensed instead a dry amusement he got a look of startlement then one of understanding from both the heralds oh always at least to an extent talamir replied with the same utter honesty and in some cases thats all to the good his voice took on a different coloring then a hint of wry tartness but let me tell you a bit of home truth alberich of karsesomething that i do not tell the children because they are children and need managingit is your right and privilege to tell your beloved companion just where he can shove anything he tells you or asks of you if it goes completely against your better judgment he raised an eyebrow as even my taver has found to his occasional shock and dismay dethor whooped with laughter and applauded by the gods talamir good for you and well said now alberich expected kantor to be completely offended but instead he heard an ironic chuckle in his mind tell the kings own that it is our right and privilege to do the same with our chosen you know alberich started to repeat the remark but talamir held up his hand never mind taver has said the same as your kantor i expect my point is that we are adults and although the companions have certain abilities and information that we their heralds may notwell the reverse is true as well youve got a mind of your own and experience that your companion doesnt have and i presume sound judgment dont be afraid to use them and if you feel strongly about something be prepared to insist you be heard the companions dont know everything as taver pointed out to a few of them the other night they arent infallible they can make mistakes and advice can go both ways herald and companion are meant to be partners not superior and servant in the beginning for most trainees exactly cause they are younglings that isnt always the case dethor put in sometimes chosen and companion are the same age and learn together but sometimes ones full grown while the others still a child or just a little older but in your case youre both adults and you start out with a partnership from the beginning talamir nodded emphatically we each give and we each take and what we do should be the result of cooperation not dictation dont forget that i shall not alberich replied but for the moment kantor it is who knows this land and people not i true enough talamir hefted his tankard and looked at dethor who poured him and without his asking alberich as well another round the beer foamed up leaving a pleasantly bitter aroma in the air dethor and talamir exchanged another pregnant glance alberichs neck prickled something was still in the air talamir was not here only because of the rumors coming out of karse alberich im here for more than one reason i think that you already have some inkling of this so i am going to put it in plain language talamir continued rubbing his thumb along the side of the tankard as a fighting commander i suspect that you have more than once had to do what was expedient rather than what was ideal alberich suggested an idealist i never was liar kantor objected mildly who was it agonizing over the fate of the border villages just now who is it that values honor above everything else hush he flexed his shoulder muscles they felt tense something was coming he was just beginning to make out the shape of it and he wasnt certain he was going to like it you have a thought more than one actually i havewe havea job that needs doing its something i used to do before i got too crippled up dethor said with just a hint of regret bitterness that he was no longer what he had been i dont know that youd have the stomach for itbut ive got to tell you alberich for all your skill youre the last person id have looked to for this except for one thing taver trusts you he thinks you can do this so talamir says taver said to ask you talamir added and sighed his brow furrowed with concern and uncertainty taver might have made a suggestion but talamir is not completely certain how good an idea it is kantor put it well that was clear enough talamir cleared his throat awkwardly you saw the lord marshals manyou know that there are such things asagents well we heralds have them as welland we need another he nodded warily but might have prevaricated except that in that unguarded instant kantor simply edged into his mind and showed him what it was that dethor and talamir wanted him to do agent was too small a word to encompass the task in fact alberich was more uniquely suited to the job than even dethor had been because of his foreign origin there were places where dethor would always stand outbecause dethor was noblyborn for all that he pretended he was common what youd been born and bred to was difficult to hide especially when you were under stress but alberich was as common as clay and used to moving in the lowest of circles under stress he slipped into that world as easily as a bottomfish slipping into the muddy river bottom mostly dethor had collected informationin the court and out of it from the servants common room in the palace to the vilest alleys near exiles gate to the scented rooms where courtiers fenced with words mostlybut a time or two dethor had done more than collect intelligence and pass it on to talamir a socalled agent who was also a herald had an extraordinary degree of freedom to act as he saw fit and once dethor had used his knowledge of traps to cause a single fatal accident and he had agonized over that murder for murder it was and never mind that the man had been the hidden heart of a vile trade and no one had been or would be able to bring him to justice dethor had murdered and knew it and still agonized over it as you would as you would act if there was no other way and you would be decisive about it yes he would on both counts but although he would regret murder for he hated killing he would not allow such a thing to ride him with guilt afterward he felt his pulse throbbing in the hollow of his throat and his collar felt too tight yes he would some things had to be doneand was it better to stain innocent hands with blood or add one more stain to the sleeve of one already steeped in it the king could have agents like the lord marshal had men who would take their orders and carry them out and leave the question of whether the orders were morally justified to someone else the king did not want that he wanted a herald he wanted someone who did not simply take orders he wanted someone who would thinkweighand act and agonize over it afterwards perhaps because there would be that necessary question when it was all over but it had to be a particular kind of herald and such folk did not emerge from among the childrenchildren with their shining certainty of right and wrongthat came with their companions to fill the rooms of the collegium every year he would not besmirch those pure hearts would not twist them into something that they were not it took a herald like dethor like alberich who was chosen as an adult fullgrown who knew about moral ambiguities and difficult choices like dethorwho had himself been one of the lord marshals agents before he was chosen like dethors master the weaponsmaster before him who had grown up a child of poverty seen the evils of the world very young wiser than his years though his parents had sheltered him from what they could no such man or woman though perhaps it would have been harder for a woman had come to dethor and talamir until now and they were not altogether certain that alberich was the right material for this task but he was what they had and they were in terrible need of some man for the job talamir was altogether too recognizable and too desperately needed to have the time for such covert walkings and as for dethor who could barely hobble to the collegium for a council meeting or a meal now and againwell all this poured into his mind as the other two sat quietly waiting for him to assimilate it all did they know what kantor was showing him of course they know it is our way i can show you in moments what would take them days to explain ah expedience so the companions knew it too somehow that made him feel more akin to kantor not less he took a deep breath and regarded both of them with somber eyes it is much of me that you ask he said slowly it is surprised i am when i have here beenhow long conscious or unconscious dethor retorted and shrugged youve been a real part of things for maybe a fortnight and i would never in a hundred thousand years think to trust you with thisexcept for taver why taver he asked kantor silently why if companions are as fallible as any other because taver can make mistakes but never that kind of mistake never ever a mistake in judging a persons character his heart and soul came the replyand then he got the sensation that kantor was conferring with someone else talamir and dethor watched him closely weighing his least expression just as kantor added come outside if you trust me there is something more you need to have that taver wishes to share with you and not just for making this decision there were so many overtones to that deceptively simple statement that it was alberichs turn to start with surprise there was more than a hint that this was something as important as anything that anyone had ever told him in all of his lifesomething lifeshatteringly important and a subtle shading that this was something taver had never shared with any other herald not even talamir not even talamir suddenly he had to know what this thing was rude i do not wish to be he said abruptly but think on thiswith no eyes on mei must for a little he stood up even as he said this and the other two heralds watched him measuringly but with a leavening of understanding you dont have to give us an answer right away talamir said as if making up his own mind about it but if you would consider it tedrelsand now this alberich shook his head i must think alone but consider it with all seriousness i will andi will answer you soon he did not define soon the other two remained in their seats as he stalked off head swirling dizzily with a dozen contradictory thoughts he wanted to go back to karse the very notion of the tedrels being near there made his skin crawl he wanted to hide here and never hear of karse again he didnt want this new job that talamir and dethor had suggested and yet if he didnt take it the tasks would be done but by men who left their thinking and their morality in the hands of others and merely followed orders and never cared what the repercussions would be never wondered if they had done the right thing never thought at all the bare idea was repugnant and he wanted to see just what this secret that the companion taver held could be and how could it possibly possibly have any relevance to him taver was waiting outside just out of sight of the windows of dethors sitting room with kantor beside him the sun was setting and the air lay thick and sweet and still among the trees around the sallebut there was a hint of the bitterness of dying leaves in the sweetness and the poignant suggestion of autumn coming soon soon thank you for coming taver said gravely directly into alberichs mind startling him tavers mindvoice was distinctive rich and deep with a little breath of echo to it there was a certainty and a stillness to it as if taver was a great tree with his head in the clouds and his roots reaching down to the bedrock and powerful without ever making alberich feel the power as anything other than potential you are welcome alberich replied awkwardly pulse hammering in his throat feeling as if he was the one being granted the favor this was strange this was very strange perhaps the strangest thing that had happened to him since he had arrived here that odd thing that they called his gift fluttered in the back of his soul with something that was notquitewarning i thinki hopethat what i have to show you will make many things clearer for you taver said with infinite gentleness please come and place one hand upon my neck and look into my eyes puzzled alberich did as he was told he touched the electric softness of tavers necklooked into living blue and paradise engulfed him as the heavens opened up and spilled out glory and when he came to himself again he was lying on the grass staring at the hooves of the two companionssilver hooves why didnt i notice that beforewith a mind so full it felt as if it couldnt possibly fit in the narrow confines of his head mortal men should not look into heaven if they do they should not be surprised when all they can remember is that they were there for one brief radiant moment he certainly was not but that moment had given him something he had needed and had not known he needed until the need was not there anymore he sat up slowly and felt the back of his skull gingerly but the lump he expected to encounter and the headache he anticipated were not there i took your body and caused you to lie down rather than fall down alberich taver said as kantor whuffed at his ear i knew what would happen and it was no thought of mine that you take hurt from it alberich stared at the companionwho was more so much more than he appeared that it made him dizzy even to nibble at the edges of the thought youve never done this to talamir talamir never required it he is of valdemar blood and bone youwere floundering drowning without a foundation i think you were not even aware of it except that you sought for it desperately without knowing what you sought for have i given you what you needed he had been looking and yes desperatelytaver was right he thought that hed been thinking but hed really been cluttering up his head with the minutiae of his new life here so that he didnt have to think about anything deeper but if it came to that hed been looking for that foundation all his life hed tried to make his honor into a place to stand but honor needed something to be based in ah there was contentment in that thought good good oh this was so much more than good he had been drowning with no land in sight yet suddenly taver had put firm ground beneath his feet uncertainty that had been with him for so long it had become an uneasy part of him had been dispelled popped like a bubble exploded like the inflated bladder that it was the monster in the closet was gone and something so much better had taken its place taver nodded his graceful head alberich will you trust me again alberich blinked at such nonsense trust him trust him trust to so pure a spirita being so near to the divine that he could scarcely believe there was no glow of holiness about him trust a being that he should by all rights be worshiping taver shook his head and mane and whickered a laugh oh come now alberich i am not so much as all thata servant only nothing more a servant as much a servant asas the firecat of legend he whispered hardly daring to speak as the guardian of the gates of paradise exactly so no more than that taver bent to touch a softand very very material noseto alberichs ear come standput your hand to kantors neck and look into his eyes as you did mine and this time open your heart to him as you have not yet done give up your walls alberich of karse take them down and let him inside he could fight the command of one of vkandis priestshe could no more stand against the same command as given by taver than he could have fought a whirlwind he did as he was told he looked deeply into those sapphire eyes and opened his heart and kantor stepped gracefully into it and filled it and until that moment he had no notion how empty it had been nor how lonely he had been and as all of the knowledge and understanding and revelations that had come to him in the past few moments settled into place like doves coming to rest on their proper perches for the night he knew truly and completely that there was something above them all call it vkandis sunlord or any other name he could no more understand that something than a flea could understand a manbut it was there he would continue to have other doubts other fears but that one was gone and there was something else much nearer and homelier that would also be with him as a certainty as rocksolid as the earth beneath him and undoubted as the sky above no matter what happened in the next moment or moon or year or lifetimehe and kantor would never be alone or lonely again chosen he whispered and buried his face in kantors mane chosen kantor replied with all the love that great heart could hold and it wasoh yesit was more so much more than enough part two the tedrel wars alberich heard a sound that once would have prompted curiosity and now only brought a dull aching despair wagons were coming up the road to the palace gates enough of them that the rumbling noise was audible even from the practice ground outside the salle he knew what that meant these days there were no more fetes and celebrations at the court that needed fancy foods wines and decorations the burdens these wagons bore were grimmer by far more grievously wounded folk soldiers and civilians alike coming from the battlefields to the south where the forces of karse grappled with those of valdemar people too badly hurt for their own healers to tend who had been sent here in hopes that the masters at healers collegium could make them wholeor at least mend as much as could be mended all the fault of the tedrels the tedrels who had been set against valdemar after all it had been no rumor that karse was hiring them and once the lands lost to the menmellith province of rethwellan were retaken to be used as the tedrel base it had been valdemars turn to face them face karsite troops and karsite sunpriests backing the most ruthless mercenaries this world had ever seen all of valdemarexcept himselfwas of a single heart and mind in this situation everything must be done to defeat karse and had the enemy been anyone other than karse no doubt he would be feeling the same but it was karse and he was torn heart and soul ripped in half between honor and desire he wanted to go to the front lines himself to put his considerable skill and knowledge to serve valdemar but there was a chance if he did he would be fighting and killing his own people and he wouldnt know it until it was too late the tedrels had no livery except among their own blood it could be anyone in the front lines he would not have cared if only it had been the sunpriests and the generals that served them that he slaughtered but it wouldnt be would it they would be safe in the rear or far far away and he could not depend on anything except that it would not be only tedrels he helped to kill no mixed in among the tedrels and certainly serving them in their camps would be ordinary people simple people who had no quarrel with valdemar and would have been happy if they had been left in peace his people the ones he had pledged himself to serve and besides even if he found a way to help without facing his own folk across the edge of a sword he wouldnt be allowed to go if he set foot outside of haven there were powerful people who would be certain that he was doing so to betray valdemar and having deserted karse how could he blame them for that assumption when a man turned his coat once it took no great stretch of the imagination to think he might do so again whenever his mind wasnt otherwise occupied it was thoughts like these that came flooding in and with them a tide of guilt and depression people who had become his friends his brothers and sisters were going south into dangerand here he was safe in the sunshine of high summer in haven he was glad that at least he had a task something he could do honorably now he knew only too well some of the pain that aksel must have felt when he remained training the cadets while his trained cadets went off to do the fighting and he knew the agony of being torn between desiring the best for his land and knowing he could not support what the leaders of his land had joined hands with aksel himself must be feeling that same agony for aksel had given valdemars spies some of the information that warned them that the rumors of the tedrels hiring was true it must have been by vkandis will surely for the information had come well before the first attack on the border of valdemar with enough time to prepare for that attack and those that followed these were not battles these were warswhere the tedrels moved into land opposite the border fortified it then launched campaign after scorchedearth campaign from spring through autumn and then vanished only to pick and fortify a new spot during the winter from which to pillage a new territory each time they did this they effectively halted all farming all commerce in that area decimating it and leaving it barren and trying to recover it was a diabolical plan and there was nothing that valdemar could do to thwart it without crossing the border into karse themselves which sendar wisely would not allow and damnall use my foresight is against them the magic that the heralds called gifts and that karse called witchpowers alberich found less useful than the exaggerated tales had led him to expect oh he had mindspeech and very powerful but it was of use only with other heralds with mindspeech and with companionsand in setting the truth spell which he seldom used he probably could reach across the length or breadth of the country with it but he never left the city of haven he was never allowed to leave and he had foresight that ability to glimpse what was to comebut it didnt stretch ahead more than a mark or two it was a gift that might be invaluable on a battlefield except that he wasnt allowed near the battlefields of course it was also an erratic gift which manifested irregularly and unpredictably certainly not one he controlled certainly nothing he could use from here to help in the tedrel wars it seemed to work only in cases where something he could do immediately would change what was to come the tedrel wars everyone called these seasonal blights by that name now little wars leeching wars stretching now into the fourth year every spring a new little war more deaths more freshfaced youngsters going out to face the foe and alberich wonderingas surely dethor wonderedhad he trained them well enough prepared them well enough could he could anyone it wasnt only heralds he trained it was young guard officers those healers that would accept training in the use of weapons and even some of the highborn youths who volunteered out of a sense of duty and with dreams of glory in their hearts he trained them and he sent them out and he never knew if any of them would return valdemar bled from a wound that was not allowed to heal that weakened her steadily alberich knew this knew that when the tedrel commanders judged the land weakened sufficiently they would turn a little war into an allout campaign and there was nothing he could do about it if it hadnt been for kantor he would never be able to sleep at nightbut kantor had his own ideas about what was good for his chosen and when alberich was prepared to spend another sleepless night staring at the ceiling his gut in a knot and his head throbbing he would sense kantor moving into his mind like a storm front and then well then the next time he saw the ceiling it would be morning last night had been one of those nights leaving him singularly irritable and not at all inclined to be charitable toward any of his pupils charity couldwouldget them killed especially the one before him now alberich surveyed his latest pupil and reflected that trainee myste was at least providing one thing for him a distraction from grief although she was providing a little grief of her own of a different sort the middleaged woman looked right back at him her hazel eyes unnaturally large behind the thick glass lenses she wore held to her face by a frame of wood with leather straps that buckled behind her head flattening already straight brown hair she had a set that she normally wore that had lighter frames with sidepieces of wire that hooked over her ears but those kept flying off during any sort of exertion this had been the best they could do for weapons practice and it wasnt very good her peripheral vision was poor enough and the frames of the lenses made it worse and they were a handicap in another way the first thing that an attacker would do would be to try to smash them but she was virtually blind without them so what could he do her shortsightedness was just the first in a string of handicaps that made her woefully unsuited to be a herald he thought she looked particularly aggrieved this afternoon but it was difficult to tell what her expression was on the other side of that woodandglass mask physically she was utterly unprepossessing and looked like what she had been before shed been chosen a sedentary scribe and clerk he had no idea why she of all people had been chosen at a time when fighting heralds were what was needed not clerks and how he was going to turn her into a fighter he had no clue he despaired shewell he didnt know for certain how she felt frustrated surely at the least she was the single clumsiest trainee he had ever attempted to teach bar none he didnt think this was on purpose though for even though she clearly didnt want to be here she did try until she was black and blue even if shed come here as a child shed have been clumsy he suspected but this business of learning weaponcraft late in life a task to which she was utterly unsuited must seem utter madness to her he didnt blame her for being irritated and unhappy what was the point of putting her in this position anyway she couldnt see without those lenses she would lose them in a fight and then she would be blind and how was he supposed to train her to overcome that though there were tales of blind warriors with preternatural abilities in both karse and valdemar those had all been about men and women who had been trained since early childhood in their craft who brought skilled bodies and the finely honed senses of hearing and smell and touch to bear on the problem of being unable to see not a middleaged clerk who had been bent over a desk all of her life she would arrive at the front lines only to return in days in one of those wagons if she returned at all which he doubted she sighed and shifted her weight from one foot to the other recapturing his wandering attention weaponsmaster all due respect but we both know im hopeless at this its a complete waste of your time to try and train me to use this she gestured at the sword she carriedand she spoke in karsite in point of fact if it were not for the fact that she couldnt fight couldnt shoot and couldnt defend herself shed be in whites at this very moment selfdefense was the only skill she lacked to enter her internship for shed known most of what a trainee learned long before she was ever chosen there was nothing about the history of valdemar and the heralds that she didnt know before she came here she mastered the fine points of the law with the indifferent ease of someone who had spent years copying legal briefs in fact anything having to do with the written word including no less than four languages was of no difficulty to her and she was the only person besides alberich himself who was a fluent and natural speaker of his own tongue learned directly from old father henrick before alberich had set foot on the soil of valdemar theres a saying in hardorn she continued you shouldnt attempt to teach a goat to sing it will waste your time hurt your ears and annoy the goat i can say without fear of contradiction that the goat is getting annoyed he had to smile at that she blinked behind those thick lenses and emboldened continued i keep asking this question and no one will answer me can you give me one single good reason why i have to learn weaponswork and because all trainees have to is not a good reason after all she set her chin mulishly you dont make all healers learn weaponswork so why should every single herald have to since he had just been about to say because all trainees have to he found himself stymied he opened his mouth closed it again and regarded her thoughtfully just what would you do if you were ambushed in the field he asked run she replied promptly id cut loose my saddlebags if i was mounted throw away my belt pouch if i was afoot and run chances are whoever attacked me would be after my things and any money i had not me id let them have what they wanted things can be replaced and while theyd be scrambling after loot id be getting farther away that was a good answer kantor observed and if you had to help villagers with a bandit attack he persisted she laughed give my advice and go for help she replied not that anyone would be likely to take the military advice of a dumpy bookish female whos half blind no matter what uniform she was wearing but riding aleirian im as fast as any herald faster than any other messenger and once im within mindspeech range of any other herald i can relay my information another good answer shes full of them isnt she shes full of something he sighed she wasnt intimidated by him not in the least difficult creature that she was she didnt care that he was alberich of karse only half trusted even by the heralds i know all about you from henrick and from geri as well of course shed said on meeting him meaning gerichen onceacolyte now priest geri whod become as much of a confidant as alberich ever made of anyone simple sentences but the way shed said them had left him wondering just what it was that theyd told her and later he wondered what and how much she had written down for she seemed to be always writing everything down in little notebooks she always had one with her when she wasnt writing things she stared in a way that made him feel she was memorizing everything so that she could write it down later so how are you going to answer her kantor prompted she has a good point youre never going to make her into any kind of a fighter you were just thinking that the first thing that anyone seeing her would go for is those lenses and then what then shed be blind of course and utterly helpless no she was right very right the best thing she could ever do if attacked would be to run away could running be the answer then it should never be said that herald alberich refused to find a better way when one existed kantor said besides if she cant fight they wont send her to the front lines theyll use her to replace a herald who can fight and send him instead put that away he said abruptly you are right i would be no kind of weaponsmaster if i could not match the weapon to the student not the student to the weapon and escape might be the answer however unlikely that weapon might be come into the salle into the sitting room and we will discuss this he didnt miss her smile of triumph not that it mattered she wasnt going to get off as easily as she thought there might not be fighting practice but she was going to find herself training until she was in far better physical shape than shed ever been in her life there would be extra riding classes for one thing if her companion was going to be running she had better be in shape to stick with him no matter what he had to do to get away and if she was going to count on being able to run away alberich was going to make her into a competitive foot racer whether she liked it or not some of that clumsiness at least can be trained away she followed him into his living quarters dethor wasnt there at the moment one of the healers was trying a new treatment for his swollen joints a course of bee venom for beekeepers swore that the stings of their charges kept the ailment away from them by now dethors bones were painful enough that he was more than willing to tolerate even the stings of angry bees in hopes of getting some relief as a reward for his cooperation hed get a massage with hot stones and a treatment for his hands of hot sand afterward something that did give him consistent relief even if it was only temporary myste took one of the chairs in front of the window alberich sat opposite her we need to think he told her we need to find a way to make the things you can do into weapons running for instance he pondered that for a while ill trade you saying for sayingin the hills in karse theres a proverb the hound that chases two hares catches neither if you are going to runwe need to contrive a way that you can create more than one thing for your pursuers to go after dropping my packs she began but what if there is something in your packs that youve been entrusted with he countered what if its in the winter with no waystations near if you drop your packs you wont have what you need to survive it wont do you much good to escape from bandits only to freeze to death in a blizzard he brooded over the idea for a moment then the answer came to him i think we should add a bit of extra equipment specifically for youpacks and belt pouches that youre meant to throw away what she asked stuffed with straw or the like he shook his head no not that actually if you drop worthless decoys it wont be long before bandits and brigands all know that the packs you drop are worthless and theyll ignore them and go for you again no that hare wont runthere will be just enough in the decoys to satisfy an ambusher without making it look as if youre an especially juicy target and to make certain that attackers chase the packs and not you and the same for belt pouches from now on youll be carrying at least two small extras both full of coppers and if someone attacks you youll throw them in opposite directions one to either side of your line of flight she was happy enough about the planning but visibly unhappy when he brought her back outside and put her in front of the obstacle course run the course then run it again he told her mercilessly and keep running it until i tell you to stop running away isnt going to do you any good if you cant actually run any better than dethor on a bad day and he left her to it with a faint feeling of havingfor oncegotten the better of her irritating woman not that he didnt like her she not only had the advantage of being one of the few people he could converse easily with in his own tongue she was an interesting and lively conversationalist and besides not being afraid of him or intimidated by him he got the feeling that she respected him in a way that was quite flattering when she wasnt trying to get the better of him why was it that she entered every conversation with the goal of somehow trying to win well she could just work some of that out over the hurdles meanwhile he had a class of young archers to put through their paces when he told dethor of his solution to the problem of myste over dinner the weaponsmaster chuckled good solution dethor replied a very good solution but i hope it isnt one we need to use id much rather that the heraldic circle can find a position for her that makes the best use of her talents here in the city whatever those talents are at the moment alberich replied with just a tinge of sourness having had to find reasons why every single obstacle in the course was one she needed to learn to negotiate arguing and writing little enough of anything else have i seen heh ive seen those little notebooks of hers dethor blinked now why didnt i think of this before heraldchronicler of course elcarths doing it now but we want him for dean of the collegium and we need to start training him in that his voice faded off as he got that faraway look in his eyes that meant he was thinking and probably mindspeaking with his companion alberich now knew that look very very well and dethor was right of course with all of his own reading of the chronicles he could see how being the heraldchronicler would easily be a fulltime job it wasnt just the doings of the heralds that the chronicler covered it was everything anything that had any impact on any part of the kingdom larger than a small village what do you think he asked kantor that its probably the reason she was chosen kantor replied she gets onto a story like a ratterrier and wont let go of it until shes shaken it free of all the facts annoying little dogs ratterriers all yap and idiotic courageor was that stubbornness still come to think of it that described myste rather well or perhaps she was more like a cat one of those mouthy ones that wouldnt stop caterwauling came when you didnt want them and wouldnt come when you did were in nasty times someone has to be willing to put down nasty facts without editing them kantor continued and you like cats you like ratterriers too he ignored that last hmm nasty facts like my little exercise tonight he replied it ought to be written down somewhere kantor countered maybe not for common consumption but if someone doesnt record everything no matter how unflattering to the heralds it is the next generation is going to get the idea that were all plaster saints then when someone has to do something underhanded far a good reason nobody will be willing to do it he sighed there was that and plenty of chroniclers in the past had created auxiliary chronicles that not everyone was allowed to read chronicles that recorded mistakes blunders errors in judgment and jobs undertaken that were somewhat less than the letter of the law all in unflinching detail not the sort of thing one gave the children of course but these chronicles and not just the standard texts were what alberich was studying as history just now he was in the middle of the very brief chronicle of lavan firestorm some of the soulbaring on the part of herald pol and king theran was enough to make the heart ache he could relate all too easily to the litany of should haves and could haves well if trainee mystewho was certainly being allowed to read and study the unexpurgated versions of the chronicleswas able to combine the qualities of detachment and toughmindedness that the job required especially now well done to her elcarth probably wasnt he was too tenderhearted to be unflattering to people he liked even when it wasnt possible to get to the truth without being unflattering mind only a handful of people would know that for certain within mystes or elcarths lifetime because the chronicles werent written for the present generations they were written for the future and very few heralds other than the king and the kings own were allowed to see what their current chronicler wrote and then it was in terms of editing by similarly toughminded heralds and only to ensure accuracy as he knew very well the chronicles could be extremely caustic at times and no one really wanted to see himself his presumed or even actual motivations and his failures stripped bare and put down in uncompromising writing in his opinion a young person didnt have the perspective nor the experience to write what needed to be written so there again myste was fully qualified appointing her as chronicler second would solve the problem of what to do with her very neatly indeed dethor abruptly came back to himself i believe that will work he said as if alberich had been privy to whatever thoughts were going on in his mind youre going out in the city tonight no other choice have i alberich replied with a shrug much result i do not expect but sow silver i must a harvest of villainy to reap in this at least he was able to aid valdemar with a clear conscience in disguise one of half a dozen personae he had concocted and established he prowled the lesssavory quarters of haven looking for trouble trouble came in various guises but money usually lured it out of hiding the money wasnt bribesalberich was more subtle than that sometimes he posed as someone looking for a particular sort of creature to hire sometimes as a bullyboy looking for work himself sometimes he bought information and sometimes sold it in all cases there was nothing to connect the lessthanhonest characters he portrayed in the seedy drinking houses and alleyways with herald alberich the weaponsmasters second there was some benefit in having a scarred and scowling countenance that looked the very acme of villainy if there wasnt a woman born whod give him a second look no one looked askance at him in a lowclass bar either and fortunately there were enough foreigners in haven that his accent caused only a little comment and no one recognized it as karsite most accepted his story that he came from ruvan brendan or jkatha all three were so far away he might just as well have told the inquisitive that he was from the moon virtually anything he claimed would be believed the only people who might know better would be true guild mercenaries and so far hed never seen one of those in haven they werent needed here valdemar fielded its own standing army of fulltime soldiers called the guard and always had even guild mercenaries didnt bother to go where there was no need of them well you be careful out there tonight dethor said putting down his empty tankard alberich automatically refilled it for him from the pitcher on the table between them and raised an eyebrow dethor wasnt known for having the gift of foresight but one never knew a reason for the warning you have he asked carefully but dethor only shook his head not really its just that its been quiet and its usually quiet just before theres a lot of trouble and trouble then comes in threes alberich agreed gloomily and a full moon there is tonight i shall walk carefully full moon dethor groaned youre going to get into a brawl tonight arent you alberich felt his muscles tighten with automatic anticipation he suppressed his reaction as much as he could dethor was very good at reading body language probably alberich shrugged with an indifference he didnt entirely feel a bar fight would at least give him something on which to take out his frustration he always slept better after being able to pound some villains face into the floor the wretches that tried to pick on him were at least as bad as he pretended to be the only reason they were at the tavern instead of jail was that they hadnt been caught at anything lately and they well deserved whatever punishment vkandis decreed they meet at the hands of his transplanted worshiper oh very nice reasoning kantor said with more than a touch of sarcasm try not to give the healers any more work will you dethor requested with resignation they had a few words for me the last time you needed patching up and since i couldnt tell them why youd gotten cut up they assumed id been working you and kimel with live steel and youd gotten the worst of it so of course it was my fault that i can promise alberich replied gathering up all the supper dishes and placing them in the empty basket for that the wretches whose bones i break seeking a healer would not be ever too fearful would they be that in seeking healing it would be justice they found with a salute to dethor he left the rest unsaid and headed for the door he couldnt help it there were frustrations in him that were crying out for release he wouldnt look for a fight but if one came to him he sensed kantors sigh he left the basket just outside the door to their quarters for a servant to collect and went out into the flooding light of the full moon to saddle kantor his companion was waiting for him at the special stable only the companions used just inside the door was the tack room but kantors gear was all stowed on racks near his stall just as it was for every companion who resided primarily at the collegium on a warm summer night like this one all the halfdoors on the stalls were open to the night air and with all of the moonlight pouring in the lanterns werent needed at all they were quite alone in the stable which suited alberichs mood perfectly youve told taver and talamir were going out tonight he asked kantor throwing only the plainest and most basic of saddle pads and blankets over kantors back of course kantor looked back over his shoulder as alberich tightened the girth were going out the private entrance of course alberich swung up into the saddle and they made their way across the field kantors hooves made no sound at all on the soft grass they moved across the silver expanse like a pair of spirits gliding over the surface of a silent sea there was a little gate at the far end of the wall around companions field that would have been a dreadful security hole had it not been closed by three doorsthe final one of iron cunningly cast to look exactly like the rustybrown stone that the wall itself was made of only talamir sendar and dethor had held the keys to those doors and dethor had given his to alberich furthermore the iron one was so heavy that it required a companions strength to haul it open from the outside and it wasnt likely that anyone with a horse or a mule was going to be able to get along the outer wall of the palace without a challenge and then a wouldbe intruder would have to get his mount to push instead of pull not too likely that it was an amazingly clever door that actually could swing in an entire onehundredeightydegree arcbut there was a springloaded stop on it that worked as a fairly high doorsill to keep it from swinging outward a stop that could only be dropped down level to the ground from the inside so kantor could push it to swing out when they were on the inside but no one could pull it out from the outside locking the door released it again and as alberich turned his key in that final lock he heard it smack up into place on its spring there was no one on the road but several times he looked up to see one of the guards keeping watch on the wall so well hidden in the shadows that only he who knew every hiding place along it could have spotted them he nodded to them and got a little hand signal in recognition the palace guard at least now knew and trusted him of course hed trained a good many of them and bouted regularly with all of them you learned a lot about a man sparring with him once kimel had accepted him the rest had started coming around he wasnt in whites tonightand that would have made him instantly recognizable to the guards no matter what he could have whites if he wanted them but he didnt want them hed become accustomed to those dark gray leathers they suited him suited his nature suited his wish to be something less conspicuous as if you could be anything other than conspicuous kantor scoffed when im with you perhaps not he acknowledged you are rather conspicuous all by yourself by alleys and shortcuts that only he knew he and kantor slipped quietly among the mansions of the highborn through the townhouses of the wealthy and suddenly came out on a side street in a neighborhood of inns and taverns they were only paces away from the companions bell a respectable inn that was their intermediate goal alberich felt that tightening of his muscles again and a quickening of his pulse it was time to go to work work that he understood work that he and only he could do the bell had several distinct advantages for what he was about to do firstly it was a place often frequented by heralds so the sight of a companion in a loosebox would not go remarked nor would the sight of alberich entering the stableyard second the heralds had a private taproom available to themheralds could and did mingle with the regular customers but no one would think twice about alberich not appearing among them for plenty of heralds who came here kept to the private room ah but then there was the third reason he dismounted and kantor followed him into the stable there were two other companions there already who whickered a welcome to both of them excellent kantor said i shall have reinforcementsif you need them alberich snorted and left kantor to make himself at home in a third loosebox as he approached the far wall and the third reason for his being here the third reason for his being here and no other place was that the bell had a locked room at the back of the stable that contained a trunk and had a second locked door that let out onto an alley a very dark alley and one that somehow never had patrols of constables or city guard at night he unlocked the door he paused just long enough to light a spill at the lantern beside the door then locked himself inside there was a second lantern there which he lit in that trunk had been dethors disguises now it held alberichs someone elsealberich thought it was probably the innkeeper himselfhad a key to that room for any clothing he left atop the trunk was taken away and laundered and placed back inside it some disguises of course shouldnt be cleanedthe stains and yes the odor lent verisimilitude to his persona those he put back in the trunk himself wrapped in a waxed canvas bag to keep from stinking up the rest of his gear tonight however it was about time for aarak benshane a common enough thug with a reputation for not asking too many questions of prospective employers to put in an appearance at the blue boar aarak was not too noisome a fellow alberich could get away with cleanliness tonight alberich opened the trunk and selected his disguise with care leather trews battered boots and hat scarred black leather jerkin strong enough to turn most blades and a shirt of no particular color that was a bit frayed about the cuffs and collar over these he slung a belt holding two knives but no sword aarak did most of his work with his fists that should suit you considering the mood youre in kantor was not being ironic nor sarcastic this time as a matter of fact alberich replied it does by day the tavern that was his goal the boar was a quiet enough tavern serving manual laborers at the nearby warehouses at night however it took on a rougher clientele some of the laborers returned to drink away their earnings and they were joined by others for whom the warehouses were of lessthanlegitimate interest aarak fit right in there he might hire himself out as a day laborer if he was inclined to do manual labor or forced into it but he would far rather serve as the lookout for thugs who planned a little latenight looting alberich let himself out into the alley it was dark back there shadowed on both sides by tall buildings but he knew his way around haven even in pitchy black he kept to the alleys for the most part only crossing streets when he had to and at length found himself in the warehouse area where the boar stood there was a lot of coming and going around a warehouse and no one asked what was being stored there very often and of course warehouses were full of things that were already packed for transportation what could be more attractive and easier for a bold gang of thieves alberich had been recruited by such gangs once or twice though never out of the blue boar and never as aarak he had hopes though and he nursed his thin sour beer at a table here several times a moon waiting to see if his patient fishing would catch him another gang of thieves he opened the door quietly it wasnt a good idea to make any kind of an entrance into the boar there were always people there who would take that sort of hubris amiss flash of bluea tangle of thrashing bodies on the floor he paused just inside the door and caught himself damn come on dont show anything or youre dead he shoved on inside the door on strength of will until his vision cleared and he could pretend that he hadnt just had a flash of foresight the regular servers knew him by now or at least they knew aaraks distinctive hat he caught the eye of one nodded at a vacant table off to one side of the room and took his seat there within a reasonable length of time the server appeared with a jack of beer despite kantors needling hed had a few hopes that someone might try to recruit him tonighta full moon now meant moondark in a fortnight and moondark meant the possibility of work but the truth was from the moment hed crossed the threshold he knew that dethor had been right about a tavern brawl in the offing even if he hadnt gotten that briefvery briefglimpse of a tumble of fighting bodies on the floor of the place from his foresight hed have known it there was something in the air tonight something wild and edgy something that made kantor back in his stall prick up his ears and ask wordlessly and in all seriousness this time if alberich thought hed need any help alberich never actually got a chance to reply he was just starting on the first swallow of his beer when the fight erupted over a card cheat three tables down the cheater had friends and the friends waded in and alberich saw flash of blue the fight was only a pretext to rob the only person here with any real cash that was the owner of the blue boar himself three people swarming the bar as combat seemed to thrust them toward it by accident he came to himself long enough to dodge out of the way of a tumbling body and shoved his hand into a special belt pouch he always wore as aarak it held weighted knuckle guards his preferred weapon for brawling he didnt like using blades in a brawlhe was there to immobilize people not kill them no point in killing them when if they were what he really wanted he wanted them alive to question another flash of blue freezing him for a moment the three thieveshe assumed that was what they werewaited for the fight to reach the bar and then threw themselves over it the surprised tavern owner trying to get out of the way as they all three landed atop him there were short heavy clubs in their hands they clubbed the tavernkeeper senseless alberich shook his head to free it of the vision as shouts and cries of pain marked the center of the brawl a drunk stinking of beer blundered into him and made a wild swing at him and that was just enough alberich sprang into motion like a mastiff held leashed and suddenly released a savage grin with nothing of joy in it split his face he ducked under the others swing and gutpunched the drunk with his laden fist stepping out of the way and shoving him to one side to topple him before he spewed the contents of his stomach all over everything in front of him flash of blue and he saw the three thieves vault over the bar and make off with the cash box while a larger fight still engaged the bouncers and everyone else they could draw in that was it that was all his foresight showed him but it was enough when his eyes cleared for the third time he saw the three men beginning to make their way towards the bar ha another drunk approached got one look at his face and flinched away alberich shoved him aside straightarmed another shouldered into a third and when the three wouldbe robbers reached their goal he was already there waiting they only saw one more temporary obstacle in their path and moved to clear it they werent very good with their leadweighted clubs which was probably why the clubs were weighted in the first place and they hadnt practiced fighting as a team either he managed to get the first two to tangle each other up for a moment by grabbing the first and shoving him bodily into the arms of the second they werent expecting anyone to reach for them while the first two were shouting and tripping over each other he stepped in toward the third came in low and laid out his target with a brassladen right to the point of the chin his fist connected solidly with a satisfying impact that snapped the fellows head back and sent him sailing across the floor to land over a table it didnt break of course the tavernkeeper didnt want the expense of replacing furniture every moon the boars tables and chairs would stand up to a charging bull and the bull would come away second best now he felt it that heady pleasurewhich would be a guilty one later when he came to think about itthat rush of energy and unholy glee that only came during a fight fightingdrunk that was what dethor called it for it wasnt the berserk rage that wiped out thought and sense on the contrary it made him sharper and he enjoyed it when he was fighting in a way that would make him feel a bit ashamed of himself later but now it widened his manic grin and filled his veins with lightning when the first two got clear of each other he grabbed them both and shoved their heads together with a crack that echoed even over the noise of the brawl one went down the other didnt he was stunned thoughstunned just long enough alberich grabbed his shoulder and spun him around to face forward pulled back his fist and delivered a gutpunch that made the fools eyes bug out as he toppled to the floor he looked around for the trios friends the ones hed seen in his vision but they seeing that the cash snatchers were down and out and there was no reason to continue the fight any further began breaking free of their little knots of combat and scuttling away he thought about pursuing his blood was up now and he was ready to chase down half a dozen of the young thugs chosen enough youve ended the problem that will do for now kantors demand cut across the fire in his veins and chilled it he shook his head and backed up out of the way against the wall with the instigators gone the bouncers were managing to quell the remaining belligerents without any help from him he slipped his knuckle guards off his hand and back into his pouch part of him regretted that the fight was over most of him sighed with relief when the last of those still trying to fight had been tossed into the street he gave the bouncers a hand with sending the unconscious after them the three hed done for were among them but he saw no point in saying anything about what might have happened after all there was no proof he accepted a somewhat better tankard of beer as his reward for helping out and stayed only long enough to drink it before returning to kantor his glee was gone his guilt had started and besides nothing more was going to happen tonight if anyone was thinking of hiring aarak they wouldnt do it tonight the men hed downed might have friends watching who would take it amiss if someone rewarded aarak with a job the moon was down by the time alberich got to his hiding place and he had to feel carefully for the keyhole to let himself inside he discovered bruises he hadnt felt when he changed back into his gray leathers maybe you didnt but i did kantor sniffed as he mounted theyll heal he replied sending kantor back up the street toward the palace he felt as he always did after a fight weary and with emotions dulled except for a fierce and bitter satisfaction the weariness was welcome hed sleep well tonight for a change there was someone watching you from the corner kantor went on giving him a flash of something that the companion had noted through alberichs eyes i think youll be offered a job next time you go there the bitterness eased a little alberich recognized that vague glimpse it was someone hed been watching for some time now a legitimate businessman who somehow seemed to have more goods in his warehouse than hed actually purchased nownow he might find out just where those goods came from good he said aloud that is why we come there isnt it not entirely kantor retorted at least you dont alberich started to reply and thought better of it kantor was infinitely better at warring with words than he was he let his silence speak for him letting kantor come to his own conclusions eventually the ears flattened and out of the silence came i apologize and you are also right alberich acknowledged i do seek out fighting more often than necessary i could go about the same business without getting involved in altercations at all but it is what i need right here right now kantor sighed but his head nodded so be it if you need it then we will continue to seek it and i will say no more about it except to ask you to take care alberich closed his eyes for a moment perhaps someday we will no longer need to go hunting trouble for troubles own sake it was all he could offer but kantor seemed to find it enough dethor had invited talamir to his quarters tonight in a way that had been less invitation and more demand talamir was fairly certain that he wanted to discuss the current situation with his second alberich the probable subject of those discussions now officially a full herald though he kept stubbornly to those peculiar gray leathers of his was gone when talamir arrived dethor interpreted his curious look correctly not a surprise considering how well he and talamir knew each other there was a small fire in the fireplace although the weather was not yet so cool in the evenings that a fire was necessary but the weaponsmaster seemed to crave both the extra warmth and the emotional comfort of a fire more and more often of late come to that they all craved extra comfort the wars seemed both too far away and too near a feeling of dreadful tension underlaid everything no matter how trivial a frantic feeling as if whatever was being done had to be done or enjoyed or dealt with now for there was no telling what the next day or even the next candlemark might bring small comforts took on enormous importance yet one indulged in them in a spirit of guilt quite as if throwing on another log was somehow going to deprive the guard on the border of heat and light dethor had lit only two lanterns one behind each of the two hearthside chairs the fire provided the rest of the light in the room tonight the weaponsmasters second was nowhere to be seen hes out in town dethor said as talamir looked inquiringly at the third seat that alberich usually used he wont be back for a while i believe hes got something on the boil tonight hes doing good work down there talamir observed as dispassionately as he could and settled himself into the padded chair opposite dethors it was difficult to be dispassionate about dethors bland statement every time alberich had something on the boil there was usually a great deal of violence involved before it was over alberich was directly involved in that violence at least half of the time if talamir hadnt been aware of just how much he despised unnecessary force hed have suspected that the man was seeking out opportunities to thrash someone butperhaps he is and hes simply making sure that the opportunity calls for necessary violence that wouldnt be too difficult in the neighborhoods alberich had to prowl i wondered how much youd kept track of dethor said what with everything else youve got going on all of it i think talamir admitted and hes as good as you ever were in the covert work and better far better than i we are perhaps too much the gentlemen he fits in down there better than we ever could no matter how much we deluded ourselves about our acting abilities the words hung heavily in the air and talamir glanced out the window of the sitting room it was moondark and a companion ghosted into and out of sight among the trees out there a glimmer of white in the darkness theres too many bloody bastards taking advantage of the situation to make trouble or money or both dethor muttered you cut one down and two more spring up to replace him it wasnt like that when i was doing the dirty work it was never that vile down by exiles gate talamir shrugged they both knew that was true enough haven had been stripped of all but a skeleton staff of the guard constables and even private bodyguards had gone to join the army the opportunities for the criminal and unscrupulous were legion alberich and a trusted handful of constables and the palace and city guard were accomplishing more than even the council guessed none of it had anything to do with being a herald of courseother than an occasional use of the truth spell and his communication with kantor alberich never did anything that could not have been done by an ordinary constable providing of course that an ordinary constable had his knack for subterfuge and covert work which of course none of them did there was only one alberich he couldnt rid the place of crime forever but every time he removed a criminal from the streets it look a while for someone else to fill the void left behind a breathing space for the constables still at work on the street alberich had a real flare for working clandestinely something hed probably never explored back in karse talamir wondered how alberich felt about this new skill it didnt seem to match the persona of a simple military man as if alberich would ever be a simple anything it was never that vile because there were never that many opportunities talamir pointed out and what are we to do demand some sort of certification of virtue from everyone who passes the gates haul them away and question them under truth spell as to their motives i think not the best we can do is what alberichs doing and thank the gods we have him the fire flared revealing dethors troubled expression you know the mans in a real mental state dethor said leveling a long and accusatory look at his old friend talamir shifted uncomfortably but his conscience forced him to meet dethors eyes i have the feeling that hes overworking just so he can sleep at night i have the feeling that hes looking for trouble just so he can work out his frustration on a legitimate object the problem is when you start looking for trouble it starts looking for you talamir sighed deliberately looking down at the plate of fruit on the table between their chairs slowly and methodically he picked up an apple and began to peel it i know he admitted i wish there was something that i could do about it but even if we hadnt promised we would never ask him to do anything against karse the council wont allow him out of haven dethor snorted and talamir looked up from his apple with reluctance the creases and wrinkles of dethors face turned his frown into something demonic and the firelight only amplified the effect dammit talamir cant you do anything about this i know he wants to do something about the wars and i see his face every time he watches another batch of youngsters going south its tearing him up what vouch for him i have a hundred times and more talamir replied nettled that dethor would even think hed been doing less than he could for alberich then theres the little matter of what he calls his honor which hes damned touchy about dethor growled exactly so talamir agreed so what are we going to do truth hereid give both legs for a dozen alberichs all willing to go spying back there among his own people damned insular karsites strangers stand out among em like a chirra in a herd of sheep accents mannerisms what they know without even knowing that they know it he threw up his hands in frustration you just cant teach those sorts of things tell me something i dont know dethor said throwing an apple core into the fire in a gesture of exasperation just how many agents have we lost too many talamir was just glad that none of them had been heralds he had arguedsuccessfullythat the heralds were too few to risk inside the borders of karse but the fact was from the beginning he had doubted the ability of any of them to pass as karsite and when the sunpriests got their hands on heralds the results were traumatic for every herald it wasnt just the death bell tolling that sent everyone into a spate of mourning it was that everyone knew what happened to heralds that got caught in karse there was a sick fear behind the mourning and the same kind of frustration and anger that sent alberich out looking for a fight the lord marshal had been perfectly willing to send in his own people however and when he did exactly what talamir feared happened karse devoured agents as a child devours sweets they seemed to last about a moon before they were discovered certainly not much longer what happened to them after that talamir was all too aware he preferred not to dwell on it for at least all the men had been volunteers and knew precisely what awaited them if captured certainly no more than a handful had returned horrible and there didnt seem to be a great deal they could do to change that no matter how much information they gathered on karse no matter who they spoke to or how many old books they read they were not able to fool real karsites for long if at all what we need dethor said glumly is what we cant get real karsites someone whos got all the little nuances habits all the things you just cant study someone who fits someone who cant give himself away because whats secondnature to him is all based on real karsite memories but the few folk whove come over are all too frightened to go back and i cant say as i blame em the scent of burning apple sweet and bitter at the same time added a strange nuance to his words alberich wouldnt be too frightened to go if he could alberich had everything they needed in an agent if only they could use him andthe other stumbling blockif only his sense of honor would allow him to be so used it was so intensely frustrating sometimes talamir just wanted to howl with the frustration if it was bad for him it must be worse for alberich he was facing enormous pressure from those who didnt know about the covert work and saw only that he spent little time in the company of the other heralds and less doing anything that might help the war effort there was even more social pressure from those who had no idea that the council had effectively shackled alberich to haven there was a feeling from some that he had somehow betrayed the land that had taken him in the brotherhood into which he had been admitted but what could they do to change that nothing everything he was doing other than his position as dethors second was covert and had to remain so especially the work with the lord marshals agentsthough for all the candlemarks he spent with them there was little enough to show in the way of success but then the agents were only menclever men facile men but just ordinary men they couldnt be him for a day or a week or somehow pluck the deep memories that made him karsite out of his head and plant them so solidly in their own minds that they became karsite themselves which brought him back to the problem all over again if only they could make all those agents into little alberichs if only they could link those agents into alberichs head so that every time they did something wrong he would catch them and correct them and a blinding revelation hit him good gods talamir exclaimed staring unseeingly at his reflection in the window i do believe i have the solution to which problem dethor asked skeptically to the problem of how we can get effective agents into karse talamir replied holding his halfpeeled apple tightly and to the problem of alberich contributing to the war you know how mindhealers are able to get into someones head and do things with their memories extract ones we need from someone whos unconscious and all that once again he found it unnecessary to explain to his friend where he was going mindhealer you think theyd be willing to get into our karsites head and get his memories out then plant them in someone elses head dethor looked interested but skeptical theyre damn near as touchy about whats moral and whats not as he is about his honor if he agrees i can ask talamir replied i lose nothing by asking and if i already have his consent what can they object to and will those memories be real dethor continued i mean you know how faulty even trained memory can be memory isnt reliableespecially not childhood memory which doesnt matter talamir responded triumphantly not in this case what matters are the little things that make him karsite not the particulars in fact i wouldnt be at all averse to some inaccuracy even a little childish fantasy if we can make agents who arent alberich but are common karsite folk all the better dethor brooded over the idea for a while im not sure that could be done with the lord marshals men he began sounding very dubious indeed but talamir shook his head im not talking about the lord marshals men he replied if this works we can risk heralds and well have to i suspect it will only work with those whove got mindspeech ah hellfires dethor was clearly dismayed after a moment however he scratched his head and shrugged i suppose youre right and i have to think well get volunteers id be shocked if we didnt it was a depressing thought actuallyhis yearmates students teachers people he knew rushing eagerly into the worst danger it was bad enough for the lord marshal to send spies but if the karsites found heralds on their soil yet if those heralds could pass as common karsites and be able to discover and pass on what the tedrels were going to do well in advance the alternative though was not to be contemplated alberich was not the only one who thought that the tedrels were engaged in a campaign to drain valdemar until it was so weak that one tremendous push would collapse everything they dont know us very well if they think well just collapse talamir thought grimly they know us not at all taver said although talamir had not deliberately used mindspeech sounding just as grim as talamir felt but the cost of holding against them never knowing when the push is coming it didnt bear thinking about so we must know what they are about to do before they do it so that we can appear to weaken without actually doing so then we can lure them into making then final push while we are still strong that really was the only possible option sendar and the council had weighed all the others not that there were many by emptying the treasury and conscripting every ablebodied man and woman in the kingdom they might be able to mount a countercampaign there wasnt enough money in the entire kingdom to hire a force equivalent to the tedrels there is not enough money in all of karse twice over to hire the tedrels taver reminded him they are fighting for themselves not karse karse has not hired them per seor at least they offered them something more than just gold karse has merely provided them with a platform from which to launch a campaign to conquer a new homeland and the resources to support them while they do so why do the karsites hate us so much talamir asked aloud in something like despair why dethor shrugged religions at the heart of it id guess he opined but dont ask me ask alberich religion what about valdemar could possibly seem so threatening to a religion there is no one true way taver said that is what threatens the sunpriests that is what terrifies them if you offer that to people you offer them freedom and you challenge those who claim ultimate authority if you offer that you give people options the sunpriests rely on being the ultimate unchallengeable authority their lives depend on the very opposite of options their rule depends on their followers having no options and relies on blind belief and even blind obedience perhaps but how do they expect to keep their people in the dark short of building a wall around the country and guarding every exit point there was no way of keeping people from finding out what was going on outside their borders ah but a war builds that wall doesnt it taver responded you dont need stones when youve got an enemy interrupting i hope i am not alberich said from the doorway he sounded exhausted when he came into the light talamir took a good long look at him and decided that he was at least as exhausted as he sounded hmm another fight he asked the weaponsmasters second was somewhat the worse for wear he had a bandage across his forehead and another binding his forearm suggesting that hed already been to the healers bruised knuckles and other signs that hed been getting into trouble down in haven small wonder he sounded tired fruitful was all alberich said but to drink something wholesome if you please he made a face the taste of sour beer to remove from my mouth i very much please lad and get off your feet dethor said quickly and alberich limped into the room dethor tilted the kettle at the hearth and poured out a mug of mulled wine handing it to alberich who sat down and accepted it draining half of it in a single go so whatd you net us this time smugglers alberich replied of vile things inof information out he raised a weary eyebrow one leak less there is and the jail full he still looked troubled though and talamir knew why it wasnt that he hadnt done well it was just that he was concerned that there were informants who were eluding him anyone that alberich caught down in the slums of haven would not likely be sending the most sensitive information not that there was any sign that there was such a leak but they always had to assume that one could exist finding those leaks was talamirs job alberich could not function in court circles while talamir could cultivating a mildmannered and quiet demeanor saying little and all of that agreeable and sympathetic he came across as unworldly and just a bit absentminded people confided in him a great deal and generally had no idea how much they had told him nevertheless there was no doubt in talamirs mind that if saboteurs and couriers were to materialize in haven they would be living and operating in the area that alberich was responsible for elsewhere people were curious about their neighbors in effect each little quarter outside of the most impoverished areas was a kind of village where everyone knew everyone else and wanted to know what they were up to not so around exiles gate the inhabitants were utterly indifferent to the doings around them and with good reason those who were too curious often ended up onat bestthe wrong end of a beating plenty of damage can come out of exiles gate talamir assured him anything you do to stop it from traveling to our enemies is another arrow in our quiver alberich sighed it seems like not enough but he leaned back and accepted a refill and an apple which he peeled with a frown of concentration getting the entire peel off in one piece the knife made a crisp sound as it passed through the flesh if you were a maid youd be tossing that over your shoulder and looking for the letters of your husbands name in it dethor observed as alberich carefully set the long curl of peel aside alberich regarded him somberly is that so in karse such are for the children fried and dipped in honey i have told you divination a thing of witchcraft is no karsite maiden would dare such a thing for the fear of the fires once again talamir was struck by how very different the karsites were a valdemaran wouldnt think twice about tossing an apple peel reading the tea leaves wishing in a fountain and that was the essence of the problem that faced the agents sent into karse have you eaten talamir asked instead of commenting more than just that apple i mean alberich shrugged talamir took that as a negative and made up an impromptu meal for him from the remains of suppers meat and salad and some bread since alberich took it with polite thanks then absently ate it in less time than it had taken talamir to make it the kings own was certain that he must have been famished glad enough i am to be rid of such filth as were locked away alberich continued swallowing the last bite whole and absently licking his fingers only i wish it were more that i was doing in the south that was as good an opening as talamir was likely to get and he took it explaining what he had in mind he knew alberich very well now he didnt waste his breath in trying to convince the man of anything just stated his case he watched as alberichs eyes took on that curiously unfocused appearance that meant he was discussing the idea with his companion this gave talamir plenty of time to study alberich and he didnt like what he saw besides the bandaged forehead and forearmnot his sword arm which was tellingthere was a bulge beneath the sleeve covering the biceps of that same arm that suggested another bandage perhaps of a previous wound the scars left from the burns on his face were crisscrossed by others now that as talamir recalled was a favorite tactic of lowanddirty street fightingto go for the face figuring that the pain and blood that any facial cut produced would be such a distraction that it would be easier to go in for a kill not that facial scars were going to make him stand out in the neighborhoods and the company where alberich was going at night the opposite was true actually the more scars the more he would fit in beneath the scars the face was good if carved on harsh linesa long oblong with a stubborn chin high cheekbones wide brow heavy eyebrows set in a permanent scowl aquiline nose and the eyes of a goshawk fierce and wild with the barest hint of something that was not quite sane or at least it was a peculiar sort of sanity that saw deeper into dark places and could stare into the abyss without flinching perhaps it was the curious quality that alberichs eyes had of never being the same color twice in a row varying from the gray of a threatening storm through a muddy greenbrown to as they were tonight something close to black for the rest well there was no doubt that even in the company of heralds who were a fit and athletic group alberich stood out it was not that he had a perfect bodyat least not in the sculptural senseit was something else the practiced eye picked out the quality of muscle the way every movement was just enough and no more the absolute stillness at rest and the immediate response when one was called for every movement was exact it was difficult to describe but easy to see when one knew what to look for there was a fine economy in alberichs actions not a bit of energy wasted and nothing held back when it was needed all of which of course came across as predatory and threatening and probably all to the good down there in the slums so alberich said at last i will think further on this it was a disappointing reply but talamir tried not to show his disappointment there was nothing more he could add to his argument and anything else would be nothing more than pressure that alberich would probably respond poorly to seeking my bed i should be alberich continued rising and looking down at them solemnly dethors second i still am and there trainees always are they bade him good night and once he was out of the room dethor shrugged well there it is he said philosophically its up to him now and hope he can find a straight path through all our tangles talamir addedwondering if he ought to begin praying to the sunlord just for a little help and whether if he did the sunlord would take it amiss and tangle things up even further alberich lay in his bed hands tucked behind his head staring up at the ceiling there was no fire in his room but a dim light from the lanterns and torches lighting the gardens came through the curtains at his window and created soft shadows contrasting with the deeper pools of darkness among the beams he was acutely conscious of little things all of them so alien so very different to the things he found ordinary the crisp herbal scent of the sheets not karsite sairel but valdemaran lavender the shape of the room long and narrow rather than square the flavors lingering on his tongue the cadence of conversation in the next room all these things speaking eloquently of another place than the one he called home and his mind buzzed with activity though his body was still this was a pretty little quagmire that had been set at his feet granted he had been helping the lord marshals men but hed done so knowing full welland having warned them all as wellthat no one not born in karse or at least raised there from early childhood could ever pass as karsite now he was punished for that for that had been sophistry a way of appeasing both sides of his conscience without having to compromise either and he had known it now he was caught and there could be no evasion either he could aid valdemar against karse or by withholding his aid help karse instead knowing he was handicapping valdemar such a choice and at the moment he could see no way of acting or not acting that would not cause harm violate his pledged word or effectively cripple the abilities of those who had succored and adopted him to defend themselves betray his home or those who had saved him talk to me chosen kantor demanded youve closed yourself off to me trust me as i trust you let me hear your thoughts you wont like them he replied mordantly perhaps not kantor countered but at least you will be talking to me about it perhaps we can find answers if we both look for them he took a moment to frame his thoughts if i do what talamir asks of me i go against my oaths and it is of no use at all to claim that the spies will work only against the tedrels when my people are working handinglove with them act against the tedrels and karsites will bleed little doubt kantor agreed as he stared at the shadowy ceiling listening to the indistinct murmur of voices in the next room but how are you being true to your oaths if you withhold help that could shorten this fight you know that your sunpriests will not hesitate to add karsite troops to the tedrels in order to defeat valdemar and the longer the wars go on the more karsites will die i have no control over what the priests do or do not do he said stubbornly and i do not know not for certain that they will order my people into this affray what they do is in their own hands and the will of vkandis i can only control my own actions and i am the one who is responsible for what comes of them he felt kantor ruminating over that one well hed spent enough time agonizing over the problem himself and it was the only answer he could come to no matter what other people did if he was to remain true he could only do what he felt was right pah kantor said in disgust why must the right answers be so unsatisfactory but chosen this might be right by your oaths but must you remain bound by oaths to those who violated their responsibilities not only to you but to the people they lead if i break those vows he replied slowly painfully become no better than they who will trust me if i break my vows how can i trust myself silence again as kantor considered this as well this time his reply was only a frustrated sigh i have no argument for you that would not also be sophistry kantor admitted after the silence had gone on for what seemed to be a candlemark at least strangely enough that reply brought him a modicum of relief kantor was with him kantor was at least as uncomfortable with the situation as alberich was but the companion was with him kantor his best and truest friend in the world was not going to use that friendship to try and persuade him of something against his conscience now all he had to do was argue with himself he sensed kantor thinking furiously and waited to see what the companion would come up with i dont suppose kantor offered diffidently that you could get some sort of dispensation from the priests of vkandis absolving you of those oaths geri wont give that he cant offer it on his own authority and i wouldnt accept it from him even if he did no matter what the sunpriests down in karse did geri knew that short of an apparition of the sunlord himself there was no way that he could absolve alberich of previously made vows and as for asking for some sort of message from vkandis himselfhe flinched away from the very notion for whatever reason the sunlord had elected to permit the sunpriests to act as they were only he knew what was in his mind alberich could speculate but here was the truth of it all who was he that vkandis should appear to him to absolve him of his oaths only one man in exile one man who could only prove his faith by remaining faithful chosen kantor said suddenly interrupting his thought let me ask you this suppose just suppose that you were not bound by those oaths what would you do in that case if you were completely free to do what you wished to do what would he do i havent thought about it havent even considered it there was no reason to he replied honestly and then answered just as honestly if i were free i would aid all those agents without a moment of hesitation id go myself if the council could be persuaded to trust me in fact id demand to go why kantor interjected why would you demand to go that was an easy question to answer for it was the sum of all of his turmoil because no one born and raised in valdemar could ever be so careful of the lives of the children of karse as i no one but i would care enough to take the extra effort to be sure no harm came to them alberich was no empath but the sudden flood of triumph that welled up from kantor was a thing so tangible that it felt like the beams of the rising sun reaching upward into the heavens at dawn it so surprised him that he felt stunned too shocked for words but kantor had words enough for him then chosen alberich herald of valdemar and captain of karsemake more of you make them out of the heralds that talamir brings to you give them not only the things that talamir wants but the memories good and ill that have made you what you are do thatand they will be as tender of karsite lives as you and you could ask for no better stewards in your absence he lay blinking for a long moment as the sense of that penetrated then he closed his eyes and considered the advice from every possible angle and he could find no flaw in it what better thing could he do for his people than this how could it violate his oath to create more protectors of his people kantor was right kantor was right relief flooded into him with such force that he felt dizzy with it and he clutched the sides of the narrow bed as it seemed to move beneath him and when the feeling of release ebbed a little he felt his face wet with unexpected tears oh my peopleoh my beloved peoplei can send you protectors to take my place at last at long last he rubbed the tears away with his sleeve swiftly controlled himself and realized that the murmur of voices in the other room had not stilled dethor and talamir sunlord bless them were still deep in their plans searching for answers trying to find a way to persuade you without pressuring you kantor pointed out yes they would be they had been as careful of his honor as he was more perhaps because they did not understand the reasons behind what he did they only honored his conviction that he needed to do them he got out of bed it wouldnt be the first time hed rejoined a discussion while in a nightshirt and sleeping trews he made his way to the doorway of the sitting room and stood there a moment silent seeing again the strain the care the burden of duty weighing both of them down at least this time hed be able to lift some of that not add to it he cleared his throat and they looked up startled i believe my brothers he said with a nod to both of them that acknowledged their kinship without unnecessary words i believe help you i can and must so speak you with your healers and tell them alberich of karse wishes this most devoutly he waited just long enough to enjoy the look of stunned shock and amazement on both their faces then he turned and made his way back to his bedthere to enjoy the first untroubled night of sleep hed had since the tedrel wars began the mindhealers with one adventurous exception were not happy about the plan which was not really a surprise alberich did not give a toss whether they were happy about what he was doing all he cared about was that they had agreed to the project the heralds he had recruited for his agents were a diverse lot four of them which was all he would risk on this venture he didnt know any of them well which was another good reason for having chosen them three of them were too old for him to have trained and the fourth had been so average that he was entirely unmemorable one sunweathered darkhaired man who was a tinker and thus had all the skills to pass successfully as a karsite tinker one in his late middleage years was from a family of herdsman and thus able to pass as another goatherd who had been displaced from his home in the hills by the war in fact he could probably make a fine case for having had his herds confiscated by the tedrels leaving him with nothing but the meager possessions he could carry on his own back the third was a youngster a lad who had just gotten his whitesbut he had three advantages first he was from a forester family just on the border near burning pines second he had been an orphan forced to take responsibility for himself from an early age as a consequence he acted more like a young man in his late twenties than one just barely eighteen and thirdlythirdly he was smart he had a strongly developed sense for selfpreservation he thought before he said or did anything he of all of them was the likeliest to be recruited by the tedrels themselves and the most likely of anyone who had volunteered to be able to keep his head and stay plausible when within their ranks there was something to be said for being the type that has been knocking about in the world before becoming a herald in this case the fourth was a woman as old as the old man she would try to get taken on as a laundress or cook alberich didnt hold out much hope for that but if she could well an old woman would hear a lot from the tedrel camp followers even if the tedrels themselves didnt speak to women the recruits were of the type that wouldnt be able to keep their mouths shut none of them would have their companions with them all of them were confident that their companions could stay out of sight but within call so if things began to look the least bit dangerous they could get out of the camp and escape before suspicion mounted to certainty alberich was quite certain of one thing at least when they were done with these sessions they would be karsite or he would call a halt to the whole scheme that was how he had sold his plan to the mindhealers he had to wonder how much they really understood what he meant but he had to take a chance somewhere no one knew how this was going to work but the mindhealer who had agreed to mediate the experiment had some ideas of his own that he wasnt inclined to share with anyone not even alberich he had only promised this much if what he planned worked the heralds were not going to get alberichs memories per se and alberich was not going to be reliving his own memories i wont say anything more hed repeated stubbornly no matter who asked him or how many times he was asked i dont want anyone going into this with any preconceptions to muddle things up if this works it will work very well indeed though how they were supposed to enter into the situation without any preconceptions was beyond him when the time came alberich appeared at healers collegium at the appointed hour with three of the four heralds he had recruited trailing in after him one by one it probably would have been amusing if they all hadnt looked so serious even apprehensive he could have been a tutor or nanny trailed by his three of his four charges they were sent to a quiet chamber that held two narrow beds and a chair between them and stood as alberich thought to himself like a gaggle of useless idlers none of them particularly wishing to take a seat either on the couches or the chair the young man still hadnt arrived there when healer crathach long and lean and sardonic appeared in the room to which they had been sent ah good i only need one of you volunteers at a time he said looking entirely too gleeful for alberichs comfort hmmyou i think orven take a couch alberich you take the other try to relax and close your eyes the former herdsman made a bit of a face and did as he was told taking the farther of the two couches in silence alberich did the same taking the nearest he closed his eyes and heard a creak as the healer sat down in the chair felt a hand laid atop his forehead and suppressed the urge to knock it away and and suddenly he was in karse but this was not exactly a memory he had never lived in this cobbuilt huttoo small to be called a cottagethough he had seen plenty like it over the years this was a typical mountain hut of the poorest sort yet there was a poorer state than that in karse and that was to be the lowest of the kitchen or stable staff who had not even a scrap of floor to call their own scullery maids cooks boysthey slept on the kitchen floor and ate what they could scrape out of pots never washed except what parts of them got immersed in water when they scrubbed things never changed their clothing until it dropped from their body he and his mother had thank vkandis never been that lowly however in this incarnation it appeared that the protagonists of this memory were a little boy who was him and was not him about three years old was watching a woman who was his mother and was not his mother scrubbing the floor of this huta floor made as was usual in these huts of the scrap ends of boards gathered and pieced together she did not own this place whereas his mother had owned or had at least rented their little dwelling this woman was a servant here the only one sleeping on the hearth doing the heaviest of the work taken on by the mean old woman who owned the place only because in her outcaste state she asked nothing but food and shelter for herself and the boy that was him and not him he looked through that boys eyes yet he did it from an adult perspective now he recognized the memory from the framework if this had been his real memory he would have been watching his mother scrubbing the floor of the inn where they lived but this wasnt his village it was another in herding country where he had served in his first year with the sunsguard it wasnt an inn for this particular village had been too small to have one this was just one of the many little houses with a bush above the door to show that it sold ale and food he didnt recognize the woman she was something like his mother but mostly not and although he somehow knew that orven was actually experiencing this episode as if he were the toddler alberich was watching it as a sort of dispassionate passenger in orvens head this was fascinating living fiction except that orven was living it had he come from a background that was that impoverished it could be the mindhealer could be taking both sets of experiences and melding them together in a karsite setting the bones of the experience were the same as his own a group of fellows who considered themselves to be young toughs strolled past and decided to abuse the woman because of his presence calling her whore and worse true she was not married and now had no prospect of ever wedding true she had not named his father to anyone but the sunpriest but his motherand in this manufactured memory this womanwere hardly whores they sold themselves to no man and had been so tightlipped about the identity of alberichs father that nothing had ever made them reveal it except to their priest the boy knew none of this nor did orven who was actually living through this instead of observing itnor had alberich at the time orven from his childish perspective only knew that the men were large and loud and were making his mother unhappy they frightened him and he began to cry now all of this came with an incredible load of detail that alberich had not even known was in his memorythe scent of the harsh tallow soap the mother was using and of the wet wood of the floor the beer smell from the cask just inside the door the aroma of the pease porridge over the hearth and woodsmoke the sharp notquitespring scent of the air itself the soursweat smell overlaid with goat and sheep of the men and that was just scent there was the quality of the sunlight thin and clear giving a great deal of light but not much warmth he somehow knew the look of the cobbles and the dirt path outside the door the shape of the hut with its rough cob walls whitewashed some time last spring the whitewash shabby from all the winter stormsthe shape of the other houses of the village of the village itself a straggle of houses along the road he even knew the road cobbled only where it passed through the village itself alberich knew where it had all come from hed seen dozens of villages like this one over the years the story came from his life and the setting but both were tolerably confused together creating a new life entirely it wasnt him orven taken back in his mind to the level of a toddler was the one feeling all of this it would be orvens reactions that counted here the flood of external detail was giving orven plenty to take in internal of course was something a good deal more primal the uncertainty and all the turmoil of a small and terrified child then he came striding up the path as if the crying had summoned him tall bearded straightbacked dressed in a long black robe with something bright and shining and immediately attractive to the wailing child on the breast of it he wasted no time verbally laying into the men in a voice like thunder somehow making it clear that it was their good fortune he wasnt going to lay into them physically as well there was a great deal of what alberichfrom his dispassionate distancerecognized as holy writ being quoted mostly about the poor the fatherless and the repentant there was also a great deal of writ quoted about the ultimate destination of those who abused the poor the fatherless and the repentant and a curious thing happened the more the man spoke the larger he seemed to become and the smaller the womans harassers became as they shrank into themselves unable to look either at the woman or the sunpriestthat was clearly what he was although it was alberich and not orven who knew thisthe woman took on more confidence since none of the thunder was being directed at him or his mother the child calmed and crept near to her and she hugged him close now go the man finished at last in tones dripping with disgust and if you dont wish another taste of my tongue find yourselves something godly to do for a change they slunk off exactly like whipped curs now the man came to stand over the boy and his mother how long has this been going on woman he asked curtly but not unkindly she shrugged since he was born holy father she replied in a resigned voice now the priest looked down at the boy then it is time i took a hand he pronounced in a way that said quite clearly that it would be useless to protest i will have the boy with me for two marks in the morning every morning it is time he learned the ways of the sunlord blessed be his name and when the village sees that my eye is on you there will be no more of scenes like this then he turned and stalked away again and the memoryor more accurately manufactured memorywas over alberich woke suddenly released from the experience and opened his eyes he was as calm as he had been when he took his place on the couch but from the tear streaks on orvens face it was clear that he had experienced and quite directly everything appropriate to that young child in that situation the healer was grinning with great satisfaction so alberich had to suppose that what he had planned had worked but he put one finger to his lips and motioned to alberich that he should leave the room for the moment alberich felt a little unsteady but did as he was told the other three were waiting outside sitting on a long bench and looked up at him expectantly when he emerged the healer pleased is he said laconically and left it at that it was not very much later that orven left looking quite composed for a man whod been dissolved in tears only a short time ago and the healer called in alberich and the young man herald wethes the next three sessions were similar with alberich serving more as observer than participant but each setting being appropriate to the persona being created for the people involved and rich with vivid detail wethes had another mountain village but his mother was from a forester clan for instance and for the old woman the village was down in the plain even the identity of the sunpriest changed and alberich had the notion that here too the image was coming from the other heralds each of them contributing the face and figure of some authority in their childhood trusted and wise he was thoroughly exhausted before the sessions were over but to his surprise very little actual time had been spent in the enterprise no more than a mark or two but if he was tired the others were completely drained by what was for them a highly emotionallycharged experience and it was just beginning he wondered if they were already starting to regret volunteering for this but although it was as physically wearing as a good long practice session this first set was not as emotionally difficult as alberich had feared well truth be told although he had known that the only way to make these fellow heralds into what he wanted to be was to give them bits of his own life that was entirely what he had feared as well he hadnt wanted to expose himself and his life to others so nakedly but it appeared that somehow he wasnt going to the others had no idea how much of what they were going through was really part of his life and the emotions they were feeling were theirs not his perhaps that was what had bothered him the most of all about this whole project he had not wanted his feelings to be so exposed if this was the healers doing then he owed the man thanks more than thanks he lingered while the last of his four volunteers collected herself and tottered off looking dazed healer crathach gave him a knowing look when he didnt leave and leaned back in his chair arms crossed ill save you trying to wade backward through our language and tell you straight up the answer to what youre going to ask me the mindhealer said with a grin that had just a touch of smugness about it yes i planned this whole business of only using what you know to build seminal karsite experiences for our four victims rather than taking your memories entire its all been very deliberate ive got a lot of reasons for doing it that way as much for their sake as yours you wanted them made karsite not made into duplicate versions of you and i didnt want them subsumed into your rather formidable personality herald alberich but most of all i did not want you to have to expose yourself in a way that would have been difficult for you to come to terms with alberich let out the breath hed been holding in you knew he said with just a touch of hesitation that you didnt want everybody and his companion knowing every sordid detail about your past crathach looked sardonic as well as smug an odd combination id be a pretty poor mindhealer if i hadnt been able to pick that up now wouldnt i alberich just shrugged it was only the truth at any rate things will diverge more from here in the little life stories were concocting the mindhealer continued and scratched his head with a slight frown how to put this the powerful incident that formed you into what you are now will remain the same and all of your background but the way our agents will react to it and the details of the incident will be driven by their own personalities am i making sense to you i alberich hesitated well never mind youll see it as we go along the point is the more we do the less it will be anything like your own experience the mindhealer shrugged stretched and got to his feet then he paused giving alberich a long measuring gaze go do something he said something purely physical theres such a thing as thinking too much especially for you since thinking was all that alberich had been doing for the past several marks the advice seemed good to him and he nodded my thanks he replied and went off to follow his healers orders sendar coughed unexpectedly selenay pressed down too hard on the goose quill and it leaked leaving a trail of ink spatters on the parchment she cursed and tried to blot the damage but only made it worse she dropped the quill and made a grab for the edge of the parchment in irritation her secretary snatched it away before she could crumple or tear it to pieces as she had two others let crance take care of it her father said without looking up from his own work he has your notes he has what youve written so far and he should have been doing this in the first place you dont need to be here and youre getting hunched shoulders from sitting at a desk go do something purely physical when she didnt respond he looked up at her you do not need to write every word of your judgments yourself crance doesnt have enough work from you as it is for havens sake you dont need to replace the entire circle clerks and all youve already freed up two heralds from the city courts so that they can go south and that is enough selenay he sounded exasperated and he probably was she was trying so hardand in her head she knew he was right but in her heart she kept feeling that she should be trying harder still she rubbed one of her tired eyes and let poor crance take the offending paper away to his own desk it doesnt seem like enough she said she felt forlorn but she was afraid she sounded sullen i feel like anyone who isnt feebleminded or sick or afflicted somehow ought to be there not here her secretary a young man who was nearly as shortsighted as herald myste and afflicted with wheezes when he ventured near anything in bloom looked at her mournfully she immediately felt even more guilty for making him feel guilty for not being in the fighting my dear her father sighed selenay you sit in council with me youre serving in the city courts and half the time you dont let crance do his job you are doing more than you need to and probably far more than you should get out of here into the sunlight before you forget what it looks like and you turn into a troglodyte she stared at him blinking he rose took her hand pulled her out of her chair and shoved her forcibly out the door of the royal suite as the two guards at the door tried not to stare the door closed behind her and to her astonishment she heard him slide the lock slide home and dont come back until your nose is sunburned she heard sendar say his voice muffled by the closed door for a single moment she thought about pounding on the closed door demanding to be let in the righthand guard made a choking noise and selenay swiveled just in time to catch him screwing up his face in an attempt to keep from laughing aloud she knew him very very well indeed hed played companion to her herald too many times to be counted when she was little in that he had been more fortunate than most patient fellows who allowed toddlers to bounce on their backs companions were expected to have minds of their own and didnt wear bitted bridles and they didnt suffer being drummed upon by little heels when they didnt move fast enough hed bounced her off a time or two when she exceeded the bounds of the allowable she made a face but didnt comment because there was great relief in being ordered to do what she wanted but had been too guilty to pursue beggin your pardon your highness the guard said composing himself but i believe that sounded like an order id obey the king if i was you he stared straight ahead but his eyes were twinkling she gave a theatrical sigh orders are orders she agreed and with a wink turned and headed for the nearest exit caryo im on my way she mindcalled feeling just a bit giddy as if shed been released from classes for an unexpected halfholiday ill need done your alberichs been ordered off to gallop out his megrims by the mindhealers caryo replied cheerfully perhaps your father knew that already when he ordered you out it wouldnt surprise me you can both do with an outing it could well be there wasnt much that sendar didnt know it saved her hunting up her bodyguard and trying to determine whether he could be pried away from duties of his own of which he seemed to have rather too many if shed been ordered away she wanted to leave haven altogether she hadnt been outside the walls inwell ages certainly not since the wars began they wouldnt go far not far enough that anyone could rebuke him for leaving the city not that he had a choice if he was guarding her and she would point that out if anyone dared to say anything by the time she reached the stables alberich was waiting with both companions saddled and bridled as usual it was impossible to read him and she had long ago given up trying a destination you have he asked though it was more statement than question outside haven the home farms she replied the socalled home farms actually belonged to the three collegia and supplied the needs of hearth and table there was a separate farm the royal farm that took care of the palace it wasnt much larger but it had twice the staff for the palace tables required something more sophisticated than the vast quantities of plainer fare devoured by the trainees selenay was in the mood for simple and besides the home farms had the river flowing along beside them and she had a notion to go fishing after all sendar had told her not to come back until her nose was sunburned and there was no better way of doing that than drowning a worm as the old gardener whod taught her used to say alberich just nodded evidently both caryo and kantor were more than ready for an excursion because off they set at the trot they took a shortcut across the velvety lawn briskly heading for the palace curving around the new palace and getting onto the paved drive in front of the old palace this was the side of the palace that the working heralds rarely saw and the trainees almost never the facade of the building was interesting showing as it did the old fortress face of the building with its doors meant to hold against a battering ram but it had been softened by a planting of formal cypress trees in enormous tubs and was fronted by a paved courtyard centered by an octagonal pool and a geometric granite fountain and selenay had no idea what the material paving the courtyard and drive were the paving dated from just after king valdemars time when the need for defense had begun to take a secondary place to other palace functions it wasnt cobbles or bricks for there wasnt a sign of seams or joins it was a solid pale gray very nearly identical to the color the trainees wore from edge to edge and the feel of it was slightly springy the entire pavement was surrounded by a wroughtiron fence tall and formidable like a row of linked pikes twice the height of a man with the wide drive of the same substance as the courtyard leading up to it and through a pair of gates that were usually left ajar nevertheless there were guards stationed here on either side of it with little boxes to keep the weather off them when it was truly awful alberich led her past them his back absolutely straight his seat so easy that there was no doubt in anyone who knew cavalry that it was in the cavalry where hed learned to ride for their part the guards did not seem to pay any attention to them staring straight ahead she knew better though they werent there as ornaments the drive went toward the tall properwalls that surrounded the entire complex velvety grass on either side of it but no plantings other than a row of cypresses right up against the wall itself the same sort of cypresses that were inside the fence and there were yet more of them planted in boxes arranged with mathematical precision on either side of the drive the cypresses softened the look of the stone wall and probably helped give the guards up there a little protection from the wind in winter and shade in summer there were more guards on the wall and on either side of the passage that led through it both inside and out this was still defensive there were portcullises on both ends and a rather nasty murderhole in the middle through which all sorts of unpleasant liquids could be poured down upon a wouldbe invader not so incidentally the murderhole had made a good place for a young princess to drop petals and peas down on unsuspecting visitors with extra points awarded for the pea that landed squarely in the middle of a fashionable hat without the wearer noticing there was no one up there to drop peas upon them now and they trotted through the cool shadow and out into the sunlight and down into the city nearest to the palace predictably enough were the enormous mansions of the highborn each a smaller palace in itself the farther one got from the palace the less expensive and more crowded the buildings until by the time they passed out of the final set of gates and wallsfor the city had outgrown its walls several times and a new set had been built around the new construction that had spilled over on the other sidethe final set on this road were a mix of shops with apartments above stables for hirehorses and inns and taverns the road was not however a straight line to the final city gate there were no straight lines to the complex within haven everything had been laid out like a maze so that if the city ever did come under attack the defense could be fought streetbystreet before the wars that very notion had seemed laughable not anymore though it would probably take having the tedrels appear at the gates before the citizens of haven believed that out yet another set of gates with yet another set of guards they went following the river which ran under the walls at this point here the transition went abruptly from the urban to the rural for this was where all market gardens that supplied the city with fresh eggs and vegetables were located while the urban had edged out past the final walls outside other gates here it had not for the profit to be derived from such wellwatered and fertile property was not to be trifled with and here in the midst of market gardens suddenly loomed a true farm the home farms so named in the plural because they had been several smaller farms at one time all of the buildings from each of these separate farms had been thriftily disassembled and reassembled in a central location all of the cottages joined into one big building where the farm workers lived all of the barns ranged around a single yard and each allocated to one form of livestock even the henhouses had been moved and were lined up in a neat little row freeranging chickens efficiently pecking up every bit of stray grain in nearly every weather and cleaning up insects in summer here the river curved away from the main road and the lane leading to the home farms buildings ran alongside it behind the home farms also watered directly by the river and situated on this lane was the royal farmbut that wasnt selenays destination the royal farm was a showplace of its kind the chickens segregated by meatbirds and layers kept separate to keep their breeds pure everything on the royal farm was a purebred from the chickens to the plowhorses every building was spotless and immaculate the hothouses were there for forcing flowers fruit and vegetables out of season pens of gamebirds were there and exotic food plants too difficult to grow in quantity ponds of delicatelynurtured fish for the royal table even too formal for selenay today the lane was clear with not so much as a turtle on it and both companions broke into a canter that took them all the way to the farmhouse selenay found herself grinning as they pulled up with a flourish in the yard in front of the building and even alberich looked a little less mordant the farm manager an ancient fellow indeed hobbled out to determine what they wanted and when selenay explained her wish to fish for the benefit of the collegium tables was happy to direct them to a shed where the fishing tackle lay eels selenay muttered to herself selecting the appropriate tackle knowing very well that the collegium cooks made a fine eel pie she looked askance at alberich who was examining the poles dubiously you do know how to fish dont you she asked he turned solemn eyes on her no doesnt mince words does he caryo chuckled then its time you learned selenay told him ruthlessly and with a touch of glee its a standard skill all heralds are supposed to know you might have to find your own food in the wilderness after all and i in wilderness will be allowed not likely that he sighed with resignation or disgust or both perhaps she didnt care he might as well learn to fish it wouldnt do him harm and it might do him good she spent the next candlemark or so in a position every trainee ever schooled by the weaponsmasters second would probably have given his last hope of the havens for schooling the infamous alberich playing stern and implacable tutor to the great stone heart himself and it was highly entertaining as well she presented alberich with his pole and had to show him how to bait the hookand the formidable alberich proved to be very reluctant to touch the bait now dont be so squeamish she ordered pulling a worm out of the earth of the bait pail and handing it to him ive shown you what to do its not that difficult he took the worm in his thumb and forefinger and held it stiffly in front of him must i he asked in a strangled voice she suppressed her mirth and instead fixed him with the same sort of gimleteyed stare he gave reluctant trainees she didnt even need to say anything he barely skinned the worm onto the hook and she knew it wouldnt stay sure enough the third time he pulled the hook up out of the water to check on it the worm was gone he glanced aside at her she was pulling in eels at an astonishing rate and already had a bucketful she just gave him that look again and nodded toward the bait bucket without saying a word with a longsuffering expression on his face he probed the loam with a reluctant finger for another worm by the end of the afternoon she was highly satisfied with her half of the expedition she had a fine mess of eels far more than a mere bucketful certainly sufficient to provide heraldic collegium with an eelpie supper she had a properly sunburned nose but not so much that it was going to hurt later and alberich was well it was comic the incredibly competent alberich did have something that he couldnt do he had caught exactly two fish both of them little sunperch and neither big enough to keep he had lost most of a pail of worms and it was a good thing that he hadnt hooked anything large or selenay suspected hed have lost the rod as well he who couldnt miss a target couldnt cast a line to save his life he who was so dexterous with any weapon of any sort tangled his line with appalling frequency mind he had managed to relax if only by cursing under his breath at his pole his line the wretched fish that stole his bait practicing with his students out of doors as much as he did he hadnt had a clerical pallor but there werent quite as many frown furrows cutting across his scars she put up her gear with a sigh of regret he put his up with a sigh of relief the old man came to take charge of the tub of eels which was as well since she couldnt exactly take them back to the collegium in her saddlebag together they rodeat a walk this timeback down the lane to the road how did you manage never to learn how to fish she asked him after they rejoined the traffic on the road heading into haven i should learn where he asked when very young helping in the inn i was then it was in the academy and fishing a sport for gentleman is or a subsistence for the poor no part has it in training for a cavalry officer he must have been very young when he first began to work then and very poor caryo told her knowing that she neednt say more although fishing was traditionally a way for the poor to add another source of allseason food to the larder the poor also had to have the time to fish which clearly alberich had not the very poor also might not have enough to spare for hook line and bait besides he added meditatively where lived i and served i no great rivers there are swift streams only trout have i heard of which great skill takes wealthy mans sport well youve got the knack now she replied cheerfully and was rewarded with his sour look then best it is that to haven i am confined he said and should fish be required of me purchased at market they can be else it would be starvation she couldnt help it she tried to hold back her snickers but they escaped he lookedpained oh really alberich its so nice to find something you cant do she exclaimed glad i am that such amusement given you i have he told her crossly perhaps a new title i should have heraldjester she couldnt help it he looked so irritated now that the giggles just burst out all over again and finally one corner of his mouth began to twitch then both corners then although he didnt actually laugh he unbent enough to admit that the joke although on him actually was rather funny and it wasnt until he had delivered her back to her father sunburned nose and all that she realized that she hadnt thought about the wars once all afternoon but what was truly satisfying she also understood in a flash that in wrestling with worms and hooks and poles that would not do what he wanted them to neither had alberich and that sendar had sent her off to do something at the same time that someone in authority over alberich had evidently decided that he needed some distraction so perhaps her father was even cleverer than shed thought no theres no perhaps about it she decided making her way back toward the royal suite hes much cleverer than id thought however of all the thoughts that had occurred to her today that was perhaps the very least surprising outside the tavern a storm raged effectively ensuring that no one would be leaving or coming in any time soon water poured off the eaves of the tavern in sheets like a waterfall as the gutters overflowed the rain spouts added to the mess spouting like geysers sending a torrent of water over the cobbles it was cold out there the temperature had plummeted and the rain felt like icewater inside the tavern those who were stuck here nursed the last dregs of their drinks and contemplated another or perhaps a nice pigeon pie or a good slice of mutton the innkeeper anticipating the needs of his customers had started a kettle of mulled cider even though it wasnt the season for any such thing and the spicy scent began to drift through the inn turning heads and sharpening appetites it was unexpectedly cozy in here with a small fire going just enough to take the chill off the air and the ambiance was a million leagues away from the atmosphere in the last tavern alberich had been in alberich had come out of the secret room at the back of the stables here at the companions bell only to find that the storm which had been threatening all day had finally broken since he was effectively trapped here and starving he decided to make a virtue of necessity and avail himself of the little private room reserved for heralds and their guests of course he was starving hed left before suppertime and you just didnt eat what was offered in say the broken arms not unless you wanted to have an intimate and detailed knowledge of the inside of the privy sooner or later when your stomach objected to what youd put there granted the indoor water closets at the collegium were fine things but not as a place for an extended stay hed already had his fill of watching people tonight on the whole hed rather just sit back on a comfortable settle alone and watch the storm here once he was out of that secret room where he changed his identity from that of a herald to any one of half a dozen personae he wore in this city and back again to a herald he felt almost as secure as at the collegium itself it wasnt only the wretched neighborhoods he prowled as a cheap thugforhire as a neerdowell of dubious reputation as a sellsword no he had some respectable personae as well he was a small merchant in imported knives he was a votary of some obscure god whose cult was so tiny that no one had ever heard of it for good reason since it didnt exist he was an honest caravan guard but most of his time was admittedly spent in places most heralds never saw but the city constables and guard were all too familiar with and most of it was spent accomplishing very little but waiting for one or another of his patientlylaid traps to catch something far too much of it was spent in places that could be called taverns only because they sold alcoholic drinks and he thought hed been served some wretched brews as a karsite officer at least those had been drinkable rough strong enough to lift the hair on your arms but drinkable tonight had been one of those nights when nothing whatsoever happened or was going to happen except perhaps a common brawl or two the threatening storm had made people think twice about leaving whatever cramped little corner they called homepeople with only a single change of clothing had to shiver in it until it dried on their backs if they got soaked through the taverns had been half empty and none of his informants had poked their noses out of their holes when the sky above the rooftops to the west began flickering with faroff lightning he had given up hed hoped to get back to the collegium before the rain began but luck wasnt with him it seemed then again perhaps it was heralds were common enough visitors here in the bell that no one remarked on their presence when alberich arrived here he didnt wear his trademark gray leathers anymore he wore whites which made him blend in with the other heralds who frequented the place sometimes a herald just wanted to get away from the collegium have a tankard or a glass of wine flirt harmlessly with a serving girl and why not heralds as talamir took pains to remind him were only human sometimes a number of friends wanted to get together when they all came in at once there really wasnt a big enough room in the palace where five or more could put their feet up and talk as long and as loudly as they wanted you could get food anytime you wanted it but it tended to be the sort of thing that could be fed to a great many people at onceand a bespoke meal of exactly what one had a craving for was something even heralds sometimes fancied the innkeeper took him to the heralds parlor and showed him to a seat by a window from which he could see in the frequent flashes of lightning rain pouring down as if it would never stop a moment later a serving girl brought him hot pigeon pie of his own and a tankard of the innkeepers own bitter ale it wasnt karsite but it was close and unlike the harsh brews of the mountains it was good the high back of the settle screened him from most of the room which in any event was empty and likely to remain so if the weather continued to be this bad there was no closing door to this room and a low hum like a hive of drowsy bees came from the common room in between peals of thunder the contrast between inside and outside was so striking storms like this commonly occurred in the mountains of karse but this was the first time hed ever spent one sitting in a comfortable warm seat with a hot dinner in front of him and the spicy scent of mulled cider in the air he could remember dozens of these storms when he was a tiny child when hed huddled beside the smoking struggling fire on the hearth in the middle of the room while the roof leaked in a dozen places and more rain dripped down through the smoke hole in the middle of the roof the shutters would rattle with the force of the wind and his mother would hold him close as she carefully fed the fire with the driest bits of wood to keep it alive he didnt remember the ones when he was in the temple though that sturdy wooden structure never left him with the fear that at any moment the roof would blow away but the ones when he was older helping out at the innyes hed be in the stable helping to calm the horses struggling to get doors closed running all over with buckets to catch leaks or hed be out in it tying things down bringing them in and never mind the lightning striking neartoo nearand the cold rain soaking him through the academy was down in the valley in a place that didnt get storms like that but once he was out with the cavalryoh he lived through plenty more of them most of the time out in the open you hoped for a chance to get your tents up first and youd wrap every blanket you had around your shoulders and watch the rain stream down off the edges of the canvas and know it would be a cold supper again being caught without shelter though was worse the best you could do was get down in a valley try and find the scrubbiest lowest stand of trees and get under them youd get off your horse because with the lighting and thunder even a trained cavalry horse could bolt youd use the canvas of your tent as a raincape and hope it kept the worst of it off you standing with your head down one hand holding your horses bridle up near his nose the other holding the canvas just under your chin shivering both you and the horse oh this was better much better like so much of his life since hed come to valdemar and yet it was not enough and he was not certain if the problem was within himself or valdemar he was glad enough that there was no one here it allowed him to be left alone with his thoughts he was rarely truly alone for very long i understand youve lost your first fight said someone at his elbow the voice was femalefamiliar but he couldnt put a name to it immediately for the words startled him so much eh was all he could manage as he swiveled to see who it was that had interrupted his solitude with a fish heraldno longer traineemyste amended her glass lenses glittering with reflected lightning she sat down across from him without waiting to be invited a rather small fish she added in karsite with a chuckle the servinggirl laden with mystes dinner set her dishes down opposite alberichs then she whisked back through the door to the common room leaving them together ah he found trying to see past those lenses rather disconcerting you have been speaking with selenay he found it a relief to speak karsite valdemaran was still a trial to him and he had the sinking feeling that it was going to take years even tens of years before he was comfortable in it he managed with his lowclass personae mainly by being taciturn knowing that the people around him wouldnt recognize a karsite accent anyway its moreorless my job she replied its thanks to you ive got the job im toldtraining with elcarth and interning in the city courts with selenay as the senior judge im elcarths second and elcarth believes i should be ready to step into the heraldchronicler position within a year or two good he said and meant it and what has my ignorance of fishing got to do with the chronicles not a thing she admitted it just came up in our discussions i just let people rattle on you know its the most effective way to learn things she paused and tilted her head to the side i dont suppose you would be willing to rattle on at me he opened his mouth to say no then closed it again it was an interesting thought and this would go into the restricted chronicles he asked instead possibly some things should be common knowledge and by the time anyone reads my chronicles all of those covert identities youve got now are going to be outdated so she knew about what he was doing well he shouldnt have been surprised if she was elcarths second shed be reading the restricted chronicles that he was writing he wondered knowing that she must know about the secret room here if shed come down on purpose to waylay him she ate two or three bites reminding him that his own dinner was getting cold he started in on it delicious as always from the bells kitchens pigeon pie was a delicacy in karse the only pigeons there were the larger wood pigeons and calling doves hard to catch and reserved for those with falcons to take them here in the city though there were pigeon lofts everywhere and the common rock doves bred like rabbits it was rabbit pie that was the ordinary mans fare in karse in fact rabbit pie rabbit stew rabbit halfraw and halfburned on a stick over the fire i grew up on this myste said gesturing with her fork to her plate we had a loft in the back yard i find i miss the taste at the collegium hmm it is good he agreed not common fare where i come from well herein the city especiallyyou make up your pies with whatever you have to eat for supper in the morning and drop them off at your neighborhood bake shop as you go off to work and pick them up when you return along with your bread most people with small apartments or single rooms dont have a bake oven in fact especially in the city most people only have the hearth fire to stew over and not a proper kitchen at all myste didnt seem to want a response she went back to her dinner and he followed her example it is much the same in karse he offered save that there is no bake shop or rather the baking place is often the inn and we steam food as often as stew it he well remembered the smell of the baking rabbit pies in the kitchen of the inn where his mother worked theyd come out and woe betide anyone who touched them each with a particular mark for the family that had left them and a star cut into the crust of the inn pies hed never gotten a quarter pie like this hot from the oven he and his mother had been on the bottom of the hierarchy of servants and were treated accordingly first were the customers of course then the innkeeper his wife and children then came the cook and the chief stableman who got whatever intact portions the innkeepers family left then the cooks helpers the serving girls the potboys who served the drink then the grooms in the stables and the chambermaids then at last alberich his mother and the wretched little scullery maid and turnspit boy which meant that what he got was broken crust gravy bits of vegetable or anything that was burned overbaked or somehow illmadetoo much salt he recalled that pie only too well but they got enough to eat that was the point once his mother got that job at the inn scrubbing the floors they never went hungry there was always dayold bread and dripping the fat and juices that came off the roasts and were collected in a drippings pan underneath there was always oat porridge plain though that might be and pease porridge the latter being such a staple of the common fare and so often called for that there was always a pot of it in the corner of the hearth pease porridge was the cheapest foodstuff available at his inn and they sold a lot of it when the pot was about half empty the cook would start a new lot so that when the first pot was gone the second was ready to serve all of the inns servants could help themselves to a bowl of it at any time even the scullery maid and the boy that sat in the chimney corner and turned the spit in all weathers the innkeeper was thrifty but generous with the food not like some alberich encountered over the years who starved their help as well as working them to exhaustion ah myste stacked her emptied plates to the side with a sigh of satisfaction alberich pushed his beside them i dont mean you to begin nattering at me at this moment alberich i just meant that when you feel like it id be glad of your addition to the chronicles and i dont mind being a listener if all you want to do is talk think out loud maybe or just talk to hear karsite he smiled slightly knowing your unending curiosity i thank you for your patience my curiosity has as much as it needs on a regular basis right now myste replied you know before elcarth took me on i was never satisfied i wanted to know not so much what was going on but why that was the thing that drove me mad sometimes why had this or that law been made why were your people such persistent enemies whywell there are always more questions than answers now im able to find out my whys more often than not and more to the point im entitled and encouraged to do so she smiled and her lenses glittered maybe thats why i was chosen i cant think of any other reason he laughed is that why you were always such a thorn in my side as a trainee that you could not be told to do a thing without wanting the reason for it she shrugged i dont take orders well unless i know why the order is being given and ill be the first to admit to you that im very lucky and have been unusually favored in that way most people cant afford to indulge that particular luxury they either follow their orders without question orwell there are unpleasant consequences for wanting answers she rubbed her thumb absently against the little clerks callus on the side of the second finger of her right hand a callus created by hours of pressure from a pen he nodded wondering suspiciously if she was hinting at his past the more im in the courts the more i realize that she continued as a clerk well i knew why i was doing what i was doing it was obvious pointless perhaps but obvious she glanced up at him sideways you know you have to be a clerk i think before you realize just what a pother people make over nothing and the sheer amount of illwill that people seem to think must go down on paper or die dear gods what letters he asked no people mostly write their own vitriol in letters were a literate people alberich thats mandated by the crown just as karsite children are required to go to the temple for religious instruction ours are required to get instruction in reading writing and figuring no i meant legal documents thats mostly what a clerk handles at least my sort of clerk there are others who do things about money but ive never had that kind of head for figures i saw a lot of wills she sighed a lot of wills and depositions and the documents involved in lawsuits well since youve been acting as bodyguard to young selenay youve seen what happens when something gets as far as the courts he nodded again but it is important to them some people have too much leisure if thats whats important to them she said sourly wrangling over dead grannys best bedcover as if the fate of the kingdom depended on it when all the while down there in the south she couldnt finish she just sat there shaking her head he thought back about all of the things he had observed while selenay sat either in judgment as the principal judge or as an assistant when she was still a trainee i do not understand it either he said then added with a touch of humor but then i never had so many possessions that things took on a great importance to me she burst out laughing at that whereas i have too many thieving magpie that i am so i suppose i should understand them then again most of my possessions are books so i still dont understand why people would get into such a state over a few pence or a set of silver she looked eversoslightly superior and if it was dead grannys library that was in dispute he asked shrewdly to puncture that superiority she saw itand bravely took the blow there you have me dead in the black she laughed oh look the rains starting to slacken up he glanced out the window she was right the downpour had turned into something lighter and the lightning had moved off into the far distance it could be just a lull he warned as she made as if to get up could be but ill take my chances i need to get back up the hill im tutoring a couple of trainees she did get up then and he found himself wishing she would stay he stifled an impulse to catch hold of her hand to prevent her leaving but she seemed to sense something and turned back toward him i meant that about nattering at me alberich she said you know i dont put personal things in the chronicles not unless theyre reasons for something happening and it would have to be a pretty important something and alberich yes something had passedwas passingbetween them something he didnt recognize and didnt understand she stared at him he sensed her eyes behind those lenses oddly intent you might try talking to geri as well after all thats what hes there for isnt it she had an oddly wry smile on her face well all things considered thats part of his job id thinkto be talked at and with that remarkable statement she was gone he sat there for some time in the halfdark wondering why this conversation seemed to havewella feeling of importance about it perhaps because its another herald kantor asked he hadnt ever gotten such an odd feeling from anyone else not even talamir no its not just that shes not an empath is she not so far as i know his companion replied thoughtfully but she does have one rather odd little gift she doesnt have to cast the truth spell to know if someone is telling the truth so long as shes in close proximity to them its why shes in the city courts in fact interesting perhaps that was why she seemed to be able to get the people to tell her so much perhaps that was why she was so focused on needing to know the why of things if you always knew that something was true or false maybe your focus shifted from finding out the truth to finding out the reasons behind it if you knew that something was true maybe that impelled you to talk to others as well as listen to them am i needed up the hill he asked kantor would know the companions always seemed to be moreorless in contact with one another kantors reply was immediate no and ive no objection to staying here in this nice dry stable if you have something you need to do shall i tell them youre going to be down here a while please do myste might not be the right person to talk to about some of the things that were troubling him but she was right about one thing gerichen was and if he couldnt take counsel with one of vkandis own who could he speak with tell them he hesitated if anyone wants to know tell them im going to visit a friend the temple of the lord of light in haven was a small one situated between a saddlery and a chandler alberich thought the chandler a particularly appropriate neighbor all things considered candlesnext to the temple of the light he wondered if the chandler knew hed gone back to the secret room and donned the garb of one of his morerespectable personae in no small part because that persona was possessed of a raincape an article of clothing that herald alberich had forgotten to bring with him this evening besides it wouldnt hurt for lysander fleet to be seen here it was one more layer in the persona the duties of a sunpriest began at sunrise and ended at sunset but geri would be accessible for another couple of marks candlemarks he reminded himself he had to start thinking in valdemaran terms or he would never get the hang of this confounded illogical tongue the temple itself though modest in size did not skimp on illumination in fact it showed itself to be a most hospitable neighbor at the gates of the forecourt directly under the two large oil torches were benches that were in nearly every kind of weather but rain or snow occupied by one or more of the neighbors taking advantage of the free lighting to read by the forecourt was illuminated by six more torches and there were benches beneath them as well although normally only a member of the temple congregation was likely to venture in there to read or socialize henrick encouraged people to feel as if the temple was an extension of their household and there were plenty who lived tightly packed into a couple of rooms with their entire family who were happy to use the space in good weather the forecourt was a good place for meeting friends taking very small children to play or just to get away from the rest of ones family they werent uncomfortable benches either of wood rather than stone though wooden benches would have been more in keeping with karsite custom anyway and constructed with a subtle curve that welcomed a sitter they glistened wetly in the rain like great sleek river beasts looming under the torches that had been extinguished by the first of the downpour with the torches out the only illumination came from two lamps on either side of the door of the temple itself that wasnt a lot and alberich cursed the invisible bumps and cobbles that made for unsteady and slightly slippery footing he pulled open the wooden door and slipped quietly inside trying not to disturb anyone who might be there but the place was empty holding nothing more but the presence flame on the altar and the sharp scent of the oils used to polish the wooden interior the aroma sent a shiver and a pang of homesickness over him all temples of vkandis had this scent since except for the great temple in throne city all temples of vkandis were made of wood polishing some of that wood had been one of his tasks as a child not that his old priest had any notion of taking him in as a novice it was only too clear from the very beginning that alberich had no vocation and at any rate he would not have lasted five marks in the cutthroat game of politics that most sunpriests played but the scent brought back memories of his childhood pleasant ones in fact which would have surprised people had they known it wellnot his four agents thanks to his memories they now knew what a sunpriest should be like a little stern perhaps but not unforgiving a truly upright person geri came in after alberich let the door fall closed again and it did so with a hollow thud the priestfor gerichen was a full sunpriest now just as alberich was a full heraldpeered toward the shadows enshrouding the door and made out at least the basic form enshrouded by a raincape what can i do for you my s geri began as alberich threw back the hood of his cape and stepped forward so that geri could see who it was dont call me your son geri he admonished in karsite youre nowhere near old enough to be my father keep coming at me out of the dark like that and my hair will soon be white enough to pass for your father geri replied of all people you were the last i would have expected to see tonight a mutual friend suggested that i dont come visit nearly enough alberich felt himself relaxing in the familiar surroundings that said safe haven to his younger self no matter what had happened to him later at the hands of sunpriests ah geri raised an eyebrow and then a hand well in that case since this is a social call shall we take this to my quarters lead on alberich came up the aisle toward the altar the sanctuary the entire temple in fact was a harmonious construction of carved and shaped wood from the vaulted roof to the parquetry floor the bench pews were finished with finials carved in the shape of a torch flame and the suninglory was inlaid in very subtle parquetry behind the altar the several woods used to create it were of shades so near in color that you had to look for the pattern and know what you were looking for in order to see it more patterns geometric this time were inlaid in the backs of the bench pews in the floor in the altar itselfand these were anything but subtle every color of wood possible had been used here and alberich reckoned that the artisan in question was either now a very wealthy man or else was a devoted member of the congregation doing it for the glory of the one god for it was quality work and wouldnt have come cheaply geri led him in past the altar and the door behind the altar itself this was a kind of robing room with vestments hung up all over the walls a door in the opposite wall led to the priests quarters here geri said motioning him into a tiny kitchen its warmer in here than anyplace else have a seat henricks asleep but dont worry about waking him he could sleep through a war and a tempest combined do you want anything to drink beer tea tea please alberich replied and watched with interest as geri moved efficiently about the tiny kitchen heating water in the pot over the hearth and getting mugs for both of them i dont know why i havent come here before instead of making you come up the hill he said that because the kitchen smelled right those were karsite spices he could taste faintly in the air and a uniquely karsite black tea that was steeping in that kettle there were sausages hanging up in the corner of the hearthboth for further smoking and because the smoke kept insects awaysausages alberich would bet tasted like the ones from the inn where hed grown up so what is on your mind geri asked a great many things alberich replied now fully relaxed with geris good tea on his tongue tell something though what do you think about myste i like her but shes deceptive i dont mean that she lies i mean that her appearance is deceiving she looks and sounds harmless but shes a hunter geri said instantly she wont let anything stand in her way once shes on a scent though im not sure what quarry shes stalking probably a lot of things one of them being answers ah but to what questions alberich replied shes stalking those too why do you ask geri responded curiously im not sure now that im not having to browbeat her into training properly and shes a full herald and elcarths second were peers so were no longer in conflict with one another she intrigues me i suppose it must be that instinct one hunter recognizing another shes the one who sent me here tonight in fact he took a sip of tea and savored the flavor it was the right flavor the one from his childhood although the flavor from his childhood was a diluted version of this im hunting answers myself geri regarded him with a somber gaze you of all people ought to know that you arent going to find many of those here questions certainly but precious few answers ours is a faith alberich not a map or a guide and certainly not a set of certitudes at least that is the way it should be not what it has become he said that sadly and once again he was back in childhood with that kind yet stern priest who tried to show him in ways a child would understand just what the sunlord was and was not we are the mirror of valdemar more like the twin or we were before things disintegrated geri sighed ive had this discussion with henrick actually he is of the opinion that the long slide began with a will to power i think its more complicated than that i think that the priesthood was corrupted by the congregation alberich blinked how exactly the laity wanted absolutes answers and the priesthood finally elected to give them answers the simpler the better geri replied the writ took second place to the rule and a poor second at that the answers took away all uncertainty and what is more took away the need to think alberich frowned not for nothing had he spent so much of his childhood under the tutelage of a priest who knewand livedthe old ways above all the writ demands that a manor a woman for that matterlearn how to think geri nodded you see the old ways require that each person come to the sunlord having thought through everything for himself the current rule requires that men become sheep herded in one direction following one path pastured in one field ever and always so will it be sheep it occurred to alberich that it was probably no coincidence that the sunpriests of karse had taken to calling their congregations by the name of flock sheep dont have to think for themselves do they geri made a face the sunlord was reshaped from the unknowable into the remote but predictable patriarch from the whirlwind to the windmill that grindsexceedingly small do thisyou are gathered unto his bosom do thatyou are cast into the outermost hells geri shook his head answers are terribly seductive the simpler they are the more seductive they become alberich turned that over in his mind and found it certainly matched some of his own experience but that isnt the whole of it he objected of course not i just suggest that this was where the corruption started geri replied then came the power power that came from giving people what they wanted instead of what they needed and power is just as seductive and even more addictive than any drug nowi dont know alberich i dont know how it can be fixed or even if it can it would take the sunlord himself in manifestation perhaps and someone as the son of the sun who is willing to hold to the hard course and be disliked even hated and loved and loved geri agreed at one and the same time and probably by the same people because when you demand that each situation be considered separately and not responded to with the predigested answer you are always going to anger someone since youre always going to disagree with someone probably even someone who agreed with you the last time and now takes this new response as a betrayal alberich smiled sourly it would take the sunlord himself to protect someone like that i fear so and i am very very glad it isnt me geri drained his cup and poured himself another then smiled so since i am not going to give you any answers what can i do for you give me an opinion he outlined as best he could what he was doing with his four putative agents they have seen the very best that karse is in the form of father kentroch my protector and teacher and if im reading them correctly they have warmed to him just as i did and more importantly responded to his ideas of responsibility and honor were just about up to the point where i first learned i had a witchpower i suppose each of them will have a similar experience but the witchpower will be his or her own gift in real life if youre wondering if you have somehow betrayed your vow to protect the people of karse let me tell you now that both henrick and i are positive you are doing nothing of the sort geri said firmly if anything you are going to put four more protectors in place just as you had hoped did you know that all four of them have been coming down here for practice in the language or so they say alberich shook his head surprised well they haveand what henrick and i figured out after the first two visits was that they didnt want lessons in karsitetheir accents are impeccable by the waybut an understanding of how our version of the sunlord differs from what theyre going to encounter in karse something about the way he said that made alberich stare at him oh no he said feeling his heart sink please do not tell me that they want to convert we wouldnt accept them as they are now if they did geri said with a laugh no actually i think theyre integrating their two personae then once they know how things are now theyll react as a karsite who was brought up in the old ways would alberich felt a profound relief the last the very last thing he had wanted to do was to change anyones religion thats sensible geri he hesitated only now did kantor interject something geri is your priest this is surely a question for your priest im torn he said at last it feels as if there must be something more i can do for valdemar valdemar has given me so muchwhat should i be doing in return geri considered that question carefully alberich my friend it is also my duty to tell you things that are true you are doing as much as any other herald someone has to be helping to keep the peace here in haven and you are doing that you still serve as selenays bodyguard and thus free someone else to go south and in case you were wondering if you should offer your military expertiseno no that surprised him butmy training one of the things that is true is that you are not a great general not yet anyway valdemar has great generals and it doesnt need you in that capacity geri gave him a look shaded with pity and understanding ah he felt deflated butwell we have the lord marshal with decades more experience than you perhaps you have the advantage of training at the academy but we have the collegium which is dare i say just as good it isnt only heralds who are taught here occasionally among the blues there is a young military genius from the guard and the lord marshal was one of those ah geri was right then he stared down at his cup so so other than doing what you are doingyou should be getting yourself prepared for the day when the king and the heir and everyone else that can hold a blade goes down to the battlefields of the south to hold off that last big push that you know is coming something about the tone of geris voice made him look upbecause it was odd very odd it didnt exactly sound like geri geri stared off into space his face blank his eyes lookingelsewhere and alberich felt an unaccountable chill on the back of his neck there was something going on here something he didnt recognize you are selenays bodyguard alberich and when the day of that final battle dawns she is going to need you more than she ever has beforebecause the last the very last thing she will think about is her own safety so it is the first indeed the only thing that you must be concerned about that is what you must be readying yourself for nothing else nothing less if need be you must save her from herself on that day so that you save her for her kingdom alberich had never believed those stories about how the hair on the back of someones neck stood up when something very very uncanny happened now he didbecause he could feel that exact sensation geri continued to stare off into space with that peculiarly blank expression on his face but something glinting in his eyes and alberich had the distinct impression that whatever was speaking it wasnt geri which leftwhat here in vkandis own temple it couldnt be anything inimical but it sounded almost as if this was a prophecy he wanted to speak and ask something for himself wanted to ask a question a dozenbut they were all questions he really didnt want to know the answers to honestly if i did id be trying to tame that gift of mine and make it serve me predictably the writ said that the future was mutable and unknowable until one passed through it and it became the past that was why the writ spoke against the witchpowers of those who tried to predict the futurenot because the attempt to know the future was wrong in itself but because being told a future closed some peoples minds to the possibility of any other and they focused all their attention their hopes and their fears on that future to the exclusion of other possibilities which defeated the entire prime principle of free will upon which all of the sunlords writ was based all this flashed through alberichs mind in the time it took for the cup to slip out of geris fingers and drop to the table with a clatter botheration geri was back startled seizing a cloth and blotting at the spill before it escaped to make an even bigger mess look at mewoolgathering im sorry alberich no matter the hairs on the back of alberichs neck had settled but not the uneasy feeling that something had wanted him to know more than he should about the future a future except that we know there is going to be a final battle were planning for that already and if i had taken thought about it i would immediately have known that selenay would never consider her own safety under battlefield conditions i havent been told anything i couldnt have figured out for myself have i i should be going my day starts early and yours even earlier he said trying not to show any of his unease true enough good thing for me that im a real larkofthemorning geri said cheerfully as he walked alberich to the door come by here more often wont you alberich almost almost prevaricated then he hesitated because the writ also said that when vkandis wished the future to be revealedor steeredhe would find a way to do so i will he promised and went back out into the cold dark and the rainordinary things ordinary things he didnt think he was going to sleep well tonight probably not for many more nights to come part three the last battle he had been expecting it for months with a feeling of heavy dread and sick anticipation that put him off his food and kept him staring at the ceiling at night all winter hed worried and wondered were the tedrels going to break with their pattern and attack in the winter after that strange evening when geri briefly spoke forsomething elsehow could he not have felt that the storm was about to break hed wished for an inkling that he was doing the right thingand hed gotten it nothing inimical could have used geri as a mouthpiece not a sunpriest and not inside the sacred confines of the temple everything in the temple was sacred no matter how homely it seemed vkandis was the lord of all from the sunfire to the hearthfire and he did not scorn the small and commonplace so even if what had spoken through geri was not vkandis himself it was certainly some spirit that was doing so on behalf of the sunlord be careful what you ask for well now he had it and now he knew well in advance of everyone else that sendar and selenay would go into combat no matter who tried to stop them now he knew and didnt dare tell anyone now he knew but didnt know when he only knew it would be soon but how soon every night he went to sleep on edge and every morning he woke with the feeling that a storm was coming and certainly this was what everyone including the nowsuccessful agents had been working toward all this timeto lure the tedrels into thinking that the valdemaran defenses were a hollow shell and a single concerted drive would crack through and thanks to the four that he had planted when that time came valdemar would know as soon as the karsite troops themselves did they would know days weeks earlier than they would have before his four demikarsites got planted successfully on the other side of the border yes he was expecting it but when the word came it still hit him like a blow to the gut it was talamir who delivered the blow that didnt make it better but at least it was from the hand of a friend and delivered as calmly as that worthy could manage it was early springor tail end of winter take your choice raw weather in any event the trees still leafless though there were a few far too optimistic for his way of thinking that were swelling into bud the snow was gone but a bite in the air and the snarl of the wind suggested that it wouldnt be too wise to tempt fate by rejoicing aloud that it was gone half the days were clear and cold half raining that miserable dripping rain that would come up without warning and then stay a week and by the time it crawled away half the collegium would be down with head colds it never stayed clear long enough for things to dry up in any event and it was a good thing that the trainees uniforms were gray because you couldnt help ending up with mud from the eyebrows down by midday no matter what you did tail end of winter he would call it for all that the days were longer and you could if you searched diligently find a few foolhardy crocus and snowdrops coming up in the gardens spring and he hated to see it because it meant at least another season of war and spring came sooner the farther south you went true in the mountains at the border it actually came later but once out of the mountains or when you stuck to the valleys spring was well on the way spring was no longer a season of hope and renewal and had not been for some time but would this be the last season of war or only the latest that was the question that hung suspended over his head like a sword for the past fortnight hed been running a crossclass with the horsemanship teacher an accelerated course in fighting while mounted and each day it had taken most of a candlemark to clean kantor up afterward all the companions had been mired to midflank and spattered above that line he was cold as a frog tired and every time he licked his split lip he tasted mud and blood there was no other way of learning how to fight in this kind of muck except to do it though no matter how much everyone hated it he was looking forward to a hot bath with utter longing and he trudged into the quarters behind the salle expecting only to see dethor and perhaps get a little commiseration before he went back to see about that long soak in hot water it took him aback to see talamir theretalamir sitting in one of the hearthside chairs and the sun still in the sky for talamir never was free enough to come back here before sundown talamirs expression told him the worst even before the kings own opened his mouth he froze feeling as if something had just petrified him in place he knew he knew and it didnt take a gift to tell him for a moment he couldnt breathe for a moment he was stunned the blow had fallen the tedrels were moving this is the season talamir said and that was all he needed to say so the bait had been taken the misinformation believed this season as soon as the rains stopped the rivers subsided and the ground was firm instead of mired the tedrels would make their allornothing push hed wanted it and dreaded it in equal parts and now it had come he nodded for there wasnt much that he could say at this point other than know where do we when whenwell theyre going to take a little longer than usual theyre going to try and browbeat the karsites into adding troops and if they cant get troops they plan to demand money so they can hire whatever nonguild scum they can hold together under a banner talamir sounded quite certain of that information which meant that someone had overheard something he or she technically shouldnt have they want shock troops to take the brunt of battle so their own can move in behind undamaged and theyll want a bigger base to move from than before one that will hold all of their people and possessions in it ready to move into valdemar as soon as they take it but where he persisted that was critical when they knew where the tedrels were going to come across they could set up their own defensive lines on ground of their choosing not yet talamir admitted other than that we dont think itll be holderkin lands the last taste of them that the tedrels got didnt seem to agree with them alberichs lip curled a little he didnt much care for the holderkin but they had surely proved to be too tough for the tedrels to digest and it wasnt that theyd actually formed any kind of a defensive army either by law and custom they kept enough food in storage at each of their holdings to keep everyone minimally fed for two yearsand in that way no single bad year could bring them to their knees so when the tedrels descended last summer instead of fighting them the holderkin had locked every man woman child and beast into their fortresslike compounds and sat the tedrels out after looting what little hadnt been locked up and burning the crops there wasnt much the mercenaries could do except circle the walls trying to get in that wasnt a very successful strategy and they wound up getting shot full of arrows for their pains any time they got within range the places were too small to justify the amount of effort it would have taken to breach those walls and there was no real loot of any kind if you did the tedrel recruits being what they were they fought for the loot as well as the promise of a land of their own yet you couldnt leave the hundreds of holds intact if you intended to occupy the land that wasnt merely asking for trouble it was inviting trouble in and offering it a cup of tea so to speak so last season when the tedrels had tried to take holderkin territory the season had been singularly profitless and unsatisfying for them perhaps that had added to the impetus that impelled them to put in their final push now they could not afford two lootless seasons in a row too many of their recruits were not fighting for a new homeland and would break ranks and desert if they saw no profit coming for a second year you couldnt even tempt them with the holderkin women if the walls were breached as had happened in one or two instances the ones that didnt kill themselves were slain by their menfolk given that the holderkin would only follow precisely the same strategy a second time it was vanishingly unlikely that the tedrels would attempt the conquest of the entire country of valdemar from there it was far more likely that their plan was to conquer all of valdemar and then cut off the holderkin dealing with them one holding at a time at their leisure i havent much else to tell you talamir admitted only that theyve fallen for our ruse that they believe we have been beaten down and depleted and that they are gathering every resource they can for that final campaign foreseers alberich asked he hoped the foreseers were getting something although his own rogue and unpredictable gift hadnt even warned him of this news then againhadnt it how much of the dread hed felt these past several moons had been due to his gift it didnt always give him visions sometimes it only gave him warnings the foreseers just confirm that the agents are right but since the decision was evidently made in their council a few days ago and only just announced to the general troops i expect that will change talamir sounded confident and he had every right to be mutable and unknowable future well perhaps what the writ had to say on that subject was a matter of philosophy rather than realitymeant more to keep people from closing themselves off to all of the possibilities that free will gave them and this was particularly true when karsite writ met valdemaran reality and the gift of foresightwhich often as not showed many futures not just one and if vkandis really abhorred the knowledge of the future would he have given me that particular gift for alberich like the heralds had used it to change the future he saw for a better one he began making calculations in his mind trying to reckon how long it would take the tedrels to coax or coerce the sunpriests into adding karsite troops to their numbersor more likely come up with more gold and silverhow long it would take to get all the supplies together for such a campaignestablish a base four times larger than any theyd had before then he realized that there were better heads than his who were already working on that very problem and that their agentsinplace would be able to give valdemar infinitely better information about what was actually happening than he could with what was only speculation but there was one thing he could and would do two targets and two only they will have should the king and heir the field take he told talamir and dethor sendar to slay and selenay to take or slay take selenay they would prefer and swordwed towhatever leader survives it is the land they want behead the leadership they must to take the land better still to behead the leadership and make all right by wedding the heir live with their neighbors they must now he could deliver his warning the warning that geri had delivered to him dethor made a sound like a groan and talamir nodded just what i thought and i told sendar as much the kings own replied bitterly but trying to keep either of them out of the fight at this point is impossible stopping the tedrels now is going to take everything we have and sendar believes that if he and selenay stay safe in haven we will lose the fight before it even begins if they take the field there isnt a man or a woman who wont fight better for their presence and much as i hate to say this i have to concur with a sense of sick agreement alberich nodded the warning had been delivered and heeded but it clearly would make no difference to the king and heir so the warning was given to me therefore it is i who must act on it then this i can do alberich said firmly heralds there will be and guards to shield them in a battle guard so to me bring them for training to make the shieldwall for a king a special skill is and each man his place must know and know that the right and lefthand comrade will firmly stand and he has to know how to fill in when the man to his side falls dethor seconded grimly alberichs right talamir we havent had a king go into combat ingloryover a century more i think i never was much good at history we havent had a battle guard in all that time i dont know the strategy except from books but trained the sunsguard is for such a thing alberich told them sunpriests red robes and archpriests and hierophants we must guard if not the son of the sunfor into the vanguard they will go when know you sendars battle guard to me send them selenays battle guard i will choose and selenays battle guard and bodyguard i will lead remain here i will not he was slightly appalled to feel his spirits rising a little at the prospect of a fight at last and something he could do action rather than sitting but that was just it really it was a fight at last no one could deny him his right to be in the thick of it now he would be the leader of selenays battle guard no one could stop him now so far as the palace guard members are concerned i would just as soon that you chose for both sendar and selenay talamir said thoughtfully you are the best judge of them since you work with them all the time then not solely palace guard it will be but city too he honestly didnt think that there would be enough men in the palace guard who were young and fit enough to supply what he wanted for two sets of bodyguards and that wasnt being snide eitherso many of the palace guard had resigned their posts to serve down south that men who had retired had come out of retirement to fill their places those old men were perfectly fit to stand indoor guard duty at a door if their reflexes were a little slower than in their youth they had a world of experience to take the place of fast reflexes they might even be good enough to fight with the army as a whole but they couldnt march like younger men couldnt run like younger men and hadnt the stamina that was needed for this job whatever whomever you want talamir told him ill see to it that you get it or him or her sheheralds and sheguards for selenay can i get them half and half with men said alberich and grinned fiercely to see the surprise on both their faces tcha think you no thanks from the princess would there be for clumsy men in her tent trampling and with her they must be sleeping and follow her other elsewheres that a man should not go you mean to guard her that closely talamir asked his face reflecting an interesting mix of shock and approval one man with a knife all our efforts can overset he pointed out to them sendar your charge is talamir selenay is mine and say i guarded she will be in every moment of every night and day battle guard there will be but also bodyguards will she nil she waking and sleeping he did not say that he expected sendar would rebel over being so closely watched and would disregard anything talamir had to say on the subject but selenay would listen and obey his orders once hed explained them thanks be to the one god she wouldnt like them but shed obey them unlike her father she could not disregard orders he could and would have her tied up and locked into a secure tower if he had to he hoped it wouldnt come to that but at the moment he thought he could count on her good sense especially when she saw her father being less than sensible tcha all it takes for a youngling of that age is to see the parent doing one thing and it is certain they will try and do the opposite how refreshing to have youthful rebellion working for him instead of against him and perhaps when sendar saw his daughter being sensible he would be shamed into sense as well not likely but he could hope youll want heralds keren and ylsa talamir said thoughtfully neither of them will be in the least impressed with rank and birthright they saw selenay as a firstyear trainee and helped me whip her into shape women there are in the city guard as well and he couldnt help the wry smile locasti perken berda lunge and haydee dellas his spirit rose a little at the thought of recruiting those three to his bodyguard selenay would have to be a deal older and craftier before she could outwit or overawe them dethor raised an eyebrow talamir chuckled oh i believe i know those names the kings own said matching alberichs smile they have night patrol around the compass rose and virgin and stars dont they and just last week frogmarched young lord realard back to his father then delivered a lecture to the old man that fair pinned his ears back dethor said with a nod or so i heard correctly you heard impressed with rank they are not either two heralds three city guards that made five and with the addition of a palace guardswoman who came to his practices who was called lotteif she had a surname hed never heard itthat would give him two women at selenays side at all times that would do for close bodyguards for her battle guards and sendars hed want another ten or a dozen twenty or twentyfour good fighters hed have to think long and hard about who these i need he said rattling off the names talamir nodded those six at once special training will they need the rest from palace and city guard i will make a list have it to me in a candlemark talamir said getting to his feet send it by page ill have sendar sign on it that will cut through any objections ill have your six women report in the morning and the rest to you within the week he would have liked it to be sooner but that was probably the best that could be done replacements would have to be found schedules juggled and all of that took time timewhich was now working against them selenay i want as well he added best it is that she learn her guards to work with right dethor agreed and if we can get sendar down here to work with his he stopped at the grimace that talamir gave ask for the moon and youre more like to get it the kings own said grimly if he sees his bed for more than four candlemarks in a night now ill be surprised so dont expect him to come down here for whats only a little arms practice then his companion we shall have alberich said in a burst of inspiration one at least of the pair shall we train with done chosen kantor said instantly and youll have taver to stand in for me because i must be with sendar said talamir in the same moment that way at least one half of the pairs will get some practice in this the sensible ones kantor said alberich was not disposed to argue with that assessment six womentwo in heralds whites three in city guard blue and one in the darker nearmidnight blue that marked the palace guardstood at attention before alberich three of the six were older than he by three or four years and were probably at least as tough but there was not a jot less than honest deference in their expression and though all six of them looked sober they did not look anxious that was good it meant that they trusted him his competence and his orders you six have i selected as selenays bodyguards he told them two each for each of three watches day and night her side you will not leave while on watch ever he saw the two heralds exchange a glance noticed a slight frown of concentration on lottes face now will i ask how paired you wish to be and which watch you wish to take he continued sensible you are and know you that no less honor there is for the night watch than the day if its all the same to you i think ylsa and i ought to be on day watch herald keren spoke up selenay will have to be in on all of the battle plans and councils and the like andwell not to be rude but heralds will just blend in with the background meaning no one will object to heralds being there when some of the highborn might complain to see city guard particularly women that they might have seen hauling their erring sons home drunk objections alberich asked looking at the other four who shook their heads that splits the night with us said berda ill tell you what if its all the same to you two im used to the late hours after the taverns close and i know that haydee and casti are onwere onfirst night watch lotte think you could handle the dawn watch with me the palace guardswoman shrugged itll take me a bit to get adjusted but ill manage well that sorted itself out painlessly make it so he told them and once satisfied i am that your business you know those watches you will take at selenays side whether or not were still in haven herald ylsa asked looking surprised whether or not used to your presence i wish her to be invisible i wish you to be nods no objections what do you want us to do that we havent done before asked lotte he proceeded to show them they were used to fighting backtoback but not when in charge of someone incapacitated or someone who needed to be kept in cover they needed to learn how to find safe exit routes at least two the moment they entered a room or a situation they had to practice defensive rather than offensive fighting and later he would teach them quick rescue techniques how to dash in and grab the heir if someone had snatched her while she was still within reach even if that someone had a knife to her throat the time to get her away was not after she was in enemy territory he hoped that at least one of each pair was a good shot one of the best ways to rescue someone who was kidnapped was to shoot her in the leg someone who had to be carried became doubly hard to take but he thought he would save that lesson for a time when selenay wasnt with them by midmorning selenay had joined them she was not at all happy about having bodyguards all the time but she was reasonable about it the same could not be said for her father according to the terse report he got from kantor but alberich didnt have to deal with her father that was talamirs problem not his he was just pleased that his six women were quick studies a little quicker than hed hoped actually the three from the city guard were especially adept in defensive strategies perhaps because of their riot training students crowds of layabouts and troublemakers and drunks in fair season sometimes turned into mobs and the city guards and constables were trained to deal with a mob in every manifestation whether cheerful and manic or surly and destructive the two heralds had their own set of valuable skills especially suited to their day watch in no small part because they were used to letting their eyes skim over a crowd looking for someone or something that was subtly wrong the two heralds would have their companions to help of courseand the companions made another good reason to have them on day watch no one assassin not even a group of three to six could get past two heralds and three companions and the possibility of getting a group of strangers past sentries and guards and other sharpeyed sorts by day was vanishingly small by nightwell it was possible but it would have to be very well coordinated and the number of approaches to get at selenay would be limited so once selenay joined them alberich concentrated on escapeshow to get her to where her companion could reach her for once she was mounted she was probably safe safer anyway her companion could get her out of reach of anything that anyone could use at night for distance weapons would be severely limited by limited visibility night watch did have a different problem for selenay would be asleep part of the time the three city guards solved that problem for him though because they were perfectly used to manhandling semiconscious bodies even if selenay was somehow drugged and couldnt be awakened with a little luck theyd be able to get her out of harms way we wont eat or drink anything we havent brought with us they told him before he even asked and we wont eat or drink at the same time that way even if someones somehow managed to get to our grub one of us will be able to see that somethings wrong he was quite satisfied with their progress when he dismissed them at the end of the first day the bones were there of a good set of three pairs of bodyguards and a firstclass set of battle guards even selenay was impressed and had worked as hard as they did in a role that did not come naturally to herthat of hiding behind others and allowing someone else to take care of her lotte was the last to leave and she helped him to clean up the salle before she did as the door closed behind her he sat down on a bench in the salle suddenly feeling exhausted it had been a long long day the salle was silent except for the sounds he made himself the last blue light of dusk came in through the clerestory windows up above and reflected off the mirrors behind him he unbuckled the straps of his armor with fingers that ached from holding tightly to sword and dagger and winced at the occasional bruise training the battlefield guardsah that would be another question hed thought long and hard about it and had decided to go with a mix of half heralds and half guardsmen and had given the list to talamir last night he would head up the group around selenay and talamir would be the commander of sendars group the most experienced fighters he chose for sendars guards because on the battlefield the tedrels that came after sendar would be going in for the kill the ones after selenay would be handicapped as they would be trying to capture not kill so they would hold back somewhat his people would have no such compunction against them and he rather expected that selenay once she saw fighting would be eager to stay out of it not that he doubted her courage but she was a young and sensitive person and battlefields were horrors he was sickened by them and he was hardened to the death and carnage once she got her first taste of real fighting she should be perfectly willing to stay at the rear of the battle lines with the commanders alberich was not as sanguine about keeping sendar out of the thick of the fighting but then again that was not his job it was talamirs and if the kings own couldnt manage it no one could certainly not alberich the foreigner for to some perhaps unconsciously even to the king that was an issue no matter how people felt about him consciously somewhere down deep inside the moment he opened his mouth perhaps if you worked on your grammar kantor suggested indeed in my infinite leisure time he retorted as he pulled off the armor hed worn to protect himself he had been the assassin for all of this practice and as such had worked harder than all of them combined he was in good condition as good as hed ever been butah it had been a hard day as well as a long one at least hed been too busy to think too busy to worry today he had neglected all of the trainees leaving poor dethor and a couple of the older trainees to conduct lessons themselves tomorrow he would have to do the same and the day after and the day after that he sagged down on the bench suddenly with an overpowering sense of guilt he was supposed to be dethors second to take the burden of all of this off of the old man ah kantor what am i going to do he asked plaintively i cant be in two places at once and if you were not here who would be teaching the trainees and who would have seen to it that selenay had bodyguards and who would be drilling the king and heirs battlefield escorts kantor replied someone else of course dethor and someone else someone who wouldnt have alberichs experience someone elseif he could figure out who that someone else might have been maybe he could recruit him her to train the trainees this last lot of trainees wont see fighting he said after a moment weve put everyone who is even remotely ready into whites by now but therere still the ones that are a year away from becoming full heralds there must be a dozen of them and ive personally taught all of them from the time they came in as trainees i can put them to teaching the younglings while dethor supervises good answer kantor approved and i can see to it that dethor stays here no matter how much he wants to go south with the full army he decided clenching his jaw hell fight me on it but if the king orders him to stay then no matter what happens to me there will still be a weaponsmaster at the collegium he wont like that but its a sensible course of action kantor sighed mind all he has to do is try one night in a tent to know that hed only be a handicap and a liability one night spent in something other than a warm bed would leave him a cripple by that alberich knew that kantor and the other companions were already plotting ways to get dethor to make the experiment quietly of course without anyone else knowing of course there was no point in embarrassing the old man or hurting his feelings good answer alberich replied and levered his own stiff sore body up off the bench a hot soak something to eat and then do you think id be allowed to sit in on any strategy sessions he asked perhaps he wasnt a great general but there was only one way to get that expertise and that was to watch an expert in the craft of war just slip in and stay in the background and well see to it that no one notices you kantor replied well that was interesting and hed better take advantage of it he limped toward the door to his shared quarters it was going to be a long night the first of many he suspected the first of many kantor agreed but it wont be alone chosen never alone talamir clenched his jaw and told himself that it wasnt wise to contemplate strangling his king he sat rather stiffly in the armchair that sendar had nodded him toward he knew that chair of old it was seductively comfortable and it was supposed to make him relax he wasnt going to allow it to and he wasnt going to strangle his king sendar he said instead i am fully aware that you are an accomplished king and leader and under most circumstances you are perfectly able to defend yourself but may i be bold and point out to you that you can neither remain awake from now until this war is over nor can you do everything that you refuse to delegate even though there are plenty of your humble servants who are perishing for something constructive to do therefore you can resign yourself to the fact that you will have to sleep now and again and will require bodyguards while you do so and you will have to learn how to delegate he took a deep breath and waited for the inevitable reaction the king growled under his breath something inaudible but it sounded unflattering furthermore talamir persisted if you intend to persuade your daughter to put up with her bodyguards you are going to have to set her a good example that sendar said clearly and distinctly is blackmail the blackest talamir agreed its also the truth he neglected to tell the king that he had pointed out the converse to his heir if each of them thought that the good example she or he was setting was the reason for the other behaving in a sensible fashion it would make everyones job much easier although sendar looked sullenly at him recalling to talamirs mind the rebellious adolescent that hed been as a trainee he nodded all right ill accept the bodyguards but i want to train with them he said stubbornly i dont think youre going to have a choice in the matter i believe alberich was going to insist on it talamir had the satisfaction of seeing surprise on the kings face hes a very thorough fellow is alberich he realized immediately that having a bodyguard doesnt do you a great deal of good if someone attacks you and you dont know what to do but they do the wrong move could put you in as much danger as if you didnt have them at all selenay sendar began and was interrupted by his daughter walking into the room selenay has been training with her bodyguards she said flinging herself down into a chair with a groan and a wince talamir noticed that her hair was wet she must have just come from the bathing room six of them and the sogentle alberich promises that its going to get harder from here i have in the course of the afternoon been thrown to the ground thrown onto caryos back hauled about like a sack of wheat and taught how to dive for all manner of cover not to mention done just a trifle of fighting practice myself im quite looking forward to facing the tedrels they cant be worse than this talamir decided not to disabuse her of that notion he just caught sendars eye and nodded sendar grimaced well ill be doing the same tomorrow the king said to talamirs pleasure though how im to squeeze more hours into the day i do not know ive already told you and done so repeatedly by putting the council meetings and any other business that is not directly concerned with the war into the hands of your seneschal talamir told him with a little heat because he had been advising this very move for months now that is what he is there for you cant be two places at once and if we dont win this thing there wont be a valdemar for you to reign over your seneschal is competent unflappable and far better at obfuscation than you are if its something he cant do he is supremely good at stalling things until you have the leisure to deal with it and what is more he knows to a nicety what he can and cannot do delegate sendar how many times do i have to repeat that sendar shook his head i dont he began then shrugged i will but and dont tell me that you dont like it talamir snapped deciding to show his king and friend the edge of his anger after all sendar wasnt the only person in the kingdom who was doing things he didnt like i wont sendar replied in a way that told talamir that this was exactly what he had been going to say what else do you want me to put on my plate a speech youre going to have to tell the peopleof haven at leastwhats coming and ive never been the speechmaker that you are that was certainly something that needed doing that only sendar could handle i cant write it and i certainly cant deliver it a speech sendar sighed yes that will have to be me selenay i advise you that when you take the throne find someone else to write the speeches for you i think not she replied so somberly that both talamir and her father shot a look at her speeches arent just something that we deliver as if we were mere actors they have to come from our hearts father and there has to be truth in them if they dont resonate from inside us and they dont have truth behind them how can we ever expect people to believe in us and what we say they both focused on her at once it wasnt so much with astonishment asunanticipated pleasure she sounded like an adult she was an adult and she sounded like someone who had learned all the right lessons from her father she returned their looks gravely platitudes might satisfy for a short time fatherbut soon or late the people will realize they are being fed form without substance what i tell them must be the truth and i must believe it and i must hold to it that is what you have taught me i have learned far more from you than that but that is one of the important things you have taught me by your example he nodded and so did talamir she knows weve done our job havent we he asked taver we have she may not yet have all the skills but she has the spirit and the heart skill will come with time nowif they could just be certain of having the time alberich stood behind selenays chair in an attitude that was a hair less than rigid attention that slight degree of relaxation he had noticed tended to make peoples eyes slide right over him he had taught selenays six as they were calling themselves that same trick it was very useful to be ignored especially for a bodyguard the fact that he was in whites rather than his own distinctive gray leathers was helpful there people didnt notice that it was the infamous alberich there because they didnt expect to see him in whites talamir would have been standing the same guard behind sendars seat except that he had his own seat on the council in this case his place had been taken by herald jadus jadus managed to look as if he was no more than an interested bystander and his guileless expression reinforced that impression if one didnt know betterand only a few people didone might well assume that was the case jadus was something of a surprise to alberich he would have expected the bardturnedherald to be one of the lot remaining behind at the collegium not skilled enough in warfare to be of any use in the coming fight he would never have guessed that jadus was as grimly determined to strike his own blow against the enemies of valdemar as any guardsman nor suspected that jadus was a deadly swordsman his skill with a blade was not something that had come to light until recently as he had been out on circuit all this time dethor had remembered it since he had trained jadus himself he was the one who had recommended jadus as one of sendars bodyguards there was an interesting twist to his talent with a blade jadus fought with a light rapier rather than the commoner broadsword but such a weapon was much more useful in a situation of close combat useful too within four walls or any other crowded situation dethor had called jadus in to work with alberich and both of them had immediately suggested that talamir assign jadus as one of the kings six personal guards the more heralds they had in those positions the better sendar was more likely to listen to a herald than a guardsman not that the king was likely to listen to anyone if their advice went against something he felt strongly about but a herald was more likely than anyone else to get him to stop and think before he acted but jadus was not the only surprise another of sendars bodyguards was a healer in fact it was the same mindhealer crathach who had mediated the transfer of all of those memories from alberich to the four spies crathach was also a wicked bladesman although he favored a twohanded style with knives instead of longer weapons and his skill was such that he had been able to teach alberich a trick or two he came to alberich himself to demonstrate his skills and volunteer his services at something besides healing you dont want a healer angry at you hed said when alberich questioned him on whether he could bring himself to kill with those knives a healer knows how youre put together and what will hurt the most ive been working with the severely wounded ever since all this started his eyes had glinted and this healer is very very angry at the tedrels alberich often wondered just what had made crathach a healer into someone who could say that and look alberich straight in the eyes while doing so but he of all people understood a wish to keep ones past private and unless crathach volunteered the information he was not going to ask he probably hadnt expected to be made one of the kings personal bodyguards but he adapted immediately and alberich was not at all unhappy about having someone who was also a healer serving as a bodyguard especially a mindhealer who had ways of dealing with a king who was reluctant to rest when he needed to it was a convenient assignment to have the healer taking the latest of the two night watches along with one of sendars former squires knighted just after alberich had come to the collegium the lad had then been sent by his father on some mission or other and hadnt come back to haven until a few moons ago alberich had anticipated a certain amount of trouble from that one but all hed gotten was respect evidently the young buck had gotten some of the arrogance knocked out of him just as well any arrogance the young bucks of valdemar still had was about to get knocked out of all of them and for some of them the experience would be fatal the less arrogance the better the chance at surviving until all this was over what sendar and talamir and the lord marshal were doing at this meeting was to give the rest of the council a thorough briefing on absolutely everything that they had all learnedfrom spies farseers foreseers and anyone else whose word they thought was trustworthy the tedrels were in the process of establishing their final base for attack just across the border in karse and the size of it made alberich grow cold all over so far they had done nothing but prepare it was not yet a campaign much less a war and that did not bode well either this was to be an invasion and as such the preparations were being taken with all of the care that decades of detailed planning could insure they had been working toward this moment forwell years decades at least alberich had known better than to hope that their focus had diminished over the years their shock troops might be a combination of the dregs of the mercenary trade criminals who sought sanctuary in their ranks and whatever young men they could recruit with promises of adventure excitement and easy money but the core was the tedrel nation whose longing for a new homeland had only strengthened the longer that they went without a home if anything the increase had been exponential with the land of valdemar in their sight the bitterness of those thrown out of their homeland by their enemies had been distilled by the years now it was as much of a weapon as the swords spears and arrows in the hands of the army and they had done something very clever this final season karse was used to their strategy of making a base from which they could strike into valdemar and didnt think twice about it when once again the tedrel commanders had set about establishing yet another but this time with the karsites lulled into complacency they had built up their own troops and established a base that could be used equally well to strike at valdemar or karse then made it clear to their erstwhile allies that they did not particularly care if further aid was delivered voluntarily or wrested from the sunpriests by force the sunpriests must have been shocked to discover the monster they themselves had created sitting on their doorstep not to be budged reasoned with or countered demanding that it be fed and fed royally that much alberich and the others knew from the spies and although he could not know this for certain he was fairly sure that the karsite treasury had been emptied literally and completely into the tedrel coffers until even the rapacious maw of their army was sated shocked and dismayed utterly undone and perhaps in a panic when they realized the position they had put themselves in their first thought would be of selfdefense the coffers could be refilled but if the tedrels came in force to take what they wanted they probably wouldnt stop with taking the gold and silver in the treasurythey would go on to help themselves to the personal treasures of the highranking priests at the very least supplies the lifeblood of an army were pouring in and the means to transport those supplies just as important were not lacking either if there was a cart or a beast in all of karse that was not in the hands of the tedrels it was not for lack of money or effort trade had slowed to a crawl as carters draymen and teamsters flocked to make a small army of their own in the ranks of the tedrels merchants couldnt find anyone to carry their goods farmers were having to transport their own foodstuffs to market the silver lure held out to recruit these notoriously independent souls was augmented by the guarantee that they would be sacrosanct that no one could or would force them into the ranks of the soldiery they would not fight they would be guarded by fighters the supply lines would roll fat and heavy with everything the tedrels needed this time they would not plunder the countryside because they had to they would not need to worry about living off the land although sunsguard soldiers did not go into the ranks of the tedrel forces there had been movement toward the border and now they had formed a line of defense on either side of the tedrel base ensuring that the tedrels could not be flanked at least on the karsite side of the border brilliant it was all brilliant he couldnt fault their strategy or their patience they had waited all this time for their golden opportunity and they were clearly not going to ruin that opportunity by forgetting that patience now the tedrels would move when the tedrels were ready not before and not a candlemark later talamir and the lord marshal were revealing all of this to the council now it was new to most of them but only because they hadnt been paying attention it wasnt as if they hadnt been warned over and over again that the tedrels were going to keep coming at valdemar until it fell or they were destroyed and dispersed alberich couldnt fathom it it was as if the moment that the tedrels retreated in the fall the members of the council forgot they existed and would be back in the spring true there were plenty of pressing concerns but none to his way of thinking as the inevitability of the tedrels making that final push perhaps in the back of their minds they hoped that eventually the tedrels would give up and go away after all they had never yet won so much as a thumbnails worth of valdemaran land but if that were so then all of the things that all of the spies and foreseeing heralds and historians had been telling them had just gone right past them without being believed if theyd been paying as much attention as they should have been to all of the reports that talamir had given them over the last few moons they would know most of this on the other hand the fact that it was all coming as a horrible surprise was going to work in sendars favor the council couldand would as talamir and sendar worked together like a pair of clever shepherd dogsbe stampeded into granting sendar whatever he wanted one of those things was alberichno longer kept back in the shadows ostensibly no more than a closely watched underling sendar wanted alberich in the thick of things at his or selenays side seeing and hearing everything that was most important most secret this greater danger would make the members of the council forget where alberich came from and remember only the uniform the quiet work on the seamy underside of haven the invaluable help in placing agents in karse and presumably there would be no further objection to alberichs presence wherever sendar wanted him granting him authoritywell that was another question altogether alberich didnt really need or want overt authority he had all he could handle covertly but he would get by virtue of being selenays most visible bodyguard complete access to every strategy session no one would think twice about it if he really saw something important and knew there was something that needed to be said it would be said through selenay or talamir or even sendar himself ah the advantage of being a mindspeaking herald i think that the position of being behind the powers that be suits you better anyway kantor observed why so that no one has to look at my face he asked sardonically kantor pretended to be shocked why chosenwas that a joke i just heard as you know i have no sense of humor alberich responded now hush i want to see just how hysterical the council members get when sendar talks about the leaks of what should have been council information and how much of it is feigned because he had some suspicions that there were a fewa very few no more than two or threemembers of the council who were not as tightlipped as they should have been he didnt suspect any of them of sending information to the enemy themselves but rather that they gossiped about council doings to others they probably thought that their friends and cronies were trustworthy enoughif they actually thought at all which was doubtful these highborn valdemarans seemed to take it as read that none of their friends or their friends friends could possibly be untrustworthy and never mind heaps of evidence to the contrary and never mind all of the political infighting that went on between factions that was probably where leaks were happening and not an overt traitor of course all of this chattering made them feel very important and in the know and their friends would be feeding them information back so that in their turn they could impress the rest of the council members with their knowledge and insight they thought it was harmless and in any other situation than the one they all found themselves in now it would have been but now such looselipped behavior was nothing like harmless even without the tedrels on the border there were other hazards outside and inside of valdemar that could and probably did use this information to the detriment of poor ordinary folk so alberich was paying very close attention to the reactions of the councilors and he wasnt at all happy with what he saw lord gartheser he was oh so very concerned shocked dismayed and he was acting alberich was certain of it gartheser headed up a faction that had been particularly nasty about alberichs presence among the heralds but alberich wouldnt have held a grudge if they hadnt been so underhanded about their opposition still hed have given gartheser the benefit of the doubtnot with that bit of overacting gartheser was up to something gartheser knew more than he should and where had he gotten that information hmm unfortunately sendars old playfellow orthallen is in garthesers coterie that was kantor who actually knew far more about these people than alberich did which was saying a great deal the companions had their own information tree which was as flourishing as any gossip vine in the court and was far more accurate alberich suppressed a grimace that wasnt good lord orthallen a few years older than sendar had been kind to sendar when the king was a lonely child in the court before hed been chosen now alberich was fairly well certain that the only reason the adolescent orthallen had been kind to and protective of the grubby little child sendar had once been was because hed had an eye to the main chance even then but you couldnt persuade sendar of that and as a consequence as a child he had made orthallen into his hero and as an adult his close friend and compatriot orthallen had extraordinary access to the royals for someone who wasnt a herald in fact it was virtually a certain thing that orthallen was going to get the council seat soon to be vacated by lord tholinar alberich liked orthallen even less than gartheser lord gartheser was just pigheaded and prejudiced and interfering he wanted things his way he didnt trust anyone who wasnt highborn and he wasnt entirely certain even of those jumpedup commoner heralds but although he despised alberich he didnt mean any harm and though he probably had friends who were not at all trustworthy there was no way yet to prove that to him to give him the benefit of the doubt alberich was fairly certain that if anyone could bring gartheser proof of his friends iniquity there was no doubt that he would drop them without hesitation orthallen on the other hand well alberich had no real evidence against the man other than the evidence of his feelings or perhaps his gift either way there was something about orthallen that put his back up like a cat scenting a snake he had no evidence against the man and nothing other than his instincts to go on but but i agree with you there is something altogether ruthless about my lord orthallen as if he doesnt care who or what is ruined so long as he comes out with what he wants now that was an interesting observation coming from a companion was this purely kantors feeling or did he have some other source of information what if you hooved fellows conspire to keep orthallen safely occupied with something else do you think you could organize that i can try but im not a miracle worker the most difficult part is that no one seems to see anything wrong with orthallen but me and thee kantor sounded discouraged as well he should my fellow companions dont like him either but that could be only because he doesnt really like our chosen then thee and me will have to do what we can among a thousand other things he pulled his attention back to the council meeting and was pleasantly surprised to see that the council members after their initial shock were actually pulling things together surprised noastonished he truly hadnt thought they would bury their differences and get straight down to working together burying feuds and sparring and jockeying for power so quickly but they were the horseshoeshaped table buzzed with half a dozen overlapping conversations as the councilors dropped their political differences and settled down to the task at hand sendar somehow kept track of it all selenay just kept track of who was in need of a page of writing materials or just another pitcher of drink as the time candles burned down selenay sent more pages for food and drink while the council organized and coordinated the resources of their territories guilds crafts and associations they were tallying up what could be brought down south immediately what could be collected in a fortnight or a moon what could be spared and how much could be done and still leave just enough left to keep everyone from starving to death over winter and no more because now finally they all realized that even if the entire kingdom was left impoverished that ruthless stripping of resources still had to be done in the face of the enormous threat that the tedrels posed finally finally they understood and at least now that they understood they were prepared to act and act swiftly with no argument the shock over they were showing their mettle even lord gartheser better hungry and cold than dead and cold said lady donrevy grimly that seemed to sum up everyones feelings not before time but at least it was in time alberich settled his face into a mask of indifference it was time for him to observe and nothing more as the candlemarks passed the daylight faded and pages brought and took away laden and empty platters and pitchers he watched and listened his time to act would come later no and no and no selenay was in a temper losing patience with her maidservant entirely she pulled the useless gowns out of the traveling chest wadded them up and threw them on the floor she did not want the creature to try and foist the blasted things off on her again i will not take those gowns or these gowns or any gowns at all she snapped as the maid snatched the dresses up with an expression of shock and offense and smoothed them hastily selenay felt a pang of guilt over the crumpled and wrinkled state of the delicate white silks and satins raimes and linensbut not enough to show that she felt any guilt how many times must i tell you im going to a battlefield not a fete a ball a state visit or a festival but highness you will be surrounded by highborn young men the maid protested indignantly your highness cannot possibly wish to appear the hoyden great good gods what part of battlefield doesnt she understand selenay suppressed a groan and wondered what demon had possessed her to accept this foolish woman as her personal servant because uncle lord orthallen sent her to me of course and now i cant dismiss her because hed feel as if hed let me down and i did need a proper ladys maid one that knows about hairdressing and all that sort of thing unfortunately the creature did not know about heralds nor did she care she cared only about the trappings of rank the care of gowns the importance of selfimportance and she could not seem to fathom that there was another set of duties of the princess and heir that went far beyond looking handsome attracting a husband of suitable rank and following the appropriate court etiquette yes she was sheer genius when it came to dressing well and looking exquisite but that was all she was good for on the whole the woman was far more hindrance than help especially now and finally selenay sent her on a fools errand into the attics just to get rid of her knowing that she would be packed and gone long before the woman got back then she did something she would normally never have done she pulled out everything the maid had packed and tossed it out all over the furniture the floor wherever it happened to fall when she dumped the packs the maid could do something useful for a change when she returned she could pick it all up see that the gowns were pressed and brushed sort out all the hairdressing nonsense and cosmetics and put it all away selenay could braid her hair by herself very well and the only cosmetic she was likely to use out there was soap with the maid out of the way it took just over a quarter of a candlemark for selenay to pack it wasnt difficult shed learned how to pack for the field long ago and had watched her friends as they packed up to go out countless times wistfully she had watched them then she had known it wasnt possible for her to go but she had wanted to so badly well now she was going and she didnt want to alberich probably thought that she would be excited about being in the front lines and anticipate being in the thick of fighting right up until she got her first real look at it and only then would she lose her taste for war he was wrong she had already lost her taste for war and she knew far more about it than she thought he realized she had been making it her business to visit the wounded in the house of healing ever since all this began to thank them they seemed to appreciate her attention though why she couldnt imagine maybe it was just that for most of them it was their first and probably last closeup look at one of the royals well she knew firsthand what war really meant and she was absolutely terrified and was not under any circumstances going to show it she rang for a servant to help her with her trunks but carried two of her packs herself and she outdistanced the poor servants in her haste to get down to the stables probably she should have waited for an escort of guardsmen but she didnt have time and if she wasnt safe at this moment with the palace and grounds alive with guards heralds and the last of the regiments to leave haven she would never be safe anywhere she popped out of the nearest door onto the courtyard in front of the palace a place that was normally quiet and empty at this time of the morning not this morning the sun was just above the horizon a sliver of red in a dusky sky the air was a little damp with dew slicking the cobbles rimming the pavement and birds filling the air with their morning calls it seemed too beautiful a morning to be riding out to war the courtyard was awash in white white companions heralds in their white field uniforms selenay fit right in her uniform was not a whit different from theirs that was a conscious decision there was nothing about their clothing to distinguish her or her father from the other heralds of course the moment she crossed the threshold she was joined by her two shadows the heralds keren and ylsa who fell in behind her casually as if they were just a couple of her best friends whod been waiting for her to come out she greeted them with a tense smile and then spotted caryo already saddled and bridled with field tack waiting with keren and ylsas companions who were completely ready saddle packs and all her father was already in the saddle but she saw with a touch of relief that she was by no means the last to arrive it didnt take long for her to sling her basic field packs across caryos rump and fasten them in place less time to get into the saddle herself her remaining packs and trunks would go on the wagons carrying the rest of the supplies with her tent and her fathers caryo with selenays two shadows in close but unobtrusive attendance moved to sendars side without prompting the king nodded an acknowledgment to his daughter but didnt stop reading the dispatch hed just been handed he held out his hand and a page on horseback slapped a graphite stick into it he scrawled a reply on the same paper and held out his hand again the page slapped a preinked seal stamp into it which he impressed across his signature he blew on the ink to dry it and rolled it up this time he handed it to the darkhaired somberfaced herald whod brought it to him who in turn slipped it into a message tube then the herald held the tube up at eyelevel frowning at it one moment he held the tube the next his hands were empty he looked a bit pale for a moment but recovered quickly sendar slapped him on the shoulder well done was all the king said but the young man smiled blushed and backed his companion off to rejoin his fellows the young fellow was a herald with the fetching gift of course either he or a mindspeaking herald had told talamir that there was a message probably from the front that needed a written answer the fetching herald had brought it in a heartbeat and sent it back again in the same amount of time now with this allornothing war to be fought the heralds truly showed how invaluable they were in fact without them valdemar would have no advantage over the tedrels at all heralds who were mindspeakers rode with scouts and served to relay news messages and battle plans heralds who were farseers spied on the enemy without him even being aware he was being spied upon heralds with the gift of foresight tried to predict what would come next the two lone weather witches tried to predict when rain would fall on the enemy and when on their own troops and those with the rare gift of fetching sent things to and from their commanders in the distant south there were other even rarer gifts which might or might not come into play depending on circumstances at the moment for instance the only firestarters in the heraldic ranks were not very strong which waswell some would think it was a pity certainly if theyd had a firestarter with the strength of the legendary lavan firestorm they would hardly need an army on the other handthe finale of the battle of burning pines had very nearly incinerated both the karsite and valdemaran armies together selenay was just as glad their firestarter couldnt do much more than ensure campfires from thoroughly soaked green wood the mood was subdued as the sun rose a little higher and the dew began to dry the companions unlike horses were not restive they stood rocksteady in their appointed places with little more than the occasional head shake or switching of a tail the heralds themselves spoke very little and only in a murmur perhaps most of them were occupied in mindspeechcertainly sendar was for the king had that faraway look that selenay knew meant he was deep in conversation with someone more likely a series of someones caryo said quietly hes been talking to the others since he woke selenay bit her lip on the one hand she wished very strongly that her own gift was powerful enough for her to hear what was going on on the other hand she wasnt sure she wanted to know she was already afraid if she knew what her father knewwell she wasnt at all sure that she could keep up the brave face that she had to show the last of the heralds to accompany sendar to the war ran into the courtyard packs over their shoulders to finish kitting their companions and take their places among the rest when the very last was mounted sendar held up his hand and what little talk there had been ceased entirely you all heard my speech for the people of haven he said his voice sounding rough and tired to selenay but strong nevertheless he squinted into the morning sunlight there were dark rings under his eyes and she wondered how much he had sleptif at all i wont bore you with repeating it and besides none of you need to be told why we are doing this before winter comes some of us will die many of us will be injured no less than myself your king you are primary targets for our adversaries our enemy knows very well how important the heralds are to our strategy and as you have been aware he has made it his business in his past campaigns to eliminate as many of you as he could only the fact that i have made it my business to withhold as many of you from the front lines as i could has kept our losses to a minimum selenay blinked she hadnt realized that but of course it was true it must be there hadnt been more than four or five heralds killed in the wars for each year that there had been fighting now she knew whyand knew that sendar had not been lulled into thinking that the tedrels would eventually go away he had believed alberich believed the spies and planned for this from the beginning this is the fight that i have been holding you for sendar continued now in my turn i am going to ask you for something very very difficult you would not be heralds if you were not perfectly prepared to pay the ultimate price for valdemar so i need not ask you for courage instead i ask you for caution caution selenay thought surprised even a little shocked she was not the only one she saw eyes widen lips purse and brows furrow among those closest to her you are a finite resource sendar continued turning in his saddle so that he could meet the eyes of everyone near him it will take four long years at a minimum to replace each one of you and that assumes that enough younglings will be chosen to do so and each and every one of you is desperately needed for our strategies to work you cannot be spared so i ask you for caution care and to remember that although your duty to valdemar may mean that you face deathyour duty also requires you to live and serve no matter what the cost to you his voice took on a hard and implacable tone you must and will face the fact that there is worse than death on the field of combat and be just as prepared to live with such a fate as you are willing to die valdemar can make use of a blind heraldor an armless or legless one and all you need to do is to recall the story of lavan firestorms mentor herald pol to know that this is true valdemar can make use of even a herald who is confined to a litter with a broken neck what valdemar can make no use of is a dead herald selenay swallowed and wondered what was going through the minds of those around her she hadnt thought about that had any of the others she glanced to her left and found herself looking into the grave and grim visage of herald alberich he gave a slight tight little nod if no one else had hed thought of that and probably reminded sendar of it the silence within the courtyard was so profound that the twittering of sparrows in the trees and bushes in the neat boxes around the courtyard seemed loud and intrusive this is no war like any we have ever fought sendar continued the tedrels have nothing to lose and everything to gain if they are defeated by us here they will have lost their last best chance at the homeland that is their only goal they have nowhere to retreat to after the way they have treated their allies in karse the sunsguard will fall on them and destroy them if they lose that so alberich tells me is the message implied in the two flanking forces along the border the sunsguard will not only prevent us from engaging the tedrels in a pincer movement across the karsite border it will prevent them from coming back into karse and never believe that they do not know this they are probably counting on it to keep their own mercenary shock troops in line and under control oh selenay repressed a shiver never corner an enemy who has nothing to lose how many times had alberich drummed that into her head and now the enemy had been put into a corner a bad situation had just gotten infinitely worse sendar paused to let all that sink in no one moved no one spoke but we have everything to gain by defeating them and not just for ourselves when this war is over and we have defeated the enemy no one will ever face a single tedrel company again much less the entire nation sendar said into the waiting silence they will be finished for all time and we will defeat them his voice took on a strength and a surety that suddenly made even selenays spirits rise we will defeat them for although they call themselves and think of themselves as a nation they are not they have a body with no heart they think that the land is the nation we know better we know that valdemar is not the landand it is not just the people valdemar is a spirit a community of spirit that binds a hundred disparate peoples with a hundred different religions and ways of life into a company and a greater whole it is not a unity for that would be denying our diversity and in our diversity and our tolerance is our strength even if this enemy succeeded in driving us from this landwhich he will notvaldemar would live on if he slew all of uswhich he will notvaldemar would live on that spirit is what you fight for and will live for heralds of valdemar for you are at the heart of that spirita spirit of tolerance compassion understanding and careall things that our enemy cannot and will never understand and in the name of that spiritwe ride the cheer that rose was as spontaneous as it was heartfelt even selenay felt a cheer bursting out of her throat and she was so used to the effect that the kings speeches had on people that she had thought herself immune by now even grimfaced alberich was cheering and his expression had as much of hope in it as she had ever seen keren and ylsa cheered with tears running down their faces and they werent the only ones sendar and his companion surged forward down the drive that led out the palace gates buoyed on the wave of sound and the rest of the heralds followed and selenay with them for once nothing more than another herald another weapon to serve valdemar to the last of her strength and even beyond the king and his company of heralds and bodyguards swiftly outdistanced the baggage train those council members who elected to go to the front lines and the royal regiment they would have outdistanced anything as alberich soon discovered because they were all mounted on companionseven the bodyguards who were being carried as a matter of courtesy by unpartnered companions carried just like sets of cooperative baggagebecause these companions would not tolerate even the excuse for a bridle that the partnered ones wore alberich had known as a matter of theory just how swiftly the companions could cover ground now he discovered it as a matter of practice they could have been performing a sort of precision drill for they all used a pace that was as fast as a canter and as smooth as a running walk so smooth in fact that it was perfectly possible to strap oneself into the saddle and doze if one were tired enough their hooves didnt pound as alberich had noted before this they chimed not as loud as bells and not precisely like bells but the effect of so many of them hitting the ground together was a bit unsettling like being in the same room as a thousand wind chimes alberich was astonished it was his first experience of this ability unique to companions or to be honest it was his first conscious experience of this ability kantor must have used this pace to get him across the border into valdemar from karse now he knew why dethor had packed his sleeping roll in his saddlepacks and not with his tent he wouldnt see his tentor anything else in the baggage trainfor days or weeks neither would anyone else in this group they would have to depend on the army for shelter for a while when they got to the front lines and he supposed that they would have to hope that the weather stayed good on the way it didnt matter dethor had overseen his packing and everything he truly needed was with him he hoped that someone with similar experience had packed for selenay and the king selenay and the king already knew how to pack for this sort of trip kantor said and left it at that once out of the capital they moved down the road with a purposefulness that was positively frightening there was no way to properly convey the effectthey werent menacing but they seemed to exude a sense of needing to go somewhere in a hurry a sense that somehow made everyone move out of their way without noticing that it was happening it was uncanny the first time he saw it working he felt the hair go up on the back of his neck and kantors wordless reassurance this could have looked like some sort of parade all of the companions and their uniformed heralds with the single spots of healer green and guard blue among them it didnt alberich could tell by the faces of those who gathered to watch them pass through their towns and villages that they gave no such impression the expressions that the common folk wore were uniformly grim perhaps the people of haven had not yet grasped the seriousness of the situation but the people of the towns and villages knew it there was no cheering and the hope he saw in their faces was tinged with desperation they know dont they he asked kantor better than those in the cities everyone knows everyone in a village when their youngsters go off into the guard everyone knows every word in every letter that comes home andeveryone knows when someone isnt going to come home again ah he shifted in the saddle careful to do so with kantors stride so as not to throw him off well that was something he wouldnt know aboutletters from the front lines and a villages interest in them his mother couldnt have read a letter even if hed been allowed to send her one from the academy and he remembered for the first time in a long long while the first line of the oath he had sworn when he joined the academy the temple is your mother and your father is vkandis sunlord it was still true just not in the way that those who had listened to him swear that oath intended they stopped for the night around dusk outside a villagewhich one he didnt know they went past it too quickly for him to read the faded sign in the uncertain light the herald in the lead broke off down a side lane and the entire group followed slowing as they did so the lane was overgrown entirely grasscovered eventually bringing them to a tiny cabin set off in a clearing with no sign of any inhabitant about it thats because there isnt an inhabitant this is one of the waystations kantor told him were two days journey from haven at my usual pace three or four by horse feeling stiff though not as stiff and sore as he had expected he slowly dismounted he had read about the waystations though he had never seen one this one a little stone hut with a thatched roof looked solid enough though it wasnt very big but sheltering no more than two heralds at a time and then not for very long it didnt need to be he supposed the walls were thick and so was the door there werent any windows but inside he saw that the floor was slate and there was a stone fireplace it was a better structure than the one he and his mother had shared before she got her job at the inn the building itself was given over to sendar and selenay as their shelter six of the other heralds returned to the village for provisions while the rest alberich included made camp and saw to the comfort of their companions even the guards and healer crathach put in the time to groom and feed and water the companions they rode they completely exhausted the stores of food for the companions in the waystation bins but at least there was plenty of grazing it was fully dark by the time the six heralds who had gone after provisions returned and by then there were a couple of small fires going sleeping rolls had been arranged according to friendships or prearrangementsalberichs would be across the door of the cabin and the other bodyguards would be in close proximityand the steady munching of companions through grass was as loud as the insects and night birds alberich had expected that they would be cooking some sort of communal meal but what was brought back from the village was both unexpected and touching the villagers had given up parts of their own evening meals to send them to the heralds on their way to the front lines ham cold chicken and bread cheese and fruit cold boiled eggs sausage rolls and sweet cakes jars of pickles and packets of tea parcel after paperwrapped parcel came out of the saddlebags and net bags that the six had taken into the village to be divided equally among the lot of them sendar and selenay taking no precedence in what they got there was a bit of trading as people swapped items they didnt care as much for then things quieted down rather quickly draw straws over who washes up tonight and who does in the morning sendar suggested as conversation ceased while jaws were otherwise employed most everyone was probably as starved as alberich theyd all eaten while on the move taking out provisions that had apparently been packed by palace servants since alberich didnt recall packing the contents of the little bag on the front of his saddlea paperwrapped pair of sausage rolls and a skin of cold tea but it had been candlemarks ago and it had been a very long day someone collected enough blackandwhite beans from the waystation to equal the number of riders and put them into a bag alberich was not unhappy to find his was a black bean and when he was done with his ham and pickled beans joined the queue of those who were cleaning up now water straight from the well felt refreshing after the hard and sweaty day of riding it was going to feel cursed cold in the morning sendar and selenay got black beans as well and alberich insisted they go ahead of him there was method in this they were in the waystation and probably asleep by the time he finished and he was able to stretch himself out across the door without worrying that hed be inconveniencing them but he wondered just before he fell asleep if there was even the faintest likelihood that a village of karsites would sacrifice portions of their own meals to a troop of sunpriests and sunsguard under similar circumstances on the whole he thought not the next day followed the pattern of the first except that they had to stop at midday in a large town and several heralds went to each tavern and inn in turn to collect meat pies for all of them alberich had an idea that he would be heartily tired of meat pies and sausage rolls before the end of their journey but of course that was the least of his worries and it was better fare than hed ever gotten with the sunsguard the contrast between their grim purpose and the placid lush countryside they rode through could not have been greater alberich tried not to look too closely at the folk who came out to see them pass but he couldnt ignore them altogether and it wrung his heart to see themmiddleaged men and older women either with children or as old as the old men there were a great many children and not very many young adults he knew what that meant those that could be spared were unattached had no families to supportthey were gone in the army facing the tedrels and who knew if theyd ever return he saw that in the faces of those that they rode so swiftly past in the fear they tried not to show but if the tedrels broke through these same people would be taking up whatever arms they had to defend their livesor fleeing back up that road to havenand try as he might he could not but help look at those peaceful villages and imagine flames rising above the roofs and bodies sprawled in the streets it was better when they were riding through the countryside and maybe the others were cursed with the same sort of imagination as alberich for their pace seemed to increase just a trifle when they were going through a center of population so it went sunrise to sundown league after league of it and no end in sight it almost seemed to him as if he was caught in a peculiar nightmare riding inexorably toward a dark and dreadful fate selenay had longed for a day when she might ride out like any other herald taking to the road with her packs behind her leaving the palace and all of the stuffiness of the court behind now that day had come and she thoughtoftenthat it might have been a good idea if she had never made that particular wish she would rather have to suffer being laced into a tight gown and listen to dull speeches every day for the rest of her life than face the tedrels and it didnt matter that there would be an army between them and her she was as much afraid for the people she knew her friends the people shed been with as a trainee who would be in that army as she was for herself what was more the reason why alberich had assigned bodyguards to her for day and night was real now she understood that her life was in genuine serious dangerand worse than just her life she had learned in several sleepless nights following a long and somber talk with alberich that there was a fate worse than death the tedrels had every reason to want to take her alive and many more reasons to want to make sure that she was alive and outwardly well but not in possession of her wits anymore and there were a great many ways to ensure that she wasnt sane once they got hold of her the most obvious being to murder caryo she was used to a valdemar where the king could walk unguarded among his peoplebut her father wasnt going anywhere without his six shadows either and that shook her to the core he no longer trusted his own peopleor at least no longer trusted the ones he didnt personally know it would have made her weep if she hadnt been too frightened to cry the heavy leaden feeling of fear increased day by day it hung over all of them making conversation stilted and unnatural punctuating the silences and making it impossible to enjoy the fragrant picturesque countryside through which they rode the enforced close presence of her father quiet and grave with worry or absent altogether as he mindspoke with the heralds relaying a momentbymoment summary of what was going on with the enemy and with their own forces was a greater burden than she allowed him to guess she couldnt lean on him for comfort for alberich and talamir were right he was already taking on more than he should she could only thank all the gods that ever were for caryo at least she had someone to turn to even if that someone couldnt actually do any more than she could it helped immeasurably when in the dark of some waystation unable to sleep she could unburden her heart to another who would understand and in moments when she could steal away a little with keren or ylsa pointedly not looking at her that she could pretend to groom caryo and cry into her soft shoulder there were times when selenay wondered if they would ever reach the army but more times when she hoped they never would so long as they rode she could put off the day when everything would change so long as they rode she was safe safe as only a herald in the company of heralds could be so long as they rode the army had not yet met the enemy and she could pretend that they never would nevertheless the companions even her beloved friend carried them inexorably to that confrontation and it was almost a relief when that day did come almost the waiting might be over but now she was here she heard the army long before she saw it the hum of a city many times the size of haven transported to the rolling hills of the southland and long before she heard it there were other signs of it provisioning wagons going toward it full and away from it empty messengers pounding up or down the road there were other signs more ominous signs the countryside was empty it was empty because insofar as it was possible to get the people to leave it had been evacuated there wasnt a sheep on the hillsides or a farmer in the fields the fields that no longer held sheep did hold something else grazing on the rich emerald grass grass that the tedrels desired for their own herds the horses the oxen the mules of the army grazed therenot the horses of the cavalry which were kept within the camp but the horses that drew the carts that supplied the army the horses that carried messengers when the message was not urgent enough for a herald common horses but for the most part better by far than any that these hills had seen before but when they finally reached the outskirts of the encampment it was something of an anticlimax for it looked like nothing more than an ordinary army camp they topped a hill and saw the edge of the camp below them across the slow river that split the valley in half on the other side of a stone bridge sentries guarded the road there the visible token of the ones selenay could not see beyond the sentries rows of pale canvas tents rows of tents that were as even as furrows in the soil that marched up the other slope and crowned the top of the hill a strange and martial crop of spears and pikes planted in stands beside them and yet it was no larger an encampment than ones she had seen before on the edge of the city she knew abstractly that it wasnt possible to see all of it from any one point not in these hills she knew that in her mind but the emotional impact of so great a force as they had gathered together should leave her breathless or so she felt so as the sentries barring the road demanded and received passwords she felt oddly disappointed but then they followed the sentrys directions down the road with properly arranged ranks of whitewashed canvas tents on either side each section with a central campfire each four sections serviced by a larger cook tent and as they continued to ride forward the ranks of tents went on and on and on until she began to lose count over the next hill and down the other side the tents ranged on before them interrupted only by trees and hedgerows the racks of pikes and spears piercing the sky beside them then the tents were interrupted by a drill ground full of guardsmen at practice followed by another hill another little valley and yet more tents and another drill ground then a farmhouse taken over by officers full of comings and goings with the yard crowded with horses snorting and switching their tails at flies and when they didnt stop there at what she had thought was the command post that was when it hit her just how big their army was selenay tried to imagine it and failed she had seen several hundred people at once many times even several thousand crowded into one of the huge public squares in haven for some speech of her fathers but never more than a fraction of the number that must be assembled here now and that number didnt include healers and heralds eitherand there were probably a lot of bards here too for you couldnt keep a bard away from something like this then there were all of the support people cooks and carters laundresses and tailors the servants of anyone highborn no wonder her father had put off assembling this huge a force until now where would he have housed them how long could he have kept them fed the logistics were mindboggling she couldnt imagine the amount of coordination it took just to feed this army for a single day let alone care for it for the past several fortnights how could it have been organized in the first place who was doing the training who was keeping the place clean for the havens sake no wonder talamir kept telling her father to delegate more now she knew why alberich couldnt be jollied into a better humor he knew this was coming of course well so had she but unlike her alberich had known very well how large a force the tedrels had when they decided to commit all of it for their army was just equal to the one that the tedrels were fielding and only just her heart went cold and she was suddenly desperately urgently wanting to run away to turn caryo and go so far north that not even the tedrels would find her there were places up therethe forest of sorrows for onewhere you could lose an entire regiment of cavalry and not find them for years one girl on a single companion could stay hidden until the rivers ceased to flow the truth of it was she could do that and no one would blame her if she did some people would even applaud her wisdom in giving the tedrels one less available target but if she did that some people would lose heart and she had no way of knowing how many it might be enough to make a difference and she could not take that chance she could not do much here but this by her very presence one slim girl facing down the enemy daring him to try and take her she might give heart to those who were actually doing the fighting and she could take some of the burdennot much but somefrom her father so she couldnt run away and she dared not show how afraid she was but she was very glad that she had reins to hold they kept her hands from shaking she had thought that they would stop at that farmhousebut no they went on past more tents more drill grounds until she wondered if they would ever make an end the practice grounds were all in useno slacking going on in this army and welldrilled these fellows were too alberichs practiced eye ran over the troops and he was pleased with what he saw better than anything in karse eh chosen kantor asked smugly as the men lunged and recovered in time to their leaders chants spears this lot had with crossbraces like on a boar spear that kept the enemy from coming at you once youd stuck him it made them a little awkward to handle in a group but that was what practice was for not better trained but bettermotivated he admitted thats as important a factor as food and weapons the trouble was of course that the core troops of the tedrels were just as highly motivated but not the shock troops and that just might make the difference the shock troops the ones meant to take the brunt of the attacking were the flotsam that the tedrels had lured to their ranks with promises of loot and blood once it was their blood that got shed the question was how well theyd stick valdemar had that working in their favor in numbers if all of their foreseers and spies were right valdemar and the tedrels were evenly matched but not perhaps in motivation greed might be motivation enough kantor said soberingly dont count on them to turn once the fighting gets bloody most of them have seen plenty of fighting its not as if they were a lot of sheepherders dragged in by fasttalking drummers his eye lingered on a group of spearmen and pikemen trainingspears in the first two ranks pikes in the next two pikemen were traditionally the positions of the least trained although there was some skill involved in handling a pike it was not much different from handling a boar spear and involved more following orders than thinking there was some clumsiness but not enough to make him think that they were entirely fresh there was a great deal of determination their clothing beneath their valdemaran tabards told him that they were farmers other men might deride farmersturnedsoldiers not he farmers knew what they were fighting for farmers were used to death and killing for they did it every autumn when they killed the cattle and swine that would feed them through the winter the average citydweller might never see meat that was not already rendered into its component parts the farmer had raised that meat from a baby and had resisted his childrens efforts to name it and make a pet of it killing a cow was easier than killing a man not when the farmer had delivered the cow as a calf had agonized over its illnesses had called it to its food every day for all of its life brought it all unaware into the killing shed and stared into its eyes before killing it whereas the man he faced was a stranger was hidden in his helm and wanted to kill him then wanted to take his land his goods and his women a farmer would have no difficulty in making the decision to kill a man no he was happy to see farmers here it was the citydwellers the craftsmen that he was concerned about it was one thing to train and look proficientit was quite another thing to hold yourself together in combat he glanced at his charge selenay was looking white about the lips he wondered why she understands now what were facing kantor replied its hit her in her gut in her heart just how big our army is and by extension how big theirs is and all that this implies ah well he felt sorry for her but better now than later better now when she would have time to gather the courage he knew she had and compose herself before the eyes of those who would fight for her sake for the sake of valdemar kantor corrected it is the same he countered as he spotted the convocation of larger fancier tents that marked the center of the army and the seat of its leadership what with bodyguards sentries servants and all it had been too big a convocation to house in any farmhouse a philosophical difference perhaps kantor replied to you a real one to us they reached the periphery of the tents a boundary marked by another set of sentries stationed every few paces around the edge the edge was defined by what appeared to be ornamental swags of rope hung between stakes it wasnt ornamental and it was a device suggested by alberich hidden amid the fringe and bullion were bells very loud bells and anyone who so much as brushed against those ropes would raise a very audible alarm one couldnt climb over it or crawl under it a small thing but one more barrier between his charges and harm the lord marshal was taking no chances it was the lord marshal who had suggested the second innovation a layer of black felt lining the inside of the tents so no one would be silhouetted against the canvas by lights within another small thing but it would make the king his heir and the officers less of a set of targets once night fell unless a spy was able to watch them closely one wouldnt even know when they were in their tents the lord marshal himself was there to greet them and alberich moved closer to selenay as they all dismounted this would be another good time to strike at her in the moment when everyone was a trifle relaxed at the end of the journey but kantor had made a statement that needed to be answered she is not valdemar then let her become valdemar he said fiercely men fight better when the symbol of what they fight for is before them why do you think we carry a shrine of vkandis before us when we wage war he actually took kantor aback for a moment an interesting observation the companion replied and left it at that it was as well that he did for alberichs attention was elsewhere nowscanning every face and every body around them evenno especiallyamong the servants of the highborn that was the place for a traitor to slip in among the servants he watched without seeming to watch a good trick he had acquired in the taverns of the worst part of haven there were a great many tricks he had acquired there or learned from dethor and he had taught most of them to selenays six and sendars too or at least as many as he could impart to them in the short time he had to school them he was pleased to see that they were using those lessons pleased to see that the ones guarding sendar were doing likewise they were more obvious in their watchfulness but there was no harm there they drew attention to themselves and if there was anyone watching them he would spot the watchers layers upon layers of care and misdirection of planning and deception and upon them selenay and sendars lives might depend the moment passed the king and heir moved into the circle of guards and canvas thin protection or so it seemed but stronger than one might guess for they were out of the milling crowd where a knife could be employed suddenly and without warning and into a more controlled place where more watchers watched the watchers he joined them in the background always in the background now more than ever he needed to be unnoticed how ironic that he who had trained for most of his life to be a leader should now require of himself to be insignificant how ironic that he should find as he dropped back to be a shadowherald in his dark gray leathers that he preferred the place in the shadows to the one in the light he watched young selenay as whitelipped but with her head held high she took her place beside her father at the planning table and then he turned his attention to those around his king and his charge he knew what the strategy for the initial stages of battle would be at least for now it had been discussed and discussed until it was tattered he knew and he feared that the enemy knew but it had been too late to prevent them from knowing when the strategy was decidedand as he himself had told dethor no strategy survives the first engagement you could plan and plot all you liked but when your plans depended on the enemy doing what you thought he would do it wasnt likely that hed cooperate with you now all they could do was see what he did and trust that they could move to counter it whatever it turned out to be chances were it wouldnt be anything they had planned for the tedrel warlords had not survived this long by being stupid if anything they were entirely too clever that very cleverness had caused any ruler who might consider hiring them to take a good long look and realize that they were in many ways as much a danger to the one who had hired them as they were to the enemy they were sent against so no one in all the time they had been roaming had ever before hired the entire nation broken up into companies they were safe to have inside your borders only the sunpriests in an act of monumental hubris had gathered all the companies together in one place now the sunpriests were well aware of their folly too late to do them or valdemar any good we cannot simply turn them back he thought with anguish if we do they will only turn on my people and of all of those here in this camp he was the only one who would care if they did but what else could he have done except to act as he had he hauled his divided attention back to where it belonged and kept it on selenay and those around her the tents were dark thanks to the felt lining them the only light came from the entrance and the unlined canvas tops the bases had been rolled up to ankleheight to allow air to circulate the interior of the one they were in was sparsely appointedthat would change when the baggage train caught up with themand for now the only seating was on folding stools sendar was offered one of these and refused it selenay did not talamir called for food and drink and when it came made sure that both the king and heir availed themselves of it sendar was of course completely immersed in all the reports of the commanders even though there was nothing new in them selenay was looking wan but alberich did not suggest that she retire to her own tent she had to harden herself they all had to harden themselves to go beyond what they thought they could do until there was no more strength left then find more strength somewhere somehow as if she had heard his thought she turned her head toward him and met his eyes then she rose and took her place at her fathers side paying every bit as much attention to the reports as he was although the king did not even glance at her alberich watched as he placed his hand on her shoulder tacitly welcoming her presence and showing any who doubted that she belonged there good now no one would suggest that she get some rest dismissing her as irrelevant to their discussions a movementan odd movementcaught his eye without turning his head he identified the movement as someone pulling slightly away rather than leaning toward the group his peripheral vision was excellent better perhaps than anyone guessed for he had no trouble telling who it was without betraying his interest by looking at the man it was orthallen who was serving as the commander for the militia of his sector his brows were furrowed his posture tense and he was frowning at selenay orthallen there were some singular holes in alberichs intelligence regarding orthallen at that moment alberich wished that hed spent a little more time trying to fill them but in the very next instant orthallens frown vanished to be replaced by his usual affable expression apparently leavened by worry and if alberich hadnt seen the transformation he would have thought that the expression was genuine now however he was aware that it was a mask one that orthallen could don in the blink of an eye and very seldom dropped a mask over what one wonders alberich forced himself to be charitable all he saw was a frown which might have been occasioned by anything that orthallen didnt approve of anyone as young as selenay being privy to every bit of war planning going on that orthallen didnt like the prospect of a queen instead of a king that orthallen didnt approve of a female being involved in war planning that orthallen had indigestion perhaps not that last although being on the doorstep of the final campaign of a nasty war was enough to give anyone worse than indigestion the likeliest was that orthallen had suddenly been confronted with the fact that he would one day be serving a queen instead of a king and given the urgency of the current situation one day might be a great deal closer than he thought and he didnt like the prospect it had been some time since valdemar had had a queen there wasnt anyone now alive who remembered the last oneit had been a good long time after all and she had been a coconsort ruling with her king sendars grandfather sendars queen whod had no interest in being coconsort had died when selenay was a mere infant and orthallen had a good reason to be wary of the problems associated with a female ruler women did die in childbirth and even if selenay wedded someone chosen who could be a coconsort there could be trouble if she died the kingdom had been left to the council to rule while sendar had gotten over his beloved wifes death if that had happened when there was a crisis like this one looming the result could have been a disaster could have been but would not have been perhaps orthallen couldnt understand that he wasnt a herald he didnt know what deep wells of comfort the companions were and he might not understand just how totally heralds were driven by duty if sendar had had to deal with a crisis even in the moment of his beloveds death he would have that he gave himself over to mourning was only because he knew he had the luxury of doing so nevertheless alberich did not like that frown on orthallens face there was something about orthallens expression that he couldnt pin down and his instincts said it was more than just one older man concerned about the possibilities that a young woman heir represented it must have come as a distinct shock to him seeing her here seeing her being briefed instead of being sent to a tent to rest its one thing to see the child sitting at a council table its quite a different thing to see her sitting here after all just because selenay had a council seat it didnt follow that she was truly a part of the councils deliberations the seat could have been nothing more than show for certainly selenays vote went with her fathers every time given orthallens patronizing attitude toward the heir the shock of realizing that she was a power to be reckoned with and had a mind of her own must have been unpleasant but was it unpleasant enough to cause that particular kind of frown it hadnt been the look of a man surprised and a little offended it had been the expression calculating and angry of one who had not realized that there was a roadblock to his plans or so alberich thought but everything he thought hed observed was all in retrospect for the expression hadnt been there more than a moment it was distinctly frustrating not to be able to quantify his feelings but since hed been working in the slums of haven his instincts had sharpened and hed come to depend on what they told him therefore he would keep an eye on lord orthallen so he delegated a portion of his mind to doing just that and turned the rest of his attention back to the briefing that sendar was getting the lord marshal and his herald joyeaus were getting to the end of things alberich already knew and they looked as if there was more to say a great deal more and that it was bad news the foreseers are reporting difficulty majesty as are the farseers herald joyeaus said her thin face was set in an expression of solemn thoughtfulness for this development was something newthough not unexpected at least not to alberich the fact was he was surprised that it had taken so long for the tedrels to block attempts to farsee what they were doing possibly they had not realized that the heralds could do such a thing with the amount of accuracy they had possibly they had been blocking attempts to scry magically and had not until now reckoned on the gifts possibly they had been saving their mages for this moment or possibly it had taken them this long to buy or coerce magical expertise it seemed to take the rest by surprise though all but the lord marshal who looked grim exactly what do you mean by difficulty joyeaus sendar asked joyeaus mask didnt slip but alberich didnt have to be an empath to know that she was very worried as you know majesty my own strongest gift is farseeing and although when i look elsewhere i have no difficulties when i look across the border i might as well be looking into fog in concert with two others i made further attempts but we managed no more than glimpses which were confusing at best the foreseers tell me that they are unable to see anything when they attempt to scry into the future but as we all know foreseeing is chancy at best sendar finished for her the most probable answer to that is that there are so many possibilities branching from this moment that they are unable to see even one clearly i am more concerned by the report from the farseers can farseeing be blocked officers and councilors began murmuring nervously among themselves and shifting their weight alberich pulled at his collar feeling stifled suddenly and wondering if he was the only one who found the rising tension in the tent to be edging close to panic i joyeaus hesitated alberich was astonished that she did so how could she not know that it could be blocked how could she not have expected that enemy mages would do so and yet from the way she looked and the way sendar acted it seemed that the possibility had never even occurred to them alberich didnt want to step out of the shadows and draw attention to himself but he didnt seem to have a choice no one else saw the blindingly obvious he cleared his throat the sound was shocking in the silence that had followed sendars question every head in the tent swiveled in his direction herald alberich sendar prompted senior highrank sunpriests such powers have he said carefully and unscrupulous others with magic for hire are in the southern kingdoms among the tedrels there may be magicians though specifically i have not of such heard they looked at him as if he had spoken in karsite not valdemaran maybe in a way he had he cursed his lack of fluency and the need to speak without composing what he was going to say he tried again this time coming directly to the point assume you must that others than heralds gifted are surely sunpriests are for this i know surely tedrels are for they are a nation and some must gifted be yes blocked your gifts can be joyeaus blinked and looked as if she was coming out of a daze hes right majesty she said we have been remiss in assuming that only heralds are giftedand that just because we dont know ways of blocking gifts it doesnt follow that someone else hasnt found a way so the gifts are useless asked one councilor his voice sounding strained no noonly farsight and foresight joyeaus hastened to say mindspeech works perfectly well and fetching as well at least as far as we can tell weve never depended on foresight its too rare a gift and too erratic anyway i can vouch for that alberich thought grimly and weve never depended entirely on farsight either selenay put in her high young voice carrying over the muttering and yes there was rising panic in those voices of those around her wed be fools to depend on any single source of intelligence gentlemen you may depend upon it there are other ways of finding things out at a distance including she added with a touch of irony common spies animal mindspeech replied someone alberich couldnt tell who precisely for the background chatter distorted the sound the voice was female though and very confident the chronicles say that the hawkbrothers of the pelagiris forest use animal mindspeech with their birds as spies surely we can do the same or listen through the ears of a horse or hound the muttering subsided and what there was of it sounded less panicky sendar turned to joyeaus deal with it joyeaus find the heralds with animal mindspeech see what you can do ask myste whats in the chronicles perhaps the heralds of our generation have not needed to worry about their gifts being blocked but theres no reason to think it hasnt happened in the past somewhere and if anyone will know where when and what was done about it it will be myste sire joyeaus bowed and edged her way out of the crowd no wonder the voice had sounded familiar and he felt that familiar apprehension whenever he thought of the halfblind heraldchroniclerintraining well at least hed given her enough skill to get herself out of trouble if she had to and he could count on her strong instinct for selfpreservation to keep her out of the fighting itself unless of course there was no other choice but if that happened everyone in a white uniform with a mount that was even vaguely pale in color was going to be in danger the tedrels knew better than to let a single herald escape alive it has to be sunpriests that are helping them though no mage worth the name would serve karse or the tedrels no mage worth the name will serve where the mercenary guild wont even one of the bloodpath mages wouldnt serve the tedrels in part because the tedrels themselves would know better than to trust one of that sort you didnt want a bloodpath mage around when sacrifices ran short they tended to grab whoever was closest that didnt make things any better however the sunpriests had power everyone knew about the invisible creatures they commanded that stalked the night able to see into a mans very soul and discern if he was a heretic and a traitor and thus their lawful prey he himself had heard them howling in the distance then why didnt they take you kantor asked with none of the ironic humor he might have put into such a question because i am no heretic he replied with none of the sharpness he might have put into a reply because kantor was not teasing him and deserved candor i follow the writ as well as i may and though i often fail failure does not make a heretic blasphemy does they hunt those who would deny vkandis not the sinner if they hunted sinners there would be no man or woman safe in karse and precious few children and as for their other prey i am no traitor to karse or my people there was heat in his last sentence though he couldnt help himself and kantor reacted to it peace i only asked to see what it was that these creatures that haunt your darkness might seek he said soothingly i suspect in part it is a feeling of guilt and in part the fear that such guilt would cause especially in those who think that such creatures can read their souls and know that the sunpriests would not approve of what is there well that was a novel suggestion and it was one he would think about in depthand perhaps discuss with myste since she was herebut later for now since the mere mention of the fact that other peoples had as much or more magic at their disposal as the heralds did seemed to cause sendar and the others to act as if they were momentarily stunned he had other things to worry about take it as read you and the other companions that the sunpriests are going to try to block whatever gifts we use he advised i dont know how well sendar and joyeaus understood what i was trying to tell them and even now he truly didnt understand how the possibility hadnt even occurred to them we probably cant do anything about farsight and foresight but i defy them to block mindspeech with the companions boosting it kantor said with determination and we might even be able to boost the other gifts on an irregular basis good enough now for the rest he waited until there was a gap in sendars orders and interrupted majesty he said clearly with a touch of sharpness if blocking farsight the enemy suddenly is when until now he has not then is it not that he does not want to be seen and steps is taking of that to make certain and that would bewhy sendar stared at him a moment his brow furrowed and again alberich cursed his lack of expertise in valdemaran but it would have taken him a quartercandlemark to work out how to say it clearly and they didnt have the time the others just stared at him probably trying to untangle his mangled syntax as well selenay who was far more used to the way he spoke uttered an oath that would have made one of the muleteers blush theyre moving she saidno shoutedbefore her father could rebuke her for her language father the tedrels they knew wed be watching them they didnt care until this moment since all wed see is their troops building but now they dont want us to see them because theyre moving sendar swore in language even stronger than selenays and there was no doubt in alberichs mind where shed learned to curse so fluently but he put up his hand to quell the raised voices around him stilling an incipient panic with a single gesture alberich hoped that selenay was taking note this was the sort of thing a monarch needed to be able to do by sheer force of personality even if they could flywhich they cannotthey could not be at our border before three days have elapsed sendar pointed out since they must move on their feet and those of their horses it will be longer than that we have a dual taskto find another way to gain the intelligence that farsight would have given us and to prepare the army to meet them the former is in the hands of joyeaus and myste and if any two heralds can find what is needed in the past they can so my friends let us bend our minds to the latter for it is time to finish our strategies that is what we can do alberich withdrew a little for at the moment he was best as an observer no battle plan survives the first encounter with the enemy he reminded himself hed reminded myste of that truism often enough as well with luck shed remember it and she and joyeaus would add several more layers to their plotting and if he paid a little more attention to orthallen than the rest well that also was part of his responsibility it was not only an enemy that could do damage sometimes the danger came from within and the one who brought it could even have all of the best intentions in the world it was a very small tentmore like a pavilion actually showing old and muchfaded colors on its canvaspitched among the slightly untidy cluster of those belonging to heralds assigned to the king and his officers no two of these tents were alike taken as they were from whatever was available after the guard the officers the king and his servants were done picking over the available canvas but this one stood out for both its inconvenient size and its shabby state as the sun dropped toward the horizon alberich looked at it askance surely not my home away from home myste said gesturing at the canvas square with its peaked top she held the flap open to let him in this must be the oddest campaign tent i have ever seen alberich remarked as he squeezed himself into the tent that myste had taken ducking his head to avoid the low crossbeams its certainly the smallest myste shrugged thats probably why no one else was particularly eager to take it i think it must have been cut down after the canvas around the bottom started to rot and stitched together with replacements because the floor is newer than the sides and top he had expected something entirely different a tent that was more a semiportable library well there were books but nowhere near as many as hed expected his glance at the neat packing case that served as a bookcase as soon as the cover was unstrapped made her smile i brought copies of war chronicles and some odd bits and nothing more than would fit in that case she said only copies if the army retreats and i have to flee with nothing more than the uniform on my back may the tedrels have joy of them he didnt tell her what he thought the tedrels would use the paper for he just folded his legs under him and sat on the canvas floor and this is interesting he pointed at the arrangement where anyone else would have had a cot or a bedroll he thought there might be a cot under there but one third was propped up to serve as a chair back and the opposite end dropped down and the rest had a strange tray raised over it on some sort of folding legs with everything needed for writing arranged atop it a brazier no bigger than the palm of his hand stacks of very cheap woodpulp paper graphite sticks and pen and ink and a lantern she could hang on the tent pole overhead which she did at that very moment raising the chimney after it was hung to light it with a coal from the tiny brazier and a moment later she sprinkled the coal with a powder that sent up a haze of insectrepelling incense she grinned as she saw what he was looking so closely at thats my invention bed chair and table in one and it all comes apart and fits together it even makes part of its own case my clothes and bits are packed in the back half under the cot and the desk is the top and since weve got messengers going to haven twice a day anyway they take what ive written with them whenever they go no matter what happens we wont lose more than half a days rough notes from meetings and anything else i know about and if everything goes pearshaped elcarth will at least have a record of what led up to it she swung the desk away on a pivoting arm and sat down he hoped that losing a halfdays rough draft would remain her only concern for all that the bed thing was amazingly compact there wasnt much room left in her tent hed seen her rooms at the collegium she was a woman addicted to clutter and a collector of things this sparse minimalism was totally unlike the myste he knew she gave him a side glance as if she guessed what he was thinking and a half smile which swiftly sobered joy and i have had our little conference and we have some plans and you were right there have been times when gifts have been blocked andoh do hold back your surprised lookby karsites but there are things we can do and they have never managed to block mindspeech on our side of the border or battle line whichever came first another point of interest if you will is that since lavan firestorms time apparently they have been unable to coax those nightstalking things you were talking about anywhere near the border because they havent appeared at all over here now can i count on that continuing do you think alberich chewed on his lower lip and considered what he knew he had only heard the things in the distance and had never asked any sunpriest about them but then one didnt ask them interest in what they sent out might cause them to suspect guilt or worse heresy but it did occur to him that although he had never heard them too near the border the reason for that was probably less than arcane the sunpriests would not risk themselves anywhere near the border and they probably had to be within a certain proximity to their charges to control them and if the tedrels were providing a screen of bodies they wouldnt hesitate to follow however the situation at the moment suggested that the sunpriests had a great deal more to concern themselves over than their ancient enemies i thinki think perhaps that even if the sunpriests could send their servants across the border at this point they wouldnt i believe that they hold them back in reserve to make certain the tedrels after conquering valdemar do not turn on them as well he raised an eyebrow consider if you will the troops we know are flanking the tedrels the ones my spies said are not to cross the border no i think the nightdemons will stay within karse that is a distinct relief she made a note amid the rest on the desk at her side then closed her eyes for a moment she looked tired and he wondered how long she had been here for he hadnt noticed her among the heralds around the king it is one small blessing he replied another is that our troops have limited choice of ground given where we think they must come and a greater blessing is that our troops will be fresh all they have to do is stop overnight their troops will be just as fresh as ours she pointed out they know we wont cross the border but frankly all i know about battles and war is what ive read and everything ive read just makes me want it all to go away unless he is a madman alberich said soberly i believe you will find that even the great generals feel the same she looked down at her hands may i ask you a horrible favor he was going to say it depends on the favor but something about the way she had asked that question made him answer unequivocally yes instead she fixed him with that glittering gaze of eyes shielded behind thick glass lenses shielded was a good thoughtshe probably used those lenses as shields to hide what she was thinking may i stop pretending that im brave and cheerful around you i feel as if i can trust you more even than the rest of the heralds i mean youve seen me at my worst i suppose and you seem to know somehow why i have to be here she shrugged helplessly and i do its important that a chronicler be here and it cant be elcarth since he cant make himself detached enoughbut its also important that someone be here who knows history because things that have been done in the past are likely to solve a problem now i darent pretend im anything other than insanely optimistic around anyone else joy is not entirely certain i should even be hereor at least she wasnt until this afternoonand if they have any idea how terrified i am theyll be certain ill freeze up at the worst moment and try to send me back he felt his expression softening and for once he let it how odd to see her looking vulnerable it wasnt that she ever attempted to look warriortough but she wore this facade of cool indifference even when hed been training herwhen she wasnt wearing an aura of annoyed irritation he didnt think he had ever seen her look so helpless much less on the verge of tears he held up his hand to stop her of course you can he said with sympathy that surprised even him and although i did not expect to see you here i understand what you can do that no one else can the amount of information you must carry about in your mind is astonishing not so much that as i know where to look for things i can ask elcarth to find what i need and he can fetch handwritten notes down here she shook her head i cant do that from up there in haven it depends on being in a meeting and seeing a problem and knowing where to look for an answer and telling people that there is an answer right then before they get hysterical you have to be there to know what priority to put on the problem reports dont tell you that but nobody wants me here they look at me and see a halfblind clumsy liability whos likely to be in the way or worse need rescuing so i have to put up a facade so they dont find another reason to send me back he hesitated as the weaponsmaster i am concerned that you are the person least able to defend herself here which is why im petrified she replied in a very small voice and i want to go home but i cant and i wont and i wont ask anyone else to look out for me i never thought for a moment that you would the tent was so small he could easily reach over and pat her shoulder which he did awkwardly her face crumpled but she didnt cry just as well women in tears unnerved him she did put her own hand up to hold his on her shoulder though and he didnt mind bollocks you like it you stay out of my head he said sharply or at least be quiet about being there kantor wisely did not reply dont think i want you to take care of me either she continued even though she was shaking i dont i can take care of myself even if im not a good fighter i wont freeze up and will be sensible and be the first to run away if the time comes to retreat i didnt think you would ask not for a moment as your weaponsmaster although i am concerned i am certain that i have trained you well and i trust you to be intelligent enough to do what you must he tightened his hand on her shoulder but as your weaponsmaster you need not be brave with me in fact if you have concerns and feel you cannot voice them to others do tell me the night stalkers for instance that was a reasonable thing to consider she sighed and some of her shaking eased im not a brave person she said reluctantly actually im rather a coward im afraid of so much its easier to say what im not afraid of i think about what can go wrong all the time it keeps me awake at night and it makes me want to dig a hole and hide in it and even if things dont go wrong its still going to be horriblepeople dying and blood and painand its one thing to read about battles but its something else to have one happening around you there were so many things he could have saidthat she was right to be afraid that she would be less afraid if she stopped thinking so constantly about all the dire possibilitieshe said none of them for none of them seemed quite right and after a moment she let go of his hand and he took it back with a touch of reluctance which felt a bit odd because you dont know how to act around a woman who might be more than a friend but isnt either out of bounds or a whore kantor said bluntly wellthat was true enough but this was no time to try and learn how later perhaps if there was a later and now who is dwelling on the dire possibilities she took a deep breath squared her shoulders and turned those glittery lenses in his direction with a wan smile thank you for being my friend as well as my weaponsmaster and fellow herald alberich it helps to have someone human i can be at ease with he nodded as you help me think of the relief i feel not only to drop my mask but to have someone with whom i can speak my native tongue he managed a wry smile perhaps you can help me with my valdemaran so we dont have a repetition of that scene in sendars tent only selenay understood me myste shook her head at least it made her look very competent and gave her credit a strong boost poor little selenay i hope she can find someone to take her mask off with if no one else it will be me he promised reading the request for exactly what it was then he deemed it time for a change of subject now what else have you found in those chronicles all the routes that your people have ever used to come at us she reached under her cot and pulled out a roll which proved to be a map i traced them all on this very useful the hilly sometimes mountainous terrain along the border only permitted so many practical routes for an invading force and here they all were or at least as much about them as the valdemarans knew since most of karse was unknown land to them but he knew the border if not as well as hed like certainly better than anyone here and perhaps with the help of some of the farseeing heralds or the ones with animal mindspeech who could see through the eyes of a highsoaring hawk he would be able to fill in the terrain on the other side a bit and theyd know which paths and passes to watch myste i shall be sure and let it be known that you are monumentally useful he said and was rewarded with a genuine smile now i shall go and present this to sendar so that i can do that and i shall write up the next lot of notes to dispatch she tucked her legs under the tray and pulled it toward her and that was how he left her head down lamplight shining down on it an island of peace in the midst of frantic preparations for war but his night was not yet over he went to selenays tent and found her toying with the remains of her dinnera dinner which for the most part looked uneaten her two guardians were right with her and her tent was ringed with regular guardsmen he nodded with satisfaction as they challenged him then sent one of their number to fetch someone from selenays bodyguards who could verify his identity that was quite right they should never assume that someone was who he said he was if they didnt know him on sight one of the two bodyguards recognized him the moment she put her head out of the tent of course only then was he allowed inside the perimeter they had established selenay gladly put aside the plate at his entrance there were several lamps suspended overhead here which didnt matter since the felt lining the walls made it impossible for anyone to see silhouettes on the canvas he noted the arrangement of the cot in the middle of the tentnow foldedwith approval is there any news she asked her expression somber and a little pinched he shook his head that i have heard nothing but for you a task i have she actually brightened at that good i feel as if there is something i should do but i cant think of anything she reached up and tucked a strand of hair selfconsciously behind her ear i dont think there are many people besides you and father who think i should even be here he regarded her gravely come among the troops we must walk speak to them you shall this night and every night of their homes and families must you ask speak you must as your heart tells you to put heart in them to put a faceyour faceon valdemar you mean make myself some kind of mascot she asked as he gestured to her guardians to take up their weapons and follow create a symbol of a sort speak of valdemar you must not just of the evil that comes to tear her not of fear alone but of hope hope he hoped she was up to this sendar would likely be making his own forays among the troops but there was a limit to his time selenay had more of that available to her and selenay was a handsome young girl goldenblond and freshfaced and not unlike the pretty girls the men and women wearing the uniform tabards of the valdemaran army would see at home he wanted to put that face on the abstract notion of my land valdemar he wanted them to see that their leaders served them as much as they served their leaders when they saw their leaders remote and at a distance he wanted them to remember the night this one walked and talked with them but what should i say she asked sounding a little desperate as they left her tent he motioned to the sentries to stay in place mounted on companions they were as safe as they would be in a knot of guards kantor waited for them caryo came out of her leanto and alberich helped selenay throw her saddle on her ask first ask of home and family ask of their welfare then think and as your father would speak she had spent all of her life listening to her fathers speeches it was time she learned to make some of her own in fact there was very little she could say that would be wrong her mere presence out here with the troops asking after their wellbeing and their background would be enough she would be showing the concern of their monarch putting a face and a voice under the crown and word of that would spread they rode down the torchlit paths between the tents at a walk so that the two bodyguards could keep pace afoot until they came to the first campfire of common footsoldiers as fighters did the world around they had gathered around their common fire and there was talk some rough joking a small cask of beer to be shared it all stopped when two companions loomed up out of the darkness it ceased altogether when they dismounted their officer good man thought alberich recognized selenay and scrambled to his feet then tried to drop to one knee highness he stammered as selenay prevented him from going down by taking his elbow and keeping him erect just selenayahlieutenant she replied her cheeks going pink lieutenant chorran maam he said his cheeks pinker than hers his eyes anxious under an unruly thatch of dark hair well then lieutenant chorran would you make me known to your men she replied with admirable composure if alberich hadnt known this was her first foray out into an army camp he would never have guessed it she stood hands clasped gravely behind her back as lieutenant chorran introduced her to every one of the roundeyed men encircling the fire when he was done she picked one at random so nort halfdenwhat part of the world are you from she asked as if his answer was something she burned to hear boarsden maam east of haven he replied looking as if he was having to concentrate to keep from tugging his strawberryblond forelock at her i know it good grain country she smiled at him and he looked about to faint yet couldnt help beaming with pride and perfectly lovely morel mushrooms in the forest in the spring aye maam he enthused losing a little of his shyness that there be she gave him a nod of encouragement and he warmed to his subject why theres a copse just by our duck pond that that was all it took he was off about his fathers farm and that led her to single out others who looked as if they were losing their awe of her to want to boast about their own lands a leading question or two was all it needed she just gave them a cue and let them run on this lot was all farm folk though from differing parts of valdemar companies were made up of men and women though it would have to be a sturdy wench who was in the pikes who came into the force at about the same time so that they all worked through training together and got to know one another well alberich approved of the arrangement it created cohesiveness when selenay showed interest in their lives their homes and their families they swiftly warmed to her when she showed them that she was not that different from them they took her to their hearts the firelight shone on their young faces and alberich tried not to think about how very young they were how it was certain that some of them would not be going back to those homes and families it wrung his heart he reminded himself that they would only be worse off if war had come to their little farms and they had to face it all untrained but what about now she asked finally looking around your lieutenant is obviously a fine officer the best maam said one stoutly and young chorran blushed she nodded with earnest satisfaction if there is there anything you need then im sure hell see to it but are you getting enough to eat well no one and nothin is gonna fill up koan there said one fellow slyly and the rest laughed this was evidently a joke of long standing among them but barrin that it aint home here but were all right maam she looked at each earnest friendly face in turn and alberich watched them watching her intent on her it was clear that she had it that subtle charisma that marked her sire she had more than their attention she had won their loyalty my father and i want you all to get home again she said softly as the firelight made a golden halo of her hair giving her had she but known it a slightly ethereal look we want that more than anything and we want you to go right on gathering mushrooms every spring chestnuts and potan roots every fall telling tales beside the fire every winter but that isnt going to happen if they win nods all around each of them looking as if they were hearing this for the first time even though it was hardly news to any of them but we have what theyll never have she continued holding her young head high her pride in them showing in every word they dont have a home and they dont want to trouble to build one for themselves they want to steal ours they dont have families even so alberich says she gestured at alberich who contented himself with looking somber and id feel sorry for them id even invite them to come settle if theyd just asked us thats what were all about is valdemarwe dont keep people out if all they want is peace thats the way weve always been havent we murmurs of assent with a growl under it good but since these tedrels dont want peace dont want to build and only want to steal our land and homes from ustheres only one way we can meet them she continued with a look of fierce pride that would have been incongruous on such a young face but for the circumstances we didnt begin this war but by all that is holy i swear we will end it it wasnt the best speech hed ever heard but it did exactly what alberich wanted it to it galvanized them partly it was selenays personality partly it was that they wanted to find a figurehead for their cause they cheered for her and that was what counted she thanked them in a way that made them cheer for her again and when she mounted caryo she was glowing with enthusiasm and flushed with pleasure then it was off in another direction to another campfire wandering in a random fashion skipping some groups that seemed to be intent on some business or entertainment of their own going on to others who might need her speech more selenay was beginning to run out of energy and wilting a little when alberich called a halt to the visits for the night and led her and her guardians back to her tent did i she asked quietly as the encampments quieted and the fighters around them let their fires die down and sought their bedrolls well you did he assured her very well and tomorrow again you will do so and the next night and the next each time a different direction a different set of fires and know all will that their princess cares for them and thinks of them and their king cares for them and his daughter sends to see they are well so for you they will fight not for me she exclaimed for valdemar but valdemar you are he countered a face they need upon the idea that face you are she might have continued to voice her objections but they had reached her tent and he bundled her inside without standing on ceremony as soon as she had unsaddled caryo and rubbed her down sleep now he told her think and argue on the morrow and there he left her too tired really to do more than he had told her to do she let the tent flap fall shut behind her caryo ambled into the leanto that served as her stable and he mounted kantor again she has the spirit in her he told his companion with intense satisfaction as they reached his tent and he dismounted to free kantor of his burden of gear and she found words enough that were right to do the job caryo helped but youre right and this is something thats needed kantor flicked an ear back in his direction shes putting heart in them he heaved the saddle onto its stand and hung the bridle up beside it taking up a wisp of straw to give the companion a quick rubdown and they in her that was the beauty of the thing even as she gave them something tangible to fight for they gave her confidence and helped her to find her courage the more courageous she felt the more heart shed put in them there that should hold you until morning the companion gave himself a brisk shake and walked into his own leanto youre wasted as weaponsmaster kantor said thoughtfully from out of the shadows under the canvas you should have been a councilor vkandis forbid he exclaimed indignantly i would rather muck out stalls thereits a similar occupation countered kantor and his mental chuckle followed alberich all the way to his bed for days there had been nothing but drill and drill for the men plan and replan in the commanders tent every day selenay sat at her fathers side and listened putting in a word or two that was always apt always to the point every night she and alberich and her bodyguards went out to another set of campfires talking to another set of fighters he tried to see to it that she had words with every sortfrom the young knights of the heavy cavalry to the archers and pikemen from the halfwild hill folk serving as scouts to the massive brutes of the heavy foot he had his own ears to the ground and he was satisfied with what he heardas hed hoped the men and women she spoke with talked and soon it spread like wildfire across the entire army that the king and his pretty daughter were right folk worth fighting for who knew their people and cared for their people and would be right in there slogging it out with their people when the day came the mood in the army shifted imperceptibly and took on a focus that was what he wanted selenay had helped to make it happen now there was a sense of the rightness of the cause and a certainty of purpose now their leaders were not some impersonal images somewhere the king and heir had personalities and faces and were well on the way to becoming beloved beloved was excellent men and presumably women too fought fiercely for something that was beloved and should anything happen to sendar his daughter stood a fighting chance of being able to take up the reins without a pause or hesitation nor should the worst happen was there now any chance that another contender could take the throne away from hernot that any herald would try but he had to operate on the assumption that there could always be someone willing to attempt a coup certainly the common people the guard and the army would support her without a second thought should a wouldbe usurper appear he hadnt revealed that part of his plan to anyone not even kantorthough he had the feeling kantor had guessed it and approved as sendar would approve if he ever learned it himself selenay of course would be horrified which was why she would never hear of it now he sat in kantors saddle under a clear summer sky with dew still wet on the grass the planning was over it was too late now to wonder if they had overlooked anything for now it all came down to this two massive armies both rested facing each other across firm ground the tedrels had taken their time getting here and they seemed unsurprised to find the valdemaran guard waiting for them seemed was the operable word since there was no way of knowing for certain if they were surprised or not when the tedrels began to move sendar ordered the spies out and back home and they made it somehow they all made it though not entirely intact a couple were injured escaping but escape they did and the last of them had come over the border two days ago alberich hoped that was a good omen he could use a good omen for he was not at all confident about this final confrontation of all the times to have some handle on the future this would have been the best for the sake of his own spirits if nothing elseso of course he got no inklings at all if the tedrels or the sunpriests were blocking foresight they were doing a good job of it if he couldnt even get a hint of what this day would bring all he felt was akin to having an enormous wave cresting a furlong above him about to crash down on him and the sense that nothing he could do would get him out of the way which was in a figurative sense exactly what was about to happen he wouldnt describe the feeling as impending doom precisely but it certainly was a sense that events were about to overwhelm him last night the tedrels had camped just over the horizon the glow of their campfires had been clearly visible from the edge of the valdemaran camp it had made for an uneasy night on this side of the border alberich doubted that anyone had gotten very much sleep there had been scouts of all sorts out all night and double the usual guardsthe tedrels were not altogether predictable and a night attack had not been out of the question a lot of people had slept or tried to in their armor this morning there they were having marched into place in the predawn deliberately arranging their ranks on the other side of the valley quite as if they were setting up for a review or a parade looking as if theyd shown up for an appointed meeting it might just as well have been an appointed meeting alberich had no doubt that they had known since they began moving in this direction exactly where the valdemaran army was there was no reason why the tedrels should not have spies of their own and every reason why they should alberich had done his best to find them but he doubted hed made more than a significant dent in the population and when it all came down to cases it was rather difficult to hide the movement of the entire valdemaran army from much of anyone in a country that had as much freedom as valdemar the tedrel spies had no doubt counted most of the valdemaran troops and reported them on the move alberich could only hope that the tedrels believed those troops were made up of old men and inexperienced boys and girlsbasically the last possible lot of conscripts left out of a depleted population working in valdemars favor of course there werent many options open to where the tedrels came across the border given where they had made their base deep in the hills the fact that valdemar had known where that base was and had moved to block the only real access point right at the border itself might he hoped have come as a slight surprise or not if the tedrels really truly thought they had superior numbers there was no reason why they should care where the battlefield was as long as neither side had a critical advantage alberich surveyed the tedrel nation from his place at selenays side and hoped that his sinking heart didnt make itself known in his expression they filled their side of the battlefield from one side of the valley to the other and there seemed no end to them a hundred thousand two hundred thousand more surely not more sunlord help us if it is beside him with selenays silverandblue battle banner streaming above her myste sat stockstill the mask of her lenses making it impossible to tell what she was thinking but her skin was nearly as white as her companions hide myste had volunteered to take selenays banner and alberich had agreed given that it was unlikely selenays party would see real combatand if they did it was because they were fighting their way to retreat talamir had the kings battle banner much larger than selenays both were affixed in a socket behind the saddle and didnt need a free hand the way karsite banners did it was easy to tell which were the real tedrels and which the mere recruits behind those shock troops whose mounted officers had to constantly ride their lines to keep them in their places the real tedrels had formed up rank on rank of them unmoving and unmoved silent waiting their armor glittered in the morning sun each man a minute scale upon the body of some massive beast poised to claw and rend its way to valdemars heart so far away as to be just barely visible to the naked eye fluttering above the heads of the enemy at the top of the next ridge were the purple battle banners of the tedrel commanders alberich hoped that the king and lord marshal were proud of their fighters who stood rocksteady in the face of so numerous a foe two or three moons ago many of these young people had been following plows sweating at a forge or tending beastsor hauling nets tending shops working at a craft now they stared at the enemy knew they were about to fight for their lives against battletested and hardened mercenaries and did not flinch there was no sign of sunpriests alberich strained his eyes in every direction to be sure but they simply werent there and his heart which had sunk down into the soles of his feet rose as far as his ankles thank you lord vkandis giver of life awful in majesty sire the lord marshal said quietly at sendars right your orders this side of the valley is valdemar that side is karse said sendar in a low but clear voice we will not provoke this fight though they have attacked us every summer for the past three years we will not provoke them and we will not cross the karsite border if they insist on having this confrontation they must break the peace and the border for we will not sendar sounded completely calm quite composed as if he did not care whether the tedrels came or not alberich glanced at selenays six all were mounted surrounding her the guards on ordinary horses rather than companions well not quite ordinary horses these were the big ugly fighting horses out of ashkevron manor trained by horsetalkers who were trained by shinain or so it was claimed knights of valdemar dreamed of being able to own a single one of these beasts in a lifetime and alberich had never seen more than three in all of the time hed been in haven but ashkevron manor had sent enough of their finest to mount every one of the bodyguards that wasnt a herald they carried their armor a set of hinged plates that protected vulnerable head chest and flank as if it weighed no more than a bit of barding each of the guards had been schooled by one of the horsetalkers in how to handle their brutes and had not just learned to ride them but had bonded in a sense with them the results were impressive they were pleasant enough in corral and under saddle but alberich pitied the man who met them in a fight a single touch of the knee and a shouted command and an enemy would be pulp and if the horses were attacked first their attacker would be pulp without the signal or the command those horses were much heavier than any companion save kantor so the guards and crathach the healer were in the point position for both the king and heir carrying wide shields to ward off missiles coming from the front the companions wore lighter armor of chain and leather probably proof against arrows probably not against axes everyone was armored even lean jadus everyone had a shield even though jadus wouldnt use one in a fight ifno say whenarrow storms fell theyd all trained in locking those shields overhead in the formation called the turtle to protect selenay and sendar the archers would have to be in range first thoughthat was what the heralds used to judging their firing distance would be watching for wheres their cavalry he wondered suddenly as he realized that the only mounted troops in sight were the officers commanding the front ranks i know they have cavalry theyve had them before so where are they no time to say anything about his sudden thought at that moment a faroff trumpet sounded and with a roar the tedrel shock troops flowed down the side of the hill carrying with them a wall of sound their running feet making the ground shake in a moment they had crossed the little stream at the bottom and sobroke the peace and began the war as they pounded toward the waiting lines the valdemaran front ranks braced spearmen butting their weapons on the ground and kneeling behind them the pikemen also braced their longer weapons and stood fast and behind them the archers waited arrows to bow for their officers to call the first volley hoi the call came a little ragged as the first line of shouting men their running feet pounding the meadow grass flat set foot on valdemaran soil the sound of a thousand bows snapping a thousand arrows swishing into the air was like a wind a perilous wind the archers aimed up so as to clear their own ranks and not at any specific targets for with the enemy so thick enough arrows would hit to make a difference the wind went up the deadly rain came down and hoarse battle cries turned to screams of pain as arrows found seams in plate or chainmail insufficiently fitted or tended heads without helms or helms without visors and some men went down and the ranks behind them stumbled over their bodies but it wasnt enough to blunt the charge screams of pain joined the sound of battle cries and pounding feet now alberich entered that singular state of hyperawareness that a fight put him into he saw everything but was affected emotionally by nothing his feelings just vanished for the moment leaving his mind clear and his body ready to act or react he knew he would pay for this later when all of that suppressed emotion hit him but for now he tightened his hands on his weapons and watched and waitedand in a terrible sense enjoyed the noise was incredible it battered the senses and it had a strange effect on the mind he knew this of old knew that the quickening of his pulse and the sudden surge of bloodthirstiness was due to the very noises that assailed his ears whether any of the others were affected in the same way he didnt know for certain but he suspected they were more or less certainly the men of his company had been some more than others at the first sound of battle some of them had nearly gone mad with bloodlustbut those did not last very long they were first into the fight charging in with no care for themselves spear catchers was what seasoned commanders called that sort hoi the best archers of valdemar were good none better they could if need be get off two more volleys while the first was hitting the enemy again the whirring as much like the sound of an immense flock of birds as a wind again the deathdealing rain rattled downand still they fell and still they came behind the ranks of charging men their archers walked in slowly and now it was their turn to come into play the spearmen and pikemen were protected by their armor and helms and stood fast the valdemaran archers dropped back beneath shields on orders from their officers and the first of the tedrel troops hit the line of spears and pikes with a shock the avalanche of sound as the two lines met was indescribable and even alberich winced screaming shouting the clash of weapon on weapon there was nothing as dreadful as the sound of army meeting army some of the tedrel fighters ran right up on the spears like maddened boars screeching as they died the rest hacked at the shafts with heavy broadswords and axes shouting furiously while more pikemen came up from the rear to take the place of those whod lost their weapons a rain of tedrel arrows fell on the pikemen and the archers behind them but the pikemen had good armor and helms meant to defend against arrows and the archers were under their shields and the moment the hail of arrows stopped the archers popped out from under cover and let fly a volley of their own this volley fell on the tedrel archers who were lightly armored and not as fast as their valdemaran counterparts this time the hail of arrows took a higher toll more screaming and louder now men of both sides fell and died or fell wounded crying out in agony the innocent little rill that marked the border went from muddy to bloody though sendar watched it all it would be up to the lord marshal to issue orders wise man was sendar he knew he was no more than a fraction of the strategist under actual battle conditions that his underlings were the lord marshal had faced these troops in his own person for the past three years while sendar had only gotten his reports the lord marshal had the direct experience of the battlefield that the king did not and sendar knew it and at the moment as the sun climbed into the sky and then reached its zenith the lord marshal was looking for something peering down at the battlefield with a frown on his heavilybearded face the cavalry alberich heard him saying as if he was thinking aloud where are their cavalry and in the same moment he turned to his herald and there was urgency in his voice alberich felt both relief that the lord marshal had noted the same thing he had and a heartsinking moment of dread mindspeak the flanks the lord marshal ordered and ask the ones with the birds find out if the cavalry is behind their lines still or if theyre trying to get us in a pincer alberich strained to hear the answer which came within the instant no and no my lord the herald replied there is no sign of mounted troops of any sort now sendar turned his head to fix the lord marshal with a look of surprise then where are they he demanded surely they havent put all of their mounted troops afoot the hair on the back of alberichs neck stood up and he got a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach it traveled rapidly over his entire body and at that moment he knew his gift hadnt deserted him in fact it was about to come down upon him with a vengeance he slid down out of his saddle as dizziness engulfed him so that he wouldnt have as far to fall when it hit himwhich it was going to in less than a heartbeat he clutched kantors saddle as his companion turned his head to look at him a flash of blue came between him and the rest of the world a woman barefoot bareheaded running but she couldnt outrun the horseman behind her another flash a man looking up from his weeding eyes wide then unseeing as the lance took him through the heart like blue lightning children screaming being herded into a pen by a dozen horsemen while the rest set fire to the village sunlord save us he muttered in karsite automatically reverting to the language he knew best the visions thank the god were silent silent and he could still hear dimly the sounds of the battlefield and the people around him what myste snapped behind him in the same tongue thank the god she didhe wasnt sure he could even understand valdemaran at this moment much less respond in it the visions shook him like a terrier with a rat the visions caught him up again and threatened to pull him in so far he would not be able to tell the others what he saw he struggled against them against a gift that was running away with him kantor he cried and a steadying presence held him out of the chaos of a hundred a thousand disasters playing out at once inside his head he could still see them but at least he could manage to get a few words out the cavalry has flanked us on either side but not to attack us he babbled in karsite thanking vkandis yet again that myste was there myste who knew karsite who could tell the king tell the lord marshal theyre clearing the countrysideburning the villages killing the adults rounding up the children he knew why but he didnt have time to explain the visions took him again despite all of kantors help a man pinned to the door of his own house by a spear a child being wrenched from its mothers arms and the woman tossed into the flames of her burning barn the tedrel cavalry riding across the land like a wave of locusts clearing it for its new masters keeping only the young children whom they would then take into their own ranks and turn into tedrels he struggled to speak but his throat and mouth were not his own not now while the visions held him he knew dimly that he had gone rigid as a plank jaw clenched unable even to whimper fire murder fear death it went on forever he was the helpless observer unable to do anything savesometimes in brief moments when the visions released himbabble a report of what he saw and where it was names came to him the names of villages villages that were not going to exist shortlybut he called them out anyway how much was now and how much soon how many places were far enough distant that help might come in time he was engulfed in a sea of horror until without warning the visions let go of him entirely and he dropped back into his own time and place head swimming he looked up through streaming eyes to find that he was clinging with both hands to kantors stirrup and the pommel of the saddle that he had buried his face in kantors shoulder sendar and the lord marshal were arguing at the tops of their lungs while selenays gaze switched from one to the other her face was white and pinched and her hands in their armored gauntlets shook but then well have no reserves the lord marshal shouted and what good will reserves do us if every creature older than a child on this side of the border is dead sendar shouted back he whirled and turned to talamir this is a royal command kings own you heard where the attackers are now deploy the reserves and every herald not in combat to the rescue talamir bowed his head and closed his eyes for a moment while taver stood as steady as a statue done majesty the herald said in a perfectly calm and slightly distant voice but you do realize that this will leave us seriously outnumbered on this field alberich was aware of movement massive movement behind them the reserve troops were moving out to the right and the left the cavalry first ahead of them on the swiftest steeds of all two wings of heralds already speeding out of sight over the crest of the ridge like a flock of swift white birds behind them the troops pulled out leaving their rear unprotected of course i realize it sendar growled and drew his sword with a bright metallic scrape it glittered wickedly in the sun matching the hard gleam in the kings eyes we need to end thisnow or we wont have a country left when we win the war there was something wild in the kings eyes that alberich recognized something he had felt himself down in the taverns of haven that feral look matched the savageness that he felt when he let himself work out his frustration on the bodies of those twolegged beasts that populated havens criminal underground but he was only one karsite herald and replaceablenot easily perhaps but replaceable he couldmarginallyrationalize risking himself this was the king of valdemar hes not alberich thought with sudden terror he is said kantor grimly nosendar couldntsomeone had to stop him and as alberich struggled to pull himself up the companion gave a kind of twist and a shove with his nose just under alberichs rump that got alberich most of the way into the saddle and a gutwrenching effort of arms and legs got him seated securely enough to turn and try to stop sendar before he could move but the king was already gone halfway down the hill though alberich had no idea how he could have gotten that far in so short a time too latehe could do nothing for sendar but sendar was talamirs responsibility alberich had another stay here he roared to selenay and her bodyguards who were only just starting to react the kings six hadvkandis be thankedacted in concert with the king they must have realized the moment he drew his blade what he intended to do they rode with him knee and knee with talamir at sendars right and jadus at his left a flying wedge that penetrated the ranks of those between them and the struggling front lines a roar went up as the king his banner bearer and his escort of heralds and guards and healer entered the zone of fighting alberich and myste imposed themselves as a barrier between selenay and the path to her fathers side the rest of her escort crowded in hemming her and caryo in among them stay here he bellowed at her trying to get her attention selenay heed me she had no intention of doing any such thing he could see it in her eyes wild with fear and grief beneath her light helm she hit out at them with mailed fists flailing at them as she sobbed and cursed she sawed at caryos reins she even tried to fling herself off caryos back and follow on foot but there were no divided loyalties among those who were protecting her however suicidal sendars action might be however much their hearts and minds cried out to follow him and protect him their duty was with selenay to keep her safe and if there was one thing that a herald understoodor a guardsman or the sunsguard it was duty she wept and fought their restraining hands she hit and screeched at them with the background of the chaos of battle nearly drowning out her screams she actually caught alberich a glancing blow across his chin and herald keren a direct hit that would leave her with a black eye soon she called them cowards traitors and worse she ordered them to let her go pleaded with them threatened them with imprisonment whipping death he paid no attention to what she said not because she didnt mean it because of course she did but because it was irrelevant no matter how much she cursed them now or hated them later they would keep her here out of the fighting satisfied that her bodyguards had her pinned if not under control he edged kantor out of the tangle and let myste take his place the danger to her was not less with sendar down on the battlefield if anything it was greater he pulled his own sword and stood lone guardian for a moment over the group his eyes raking over the hilltop looking for help he was in luck there were still a few of the royal guard who stood hesitantly nearby milling a little in confusion they were not mounted not swift enough to follow sendar on his headlong plunge toward the fightingzone they were torn between trying to battle their way toward him and staying to guard the heir alberich solved their hesitation for them to selenay he roared at them given clear orders they gratefully obeyed and made a second line of defense in a halfcircle around her weapons at the ready a line of four archers kneeling in front of another five swordsmen he turned back to the group around selenay she was still in danger if the enemy archers took it into their heads to shoot perhaps only the fact that the tedrel commanders wanted her alive had kept them safe so far for they were the only members of the command group still on the ridge everyone else the lord marshal included had followed sendar he wanted to lookbut selenays safety came first get her down he shouted on the ground and enforced his order with mindspeech no telling which of them would hearbut the companions would caryo would on the ground unhorsed get her down form the turtle the others fell back a little as myste halflunged and halffell off her companion taking selenay and the banner with her while caryo helped by giving a buck and a twist to dislodge her rider myste and selenay disappeared as keren and ylsa spilled off their mounts and formed the turtle over them with their shields the guardswomen looked uncertain for a moment you four ahorse stayhelp me he shouted at them and they stayed mounted kantor i want the companions and us between the enemy and selenay but behind the royal guard make a circle right the companions now without riders made a square of their bodies around the turtle yourselves space out alberich ordered bunch not but knee to flank gocompanion guard companion garbled and heavily accented as his words were they evidently figured out what he wanted with riderless companions between them they wedged themselves into the circle facing outward under the turtle of shields there was still a lot of movement and raised voices but nothing was coming out so alberich dismissed the struggle from his mind he looked sharply toward the battlefield in the middle of the fighting where it was at its most heated the kings banner still waved butbut their lines were now on the verge of the little stream not behind it sendars charge had carried the entire line of battle forward insane as the move had been it looked as if it might have had the desired effect he saw the faint movement above the heads of the milling fighters on the other side of the stream behind the tedrel lines and acted on instinct shields up he shouted and put his over his head as example the others did the same just in time arrows clattered down on them force in nowise spent by their long journey the movement hed seen had been the arrows arcing up to clear the battle lines from the tedrel side the arrows fell harmlessly thanks to his instincts the shields their armor their mounts armor kept anyone from being hurt and under the turtle selenay was completely safe it sounded like being caught in a terrible hailstorm however and the first volley was followed within a moment by a second a third shes stopped fighting i think the arrows have scared her said kantor good one less thing to worry about the turtle stay under shields up he ordered as another rain of arrows clattered onto the upheld shields he did not look behind him to see if he was being obeyed he knew that even if selenay rebelled the heralds would make sure she stayed put myste would sit on her to make certain of that an unfamiliar mindvoice touched his inward ear for once being clumsy paid off if id tried to hang onto her and pull her onto my saddle shed probably have gotten away from me but she couldnt do anything about my falling off with her myste he was astonished shed never tried to mindspeak to him before dont worry she cant get away from me now i outweigh her by quite a bit she might be a little squashed but she cant get me off of her although he was nothing like an empath he was astonished by the complex emotional overtones that came with her words amusement at her own expense pain anger grief frantic worry for herself more worry about selenay and sendar and over all terror held rigidly in check and yet her thoughts were so clear he could hardly believe it even if they get this far theyll have to get through me to touch her and theres a lot of me to act as a shield he didnt ask if she was all right she wasnt none of them were are you hurt my lenses are broken and i think i broke my ankle but thats the least of our worries dont call anyone and dont try and get me out of here for now i wont be moving anyway until this is over or unless you have to haul her out of here and run for it promise me though if that happens make sure i get back in my saddle im curious about these tedrels but not that curious you hove my word he wanted to try and summon a healer for her for she must be in excruciating pain but she was right and with luck her armored boot would hold her ankle well enough in place that no further damage would occur until they had the luxury of worrying about it given the kinds of terrible wounds being inflicted out there in the zone of fighting a broken ankle counted as minor there was no doubt that myste knew what the right answers were and was giving them even though she probably was howling inside with terror and the right answers were the last thing she wanted to supply probably given the level of terror and pain he sensed she was howling deep in her own heart all right years ago when she refused to learn weapons work this was the last thing he would have expected out of trainee myste and in that he had done her a tremendous disservice and ill make it up if we live he turned his attention back to the battlefield and for the first time felt his heart rise just a little the tide of battle was turning sendars charge had paid off in unexpected ways the tedrels had given up whatever battle plan theyd originally had and were concentrating on trying to take him down this had the effect of concentrating all of their attention on the center of the line and gathering in fighters from the rest of the field as they all tried to be the one to take the king those who had been hired or recruited were the worst for their motive was profit not the gain of a new homeland even if the true tedrel commanders had not put a price on king sendars head these men would think there was and anticipate a golden reward for killing him in the meantime pulling away toward the center meant that the valdemaran forces were able to draw in to enclose the tedrels on three sides the thick press of tedrels toward the king gave the valdemaran archers somewhere to aim for and they were taking advantage of thatthose that were not already aiming for the tedrel archers when the enemy is in range so are you and there was only so much room in the kings immediate vicinity the vast majority of those struggling to get at him could not actually fight anyone because of the press of their fellow fighters they were tied up without being of any use but the long valdemaran pikes could reach them and so could the spearmen the archers and the warhammers the sight of their king in danger was enough to put extra strength in the arms of valdemaran fighters the sight of the king within reach had drawn the tedrel leaders down off their hill and when you are in range so is the enemy the lord marshal was in the thick of the fighting and so was talamir there was no one to ask permission of he hesitated but only for a moment to the hells with permission ill apologize later are there any heralds with bows and the fetching gift left here he asked kantor with an idea so impossible it just might be able to work ah kantor paused it was going to take a lot longer for companion to speak to companion in all of this mess and he didnt want to distract anyone who was right in the middle of the melee either he waited watching the line of fighting swaying slowly like a sluggish snake retreating a little there bulging a little there four and theyve pulled out of combat for the moment have them shoot for the tedrel commanders and put fetching gift behind it whether they could even do that he had no idea but if they could it would be something no sunpriest would think of guarding against if it even could be guarded against if there are any sunpriests still helping them he had to wonder in the back of his mind if the reason his gift had suddenly broken through was because the karsite sunpriests had abandoned their erstwhile allies as soon as the tedrels were fully occupied with valdemar he hoped so if the priests decided to mix in with this it would make things so much worse at this distance he couldnt see anything other than the dark purple blot under the purple tedrel battle banners he couldnt make out individual arrows and he wouldnt see anyone fall if they were hit so he didnt even trouble to try to watch for it he would know if anything happened by the tide of battle if there are any animal mindspeakers still here ask if they can spook the tedrel horses one more bit of damage the officers were all ahorse and even if his arrow trick didnt work if he could drive them off there would be less control on the battlefield he didnt want to interfere any more the rest of the heralds were the only way the various parts of the valdemaran army had to communicate with one another things were falling apart on their side badly enough as it was instead he kept his shield above his head although there were no more hails of arrows the valdemaran archers were doing that much forcing the tedrel archers to duck under cover or even into a full retreat and he kept kantor turning in a slow circle watching not only to the front but to the rear and the sides looking for a suicidal charge into their ranks assuming that there could still be an attempt to capture or kill selenay of course the tedrels might not realize selenay was still here her battle banner was on the ground dropped when myste lunged for her and the only white uniform on this hilltop was alberichs all the more reason to keep the four of them on the ground then it came a flash of blue on the left attackers fresh unwounded and seasoned hidden in a ditchfull of bushes and about to emerge it wasnt much warning but it was enough he turned to the left spotted movement and shouted pointing with his sword to get the attention of selenays guards and they just popped up out of nowhere a band of twenty thirtyfortymoresuddenly materializing as if conjuredbut they hadnt been of course theyd found cover and slipped through the lines avoiding detection by avoiding fighting it was a trick hed used himself and so had the bandits hed fought and now at last he had something he could vent his own anger and fear against his blood pounding in his ears he howled a curse at them kantor didnt need the touch of a heel kantor was just as eager for blood as he was what sendar could do he could do and for as good a causekeeping selenay safe buying some time for her guards to react before the guardsmen on foot could rearrange their line of defense to meet the attackers he was racing toward the ambushers not so far to go after all ten of kantors long strides at most before he crashed into the first knot of them lightly armored of course much more lightly than he to facilitate slipping through cover first mistake he got a brief glimpse of a swarthy face beneath a light cap helma true tedrel then this was a group sent to capture the heir he swung his blade at the same time as he got that glimpse of target and he felt the shock of his sword meeting flesh as he slashed across the line of the eyes the man fell kantor made a ferretquick turn to trample him then he and kantor were among them and for the first time he learned what it was like to fight with a companion as a partner he gave himself up to it in fact he gave himself up totally to it to the terrible joy of killing for the first time in his life he would probably be sick later but now now these beasts these fiends were here to murder his friends his brothers and sisters to enslave his country they were going to take or murder that sweet cheerful girl hed come to admire so much who was so very old for her few years and yet so charmingly young they and others like them were killing innocent ordinary farmers like those boys and girls he and selenay had met around the fires old men like dethor and women like myste mothers like his now he and kantor would kill them he felt kantors rage along with his own kantor reveled in the shock that traveled up his arm with every good blowhe rejoiced in the impact of kantors hooves on flesh they moved as one in an awful and glorious dance of death as kantors white hide and his white uniform and armor were spattered splattered drenched in red as red blood ran down his sword arm and soaked into kantors legs kantor danced on bodies that crunched and screamed he reared and kicked hooves connecting with heads and bodies before and behind they were surrounded alberich didnt care let them waste their force on him he was expendable selenay was not he used his shield as a weapon as well as protection the heavy metal frame as a club and his sword made short work of those toolight cap helms when he struck them at all mostly he went for the facesthe eyes those dark and fierce eyes that held no pity and no remorse only a flicker of terror when the blade came at them he reveled in the terror he wanted more of it he howled in protest when they slashed at kantors rump kantor screamed in rage as they cut through his armor into his leg they fought as he had never before fought in his life without effort with endless strength and energy and in a white heat of rage that slowed time and sped his reactions and still they foughtand continued to fight the briefest possible flicker of blue hazed his vision for a moment but not even his gift could conquer this unbridled rage but something was going to happen something awful was going to happen then a sickening blow to the soul that should have sent him to his knees told them both that sendar sendar his patronsendar his king for a moment just a moment he leaped skyward out of his body and found himself looking down on the field of battle where tiny creatures fought and died there he was the sole target of a circle of tedrel elite who had forgotten their primary mission in the face of his attack he continued to fight like a nightfiend despite the fact that he wasnt there anymore another blow nauseating and disorienting struck him his attention snapped to the battle line sendar was cut off from the rest of the valdemaran forces with only his bodyguards for protection he fought like a demon and so did they but even as alberich realized what peril they were in three of the bodyguards went down leaving only crathach jadus and talamir to fight with him there was a blur of motion just under the noses of the companions a shriek of pain that came from the soul of taver as well as the body and taver flung up his head then a burly hulk with an ax swung at talamir nonot at talamirat taver at the exposed neck of the kings own companion nothing could have survived that blow to the neck no matter how heavily armored taver went down blood gushing from the severed throat neck snapped talamir with him leaving the kings right flank open no alberich howled in protest uselessly silentlybut suddenly jadus was there between the king and the axman and the ax came down this time not across a companions neck but across jadus leg the companion reacting to his chosens agony shied sideways leaving sendar unprotected as if in a nightmare where time slowed to a crawl yet nothing could be done to stop what was happening alberich saw a hundred fighters moving at the same time saw the mob close in like a pack of rabid dogs shoving crathach into sendars side hemming in the horse and companion so that neither could move watched as too many weapons to count pieced first sendars companion then sendar flicker of blueand a wave of sickening horror smashed him back into his body but he knew what he had seen was real sendar the king of valdemar was dead that was when a shriek of berserk rage tore the throat of every man and woman in the army and sent them against their foes in a killing frenzy such as no valdemaran had experienced in three centuries or more he and kantor rode that wave of bitter mindless hatred rode it and used it and let it use them until it ran out and the foes ran out and left them like every other surviving fighter on the valdemar side exhausted and sickened blinking at the carnage around them peering at death through eyes that streamed with agonized tears in grief and mourning that would never entirely be healed the taste of blood was in his mouth the sweetsickly stench of it in his throat his nostrils felt choked with it he thought vaguely that he should be on his knees throwing up what little there was in his stomach but instead all he could feel was grief and numbness selenay prompted kantor with unutterable weariness turning his head in the direction of the heir no not the heir he reminded himself with a stabbing sensation in his heart the queen he wiped blood and sweat away from his eyes and peered though a haze of exhaustion toward her circle of protection he hadnt prevented all of the tedrels from getting to her and her guardians after alljust a great many of them another clot of bodies marked where the royal guardsmen and her bodyguards had taken care of the ones that had gotten by him four of the royal guardsmen were dead the rest wounded two of the four mounted bodyguards were down kantor stumbled to them he half fell out of the saddle his leg slash and half a dozen other wounds burned with a fire of their own but he knew from the way they felt that though they hurt like demons were poking him they were relatively minor he wasnt going to bleed to death any time soon and his injuries werent going to incapacitate him therefore as he had countless times when he was injured he would carry on if need be until he dropped berda and locasti were on the ground with their greathearted horses standing over them like guard dogs locasti sat up just as he got there holding her head in both hands a dented helm told him what had happened to her it was a good helm that doublewalled with extra space between the inner and outer wall on the top of the heada helm inside a helm so to speak good job it was built that well it had saved her from a cracked skull or worse berda rolled over on her side moaning and lotte slid down off her mount to help her blood spewed from the knee joint of her armor but she was still alive and lotte was down beside her tearing off the thigh armor to get a belt around the leg even as he reached them lotte had a slash of her own down her arm that she didnt seem to noticeor else she didnt care knowing that it was minor compared to that leg wound shes going to lose that leg he thought dispassionately looking at the joint laid halfopen better that than her life much better that than losing selenay theyre telling me all over the field that whats left of the tedrels are routed said myste into his mind with a deceptive calm that overlaid hysteria the others are telling me that theyre disengaging and scattering to the four winds and our reserves have caught up with their cavalry and theyre cutting them to finelychopped bits i think we can get up now that was when he realized that she was mindspeaking keren and ylsaand the companionsas well as himself the companions spread out and the little armored shell at the heart of their circle opened up your guard drop not he croaked as keren and ylsa stood up ylsa hauling a weeping selenay up by main force myste stayed where she was we dont intend to keren said grimly and put her back to selenay shield up facing out alberich dropped heavily to one knee before the queen who stared at him without comprehension her face contorted with grief tears pouring down her cheeks perhaps it was without recognition as well his whites were saturated with drying blood the white leatherandplate armor over it bloodstreaked and crusting he must look like something out of a nightmare majesty he said in a harsh voice from a throat made raw with screaming to your people you must show yourself now your banner must fly know they have a queen they must he really truly didnt expect her to understand him he didnt think she would even hear him much less realize what he had just said but as ylsas armored hand fell on her shoulder in a gesture as much of comfort as a hand in a gauntlet could convey he watched sense come into her eyes watched with awe and wonder as she somehowout of what reserves he could not even begin to imaginepulled herself together she pulled off her gauntlet and wiped her streaming eyes with the back of her hand then straightened youre right of course she said in a flat voice myste working on it he saw that myste had hauled herself to her feet no foot for the other one was held clear off the ground and her companion was lying down on the ground so she could get into the saddle she did so with a grunt of pain leaned over and picked up the bloody muddy battle banner by a corner of the fabric her companion heaved herself to her feet rider and all and myste manhandled the banner back into its socket in the next moment selenay mounted caryo and pulled off her helm so that her golden hair shone in the westering sunlight heralds of valdemar myste mindcalled the voice echoing painfully in alberichs skull that was a strong mindcall behold your queen alert remain alberich growled to the remaining bodyguards and dragged himself back up into the saddle though a gray film of exhaustion seemed to fog everything he made a trumpet of his hands and shouted what myste had called out to those with mindspeech he was used to bellowing battlefield ordershe put every bit of that into his shout valdemar behold your queen from that vantage he watched as slowly slowly heads turned toward them in a wave of motion starting from those nearest the group on the hill until it reached even to where there were knots of fighting still going on myste was right though from where he sat there was more fleeing than fighting and as combat broke off those who could still move took advantage of the momentary distraction of their opponents to escape there was still a pool of purple between the valdemaran lines and the hilltop but it wasnt moving and the battle banners were nowhere to be seen could the tedrel high command actually be dead i think so kantor told him after a moment yes your idea worked the fetchingheralds did it when sendar died he winced for a moment he had difficulty breathing if only they could have done it before so many if onlys never had a victory felt so much like a defeat the lord marshal he asked kantor coming a strange silence fell over the battlefield the sunlight glittered on helms but there wasnt a single raised sword or spearpoint to be seen the pressure of thousands of eyes was a palpable force that even alberich in his exhaustion felt then it began weakly at first but gathering strength a sound a cheer wordless inarticulate torn from the throats of exhausted men and women grew and grew from a thread to a river from a river to a torrent to a wall of sound that surrounded them they came walking then running sometimes dropping weapons but all all cheering some weeping while they cheered but all of them saluting her their queenvaldemar incarnate and when they reached her they reached for her hands outstretched to touch her touch caryo assure themselves that she was alive was real she reached out to them touching hands faces and as each one of them got that assurance he made way so that others could discover for themselves that their hope still lived caryo began to move forward one slow and infinitely careful step at a time taking her through the sea of upturned faces and reaching hands alberich and her remaining four bodyguards followed though what they could do in this press of bodies if anything happened let anyone so much as breathe harm on her and the army will tear him to pieces kantor said shes safer now than she has ever been the lord marshals horse swam through the river of humanity to meet them and alberich was immensely grateful to see him alberich knew nothing of courts and politics and without missing a beat he and kantor dropped back to ride just behind and to her right as the lord marshal took the place on her left he wasnt sure where they were going except farther into the battlefield until they got thereand he was having enough trouble staying alert and concentrating on selenays back to think about it it was slow going wading through that surging sea of humanity it must have taken at least a candlemark to get from where theyd been to where they were going and by that time the handful of men and women who had not been pressing toward the young queen had accomplished a great deal they passed through a protective ring of guardsmen into a clear space the men working there among the fallen stopped what they were doing and respectfully dropped to their knees there was another pile of tedrel bodies laid to one sidea very large pile the bodies of several guardsmen had been laid out respectfully in a neat row their weapons in their dead hands clasped on their chests and the blooddrenched white bodies of two companions idiot of course shed come here first selenay slid from caryos back to kneel at her dead fathers side theyd already laid him on a stretcher with his banner draped as a pall across his body she pulled the fabric down to reveal his face alberich couldnt watch he felt as if he was intruding on what should have been a private moment he wondered if she hated him for keeping her away from her fathers side if she would ever forgive him for keeping her safe at the moment but as he turned away he caught sight of healer crathach sitting on the churnedup bloody ground with talamirs head in his lap both hands resting on the heralds forehead kantor stepped carefully to the side to stand over them crathach looked up as if he had felt alberichs gaze on him his eyes were haunted but fierce he wants to die crathach said in a low voice hoarse with shouting screaming and weeping he wants to follow taver but i wont let him not now selenay needs him we cant afford an untrained queens own not now she needs someone with every bit of international court and political experience possible hold to him then alberich agreed jadus theyve already taken him to the healers tent theres nothing left of his leg to save but hell live crathach growled bloody hell those bastards knew exactly what to do at the worst possible time we were holding our own until they got us too crowded together for the hooves to come into play then sent a man in to hamstring the companions alberich bit back an oath no wonder the two companions had gone down so easily and no wonder sendar had faltered just long enough for the fatal blow to fall stand fast can you he asked as long as i have tothe new groveborn should be coming as fast as he can i just have to hold until he comes what he was saying made no sense to alberichs weary mind but it was too much to try and think about jadus and talamir were going to live that was all that counted a pair of stretcher carriers came up then and crathach let them take talamir up though he kept one hand on the heralds head the whole time they carried the herald away with crathach as it were attached alberich found himself swaying in the saddle and dragged his attention back to selenay she had drawn the fabric over her fathers face again and now she stood up gently bear him away and prepare him for his journey was all she said but there was a rush of volunteers most of them still weeping and when the stretcher was picked up there was not a fingers width of it that did not have an eager hand supporting it as the body was taken through the crowd men fell silent removing their helms and standing with heads bowed until it had passed them selenay stood looking after it with the last scarlet rays of the sun turning her golden hair to a redgold crown then she mounted caryo again summoned alberich and the lord marshal with a glance and rode from the silent field back to the encampment for a moment a curtain of gray haze came between alberich and the world it cleared up in the next heartbeat but it was a sign he couldnt ignore alberich signaled kantor to drop back a pace putting him even with ylsa you and keren he began weve already figured youre in no shape to protect anything the rangy herald told him bluntly were on it and whats more the minute she dismisses you therell be a healer waiting to take you off ahmy thanks he managed let them decide for themselves what he was thanking them for he urged kantor up again they passed through the camp and as they did it was through another corridor of battered fighters some wanted to touch her or caryo some just saluted her respectfully some murmured things like the gods bless you majesty and others gazed in worshipful silence a tiny shard of alberichs mind that was still able to think was both pleased and sorrowful at these demonstrations pleased because his work with her among the fighters had born such fruitand full of remorse because the harvest had been gathered too soon they moved now through a blue haze of twilight he was grateful for it cloaked the injuries hid the wounds of men and beasts in soft shadows from which the color had been leeched and he was grateful too for the fact that he needed only to sit kantors saddle for the moment he wasnt certain he was up to much else when they reached the command tent she paused and did not dismount as he had expected she would instead she turned caryo so that they faced the crowd of quiet men and women who had followed her someone brought torches and stood to either side of her so that she was clearly illuminated her young face looked years older than it had this morning her cheeks smudged and armor and surcoat dirtied from the struggle to escape from myste keren and ylsa and still she looked he thought every inch a queen we have fought a terrible foe today and we have won she said to all of them her voice carrying across the stillness and it has been at a cost that none of us would willingly have paid i do not speak of the loss of mymy father only i do not speak of your gallant friends and comrades only but many if not all of you know that our battle plans changed without warning and that king sendar made a strange and some might say suicidal charge toward the enemy that ended in his death and that of many many others there was a reason for that and i believe that you should all hear why my father acted as he did today she told them all then what had happened up there on the hillside why sendar had sent away the reinforcements and why he had subsequently made of himself such tempting bait that the main tedrel army threw away their own plans and strategy and were lured into defeat all this was new to those straining to catch her every wordand there was one telling omission she did not say it was alberich whod had the visions she let them think it had been sendar himself he was astonished amazedit was a brilliant stroke for it made sendar just that little bit larger than life that more of a hero while at the same time it kept alberichs gift a secret among the very few that he knew could be trusted with it if hed thought of it himself it was exactly what hed have asked her to say since she thought of it he could not have been more proud of her we have lost a great king this day she said when the murmurs of wonder had died away we have lost a king who cared so deeply for the lives of his people that he flung his own down to save them we have lost a wise and compassionate leader and a greathearted man as well and i have lost not only a father but my best and truest friend her voice caught on a sob but she stopped for a moment wiped her eyes and went on but valdemar lives and i live and together we will make certain to be worthy of his sacrifice there is much to do now and much that will need to be done in the future but we have proved today that together there is no foe that can stand against us and no matter the odds we will prevail a great roar went up as she dismounted and gave caryo into the willing hands of waiting aides keren and ylsa were a fraction of a moment behind her flanking her as she walked into the command tent alberich did not so much dismount as fall out of the saddle and he had to cling to it for a moment before his head cleared kantor swiveled his head to peer at him but before the companion could say anything more aides came to take kantor away with the other three companions alberich set his jaw swayed for a moment and followed selenay into the tent intending to stay discreetly on the sidelines that gray haze clouded his vision but he had fought it away before and he would fight it away now that was his intention anyway what happened was that he got three paces inside the door flap that grayness turned to blackness and he passed out cold at selenays feet he came awake all at once and blinked up at white sunwashed canvas its about time myste said dryly as he realized he was not alone and this was not his tent layabout come on get up and get out of that cot they need it for someone whos really hurt he sat up it was a big tent and it was full of more cots like his he had been put in one right beside the tent wall his nearest neighbor was jadus he said the lean herald turned to face them without raising his head from the pillow and grimaced in the flesh most of it they had to take the leg jadus eyes had that halffocused look of someone powerfully drugged alberich was surprised he could speak at all the saying should be better the leg than the life he shouldnt have said that he knew it as soon as the words were out of his mouth too late better mine than his jadus replied voice thick with sorrow but i didnt get to make a choice seldom does anyone alberich reached across and put one hand on jadus arm he didnt have the words of comfort he wanted not even in his own language but jadus seemed to understand that he meant to offer whatever support he had without words thank you jadus told him in a tone that said he meant the words you knowthey just dosed me i believe i need to sleep now his eyelids dropped and in a moment he was asleep poor man i hope we can find something he can teach at the collegium myste began but alberich interrupted her bah a sad day indeed it will be the day a herald needs two legs to do his duty he would not hear of it a healthy man certainly no older than the late king being given makework just because he lacked half a limb and of legs speaking he looked down at hers one of them was in a rather odd boot a very thick boot i note that you manage having not quite a whole leg unless a phalanx of slave boys you have to carry you a litter upon she smiled faintly yes i broke my ankle no im not letting it stop me though let me tell you it still hurts like seven hells and its only because the healers are very good that im not screaming now between their offandon magics and some truly vile concoctions even if it hurts i tend not to care if that makes sense and this plaster boot theyve granted me lets me get around she looked wistful for a moment though come to think of it i wouldnt mind a squad of littercarrying slave boys ah never mind im supposed to tell you that selenay sent me for you me he stared at her he wasnt certain hed heard her correctly one of his last thoughts before he passed out after all was how long she would hate him of course you you saved her life she knows that everyone knows that you did it twice over in fact once by keeping her from following sendar and again when that lot of infiltrators popped up she spoke matteroffactly in such a way that he could not doubt her and you did more than that although there arent too many who know it was you that caused sendar to send the reinforcements out to save the countryside ah she hesitated just so you know selenay wants to keep it that way except for those of us who were there he didnt feel up to stumbling his way through valdemaran anymore and reverted to karsite myste i have no objection to that he might just as well have had the visions as i what did or could i do about them i just blurted them out to you and not even in a tongue he could understand he understood what they meant and in his greatheartedness elected to save his land rather than his own life he charged the front line knowing what he was doing and knowing full well that he had less chance of surviving that charge than a rabbit charging a pack of foxes let his people think whatever they want he deserves all of it i told her youd feel that way she nodded anyway selenay did indeed send me this morning to stay here with you until you woke and tell you to come to her when you did a bit melodramatic that passing out at her feet wasnt it he winced i hope i was discreet about it you werent but i dont think anybody cared actually those of us who were still able to think were trying to figure out if wed have to get crathach to mindblast you to get you to stop being so infernally noble and selfsacrificing she lifted an eyebrow at him you saved us from that by neatly falling over well he was cleaned up at least someone had done him that tremendous favor and left him to sleep off his exhaustion in a clean white shirt and trews the rest of his whites were beside him on a chair he started to reach for them no he said aloud i put them on for sendar but i do not think i will wear whites again not unless there is a pressing reason myste pursed her lips but looked curiously satisfied as if she thought she had been particularly clever i thought you might say that so i stopped by your tent and brought these she pulled a basket out from under his cotand there were his form of the heraldic uniform the dark gray leathers he had worn up until they had left haven are you certain you are not an empath he asked no im a herald with work to do and now that youve been informed that her majesty wants you i need to go do it she softened her words with a slight smile then suddenly reached out and took his hand but i wont always have work to do she said giving it a slight squeeze and i find you excellent company because i dont have to pretend or mince words around you then she picked up a crutch from beside her stool stood up and hobbled off he stared after her with bemusement you really dont know what to do with a woman who isnt either untouchable or a whore do you said that familiar faintly mocking voice in his mind well why dont you teach me he shot back stung and reached for his familiar gray leathers i might but youll have to ask me nicely his ears burned changing swiftly he headed out of the tent intending to pause only long enough to tell one of the healers that he would not be needing that cot beside jadus anymore but the first healer he ran into was a very familiar face and one he had not expected to see tending to the wounded crathach he exclaimed and seized the mans arms grasping him by the elbows with both hands buttalamir come see for yourself the healer said taking him by the elbow crathach led him out of the ranks of the healers tents and into the ring of command tents alberich could not help but notice some gaps where tents had beenand felt a stab in his heart but one tent still stood crathach led him to it as with many tents used by heralds it was fully large enough for a companion to fit inside for heralds sometimes preferred to know that their partners were as comfortable as they were inside talamir lay quietly in his cot and lying beside him on a worn rag rug was a companion for one moment alberichs heart stopped there was only one companion that had that special look that faint aura of otherworldliness taver he stopped himself from blurting it just in time the companion lifted his noble head and looked into his eyes not taver weaponsmaster i am rolan your pardon alberich murmured a little unnerved the queens owns new companion nodded his acceptance of the apology it was a natural thought and no harm was done i am pleased to see you we will probably be seeing a great deal of each other in the future but if you will forgive me i have my charge to tend for now the companion turned his gaze back toward the quiet figure on the cot talamir no longer looked like a corpse but he had aged and aged greatly inwhat less than two days he had looked no older than sendar middleaged at worst before the battle now he looked old thin and wornout with long struggle his face etched with lines of pain and he looked fragile alberich felt his heart wring with pity and wondered if perhaps it would have been better for him if hed been allowed to die but that was not his decision to make vkandis be thanked crathach tugged at his sleeve and they left the tent to the companion and his charge he did what i could not crathach said how he got here in so little timewell i cant guess but he did what i couldnt i could only hold him just out of reach of deaths gate rolan dragged him back to life then full awareness and made him stay he has awakened then alberich asked still in a murmur with a glance back at the tent several times hes quite sane now and he doesnt seem to want to die but hes fragile alberich very fragile ive told the queen that hes not to do much for a while and she agrees crathach tilted his head to one side and gave him a penetrating look hmph alberich traded him look for look then until you say so shall i sit upon him if need be i knew i could count on you crathach slapped him on the back now i think the queen wants you so i believe and i shall my leave take of you he hoped crathach would say something that might give him a clue to the queens mood but crathach didnt seem to have any more idea than he did ever since rolan arrived ive been too busy to go near the command tent he replied and sighed and at the moment my services as a healer are in far more demand than those as a bodyguard alberich grimaced wish i could that otherwise it were crathach nodded and i it is good to be able to use ones gifts but he could only shrug helplessly they parted then but having seen talamir alive if not exactly well alberichs heart felt a little lighter but now it was time to face the queen and he was not looking forward to that for no matter what myste said he was not at all sanguine about his reception surely selenay would never want to see his face again after what hed done to her if nothing else she would never forgive him from keeping her away from her fathers side and who could blame her probably she wanted to see him only so that she could tell him she wanted him to return immediately to haven and confine himself to the salle from now on it was in this mood that he presented himself at the command tent the guardshis choice he saw with pridelet him past he tried to slip in unnoticed but keren spotted him and bent down to whisper in selenays ear she looked up sharply herald alberich she said silence descended like a warhammer he cleared his throat awkwardly you summoned me majesty i did come here herald alberich queens did not say if you please queens issued orders and their subjects obeyed as did he he made his way between two ranks of officials and highborn who parted to let him pass thanking his luck that the tent was not all that large for to have to pass a gauntlet of only a doublehandful of watchers was bad enough she was sitting in her fathers chair at his table and she watched him with a measuring gaze as he approached dont kneel she said sharply as he started to bend and look at me she tilted her head to one side and looked him up and down youve gone back to your shadowgrays i see good if youve no objection except when we need you in whites forahformal occasions i should like you to keep to them it will serve very well to make it clear that while you are taking talamirs place for some little while you are not the queens own he blinked surely he had not heard that correctly majesty he faltered i amwhat crathach tells me that talamir will not be fit for duty for a while until he is i wish you to take his place here at my side she smiled wanly at least until you resume your duties at the collegium that is crathach thinks talamir will be ready by the time we reach haven i should like keren to go back to what she does best in my bodyguard meanwhile i need someone here beside me in the capacity of adviser as well as guard someone with a level head who knows when his queen needs to be dragged out of her saddle and sat upon yes majesty he managed and changed places with keren who looked only too happy to relinquish her position she resumed the business that he had interrupted which seemed to concern those enemy fighters who had thrown down their weapons and scattered some of them it was thought had come north rather than south and were trying to hide themselves in valdemar there were several arguments ongoing as to the best way to hunt them down brutal savage plans most of them apparently it was not enough that the entire command structure had been wiped out there were plenty who wanted every single person who had so much as carried a bucket for the tedrels hunted out and strung up on the nearest branch high enough to haul them off the ground and the corpses left to hang there until they rotted away selenay listened impassively until the various angry speeches had been made then looked at alberich well she asked have you any suggestions he supposed that by all rights he should have been just as full of righteous anger but he wasnt he was justtired tired of death sick of the stench of it in his nostrils he didnt want any more deaths not if he could help it real tedrelsif any livedare not the border to cross he said slowly and i think the sunpriests a mostunpleasantfate will accord them should they foolish enough be in karse for to stay for heretics by the measurement of the sunpriests the tedrels most surely are say i would that their welcome will not be warm except of course that it rather too warm will be it took a moment for the others to realize what he had said and more to figure out what he had meant the fires of course there wasnt a chance that any real tedrels would be spared the fires someone in the back snickered although he had not meant it as a joke as for the rest he shrugged the worst of mercenaries and the most foolish of fortune hunters they are perhaps some are here in valdemar the firstwill swiftly run afoul of constables and guards or even of farm folk and in trouble they soon will be and have them you will now how to tell are we which are those that fought here and which mere outlanders arrest all who with an accent speak he raised his eyebrow then without acting queens own you will be she blinked but nodded and some of the muttering stopped he had to say this much for most of the people she had about her now they werent stupid what is valdemar if not just he asked rhetorically leave some guards perhaps to deal with them as found they are but i think you need not hunt them live off the land they cannot when their swords they cannot hire out leave they shall or break the law and so you have them as lawbreakers which can be proved the second either a lesson will have learned or will not and thus also he spread his hands so youre saying we shouldnt track them down lord orthallen asked smoothly as if the question was of no matter to him just leave them as a menace to the countryside i say find them you will without hunting hide they cannot and with nothing more than what on their bodies they have little have they to live on and only one trade they know but what if they try and pass themselves off as laborers someone asked angrily alberich raised an eyebrow to escape labor it was that most turned to sellswording wish them joy of it i doand find may they only the hardhearted as masters please said selenay in an exasperated tone of voice do think this through do any of you want to keep this army together spending the treasury dry to feed them and keep them in wages just to frighten the locals by riding over their fields and interrogating anyone who looks the least bit out of place and how do you propose to tell one of these tedrels fromoh say a hillman out of rethwellan looking for work or a poor brute of a karsite whos taken advantage of this to cross into valdemar for sanctuary or are you actually proposing as alberich said to string up every man with a foreign accent from the nearest tree i repeat begin with me you would have to alberich pointed out gently there were some embarrassed coughs i wont even begin to point out how my father would have responded to such an idea she continued looking at all of them and making a point of staring each in the eyes until he either dropped his gaze or met hers with agreement it is so totally foreign to everything valdemar has always stood for i agree with alberich if anyone has crossed to our side of the border the likeliest thing is that theyll try to get over to rethwellan and be of no concern to us if any stay they will either settle and fit in or not and break the law and we can deal with them on that basis well majesty lord orthallen began but he was interrupted dammit i will see her majesty snapped a querulous aged female voice that he knew and had not expected to hear and a moment later the owner of that voice someone he knewas well as he knew himself pushed her way in past everyone he should know herald laika though hed last seen her just before she left to infiltrate the tedrels in her guise of an old washerwoman after all hed helped form half of the memories that now made her what she was and given that fact you shouldnt be surprised that shes as stubborn as a mule and as intractable as a goat kantor put in as she bullied her way right past the lord marshal made a pretense at a courtly curtsy then stood glaring at selenay with her hands on her hips selenay stared at her blankly and without recognition well she wouldnt recognize laika though she might know the name for as far as alberich knew neither she nor caryo would have seen laika before herald laika majesty alberich said carefully one of our four heraldagents behind tedrel lines she was within the camp infiltrated was she as a washerwoman and very valuable damn right the old woman grunted and thats why im here i want to know what the hell youre going to do about the children selenay blinked i beg your pardon herald laika but we do already have peoplehealers and othersout trying to find the children whose parents were killed by the tedrel cav not those children laika exclaimed not the children of valdemar im talking about the tedrel children what are you going to do about the tedrel children what tedrel children selenay asked blankly alberich was going to explain but laika saved him the effort this wasnt just a mercenary company this was a nation she said with the irritation of a teacher whose student hasnt studied her subject sufficiently granted theyd made a vow never to wed or have families until they had a land of their own again but that sure as hellfires didnt stop them from breeding selenays eyes widened and her mouth made a silent oh shape whats more they used to pick up every stray boychick they could get their hands on and throw him in with the rest laika continued not to mention the ones they kidnapped not a few of em from our own people they didnt have much use for girls until they were of breeding age but boysoh my yes thats why they were taking such pains to keep our littles alive so they could turn them into tedrels now youve got a camp full of orphans and other youngsters over there that the karsites are not going to want youve killed off their fathers and protectors if they even have mothers their mothers are probably halfway to rethwellan by now and might not have waited about for them and what are you going to do about it wont the karsites just take them selenay asked looking to alberich probablyno he said reluctantly karse needs no extra mouths that come not with hands that can work andthey are heretics and the children of heretics and what is more even their own blood to the sunpriests eyes they are notor no longer arekarsite he did not elaborate on what that meant but there was something very unpleasant stirring in the back of his mind something like aprotovision an intimation not of what would be or what was about to be but what might be a vision of the fires of cleansing and the fuel that fed them i dont want to sound utterly callous and hardhearted herald butnot to put too fine a point upon it what can we do the lord marshal asked theyre on karsite land in karsite hands she looked at him as if he was an idiot and this stopped vanyel this stopped lavan firestorm the lord marshal wasnt about to back down that was in another situation entirely he retorted and if youre referring to the demonsbane legend vanyel was on hardorn land not karsite alberich cleared his throat ahherald laikaa question suppose i must that you have these children been among think you they can be anything but tedrel most of em arent now she replied and shook her head some of em in fact a lot of em are karsite orphanssome of em are camp followers children and dare i repeat myself some of em are ours grabbed every time they hit valdemar in the past three years but like i said they dont have much use for girls that arent breeding age so they dont pay any attention to em and boys arent useful until theyre thirteen and old enough to take into a tedrel lodge for training so theyre all right up until then basically theyre not tedrel theyre not karsite theyre not anything really when i was in there they had a lot of the camp followers that were tending to all of them and most of those were girls out of rethwellan seejay and ruvan with a couple of karsites so thats what theyve been raised as raised as nothing then selenay ventured pretty much a pretty weird mix they all speak a kind of tedrelpidgin with words from all over the girls dont ever get taught pure tedrel tongue thats a mans mystery the kiddies have got some little religious cult theyve made up on their own that isnt like anything ive ever heard of like i said they arent tedrel they arent anything she sighed what they are is dead needy for adult attention even an old hag like me they swarmed over but babieswithout mothers someone put in doubtfully babes in arms she shrugged that little the tedrels dont take the ones born to the camp followers well they may be whores but theyre still mothers the ones thatll bolt theyll take the children they can manage to carry and run for rethwellan that leaves the orphans or ones whose mothers dont care and theres a couple hundred anyway of an age we could rescue no more than a thousand selenay glanced at alberich who was thinking furiously karsei think might be busyelsewhere elsewhere hunting down all the escapees on their side of the border and either conscripting them as bound slaves or making sure no one else ever does and he continued if the rescue and evacuation were made quickly might not know it had been entered at all and a thousand children selenay gulped its not an unmanageable number the lord marshal put in its not as if it would be a thousand captives most of them couldnt run far laika snorted show em food and smiles and most of em wont run at all and dont forgetsome of them are ours and if word gets out that we left valdemaran children to starve or hope for the mercy of the sunpriests she let that particular statement sink in without elaborating whats more they arent more than a days march inside karse when the tedrels moved this time they were preparing the fullon invasion remember they thought we were going to go over with just a push and they had everything and everyone set to move straight across the border surely not lord orthallen said skeptically surely they were not going to put all of that so close to the battle lines laika smiled grimly and what makes you think they were unaware that the moment the fighters left the base camp the karsites were likely to grab everything believe me that was the talk all over the campeveryone wanted to be sure that they didnt get left behind the last camp they made would be where they left all the noncombatants and the baggage and all in fact there was talk about setting it less than a halfdays march from the border figuring that the closer it was to valdemar the less likely it was that the karsites would come calling the campfire glow we saw in the farther sky last night was probably from their full camp not their battle camp i thought they looked rather too wellrested murmured the lord marshal then that means we wont have to break the border so much asbend it a little selenay said speculatively i suppose one could consider what is in that camp to be legitimate war loot now it was the lord marshals turn to smile grimly one could majesty the lord marshal said and in fact one should why after all should the karsites have the benefit of thiswar bootywhen it is valdemar that suffered alberich merely raised an eyebrow how can we calling ourselves civilized leave children to suffer and welcome in karse they will not be now selenay looked to the rest of her advisers and commanders ihonestly gentlemen ladiesi think we should do this i know we can i think we should bringing life out of death asked the chief healer i dont think there is any doubt sendar would selenay smiled wanly my father would have been at the head of the expedition she said softly that seemed to decide them all and the prospect of having a positive task to organize also seemed to galvanize them lifting them somewhat out of the slough of depression that most of the encampment had sunk into the mood in the tent suddenly lifted and even selenays voice took on more life than it had held since before the battle well need wagons to carry the children wont we she asked breathlessly how many where will we get them we already have them majesty said the chief healer catching fire from her enthusiasm we were going to send some of the wounded northleg injuries not so serious but needing some recoverybut theyll gladly wait for a little to save these children the horses are harnessed right now the wagons are provisioned we havent loaded the wounded yetwhy we can be ready to go on the instant she turned to alberich wouldyou of course he would the lord marshal exclaimed great good gods who else you used to patrol here didnt you man and you wont be doing without him for more than a day or two what about us laika interjected oh good gods not as leaders but we know the karsite language and we came across here to get out and the children know me at least give me a moment and ill send a messenger about the wagons the chief healer put in and they were off with the bit between their teeth alberich simply stood there while all the decisions were made for him they seemed to accept without question that alberich should serve as the leader and that laika and the other three spies should be in the rescue party and that it would consist of heralds healers and wagons heralds to act as eyes ears and if need be guards healers to soothe the children and wagons to carry them the decision to go was made so swiftly that ifas laika asserted the camp was no farther than a halfdays march awayalberich reckoned that they might get there and back by this same time on the morrow and it slowly dawned on him that no one no one at all even thought about the question of his loyalty of course he would lead the rescue he was the best person for the job of course he would bring these childrensome of them karsiteback to valdemar and of course he wouldnt even consider taking the opportunity to defect back to his homeland he was a herald wasnt he divided loyalties didnt even come into it perhaps there were a few who thought differently but there always would be there would have been had he come from hardorn or menmellith or rethwellan or anywhere else other than valdemar within a candlemark the whole thing was organized and ready to go with plenty of volunteers he hadnt been surprised by the ones among the heralds or even the healers but the fact that the teamsters had lined up to a man had come as a bit of a surprise he was a little uneasy about leaving selenay on her own though still she was essentially on her own from the moment her father died she has trained for this for years hasnt she if she couldnt handle the reduced council now when there was so little opposition and she was the darling of the army what would she do back in haven and as for her bodyguardsthey were taking their job just as seriously now as they had before the battle if any true tedrels had survived now would be the time for an assassination attempt for now whoever still lived had nothing to lose and such men were the most dangerous of all selenay saw them off but she kept things brief go safely and swiftly she said and impatient to be off they took her at her word she didnt linger to watch them rattle across the little stream at the border either when he looked back she was gone not only was he not surprised he was pleased it wasnt as if she didnt have more than enough on her hands for the aftermath of a war generally left both sides in shambles there were hundreds of decisions to be made and in the end only the queen could make them then when one factored in all of the messages and dispatches arriving from haven moment by moment every one of them requiring her attention he was certain she would be getting very little rest between now and when he returned which might be just as well it would give her very little time to brood and might exhaust her enough that she would actually sleep instead of lying awake staring at the darkness behind her eyelids it was a strange sensation crossing onto the karsite lands of the hills where he had once ridden at the head of a troop of sunsguard a close watch keep for bandits he warned everyone when they first set out driven away by the battle they were perhapsbut like vultures return to feast upon the slain they shall he had to wonder though as they rode through empty valleys and over hills bare of the usual flocks of sheep and goats if the sunsguard had actually sealed off this area if that was the case and bandits had fled the coming conflict they could easily have run right into the sunsguard he hoped so he truly hoped so not only because it meant that they would not encounter any trouble going there and back but because the scum that had fattened on the misery of the shepherds of these hills for so long well deserved to be cut down like the plague rats they were it was easy enough to know where to go despite the fact that there was no road to follow the marching feet of so many thousands of men had left a road across the landscape the tough and wiry vegetation hereabouts pounded flat then into dust this was a tough country of scrubby vegetation and endless hilly moors punctuated as he used to tell dethor by endless rocky hills yet it had its own beauty the gorse was in bloom and the heather and drifts of purple white and yellow spread hazy blotches of color across the face of those hills the weather elected to smile upon them todayor the sunlord himself didfor the sun beamed down upon them neither too brazenly hot nor thin and chill out of a sky whose blue was interrupted only by the occasional white fluffy cloud like one of those missing sheep once or twice they caught sight of wild goats on the ridges or heard the bray of an equally wild donkey but otherwise it was nothing but wind and birdsong he had no idea how low his spirits had been in the wake of the battle until they were well away from the battlefield and he could allow himself to pretend it had never happened but the clean wind swept through his heart and soul he was going to a rescue not a battle and he felt as if the wind was carrying away his sadness a little at a time and this was home the breeze felt right the hills smelled right they were the right color of graygreen and the right sort of rocks poked up through the thin soil he might never see these hills again so he absorbed the changing landscape stowing it away in his memory to take out on those nights that would surely come when he felt himself to be entirely alien in an alien land finally he had to remind himself to stay alert this was no pleasure jaunt things could still go wrong at any moment if the sunsguard wasnt busy picking off former tedrels they could be here at any moment this is a handsome land kantor observed ears pricked forward to catch every sound hard but handsome i think so he agreed secretly pleased by kantors compliment ahwell be coming up to a spring here shortly if my memory of this area is any good there arent a lot of good watering places here warn the others that well be stopping for a moment his memory was goodand interestingly enough the tedrels had not made use of the spring he recalled for they had to deviate from the track and go over a hill to the east to get to the halfhidden water source when they did they found no sign that anyone had been there and the tedrels would surely have trampled the bank of the stream that the spring fed and muddied the basin but alberich was taking no chances just to be sure that they hadnt been here and tampered with the water which would have been entirely like them he called over one of the healers test this for fouling or poison can you he asked the greenclad woman hmm she gave him a sidelong glance but bent to test the water taking up a single drop on the end of her finger and touching it to her tongue that would have been like those bastards wouldnt it she said absently spoil whats behind them so the karsites couldnt follow my thought he agreed gravely well its clean you can bring them all in she stood up he waved at the wagons and the teamsters brought their charges in to drink at the stream fed by the spring while the humans drank at the source toothachingly cold the water tasted of minerals the horses adored it fortunately they were not so thirsty that they were in any danger of hurting themselves by drinking too much too fast he kept an eye on the crests of the hills around them the disadvantage of stopping here or anywhere for a drink was that doing so made them very vulnerable but this spring flowing as it did out of the side of a hill at least was not as exposed as the stream it fed that ran along the bottom of the valley he put a lookout on the crest of the hill which was all anyone could reasonably do and trusted also to his gift and that of the farseer that was with them to warn of any danger approaching but all that appeared was a herd of sheep and a dogand a very brief glimpse of the shepherd who turned his flock aside and back over the hill when he saw them at least hell know the waters safe kantor pointed out as he rounded everyone up anxious to be gone now that they had been spotted i dont think hes likely to say anything to anyone for a while days probably considering the taciturn nature of the lone shepherds here alberich was inclined to agree the sunpriests hated them for they could not be controlled as easily as villagers they thought their own long thoughts alone out here for moons at a time and could not be compelled to come for the regular temple services you could not leave sheep to tend themselves while you hiked to the nearest village for sundescending sunrising solstice and equinox after all and sheep tended to run astray when they felt like doing so not on any schedule if there was to be wool for the wheel and the loom and mutton and lamb for the table the shepherds had to be left to their own ways and thoughts the priests were not amused but they could do nothing about it on a rock beside the mouth of the spring he left the thanktoken for whoever actually owned the resource it might even be that shepherdbut whoever laid claim to the water rights would find the proper toll for the use of his water alberich had packed several such needful things in kantors saddlebags before theyd left in this case it was something virtually every hillman would find useful the more especially since the confiscation of so many weapons by the sunpriests a tedrel crossbow and a quiver of quarrels for it all wrapped in oiled canvas to keep them safe there was nothing about any of the tokens alberich had brought that said valdemar and nothingsuch as for instance a bit of goldthat would be difficult for a poor hillman to explain these were after all his people still he would have a care to what happened to them when he was gone again and on they went taking to the pounded track once again as the sun sank on their right and the light edged into gold and goldenorange and the shadows of the hills grew long and stretched across their path that was when he sent laika and a younger herald out on a long scout ahead if laika was right they should be getting near to the camp and he began the usual futile attempt to probe at the nearfuture like a man probing at an old wound to see if it still hurt as usual his gift was silent which was in a way a good thing since it wasnt warning him about anything the sun was dropping nearer the horizon now and the sky to the left had turned a deeper blue while the sky to the right with long banks of cloud across the path of the sun was turning red it would be sunset soon and they still hadnt found that camp he was beginning to be concerned they would have to decide very shortly whether to go on under the full moon able to see all right but risking ambush or make camp themselves alberich came a mindcall it jerked him out of his preoccupation with scanning the hilltops for trouble and made his heart race in sudden alarm steady on chosen that wasnt trouble kantor said and in the next moment he knew that his companion was right of course if it had been trouble there would have been warning and alarm in that mindvoice it was from the youngster who had gone out with laika and the next words that came were excited not fearful alberich get up hereyou have to see this to believe it the excitement communicated itself to kantor who tossed his head in sudden impatience to be gone ears pricked forward muscles tensing laika and kulen something have seen he called to the rest keep to the tracksummoned i have been kantor evidently felt that was enough he launched from a swift walk into a flat gallop speeding over the top of the hill down across the next valley and over the next hill and the next and the next and that was when alberich saw why there had been so much excitement in kulens mindvoice because coming slowly toward them flowing over the hill like a dusty moving carpet was an army an army of children not just children he saw after his first astonished look there were some adult women among them but not many and they were burdened with infants slung across their backs and their chests carried in baskets even it was clearly the children themselves who were in charge hereand it made alberichs heart leap into his throat to see how carefully they were tending to each other there were carts pulled by donkeys and ponies full of the very smallest led by those old enough to control a beast there were more carts that the tallest and strongest were towing themselves and those old and strong enough to walk by themselves were doing so in little groups each shepherded by one older child and now that alberich was here laika was not going to wait any longer she and her companion raced toward the oncoming horde and after an initial reaction of alarm several of the children recognized her and dropped the bundles they were carrying to race toward her cheering as they went kantor ive told them kantor replied joyfully theyre putting on some speed by the time alberich and kantor got to the front of the mob laika was engulfed in children all babbling in that strange polyglot tongue she had told him about he remembered what else she had told him as they rode on the waythat these poor children were starved for adult attention that she used to tell them stories and had made herself a kind of extended grandmother to a great many of them the dry bare bones of her narrative did not prepare him for seeing this and he felt his eyes stinging with tears at least he had had his mother lonely though his childhood had been he felt a tugging at his sleeve and looked down at a little girl who had the features of one of his own hill folk aunty laika says you were of the people of the sunlord the child whispered in karsite peering up at him hopefully and that you are of the white riders of the ghosthorses now i am both he told her immediately dropping to the ground to put his eyes on a level with hers this is my ghosthorse his name is kantor ghosthorse where did she come up with that i like that a great deal better than whitedemon or hellhorse kantor said lowering his nose to touch the hand she stretched out to him have you really come to take us somewhere safe she asked as he marveled that a child of karse should ever reach toward a companion without fear we havebut who told you of all this he asked trying to make sense of the puzzle who told you about ghosthorses and white riders if it was laika he was going to have a few choice words with her that sort of story could have gotten her killed and the other three heralds exposed oh it was kantis of course the child told him blandly in a tone that put the emphasis on of course kantis has told us about the white riders forever and he promised us that some day they would come and take us where there are always good things to eat and a soft bed to sleep in and no one would make us walk when were tired and that wed all have a mum and a da though wed have to share before he could ask her who kantis was much less where he was and how he had come up with this unlikely tale and convinced them it was going to be true she caught sight of something past his shoulder and with a squeal of glee ran off he looked around what she had seen and what had set the rest of the children running was the first lot of heralds and wagons topping the hill brushed by the scarlet and gold of sunset and in a moment he was nothing more than a rock in a flood of children who found a little more energy in their weary bodies to run they flowed around him like the largest flock of sheep in the world faces transmuted by hopeand it was all he could do to hold back his tears and of course faced with this oncoming flood of children screaming not in fear but with delight the heralds and healers and teamsters reacted just as any decent human beings wouldtumbling out of the seats and off their mounts to open their arms and their hearts to open the boxes and bags of provisions they had brought to stuff little hands and mouths with food and drink and toss little bodies into wagons padded with blankets even as more little bodies were helping even littler ones to climb up as well they couldnt understand what the children were saying but they didnt need to know to understand what was needed and many of them were smiling with tears in their eyes how could they not after leaving that grim scene of battle aftermath behind them how could they not want to ease their own aching hearts with the warmth of a joyful child and it was all sorted out in a remarkably short period of time those carts that had been drawn by children were fastened to the backs of the wagons with the children themselves sharing out the provisions in a generous way that made alberich marvel everyone got enough to fill his empty belly the few camp followers who had come with the children rather than fleeing burdened with abandoned infants were provided with seats and clean linens for the babies and in lieu of milk sugarwater for them to suck to at least stop their crying and ease their hunger the last of the teamsters finding no need for their empty wagons asked permission to go on under guard and see what they could get out of the abandoned camp after a moment of thought alberich gave his permissionalthough with unchildlike forethought the little ones were all carrying loot in their bundles whatever was small valuable and light they gave it up to the heralds without a second thought and that pained him did they think they would have to pay for their rescue no laika said when he asked her that no this is just something that this mysterious kantis told them to do he relayed that information back to the army via kantor along with his recommendation that at least a portion of it be kept in trust for the children themselves that was all he could do about it but they seemed far more interested in eating and sleeping than in the jewelry and coins theyd lugged along so he dismissed it from his mind as if the one god had decided to ease their way further the full moon rose before the last light of twilight faded with the broad track to follow there was no chance of getting lost and not much chance that a horse would make a misstep and hurt himself accordingly there was never even a thought but that they would turn around and head back to the border bit by bit as laika and the other three talked to the older children a broad picture began to form of what had happened one of the first karsite orphans scooped up by the tedrels when they first made their alliance and moved into karse was a boy they all called kantis it was he who had somehow concocted the odd cult that laika had noticed among the childrena cult that admitted no adult members and whose members were sworn to secrecy with a solemn oath that apparently not even the boys who were later initiated into the tedrel lodges ever broke most of the cult that kantis had created had a very familiar ring to alberich for it was virtually identical to the simple forms of vkandis rites that he had learned as a child from his mentor father kentroch even to calling the god by the name of sunlord but there were more interesting additions kantis had from the beginning it seemed included a kind of redemption story told whenever times were particularly hard for the children he told them all that some day the keepers as he called the tedrel adults would abandon them and never return and on that day the white riders and their ghosthorses would come for them and take them all away into a new land this would not be the home of the sunlord he had assured those who out of bitter experience had feared that this meant they would all have to die no this was a very real land where they would all make families with a shared set of parents where they would always have enough to eat and a warm safe place to sleep and where they would never have to follow the drum again the children stolen out of valdemar only reinforced kantis stories when they identified the white riders as heralds somehow he had impressed upon them the need to keep all of this utterly secret even more so than the redemption story and somehow he had known the very moment when the tedrels lost their battle for even before the remnants of the army came running back to the camp to take what they could carry and flee he was telling the children that now was the time he organized them told them they should get what they wanted and whatever shiny things they could find in the adult camp hide the ponies and donkeys until the last of the adults were gone and prepare to march north themselves as soon as the last of the keepers fled away which was exactly what they had done those camp followers who had not run off with skirts stuffed full of valuables and some protector or alone had been bewildered by the stubborn insistence of the children on their goal but had gone along with it seeing no other options before them most of them were heartbreakingly young by alberichs standards and not yet hardened from camp follower to whore they must have set out from the remains of the camp about the same time that alberich and his group set out from valdemar the entire story was mindboggling and he wanted very badly to meet this boy this soclever sointelligent boy calling himself kantis and speak with him but though he rode up and down the line he could not actually find the boy one child after another asserted that yes kantis was certainly with themsomewherebut no one could tell him what group kantis was with or where hed last been seen he might have been a figment of their collective imaginationhe might have been a ghost himselffor he had somehow utterly vanished from among them the moment that they spotted laika and kulen the wagons loaded with the most portable of the tedrel wealth caught up with them much sooner than alberich had anticipated this was in part because the portable wealth was very portable indeed and in part because the section carrying the children was moving slowly the poor things were exhausted and even packed together like so many turnips in a sack once stuffed with food and water they fell asleep so since the treasure wagons were going to have to catch up with the main part of the group anyway alberich took their pace down to a steady walk laika came up beside him now that night had fallen he was able to relax his guard laika sharing his memories of karse was similarly relaxed nighttime held no terrors for alberich now not after so many years in valdemar if the sunpriests unleashed their demonsand given how quiet the night was he rather thought that said demons were fully engaged in pursuing stray tedrels at the momenthe didnt think they would bother to do so here so far as the sunpriests knew at this point there was no one in this part of the hills but the children and why waste their most dangerous and powerful nighttime weapon on a lot of children children who couldnt escape on their own and would soon be facing the fires anyway he had to unclench his jaw over that thought and he sent up a silent prayernot the first and he doubted if it would be the lastthat one day the sunpriests would be answering for their transgressions and one day it would be priests like his old mentor kentroch and like father henrick and geri who would be ruling in karse again one of the other heralds came riding up looking nervously over his shoulder herald alberich shouldnt we be putting outriders all around he asked i mean peace at ease be protected we are by the priests themselves alberich said and exchanged a glance with laika she laughed karsites wont stir out of their doors after dark she said with the air of one who knows their priests have a habit of sending some sort of creepyhowly thing out at night to make sure nobodys out doing something they shouldnt even the sunsguard stirs not alberich added with sardonic amusement so that now should even a priest order them out they will not go caught in their own trap laika said and serve em right so by the time suns up well be so close to our people that even if they catch on were here our folks can mount a big enough rescue to squeak us across without losing so much as a hair alberich considered how much the tedrels had drained from the country and sighed with pain if they scout or farsee us we takeso far as they will knowuseless mouths only we leavethink they willthe camp unplundered privately he doubted that even the sunpriests would trouble themselves with farseeing this part of karse they would use their power to track down the tedrels and tedrel recruits they must know that sendar was dead but they must also know that now was not the time to attack valdemar themselves valdemar had just fought a terrible battle and were exhausted yes but the karsite sunsguard was drained and weakened by the demands of the tedrels the current son of the sun he set bandits against valdemar then hired the tedrels to do his work for him alberich thought somberly and now thanks to the drain that the tedrels put on his resources the sunsguard must be even more depleted he hasnt got the means to attack us no the sunsguard would be mopping up what was left with the priests assisting then they would all descend on the tedrel base camp with an eye to getting back what had been drained from them believe me there is no way the plunder in that camp can be exhausted even by us and the tedrels that were left laika told them both therell be enough there to satisfy priestly greed even after our wagons come back it isnt only the karsite treasury theyve been draining theyve got the accumulation of some twenty or thirty years worth of loot from other campaigns theyve fought and theyve been saving it all waiting for the day when theyd have their own land again she scratched her head thinking and added ill give the bastards this much they had discipline almost a quartercentury of honest pay extortion and booty and they didnt spend a clipped copper coin more than they had to every fighter had his own store of loot but beyond that every true tedrel war duke had a treasury tent waiting for the day when he could finance the building of his own fortified keep in the heart of his own principality alberich was greatly pleased to hear that if the wagons sent onward came back so well loaded then perhaps the childrens little hoards could be kept solely for their use when they were older if the ride out had been a mixed pleasure the ride back was an unalloyedif bittersweetone with all worry about encountering sunsguard gone under a glorious full moon and a sky full of stars and buoyed on the energy of the successful rescue there was nothing in the way of opening themselves up to pure aesthetic enjoyment of a tranquil ride through peaceful countryside the teamsters once the situation was explained to them relaxed and sat easily on the seats of their wagons even the babies only whimpered a little now and then timeless and dreamlike they moved on across ground that seemed enchanted and drunk with peace it was as if the one god was granting them all a reprieve from their grief the sorrow that would confront them when they crossed back into valdemar giving their hearts a rest so that they could all bear it better when at last it came just about the time when the moon was straight overhead he heard the wagons coming up behind them the sound of the wheels echoing a little among the hills since they were near to the spring theyd used on the way in he called a halt there once the whole party was together again the children didnt even wake up more about these children tell me he asked of laika when they were on the move again and a comfortable sort of fatigue began to set in the moon silvering the grass around hem turned the landscape into a strange sculpture of ebony and argent with hoofbeats muffled by the soft earth and grass they seemed to be moving in a dream and he asked the question more to hear a human voice than for the information itself youll find theyre a funny lot she replied youd think being mostly not taught anything that theyd be wild butwell once they got out of babyhood they pretty much had to teach themselves and take care of each other and by the gods thats what they do maybe it was because so many of em lost their whole families but theyve got a kind of mottonobody left behindand they stick to it the older ones see that the little ones get fed and clothed the little ones do what they can to help the older ones i think theyre the next thing to illiterate but theyll drink up anything you teach them like thirsty ground they all found out that the tedrels themselves may not do anything for them but if they made themselves useful they got rewards beyond whatever the tedrels dumped in their section of the camp so thats another thing they learned to do how to make themselves useful then when that kantis child showed up he really organized them of coursei didnt get to see much of that since i was an adult she coughed very secret that cult was no grownups were to hear about it sowhen into our camp we bring them they will helpful be he hazarded i would be greatly amazed if they didnt swarm the place doing all sorts of little chores anybody expecting a bunch of terrified wild little beasts is going to get a shock having em around is a lot like having a tribe of those little house sprites some old stories talk about they cant do heavy labor but by the gods when they get determined to do something it gets done i had to fish more of em out of my wash tubs than i care to think about she chuckled a little then sobered listen you have the queens ear make sure no one breaks them up into little groups right awaylet em sort themselves out theyve made up little family groups of their own and its all theyve got make sure none of us take that away from them i shall he promised it wasnt a difficult promise to make the caravan moved on ghosting through the darkness and even at the slow pace they reached the border again a little after sunrise the children were awake by then and peering eagerly ahead alberich had elected to come into the camp not from the south directly but indirectly from the west saving the children the sight of the battlefield they might have run tame in the tedrel camp for most of their lives and they might be inured to the aftermath of battle but he didnt think they had ever seen a battlefield even now there would still be much of horror about it the result of so great a conflict was not cleaned up in a day or two and it was no sight for these little ones so they actually made a detour upcountry leaving the trampled road that the tedrels had left until they struck an old track that crossed the border at a ford and joined up with one of the valdemaran roads used by border patrols the old track showed some wear so someone was still using it it was rutted and gave the teamsters some hard times but they took it in good part knowing they were nearly home whenever a wagon got stuck the children if it was one that was carrying children all piled out and the largest children mobbed it put their young shoulders to it and helped in the front by hauling on the horses harness no wagon remained stuck for long with that kind of help for alberich crossing the border brought on a mood of melancholy and depression not despairbut his heart sank with every pace they came nearer the camp for a little he had been allowed to forget but only for a little and now they had all lost so much so much and yet just as they approached the camp with what seemed like half the inhabitants waiting for them and in the very moment that the blackest depression descended on him the children changed the complexion of everything they had been clinging to the sides of the wagons peering over and around each other trying to see aheadwhen they saw the lines of whiteclad heralds and companions they could not hold themselves back they boiled out of the wagons spilled over the sides tumbled to the ground laughing and shouting and ran to those who waited white riders white riders they shouted virtually the only karsite they knew pouring into the camp and running up to anyone who looked even halfway friendly as if these were not strangers but friends and beloved relations there were a great many of these children he realized as more of them spilled out of the wagons and carts more than the thousand that laika had promised but no one seemed to mind certainly no one called him or selenay to account for it not then and not at any time thereafter and in the days following as the bodies were burned or buried as the wounded were taken north as the encampment was disassembled and troop after troop of fighters sent north again it was the children who kept them all sane they were everywhere poking their noses into everything trying to learn valdemaran trying to help where they could and just being children some for the first time in their short lives not even selenay was proof against their sheer exuberance at being here a place that they seemed to consider an earthly paradise and before long she had adopted a half dozen or they adopted her making them her pages and promising that they would be allowed to join her royal household in that capacity once they all reached haven nor was she the only one every wagon going north seemed to hold a handful of children going to a new home fighters teamsters heraldsservants and highborneveryone who could take in two three or four children did so i never would have believed it no matter who had told me if anyone had claimed that bringing these children here was the best thing we could have done selenay told him on the third afternoon of the return watching a child dash away with a message to be given to the next dispatch rider going out of the camp her eyes were still shadowed with sorrow but her lips curved in a faint fond smile i thought that it was something that had to be done but truth to tell i was dreading the mess theyd make for us theyd taken down the black felt linings for the tents and the painted canvas glowed with afternoon light that too was a mixed blessing more light raised the spirit a littlebut the black felt had gone for use as shrouds and i he agreed most unnaturally helpful they seem she had to smile at that just a little you dont see them at their worst theyre still children they still fight and get into things they shouldnt and have tantrums but for all of that im afraid that in years to come theyre going to be held up as the good examples that every naughty child in valdemar should behave like or perhaps as children being a year from now and they will no better nor worse than others become alberich suggested she flicked a fly away with the feather end of her quill perhaps she put pen to paper and signed another order who knows im no foreseer and isee not that far when i see at all he admitted ruefully if i had been could i have changed any of this or was it all too big for any one man to change speaking of the children ive given some thought to what to do with them the ones that havent managed to get themselves adopted already that is she said looking up at him and i wanted to ask you what you think keeping them to their ownahfamilies you are he asked a little anxiously because he had seen just as laika had told him how they sorted themselves out into their own little families and stayed together it had been the smallest of those groups of two three or four children that were the ones that found homes first of course she replied it doesnt take an empath to realize we shouldnt tear apart what few bonds they have but thats where the problem lies you see there arent too many families or even childless couples prepared to take in six or a dozen children at once much less ones that dont even speak our language so my first thought was towellsend them to school she folded both hands over the papers on her little desk and looked anxiously at him to see what his reply would be he nodded that made perfect sense likethe academy he hazarded she nodded or the collegia oh obviously they cant actually go to the collegia we havent nearly enough room for them but something like the collegia and there are a lot of valdemaran orphans to deal with toothough those are having to go to the houses of healing im afraid they need mindhealers right now not schooling her face darkened for a moment but she took a deep breath and went on so ive written to all of the major temples the ones with both day and boardingschools and asked if they would take in some of the families for a year teach them valdemaran and some basic reading and writing until ive got these orphan collegia built she waited for his response he pondered what she had told him your project this is she nodded if i have to she said with some of the same mulish stubbornness of her father ill pay for it out of my own household budget he raised an eyebrow doubt do i with the current mood of the council you will have to and now she had the good grace to blush then better to push it through now than wait she said raising her chin given that the booty from the tedrels has furnished the means to restore all the damage they did down here there isnt a great deal for the council to complain about that was certainly true laika had been correct about that as well so build housing for these childrenbut homes he prompted im going to look for childless couples and ask them to serve as surrogate parents she said warming to her subject more than one couple of course for each house it will probably take a year to get that all sorted out find couples that like each other enough to share that kind of responsibility get the houses built but then we can keep them all together we can probably even put valdemaran children in with them that he interjected a most good idea is help each other they can and good it would be for valdemaran children to know tedrel children are no different than they she sighed deeply i was hoping you would say that then its settled ill put it up to the council first thing maybe they wont think its as important as some of their other business but i do so the prophecy is going to come true after all that the children of the tedrels were going to have real homes though they would share mothers and fathers once again he wondered about that mysterious child called kantis since arriving back in camp hed been too busy to look any further for him and by now he could begone well this will be the last one of these that i sign here selenay said signing the last of the papers waiting for her signature and seal and putting it in the pile of completed work she closed her eyes for a moment and it cost him to see how worn and tired she looked i wont miss this place nor i he could not wait to be gone truth to tell if this had been karse rather than valdemar the aftermath would have been left for the locals to clean up but it wasnt so now there was a neat cemetery with rows of wooden markers out there where the churnedup ground had beenand a pit full of ashes where everything that wasnt valdemaran had been disposed of there had been too many burials for single ceremonies each day at sunset had ended with a mass ceremony at which the names of the interred fallen for that day had been read he had come to hate sunset as each sunset brought fresh pain or the renewal of old as names of those he hadnt known were gone and those he had known were dead were read out he woke each morning it seemed with the scent of death in his nostrils and went to sleep at night with a heart too heavy for tears only sendar and a few of the highborn were going north to find burial it was too bad but there were not many who could afford the expense to bring their loved ones homeand the horror of transporting that many bodies stacked in the beds of wagons like so much cargoand in the heat of summerdid not bear thinking about there wasnt a teamster in the country who could be induced to use his wagon and team for that but that was always the case in war the highborn had already been taken north in their expensive sealed coffins by the family retainers in blackfeltdraped wagons bedecked with family crests only the king was left to make his final journey in the company of his daughter and those who had known him best it would be an honor guard and it was an honor to be included in it and here was the one factor that leavened just a little the sadness of the journey for alberich no one not one person had objected to his presence at selenays side talamir had already been sent north with the wounded and there was no queens own to ride with her but she wouldnt need the queens own on the journey only bodyguards the council had gone on ahead and now that the most urgent needs had been answered all decisions were being held until selenay reached haven so when it came down to it selenay only needed her bodyguards not alberich yet no one said a word when she posted the final list of who was to accompany her and chief on the list was herald alberich acting queens own are we on schedule she asked packing up her writing case with greater care than the simple task warranted ahead a little he told her in readiness all will be for leaving at dawn she closed and locked the case then sighed i suppose ill be expected to make a speech yes he did not elaborate on that he felt horribly sorry for her but it was her duty and she knew it but there was another aspect to this journey of grief that he didnt think she ad considered not only the army mourned its king but the country it is wondered majesty if pausing you will be at each village theyd left it to him to ask that delicate question that and any others that might come up he was acting queens own after all delicate questions it seemed were a art of the job at each village she asked looking blank a speech to make he elaborated she frowned and looked as if she had suddenly developed headache oh gods i dont want to but people are going to want to pay their respects arent they but each time we stop its just going to make this whole thing drag out longer and the frown turned into a look of despair and he sensed that if he told her she should make all those stops shed do it but it might break her he racked his brain for an answer and finally thought he had a compromise majestyperhaps not a stop and not a speech butspectacle something for memory and showing honor a herald sent ahead to warn each place that we come then drop pace to a slow walk withahmuffled drums lowered banners through each places center though a detour we make no speech but he sought for the word desperately on your part to be the icon of grief you need speak not only mourn publicly she looked as if he had taken a huge burden off of her shoulders the very thingwould you go see to it for me get it all organized she must be near the breaking point or she wouldnt delegate that to me at once majesty he promised pleasebe eating would you little have you had since morning that got a thin ghost of a smile from her except for the accent you sound like talamir or my old nurse all right nanny alberich ill go get something to eat and i promise ill get some sleep too maybe ill have crathach give me something to make me sleep and go to bed early that most wise would be he said and eat you must too thin you are how are you to get a husband so thin you are she stared at him for a moment in utter silence as he kept his face completely expressionless then weakly she began to laugh he allowed himself a smile she wiped away a tear but he could see that some of the lines of grief and worry around her eyes had eased and they say you have no sense of humor she said nor do i all know this he assured her go now and something impossible demand of the cooks impossible that caught her off guard why first that a reason they will have at last to complain cooks must complain in their nature it is second that injured their pride has been that you have asked for nothing their pride is in that their masters demand much of them third concerned they have been that you have asked for nothing they fear you need them not fourth they worry for you he raised an eyebrow but be certain though impossible it is something you want suspect i do that they will create it ah she blinked do you know everything that is going on around here he shook his head at that not i but kantor i have as caryo you have our companions know much and what they know not generally they can discover sendar made use of that often and often id better get used to doing the same then this time her smile was a little stronger as she picked up her writing case and stood up and ill think about impossible things to eat on the way to my tent can you find crathach and send him to me while youre doing all the other things ive asked you to without difficulty he returned her smile ask rantor i shall they left the tent together she picked up her escort of ylsa and keren at the door of the command tent and went her own way in the golden light of another perfect evening while alberich started off on the last of the errands she had set him the last turned out to be the first crathach was nearby and heartily approved of selenays wish to sleep early most of the rest were trivial and easily discharged that left the organization of what were essentially funeral corteges through every hamlet village and town on the road to haven but rather than solve that one himself he asked kantor to have all the heralds that were left in campsave only selenays bodyguardsmeet him back at the command tent and bring with them the remaining highborn officers and bards the latter because bards tended to be very good at concocting ceremonies and he suspected they would have some ideas they did and it didnt take very long either since this was only going to be a procession the greatest amount of time was spent in deciding what the order of precedence was going to be and then what places in the procession would belong to whom he left them at it after about a mark his place would be with selenay and if they settled their differences without any interference from him even if not everyone was happy they couldnt attach any blame to him or the queen and nothing would be required of her except to follow the wagon carrying the coffin on foot with caryo walking beside her certainly no speeches the focus of attention wouldnt be on her but rightfully on the kings remains which should be something of a relief so he hoped anyway if she wept all the better he hoped she would weep she hadnt done nearly enough by this time it was full dark and the camp was quiet with an early start planned for the morrow most people had if their duties allowed made an early night he moved down the nowfamiliar lanes of tents in the light of the torches stuck on either side of his path thinking that this place would look very odd when all of the canvas had been struck and there was no sign of what had stood here but trampled grass im glad to be leaving kantor said so am i at least in haven there would not be the everpresent reminders that this was the place where they had lost a king his tent had been moved inside what had been the royal enclosure to adjoin selenays and out of habit he glanced at hers to see if there was any light showing there wasnt and with a feeling of relief he nodded to the guards at the tent door and entered his own they didnt trouble to leave guards inside the tent anymore selenays little pages all slept in bedrolls spread out across the floor and anyone trying to get in would probably step on one of them he certainly wouldnt get in quietly those children slept lightly and the least little sound sent half a dozen heads shooting up any intruder would set off more noise than disturbing a flock of geese a lantern had been lit for him and hung from the center pole showing that most of his baggage had already been packed up and presumably put on the wagon there wasnt much left only a bedroll a set of clean linen and the towels and soap hed need in the morning and kantor most heralds tents were big enough for their companion mystes being an exception but she had obviously gotten last choice on accommodations somewhat to his surprise it wasnt at all unusual for heralds to share their tents with their companions rather than using the canvas shelters kantor took up roughly half the space that first night in his own tent again bowed down by grief he had craved kantors company with a need that was almost physical and kantor had obliged by leaving the canvas shelter at the side and moving into the tent proper and at first despite that craving it had still seemed unnatural in a way to have ahorsein his tent now it was just as in the old days when he had shared tent space with another sunsguard it no longer seemed at all odd to see him there excuse me i believe i am far better company than any of the sunsguard you ever shared tent space with kantor said indignantly he felt instantly contrite i beg your pardon indeed you are did anyone leave anything here for me to eat selenays swarm of little ones had adopted him as well and lately had taken to fetching food for him at the same time that they got meals for her leaving them in his tent wellcovered and protected against the depredations of insects and other pests as a matter of fact they did andi dont suppose youll share kantor asked hopefully since his appetite had suffered as much lately as selenays kantors hope was wellfounded i dont know why not he sat down on the bedroll and saw that the usual covered platter and cup had been left for him cleverly balanced on two more cups in a pan of water which prevented insects from crawling into it he took them out and shoved the pan of water over to kantors side of the tent taking the cover off the platter explained why kantor had hoped hed share selenay had asked for the impossible gotten it and had seen to it that he got some of the cooks largesse perfect for the heavy weather and a failing appetite were two sallats a savory one and a sweet the former a bed of greens with cheese bits of chicken fragrant herbs and spiced vinegar the latter of chopped fresh fruit and nuts with honeysweetened cream how had she known hed like such things too piff she asked me via caryo of course she doesnt need being told something twice id like some of that cress please and some spinach with the empty platter and cup left outside his tent door he stretched out along his bedroll and listened to the sounds of the camp he had been a soldier for too long not to be able to sleep when he needed to but he had also been a soldier for too long not to be able to assess the mood of the camp just from the night noises tonight he sensed mostly weariness and relief they had been here long enough and through work and time what had been terrible anguish had muted to bearable sorrow now it was more than time to go home and take up their lives again except perhaps for selenay the time for grief was over and the time to move on had come and that was as it should be when morning came he was barely able to get dressed and out of his tent before selenays servants swarmed all over it her tent had already been struck and she was finishing a strong cup of chava and a buttered roll while in her saddle as he escaped from the collapsing tent still tying the laces at the collar and cuffs of his shirt one of the pages handed him a similar cup and roll and waited impatiently for the empty cup another brought kantor a bucket of grain the companion immediately plunged his nose into it and began his own breakfast prudently alberich ate and drank before getting into the saddle there wasnt a chance hed be given a chance to finish unless he did the chava wasnt scalding hot as he had feared it might be but the heavy admixture of cream and sugar and the color like thin mud warned him that it was probably from the bottom of the pot it was even with the help of cream and sweetening it nearly made his hair stand on end but it certainly woke him up he handed the empty cup to the page who took it and vanished the second whisked off the bucket the moment kantor lifted his head from it all around them tents were falling in the thin gray light of predawn selenay gave her cup to a page just as ylsa and keren walked their companions into what had been the royal enclosure alberich was in the saddle a moment later selenay looked around at the vanishing camp is breaking camp always like this she asked a little dazed a camp we sunsguard seldom had alberich admitted i got the impression last night that everyone was pretty impatient to be out of here but dont take my word for it keren shrugged i dont usually serve with the army that speech you should make before we leave i fear alberich told selenay in an undertone but it will be the last until haven we reach this i can promise she grimaced but nodded i hope you two know where im supposed to be she asked the other two thats why were here visa told her they sent us to fetch you selenay gestured broadly with one hand well lead on since you know where were going the processionfor procession it would be even when it wasnt going through a villagehad already begun to form up on the road keren and ylsa went straight to the front of it where the rest of selenays guards were waiting the funeral wagon would not be immediately behind her but would be the first of the string of wagons bard lellian in charge of the ceremonial part of the journey came up and introduced himself majesty i have devised something i hope will meet with your approval he told selenay ignoring the rest of them in a way that told alberich that his singleminded focus was due to anxiety not an intention to slight them it will not be the ordeal that stopping for speeches would have been you will merely have to drop back and take your place on foot behind the coffin when we reach any sort of town along with the rest of the notables who have been deemed of high enough rank to follow you afoot that is all simply follow afoot anddo whatever you feel impelled to do selenays relief at the simplicity of the arrangements was obvious then when you have dropped back the riders here at the front will all divide to either side of the road let the wagon and the walkers pass and fall in behind the last of the walkers except for two bards with muffled drums the bard finished those will ride in front of the wagon he peered anxiously at her he was not a young man but he didnt seem to know selenay very well i hope that meets with your approval hes a specialist in this sort of thing kantor confided funeral dirges memorial ballads funerary ritualsrather a melancholy profession i would think but apparently it suits him this is the first time hes had anything to do with the royals though and hes nervous i think it is very fine she told him and he smiled with relief you must have worked terribly hard to come up with something thisappropriateat such short notice now he blushed with pleasure and murmured a disclaimer she raised her head to assess the state of preparations even as he thanked her we seem to be ready to move out kantor told his chosen would you sound a call for silence please selenay asked the bard who snatched up the trumpet at his saddle bow and played a fournote flourish silence fell immediately and selenay rode caryo up onto the bank beside the road so that everyone could see her this seems to be a moment that requires a speech she said into the waiting silence but a speech to me means something that has been prepared for the ears of strangers and after all that we have been through together i think that none of us are strangers now she paused and looked up and down the road and alberich knew that she was making certain each and every one of those in this cortege felt she lad made eye contact with him perhaps some day when our losses are not so fresh our wounds are not so raw we will be able to look back on our victory as a victory with more pride than sorrow and we should it was not only my fathers sacrifice that won the day it was the sacrifice of every single person who perished or was wounded and every one of you who held a weapon who wielded your gifts who tended a beast kept us fed or served any other task here the victory belongs to all of you and never ever let anyone tell you differently she took a breath blinked hard and continued and even if the enemy had won here he would never have taken valdemar for valdemar is more than land valdemar is the people and the spirit that lives in those people and that spirit can never be conquered now she looked at the sealed coffin draped in black and covered with a pall upon which the arms of valdemar were embroidereda pall that had once been sendar and selenays battle banners and which were still stained with blood not just sendars blood either but that of all those who had been with him whether wounded or fallen he knew that and he trusted to that spirit to carry on no matter what happened to him you have shown that spirit is alive in all of you and he could have no better tribute than that nor would he have asked for anything more another pause and i do not ask for anything less well said my queen he mindspoke to her and was rewarded by a brief flicker of her eyes in his direction now it is time for all of us to tender him our final service she finished nowlet us bear him gently home and she rode down the bank to her place at the head of the procession and lifted her hand in signal alberich took his place at her side with keren and ylsa to the right and left she dropped her hand and they moved forward on the road to haven and though there had not yet been a ceremony or a coronation everyone in that procession knew that this was the moment when the heir truly took up the reins of power and so in silence but for the sound of hooves and feet and wheels on the road the reign of king sendar ended and the reign of queen selenay began the journey north accomplished for selenay what the cleanup of the battlefield had done for everyone else it allowed her to indulge in the full expression of her mourningin public until the moment of departure she had held her grief firmly in check perhaps feeling that with so many others suffering she should not further burden them with her own grief if she wept she did so only in private everyone knew she mourned but she did so quietly but on his journey her public duty was to mourn to be the symbol of valdemars grief and at last she could give free rein to all of the anguish she had held inside it seemed that everyone along their route wished to pay heir final respects to the king farmers left their fields shepherds their flocks tradesmen their crafts villagers and townsfolk lined both sides of the road and the road itself was carpeted with rushes flowers and herbs whenever they entered a town so much so that the wheels of the wagons were muffled and cushioned against bumps people carrying baskets and great bouquets of blossoms and even handwoven garlands and blankets of flowers brought them up and placed them on the wagon as it crept past them at a slow walk until it overflowed with blooms and foliage and nothing of the blackdraped coffin could be seen and they wept which had the effect of freeing selenays tears it was exhausting for her but at the same time it was exactly what she needed alberich and crathach saw to it that she got plenty to drink plenty of clean handkerchiefs and the occasional arm about her shoulders the healer concocted soothing eyewashes to rinse her sore eyes and face with whenever they stopped she ate with growing appetite which was no bad thing and was so emotionally exhausted by the time they camped for the night that she slept soundly and without waking her little pages saw to it that she had everything she needed faithful as hounds and each day that passed saw a little easing of the tension within her that had kept her so near to the breaking point it was not that she ceased to care or became numb as the days passed it was more as if the worst of her grief was a finite thing a barrel that had only seemed bottomless until she began allowing it to flow freely by the time they reached haven and the procession made its slow and solemn way through the city to the palace that pinched and overstrained look had left her she wore her sorrow and her loss like a cloak with grave dignity rather than being bowed down beneath their intolerable burden she needed that release for as the journey reached its end she was about to undertake her final ordeal the entrance to haven marked the day of sendars official funeral haven had been waiting too long to put it off for even one more dayand that wasnt a bad thing the funeral though it would be exhausting for all concerned especially selenay would put closure to everything they all camped overnight just outside the walls at the royal and home farms and servants from the palace brought them all formal mourning garments formal whites greens and scarlets the line for the bathing facilities and even to use the horse troughs and pumps for a bath was a long one and alberich as did many others elected to bathe in the river instead the faint weedy fragrance of the river water was no match for the strong horse soap they used on themselves as well as their mounts when they arrived at the gate of the city in the early morning they looked as if they had all come straight from the palace itself and the wagons carrying tents belongings and a small mountain of dirty clothing had already gone up the hill leaving only one single wagon the one that had carried sendar to his final rest the court joined them at the first gate the lord marshal the seneschal and the heads of bardic healers and heralds circles all walked with her behind the coffin while the rest joined the riders the coffin itself was transferred by a handpicked group of the guard with great solemnity and ceremony to a more ornate carriage used solely for state funerals before sendar made his last journey through the streets of his capitol and talamir joined them as well alberich was glad enough to relinquish his place at the young queens side and join the rest of her bodyguards but talamir did not so much ride to meet selenay as appear it was a very strange moment for alberich when the official greetings were over and suddenly in a pause and a pocket of silence that seemed created for him there was talamir and talamir was changed vastly changed it was more than just the twenty years that had been added overnight to his appearance it was more than just that his hair had gone silverwhite like the mane of a companion after all alberich had found gray roots to the hair at his temples this very morning when he had stolen a moment at an unoccupied mirror it was much much more than that there was an otherworldly stillness about the queens own a distant look in his eyes as if he was always listening to something no one else could hear and a faint translucency about him as if his flesh was not quite solid enough to contain all of the light of his spirit and a sadness that had nothing to do with the alltoomortal grief he displayed so openly for his king it made alberich shiver a little and he sensed he wasnt the only onebut not everyone seemed to notice the change selenay didnt for one but perhaps she was too young too involved with her own grief or both alberich was just glad to acknowledge talamirs thanks and drop back farther into the procession selfishly grateful to talamir for having recovered quickly enough to take his proper place back it hadnt been a position he had been comfortable with he hated being in the public eye on show now in the formal whites that the young queen had asked him to don for the funeral he was just one herald among many besides now were into haven we come into court protocols and precedence all the pomp and ceremony that i know nothing about the arrival of the state funeral coach had been the first sign that he was rapidly getting out of his depth of experience he and the other heraldsand the royal guards that were leftrode alongside the walkers between them and the crowds of onlookers and mourners here as out in the country the streets were carpeted with flowers and the green herbs of mourning rue and rosemary but there were far far too many people here to allow folk to pile more flowers on the carriage it would have been covered within a single block that was all right they seemed content enough to strew their blossoms in the path of the carriage and the procession the muffled drums augmented now by more mounted and walking musicians made a dull throbbing through the tooquiet streets that was the strangest part of all the quiet in the city alberich was used to the noise of haven but today the silence was broken only by the sound of people sobbing and even that was muffled as if the mourners did not want to spoil the solemnity of the occasion by being too vocal they stopped three times in the course of the morning at three of sendars favorite temples for memorial services that were mercifully briefjust long enough that the walkers could rest before carrying on similar services were being held all over the city and would be all day and well into the night but these comprised the official funeral for the citizens of haven and it took most of the day to get from the city gates to the palace gates they took one break at noon at one of the huge guildhouse squares selenay and her entourage retired to the needleworkers guildhouse for rest and a meal while sendars coffin lay in state in the enormous guildhall of the woolmerchants guildhouse and lines of folk some of whom had traveled for a day to be here filed past then the procession began again after two candlemarks stopping twice more for two more memorial ceremonies and at long last they entered the gates of the palace by then they were all exhausted even those who had only joined the procession when it entered haven sendar was to be interred in the crypt beneath the floor of the palace chapel along with the rest of his line all was in readiness there and had been presumably for days the guard now marched off to their barracks leaving a much shrunken company to enter the chapel behind the coffin they all filed inside where at least it was possible for those who had been walking for so long to sit down candles had already been lit all over the chapel although the last light penetrated the western windows and the interior was overly warm with the golden and reddish light making it appear warmer still incense warred with the scent of lilies for supremacy the chapel was packed solid shoulder to shoulder alberich who had been riding all day rather than walking took a standing position up against the wall beside the royal pew he was glad to be there truth to tell the stone wall felt cool against his back it could have been awful speaker after interminable speaker eulogizing the king until grief turned to benumbed boredom and that would have been a terrible thing to do to selenay but someone had been wise there were no interminable eulogies only a few brief speeches by those who had known and loved sendar the best punctuated by some of the most glorious music that alberich had ever heard not for nothing was this also the site of bardic collegium the bards had exerted themselves to the utmost and even though he had thought that the depths of his grief had been plumbed and exhausted it was the music that brought tears again to his eyes anyone who could have listened to such music and not wept must have had a heart of stone needless to say when it came time for the last of the speakersselenayshe mounted the podium with reddened eyes and tearstreaked cheeks but her voice was clear and steady as she spoke sendar was my king as well as my father she said simply he was outstanding at both tasks it cant have been easy to rule this unruly land of ours and at the same time govern an ungovernable child being father and mother to herbut he did it and did it well i will spend the rest of my life missing him wishing he could be here to seeso many things i suspect valdemar will miss his steady hands on the reins too i can only pray that i can be as wise and compassionate a ruler as he was i doubt very much if i can ever equal him as a parent and i would gladly give my own life to have our positions reversed she raised her head a little nevertheless such a sacrifice demands more than just words it demands deeds it demands that we be worthy of it it demands that we all go beyond what we think is enough making our own sacrifices in the name of a better life for all of valdemar that in the truest essence is what he did that is what i will do that is what he would expect of all of us he deserves and should have nothing less than excellence as a fitting tribute to his memory only then can we be worthy of such a great and terrible giftthe life of a king she sat down in silence and it seemed to alberich that she had surprised many of her listenersnonplussed someand actually startled others they were not sure how to react to her this was not the speech of a young woman overwhelmed with grief that they had expected to hear more music filled the silence then a final prayer and the service was over a small and very intimate party followed the coffin down into the crypt for the final interment alberich was not part of that procession nor did he wish to be he had been an integral part of a funeral that had stretched on for far too long from the border to haven andmeaning no disrespect to sendars memoryhe was weary of it and wanted only to rest believe me selenay feels the same kantor told him the weariness in his mindvoice clear as cut crystal shes going straight to bed and she told caryo that she is going to sleep for a week were already bedded down and caryo and i intend to stay here and rest i told caryo to stay as long as selenay stays asleep good he said and meant it he remained where he was only long enough to see them all emerge from the crypt see that the seneschal cut short the line of those wishing to offer condolences and watch selenay vanish through the private door at the rear of the chapel that led straight into the royal suite with talamir crathach and the seneschal in close attendance then he made good his own escape perhaps he should have stayed to listen to the court gossip and read what he could out of expressions and what was not said but but that frankly was talamirs job then he recalled what talamir had looked like and wondered if talamir was even capable of descending to such mundane and petty depths now all right i had better start to learn it but not tonight the air in the chapel had been warm and now it felt stifling too hot too heavy with the mingled scents of candle wax incense and lilies he was only too glad to get out into the night it was sultry and humid out there but not as suffocating as the chapel had been and he was unsurprised to be intercepted at the door by dethor who must have stationed himself right at the exit hed sensed the old weaponsmaster lurking somewhere about but he figured that dethor would wait until he was free before greeting him by your sunlord boy it is good to see you was all the old man said but alberich felt something inside him warm at the welcome he seized alberichs shoulders in both hands and stared into his eyes while the last few mourners filed out of the chapel door behind them i wish i could tell you just how good it is i think that i may know for as good it is to see you he replied quietly and sighed a thousand things i wish to tell you and all of them can wait a good cleanup for you and then your own bed dethor told him firmly thats why i came here to get you falling on your nose wont honor sendar or help his daughter and besides shes got all of the collegium and every herald that could get here to keep an eye on her tonight he felt compelled to protest weakly butduties i have which are in talamirs hands at least as far as selenay is concerned do him good dethor gave him a little push to send him on the path down toward the salle as for your duties as weaponsmaster the court and collegia are in a week of official mourning no council meetings unless theres an emergency no court functions no classes no lessons the only thing on anyones plate is planning the coronation and that is for the seneschal and bardic collegium not us not even selenay actually all she has to do is go through what they plan out for her for you lot this is a week of rest ah he absorbed that with reliefwhen something that dethor had said at the beginning of the explanation struck him as odd dethorweaponsmasters second i am not weaponsmaster not as of today youre not dethor said smugly with the deans approval i just retired and you are weaponsmaster ah he said it was all he could say he felt completely stunned and utterly blindsided this he had not expected glad you agree said dethor with satisfaction which is just as well since its too late for you to back out come along its a shower bath for you and then bed worry about whatever it is youre going to worry about tomorrow you might as well surrender now kantor said sleepily he still outranks you retired weaponsmaster outranks the current weaponsmaster and in fact there was a sweet relief in doing just that surrendering and letting someone else give the orders he had never thought he would be comfortable in doing thatbut he had never trusted anyone the way he now trusted these friendsthese brothershis fellow heralds as they trusted turn had trusted him with the safety and life of their queen and their own as they had trusted him to go home to karseand come out again in your hands i put myself he said and gave in gracefully to the inevitable i find it somewhat ironic selenay said a good two weeks and a bit later as alberich stood beside her on her left that one of the first things i do is ask you to keep to your shadowgrays and yet circumstances keep forcing you into whites they stood outside the doors of the great hall and from the other side came a hum of voices and a sense of expectation on her right was talamir in that same set of formal whites alberich recalled from the first moment hed actually seen the queens own now he wore a set of whites every bit as elaborate as talamirs and very uncomfortable he felt in them too it wasnt as if they were illfitting quite the contrary they fit him better than any clothing hed ever worn they should it had taken two cobblers three tailors and five fittings to ensure that they did and the wonder was it had all been done in just under a fortnight no it was that same reaction hed had to talamirs whites this was a set of clothing for a highborn courtier not a common man like him i believe at the time you were thinking a foppish highborn courtier or something of the sort kantor observed so i was i still think so and the moment all this is over i am changing out of these ridiculous garments as quickly as humanly possible he refrained from tugging at his high collar it wasnt tight he only felt as if it should be only for one day it is he replied tomorrow alberich the grim i shall again be he did not add how much it would take to induce him back into the cursed whites is that what the trainees call you talamir asked with interest talamirs health had improved vastly and continued to do so but there was still something that was otherworldly about himmore so at some times than othersas if only part of him was still here among the living and it wasnt as if he was absentminded or that his mind wandered actually he was if anything sharper than ever he noticed everything but said very little perhaps that was part of it he stood aside from life an observer rather than a participant the things that irritated and annoyed other people talamir did not even comment upon alberich wondered if there was even anything he was afraid of anymore there were times when he seemed so distant and remote that he didnt quite seem human fortunately today he was very much in the moment and the most like his old self that hed been since before the last battle oh that they call me other things among alberich replied and great stoneface or herald stoneheart he permitted himself a sardonic little smile they take me perhaps for granite talamir and selenay both blinked at him was that a joke i just heard talamir asked in utter disbelief a pun not possible he replied blandly no sense of humor have i all know this it was too late for any retort for the trumpets sounded just beyond the double doors of the great hall the doors themselves were opened from inside and selenay stepped forward followed closely by her two escorting heralds the great hall was crowded as full as it could be with every highborn and notable who had been able to get here in time for the funeral and subsequent coronation all six of selenays little tedrel pages decked out in the dark blue of the royal livery preceded her as she paced up the narrow path between the two halves of the audience in time to the music each of them had a basket of fragrant herbs which they scattered in her path with meticulous care initial rehearsals had them either dumping handfuls and running out halfway up to the dais or being so stingy with each leaf that they still had full baskets when they got there so they were taking immense care to do it right this time the looks of fierce concentration on their little faces were quite endearing all of the doors and windows were flung open to the summer day outside the hall so at least it wasnt as close in here as it could have been but the crowd glittered like the contents of an overturned jewel chest garbed in so many colors that after a fortnight of the stark blacks and whites of mourning it hurt alberichs eyes to look at them the sunshine pouring in the windows glanced off gold and jewels and the crowd glittered with every tiny movement selenay set the pace they only had to follow her she looked meditative as if she was taking a stroll in the gardens not walking up to the throne that she would officially take in a few moments alberich thought that she looked as beautiful and fragile as a snow spirit in the gown that had been made for this moment a gown of some soft silky draping stuff based on heralds whites but with winglike sleeves and a train that trailed out behind her glittering with tiny moonstones and gold beads and a chaplet of moonstones and beads in her unbound hair he would much rather that she had worn her armor truth to be told he would have preferred to see her marching up to the throne like a conquering battle maiden who would take this sweet young girl seriously as a monarch the army anyone who was with us on the battlefield perhaps those who heard her eulogy for her father but the others highborn and notables from across the land they knew only what they sawa girl a mere girl come to govern well shed better learn how to handle them it was her job to make them take her seriously with perfect timing they reached the dais just as the music ended and in a silence remarkable for a room holding so many people the three of them ascended it waiting for them there were the chief members of the council ranged in a half circle behind the thronethe seneschal the lord of the treasury the lord marshal and the chiefs of the heraldic bardic and healers circle representing all of the various and varied religions of haven was the patriarch pellion dgenrayes alberich didnt know which sect and temple he represented but he looked every inch the partwhitehaired bearded in robes of purple and white that were absolutely stiff with white embroidery and an imposing staff capped with a huge globe of amber who comes before the throne of valdemar the lord marshal thundered placing his hand on the hilt of his purely ornamental sword i selenay daughter of sendar and rightful queen of valdemar she replied in a voice as cool as mountain snow in the name of the gods i lay claim to the throne of valdemar by what tokens do you claim the throne asked the seneschal who looked nothing near as imposing as the lord marshal truth be told he looked as if he should be asking have we got the order of precedence right selenay answered the challenge as her fathers daughter should by the token of my blood of the line of valdemar first king of this land by the token of my choosing by the companion caryo by the token of my mind trained to rule this land as wisely as the first king by the token of my heart that is given to the service of the people of this land and by the token of my right hand that will wield the sword of war or the staff of peace over it as need be she held her head high and her voice remained steady and clear and who vouches for these things the lord treasurer asked i vouch for her blood of the line of valdemar for my healers saw her born of sendars consort said the chief healer it was the chief heralds turn and i that she is chosen by the companion caryo for my heralds saw her trained and granted whites i the chief bard said somehow putting far more theatrical flourish into the words than anyone else vouch for her mind for my bards have tested her training and found it complete now it was talamirs turn his voice trembled a little but only a little and alberich didnt think that anyone noticed but him i vouch for her heart for i am the queens own and her heart is open to me now tradition said that the last lines were to be spoken by the lord marshal himself but selenay had asked for alberich to take the final part who else could but you she had asked and he could not find it in him to deny her he had drummed his response into his brain until he woke to find himself reciting it in his sleep this was no time to let his karsite syntax mangle what he was going to say and i he said in a voice that sounded harsh to his own ears vouch for her hand strong in defense gentle to nurture for i am the queens champion and i have tested her will and her spirit in the fires of adversity the lord marshal nodded and stepped back then come selenay daughter of sendar come and assume your rightful place queen of valdemar selenay took the last few paces until she was within touching distance of the throne then turned and faced the gathering her pages scrambled to gather up the train of her gown and arrange it at her feet alberich moved farther to her left and took the gold wand that served as the seldomused scepter from the hands of the seneschal as talamir did the same on the right and took the crown from the seneschal selenay removed the bejeweled chaplet with her own hands and gave it to the treasurer with infinite care talamir placed the simple gold crown hardly more than an engraved circlet on her golden head and stepped back to take his place behind the throne alberich gave the scepter into her hands and looked for a moment deeply into her eyes she looked back at him fearlessly a world of question and reassurance passed between them in that look and he could not have told which of them comforted the other more but he knew then in that moment that no matter what hardships what trials came in the future she would not break under them he had seen her tested in the fires of adversity tested and tried and tempered and she had come out of it full of strength true as steel and as tough and flexible as have you kantor said a universe of love and pride coloring the words and those who dont see it havent eyes the rest are proud that you are one of us herald alberich he stepped back and took his place next to talamir and the lord marshal called out the very same words that he had used all those many days ago on the road to haven valdemarbehold your queen and the cheer that erupted from those gathered below her held nothing feigned or uncertain epilogue alberich had wanted to come to the temple of the lord of light and visit geri for nearly a moon but there had just been too much to do it wasnt just his full duties as weaponsmaster although that was a timedevouring job in and of itself when you added his continued forays into the darker streets of haven then his informal but very necessary lessons with talamir lessons detailing the intricacies of the life of the court and the highborn courtiers that made it the very hub of their existence as well as all the eddies and swirls of intrigue within it there just hadnt been enough marks in a day working with talamir had been the hardest although talamir was during these sessions the most like his former self that he ever was these days alberich walked into the lessons with a shiver and out of them with a feeling of relief and the strong sense that hed been in the naked presence of someone whod been done no favors by being brought back to life and who lived each moment longing to return to the path hed been taken from so that he could finish the journey but crathach had been right there was no one else that could serve as the queens own that selenay needed right now and talamir knew that perhaps that was why he was driving alberich so hard transferring the full weight of the job ofintelligence master for lack of a better titleonto alberichs shoulders meant there was one less thing holding talamir back from that delayed journey finally it had been the fact that he hadnt been to the temple in far too long that had decided him talamir was busy with some delegation or other paying respects to selenay and the scum of haven could stew without him for one night kantor heartily approved which eased his conscience somewhat and truth to tell it felt very good to ride down into the city without wondering which persona he should don if there was going to be any trouble that night or whether he was going to have to explain himself to the constables and city guard again he felt relaxed as he seldom did as kantor stopped inside the walls of the temples outer court and waited for him to dismount on a pleasant evening like this one he had expected the court to be full of the sunlords worshipers and indeed it was as the priests intended the court was serving its function as the neighborhood gathering place older children who had not yet gone to bed played games along one wall a number of folk were using the free lantern and torchlight to read by sitting at the benches on the opposite wall to where the children played there were little knots of gossip and courtship awkward flirtation and some friendly rivalry and even a pair of old men playing a game of castles on a portable board alberich wouldnt have been surprised to see a hot pie seller there though no doubt if one had appeared geri would have run him off there were some things that were just a shade too undignified for the forecourt of a temple none of them paid any attention to alberich he was now a fixture at the templethough he doubted that anyone knew him for the queens champion in his dark gray leathers they probably thought he was just someones private guard anyone could have a white horse after all and what would the weaponsmaster of heralds collegium be doing down here in this little neighborhood temple anyway those with karsite blood took great pride in the fact that one of their own was a herald but no one would ever dream that a herald would come here to worship the sunlord however devout he was people he was coming to think mostly saw what they expected to see and if they saw something that ran counter to their expectations they tended to rationalize it away useful that for a man in his position though he would never trust his life to that principle people were also likely to figure out the one thing you wanted to keep hidden from them at the worst possible moment the door to the temple lay open to catch the coolness of the night breezes and he simply walked in and stopped to stare for there was geri and around him was a gaggle of children one of which he recognized as the little karsite girl who had talked to him on the night of the rescue they were all wearing a version of the warm yellow tunics and trews worn by novices in the service of vkandis brand new and a bit oversized and they all acted as if they were completely at home here geri was giving them a valdemaran lesson with the flock of them tucked out of the way in the side chapel used for long vigils and private meditations alberich realized after a moment of complete blankness that this little temple had taken in all of the karsite children that had been taken by the tedrels and if the hour seemed rather late for lessons well that might be the case for anyone other than a temple of vkandisthe sunlord had rites and rituals going on from the dawn to sunset and only after darkness fell was geri going to be free to give these little ones the language class they needed before they could hope to learn anything else ill have to ask myste if she can get down here and give him a hand he thought watching them all i wonder if there are any other karsite exiles whove got the time to help geri wont push it but myste will he quickly moved back into the shadows lest he disturb them and watched and felt something extraordinary unfold inside him something so extraordinary that at first he didnt recognize it for what it was happiness pure unalloyed happiness of all of the things he had done or had a hand in doing this was the one that had brought nothing but good for all concerned with nothing whatsoever to regret or wish he had done differently the children responded to geri with all of the warmth that he would have expected geri was one of the kindest souls in the world and children liked him even when he had to discipline them for something but these children in particular were blossoming for the young priest like flowers in the sunalready he could tell a vast difference between the tooeager toohelpful anxious pinchfaced little things they had been and the brightfaced creatures they were now it was wonderful this was how karsite children should look and even as he reveled in the pleasure of knowing that he had had a key hand in making it possible for them to be here he also knew a moment of sadness at the fact that even in karse most karsite children were not this free not this happy sunlord gentle giver of light make it possible for them too a small hand tugged at his sleeve and he turned and looked down i heard you were looking for me said a very small very redhaired boy with amazing blue eyes that looked oddly old in such a young face for a moment alberich stared at him trying to work out what on earth the child could mean then it struck him you are the boy they called kantis he asked the child nodded and youre alberich the white rider the one who was promised to us right well he squatted down on his heels so that he could look the boy straight in the eye i would say that it depends on just who was doing the promising and where he got his information the child grinned at him it would be me that was doing the promising but the promise wasnt mine it was the prophecy and it all came out of the writ of course i know the writ very well he struck a pose and began to recite alcar canto seven verse nineand the children shall be reft from the people and they shall suffer in the hands of the infidel but those that keep faith shall endure and the riders of light shall redeem them porphyr canto twelve verse twentytwoand lo in the moment of despair i shall be with you i shall guide you as you were a child out of the camp of iniquity and into the hands of the saviors and great spirits of white shall succor you werthe canto fifteen verse fortynineand a rider of the purest white spirit shall alberich held up his hand to stop the flow of words i would say that you do indeed know the writ very well he admitted gravely but i am not at all certain that there is anything in those verses that i would recognize as being part of thethe prophecy he was going to add if there ever was a prophecy except that what this child had done and the hope he had given the others the way he had organized them and kept them goinghow had that been so wrong even if it had all been a childish tale concocted out of the scraps of writ he knew the tales the valdemaran children babbled and his fertile imagination it had essentially saved them but i suppose it depends on how you interpret them he finished instead and smiled i wanted to meet you primarily because i wanted to thank you for helping all of the others so much the boy looked at him unblinking but with a smile playing about his lips isnt that what were all supposed to do help each other no matter who we are and where we come from thats what the writ says in the great laws where had the child learned that not from any of the sunpriests that alberich had served absolutely right he stood up and gazed down at the child you are a very remarkable fellow and so are you alberich of karse herald of valdemar the childs voice suddenly deepened and seemed to fill his ears his mind and his world shrank to the boys young face and the voice that resonated all through him he couldnt move and he didnt want to a man of such conscience and honor is a remarkable man indeed so remarkable that it would seem that his prayers reach a little farther than most alberich could not look away from those blue eyes eyes which held an impossible golden flame in their depths he wasnt afraid though far from it he had never felt such peace before in his life a man of conscience and honorwho has found a fitting place in his exile among those who value that honor and honor the conscience the boy nodded it is written that exiles do not last forever for those who are true to their word their family and their home but remember always that the writ tells us that a mans home is where his family is herald alberich and also that friends are the family one can choose the child backed away a few paces as alberich felt his pulse hammering in his throat as if he had run a very long distance he hardly knew what to think he couldnt have actually said anything if his life had depended on speaking the boy turned and walked a few more steps away in the direction of the door then looked back over his shoulder and if you think what i am is remarkable wait some few years and you will see what my daughter can do or should i say my daughter who will be my son then he laughed and ran off a high utterly childlike laugh that broke the spell that had held alberich motionless he still couldnt think his thoughts moved as if they were flowing through thick honey buthe needed to run after that boy alberich geri called and he turned the priest had broken up the class and apparently had spotted alberich in the back of the temple i was hoping youd come to see what weve done we took all of the karsite children when the queens people came to ask if we had room for any you know we just couldnt turn them away and theyve been a delight to have here whats more they are making remarkable progress likethat boy he replied feeling his heart still racing with an emotion that held both excitement and fear nonot fear but an emotion like fear it took him a moment to recognize it as hope boy geri looked puzzled what boy the boy i was he gestured but there was no sign that there had ever been anyone there talkingto they both scanned the nowempty temple but there was no sign of any children now it must have been one of the youngsters from the courtyard geri replied looking puzzled all of the karsite children were with me are any of the children who come here in the evening named kantis he ventured not knowing whether he wanted to hear the answer but geri only shrugged i havent a clue there are so many of them and they just swarm the place in weather like this some of them arent even worshipers of the sunlord they just come to play with our children alberich licked dry lips and thought furiously it might just have been a child playing a prank it would have been natural for the karsite children to tell others about kantis and their peculiar prophecy children sometimes played the most elaborate jokes especially on adults when they thought they could get away with it although the families who worshiped here were fluent in valdemaran they all spoke karsite at home and children picked up languages easily it would have been easy for one to pick out some passages from the writ that matched that prophecy wouldnt it and who was he to be the recipient of a visitation from the sunlord himself no one if anyone should have gotten a visitation it should be geri not him andno i wont worry this to death if it was the sunlord in his aspect as child of the morning or if it wasnt it is all the same to how i should continue to act that was free will again the gift of the sunlord to choose or not choose a path he would choose the same path he always had that of honor and in either case because pearls of wisdom drop from innocent mouths i shall take the advice to heart for it comes from the writ and i shall take comfort from it for the same reason it probably was one of the youngsters from outside if you see him again make sure to get him to talk to you for he is remarkably wellspoken he said and slapped geri on the back i am dying for a decent glass of tea why dont you tell me what youve been doing with these children and give me some idea of how i can help after all wasnt that what everyone was supposed to do even an exile in a strange land exile the writand the boywere right when he had come here perhaps but among these people he had found those who understood that a man had to hold to his word and his honor people who were the truest sort of friendsand as the writ said the sort of friends who became ones family which meant that he wasnt really an exile after all it was good to be home
