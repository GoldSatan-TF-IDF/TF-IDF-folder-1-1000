yet here i was plugging across the western approaches on a flooding tide in a filthy night in seven years i had been home just once that first return had been a family duty and had turned into a family disaster i had endured as long as i could then overwhelmed by responsibilities and harried by lawyers i had sailed away it was then that i had sworn never to return to england now four years later i was going home and again it was duty which drew me back family duty it certainly wasnt homesickness for in seven years of ocean wandering i had never missed england i tried to persuade myself it was curiosity that took me north into the cold channel waters but curiosity needs the provocation of affection or hate and i felt neither for my family yet now if the message was true my family wanted my return and so dutifully perhaps guiltily i was going home the message had reached me in english harbour antigua it came from my familys lawyers who had left the message with my london bank id telexed the bank hoping some dividends had taken me out of the red but instead of money the bank had sent me news that my mother was sick and wanted to see me it was the first time in four years that my mother had noticed my existence or to be fair that i had remembered hers i didnt want to go but there was a pathetic appeal in the message and so i slipped my mooring and turned sunflowers bows to the eastern sea i didnt hurry home indeed and it might have been my fancy it seemed to me that sunflower sailed sluggishly right across the atlantic we spent a week becalmed in the horse latitudes and afterwards when we made the westerlies she developed a weatherhelm id never known in her before for the first time in her life my boat became a pig to sail and i wondered if this new stubborn waywardness was some reflection of my own reluctance to reach england somehow we made it to the azores but then a week out of horta a foul toothache erupted in the back of my upper right jaw and i was tempted to believe that this new pain like sunflowers weatherhelm was a mute protest against the voyage the toothache got worse as i endured a long beat north before the west winds drove me hard towards the english channel i sailed alone just sunflower and me sunflower was a frenchbuilt steelhulled cutter thirtyeight foot long with an angular hull that banged in a moderate sea and sounded like a demented field gun in a big one she was twenty years old that springtime and showed it the mainsail on a modern yacht has about as much cloth as a bikini bottom but sunflower had a proper mainsail with some guts in it a big bellying brute of a driversail she had a proper boom too a real skullcracking spar instead of a stubby hightech afterthought she hadnt been built with the modern refinements of inmast reefing or headsail roller reefing instead she had oldfashioned reef points that needed to be tied down by hand on a cold wet night that can be a murderous job but better to have fingers scraped raw and bloody than a mainsail jammed in its slot and threatening a capsize in a rising gale her foresails had to be dragged on to the foredeck in their stiff bags pistonhanked on to their stays then hauled into the winds face she was never a fast boat not compared to the gossamerlight multihulled speedsleds that take all the oceansailing records these days but sunflower would have sailed you to hell and back and thats all a proper seaman should ever want in a yacht it was all i ever wanted for sunflower was my home she and i had done a lot of miles wed sailed the southern ocean rounded the horn run the agulhas current smelt the african jungle anchored off indian coral and now because of a message from my familys lawyers we were pounding a western approaches sea a short grey unfriendly sea that hammered the hulls angular chines and shredded white into a stinging cold shrapnel that slashed over sunflowers gunwales to spatter me in the cockpit it was nighttime and the wind was rising it was englands homecoming wind a southwesterly but there was nothing welcoming in this malevolent cold force at dusk the wind had been force three or four by midnight it was five and rising by three in the morning id taken in the first reef and now an hour before dawn sunflower was riding a hard force seven id dropped the main and was running on a working jib alone that sounds cautious but i did not shorten sail out of fear only because i was dog tired i dared not sleep for we were near the shipping lanes and you dont take risks with the onehundredthousandton tankers that slam oblivious through the darkness id seen one such supertanker just after midnight or rather id seen the great block of her bridge beneath her steaming lights but i hadnt seen the tankers hull because the wind was shredding the wavetops into a grey devildrizzle that danced above the sea sunflower and i had been racing the whitecaps then just spits of light in the darkness and id known the tanker would be ignorant of our presence shed passed a halfmile to our south heading towards biscay the sight of the tanker had jarred me into a new alertness but the wakefulness didnt last despite the foul pain in my tooth i dozed i sat on the port side of the cockpit one knee crooked over sunflowers tiller and leaned my head against the guardrails the banging of the sea against the hull was hypnotic id sleep for a few minutes then start awake to stare in sudden uncomprehending alarm at the compass once or twice i rubbed my eyes to help my vision but mostly succeeded only in grinding dried accreted and stinging salt into my eyeballs the pain in my tooth was a throbbing agony but even that was not sufficient to keep me awake but i knew i had to stay awake sometimes i would stand to let the spray hit me hoping that its forceful discomfort would keep me alert but as soon as i sat again the sleep would insidiously steal over me i was in a halfgale in short steep seas in a small boat pitching like a demented rockinghorse sailing into the worlds most dangerous seaway with an aching tooth and stinging eyes and all i could do was sleep and hallucinate i was used to the tired hallucinations of a night sail yet familiarity did nothing to convince me of their falsehood the hallucinations are halfdreams of an uncanny reality that night i distinctly saw the loom of a lighthouse guiding me home and later a coastline if the hallucinations had been of fantastic things say of women or hot food then my mind would have dismissed them as apparitions yet that nights visions were of the things i most wanted to see signs of a safe landfall and so i saw a gentle twilit coast backed with church towers trees and cliffs and the coast even had halfobscured leading lights showing the way home one part of my brain knew that i was seeing an elaborate illusion but still i would indulge it it was only when something shattered sunflowers rhythm that the mind would sluggishly tear itself away from the comforting fantasy to accept that we were indeed slamming through a shortening sea in a halfgale with no leading lights to guide us home those were the moments of wakefulness eventually i stopped fighting the sleep somehow my wet clothes so arranged themselves that i had the illusion of comfort and to move was to bring cold wet cloth against a sore chafed skin so i stayed still i dreamed and sunflower flew upchannel to where the big ships thumped and the black rocks waited and still i did not know why i came home or what waited for me in england id fled england four years before id gone home because my brother had died and i had become the new head of the family they looked to me to solve their problems but instead i had bought sunflower victualled her then run away to sea id scraped round ushant against this very same southwesterly wind and had felt an immense liberty unfold before my bows i had gone i was safe and i was free the unwanted responsibilities and my familys spitting accusations had dropped astern like seaanchors cut adrift id never regretted that leaving id stepped on far beaches sailed into distant nights and made friends with people who knew nothing of my past to them i was merely john rossendale master under god of the good ship sunflower and a welcome mechanic carpenter welder and rigger i was anonymous i was free and now i was coming home alone i hadnt always sailed alone when id first left england seven years before charlie barratt had sailed with me we had three good years together sailing the southern oceans then when my family demanded my return charlie had gone with me we had been in australia when the news of my brothers death arrived and we had been forced to sell our boat to raise the money for the air fares we promised ourselves wed buy another yacht in england and go back to the pacific but charlie had married instead and that put paid to his dreams of far blue seas i had struggled with my brothers legacy for as long as i could then in desperation i bought sunflower and went back to sea alone i didnt sail alone for long a german girl came aboard at belize and stayed as far as the marquesas where she abandoned sunflower to join a ramshackle commune that shared a vast catamaran skippered by a moody pole id heard that the catamaran had broken up off the trobriands drowning everyone aboard but the sea lanes are full of such rumours so perhaps the german girl was still alive in the solomons id met an australian who sailed with me one whole year but she discovered who i was and wanted to marry me and when i adamantly refused she jumped ship in california there had been others the oceans are littered with hitchhikers struggling from one coast to another bartering rides on battered yachts and all believing that their freedom from bureaucracy will last for ever some of the hitchhikers drown some get murdered some disappear a lot become whores and a few a very few go home now i was going home and i didnt want to i hallucinated i slept and i dreamed of far southern seas i was woken sharply in the dawn it was not the feral grey light that woke me nor my toothache but rather because the wind had shifted abruptly to the south and sunflower went over it could only have taken a few seconds a blink of a dream no more but the tiller slipped under my knees grip and she broached for a moment she was speeding along the hissing crest of a wave then the sea smacked her over the wavetop broke and she was falling tipping slamming down on to her starboard side water poured like niagara over the port gunwale for two seconds i was standing in sudden amazement on the far thwart then i was pitched forward into the maelstrom of white water just before my head went under i saw the masttip drop into the water then i was thrashing in sudden panic until the safety line jerked me hard and fast the wave was still seething round me and breaking high over sunflowers hull that was lying flat on the sea i despaired for a moment until the inexorable laws of physics began their work and the deep heavy keel began to drag sunflower upright no law of physics would save me i would have to drag my waterlogged weight to the high gunwale and somehow climb back aboard but then a merciful and freakish backwash of water flung me against a starboard guardrail stanchion i felt a sharp blow against my ribs but all i could think of was to cling like grim death to the guardrail as the boat righted she came up sluggishly at first then tore herself free of the seas grip and i rolled up with her to haul myself unceremoniously over the rails into the swamped cockpit that was the seas alarm call good morning and welcome to the channel i crouched in the swirling cockpit and gasped for breath the pain in my ribs stabbed at me but there was no time to worry if anything was broken the jib was flogging and another steep sea was charging at our beam i rammed the tiller hard to port and dragged the jib sheet in to catch the wind sunflower sluggishly turned her quarter to the waves water was still streaming off the foredeck and coachroof cascading green and grey into the whiteflecked heaving sea the drains were emptying the cockpit i doubted any water had got into the boat sunflowers washboards are of one inch teak and like the companionway hatch i keep them bolted shut in dirty weather i had been lucky the knockdown had been my own fault but thanks to the safety line i was alive i gingerly felt my ribs and though the pain was sharp nothing seemed to be broken i was soaked through after my ducking but sunflower was moving again in the broken seas i lashed the tiller then stripped myself stark shivering naked it was springtime but the channel air still had a cutting edge and the sea was as cold as an opened grave i unlocked the companionway waited until sunflower had been overtaken by a hissing sea then clambered over the washboards to drop into the cabin i had very few dry clothes left but i found two pairs of jeans one pair of socks and three sweaters i pulled them all on they felt warm but i knew they were full of dry salt crystals which exposed to even the smallest dampness would attract the moisture and swell to make me chill and damp again i scrubbed my hair half dry with a mildewed towel then wedged myself into the galley and slid the thermos out of its padded clips i poured a big mug of tea and though sunflower was pitching and corkscrewing i didnt spill a drop of the precious hot liquid practice in such small things makes for perfection a tanker could have turned me into scrap steel in the time it took to drink the tea but i needed something warm inside and i was craving for a pipeful of dry tobacco those creature comforts gained i went back to the cockpit and disentangled my oilskins from the wet mess on the bottom grating i grimaced knowing that the water inside the oilies would soak my new dry clothes but there was no choice i kitted up pulled on drenched boots then hauled up the mainsail that had three reefs already tied to the boom sunflower liked the extra canvas and became steadier we were on a beam reach and my boat was sailing the gales wrath like a dream i was wide awake now my hallucinations had vanished with the dawn and i was going home but why and to what i did not know i should have sought shelter in falmouth or at any of the cornish ports but i had a sudden reluctance to exchange my damp clothes for a landfall the wind still in the south was gusting towards gale force and flensing the wavetops into a stinging white mist that obscured the grey sea the waves were thundering from the southwest but being crossed by the new wind that filled their troughs with confusion sunflower did not mind she was a tough beast and had taken far worse she had a steel hull and over the years id doubled the strength of all her rigging shed ridden the edge of a typhoon once and all that had been broken was some crockery in her galley now in a filthy new day she sailed upchannel the daylight was grey churned with spray and cold i was curbing sunflower not wanting a following sea to poop her but though she was pitching hard she was in no danger all that could have killed her now was a bigger ship or my own carelessness my first sight of home was a glimpse of the eddystone lighthouse it was then i turned for salcombe i suppose id always known i was going to salcombe because charlie lived there charlie and i had grown up together chased our first girls together got drunk together were arrested together then sailed the far seas together whatever else waited for me in england charlie was there and his friendship alone made this voyage home worth its while so in the hard dawn wind i turned for charlies home port salcombe on a chart salcombe seems like one of the most sheltered havens of englands south coast and so it is if youre safe inside its steepsided web of flooded river valleys many a yacht has waited out channel storms in salcombe and the very harrowing of hell would find it hard to disturb the innermost lakes but in an onshore wind against a falling tide the entrance to salcombe is a deathtrap salcombe means safety but reaching that safety in a southern gale is suicidal folly a bar lies athwart the harbour entrance like a hidden barricade the winddriven waves are toppled by the sudden ridge on the sea bottom to make a churning turmoil of breaking seas that crash white and are made even steeper and more dangerous when an ebbing tide tries to challenge them only a fool chooses salcombe in a southern gale dartmouth which can be entered in any weather is just a short distance to the east and plymouth even safer than dartmouth is not so far to the west torbay the classic shelter in a southern or westerly gale is an easy sail upchannel but i chose salcombe perhaps i thought if i was not meant to be coming home then the bar at the estuarys mouth would tell me i would tempt the devil and if i lost sunflower and i would die on the bar rolled and swamped and broken up within the very smell of home that reasoning was the stupid bravado of tiredness made worse by a lethal mix of selfpity and arrogance the selfpity came from my reluctance to see my family again the arrogance from a determination to show off my seamanship as i came home sunflowers boom was hard out on the port side as we ran towards bolt head we were crossing the seas now sliding diagonally over their eastwards flow one moment we would be on the crest of a wave triumphant and flying then we would plunge deeper and deeper into the watery darkness and i would see the next wave threatening astern its top sleeked and whipping with the winds force the glassy dark heart of death would rear up sunflowers port quarter and just as i thought she would never rise again so we would be heaved up to the next crest from where i would stare ahead for a sight of land the tiredness was gone i did not even care that i was cold and wet now i was elated by the thrill of daring a sea to do its worst yet the galedriven sea was not our enemy our enemy was the steep rise of the bar silent and hidden beneath salcombes entrance charlie and i had once watched a yacht crash down into a wave trough on salcombes bar the boat had come up again but in the trough her keel had struck bottom and the compression of the blow had smashed every bulkhead inside her hull and fractured the skull of a man sitting at her chart table even a lifeboat had been lost on salcombes bar and lifeboats make sunflower look fragile scores of widows cursed salcombes bar and now we were racing towards it driven by a southern gale and madness there was a moment early in the afternoon when i knew i could turn east and still make prawle point to reach dartmouth in safety for a second i hesitated tempted by sanity then the greater temptation of tweaking the devils tail took over i was a rossendale the last of the line and i would come home with all the savage flair of that unpleasant familys blood bolt head came up like a grey threat on the port bow the land was blurred and soaking the wind had a noise like an eldritch death shriek and the sea was harrying me on to the lee shore the waves were huge steep and made tumultuous by the lands proximity at the top of each breaking crest i stared forward and i knew what i would see and when i saw it the fear came i saw whiteness its one thing to imagine a danger but quite another to see its true malevolence and to realise that the imagination does not have sufficient horror to match reality the bar was frantic with shattering seas i had a glimpse of breaking wavetops spuming a mist of white and beneath that mist the weight of water would be a churning maelstrom men ashore would have seen my sails by now they would be knowledgeable men and they would damn me for a fool and pray that my boat lived despite my foolishness doubtless the inshore lifeboat would already have been called but only to pluck my corpse from the incoming waves i kept to the western side of the entrance the waters deeper there though the bass rock is waiting just in case the bar fails to kill i saw an explosion of white spew up as a wave broke into fragments on the little mew stone then sunflower dipped her bows as a wave lifted her stern but this time instead of riding up over the waves crest the great steel hull began to plane on the tons of rolling water now we were no different to the surfers of the pacific we were no longer a boat but a scrap of material being carried aloft on a waves violence to where the bar made a white turmoil of the sea we were also just where i wanted to be hard under the western cliffs i was braced in the cockpit with the tiller between my thighs and with both hands on the mainsheet for i knew what was about to happen sunflowers hardreefed mainsail was still out to port at any second the wind would bounce and curl off the cliffs and she would gybe i should have furled the main and let the small jib and the big sea take us in but to furl the main would have been to show cowardice let the bar do its worst id chosen to play the seas game and i wouldnt give in the leech of the mainsail shivered it wasnt much just a tiny flicker of the heavy grey material but it was the sign i had been waiting for and before the cliffturned wind could dismast me i hauled the sheet in with both hands i braced the tiller hard knowing how sunflower would be knocked to port when the gybe came it came unless youre pointing dead into the wind and happy to go nowhere the sails of a boat are always stretched either to port or starboard there are two ways to bring them across from one side to the other one to tack is to turn the boat into the wind so that the wind slides decorously across the bows and the sails like flags streaming from flagpoles obediently change their direction the other way to gybe is to turn the boat in front of the wind then its as if the wind has sneaked fast round the flagpole and the flag is crushed up against the pole before it smacks out in its new flight gybing is dangerous and violent instead of a flag i was letting a gale rip round behind a heavy sail that was lashed to a skullcrushing wooden boom the weight of all that gear hammering across the winds eye could easily tear my shrouds free of their chainplates and pluck the mast clean out at its root except that i had just enough of the mainsheet gathered in to act as a spring and as the great sail and boom slammed across i used the sheet to soak its force and tame its threat i skinned my right palm bloody doing it but it was a proper job thats what charlie would have called it a proper job was charlies biggest approbation he offered it rarely and only to practical achievements like a wellscarfed piece of wood or a neatly welded seam or for a maniacal gybe off the bar at salcombe not that i had time to admire my own manoeuvre we had survived the gybe but as soon as the sail settled i felt sunflowers bows drop and i knew the bar was straight beneath the boats stem i whooped a crazy challenge i was staring down into the trough where mud and sand discoloured the water scummy strings of foam whipped across that dull patch i was running into the killing trough and for a few seconds the howl of the wind was muted by the towering wave behind me i could only hear the seething of the water this sea had perhaps a hundred yards left in which to kill me no more but they were the worst hundred yards if i broached now then nothing would save me because sunflower would be turned over her mast would snap and the sea would pounce on us to tear man and hull into dented steel and bloody scraps i was holding the tiller with both hands muscles rigid as the crest behind shattered to cascade like spilt ice down the waves dark face christ i thought but why had i done this the jib was flogging shielded by the main we were veering to port i dragged her back the wave that was carrying us collapsed its underpinning sheared off by the rising bar and sunflower was suddenly nothing but a scrap of steel in the heart of a broken tidal wave water bounced halfway up her mast a new wave reared behind and sunflowers keel began to drop crashing down through an incoherent sea towards the hidden land that could fracture her steel hull as though it was an egg down we went and still down and behind me the new wave curled at its top and i saw the glassy black beneath the fractured white and still we dropped and i saw that i would be crushed between the bar and the following wave but then sunflower good sunflower began to rise she fought her death inch by damned inch the peak of the reefed sail was drawing forcing her on she had way on her still and she was cutting her steel through the water she would not give up but still that toppling wave threatened to poop us and i knew it could kill with a blow as easily as it could drown us the wave broke the dark black glossy heart of the wave was blown apart as if by dynamite it turned white as it tumbled and as it broke into a million fragments it fell and it would have killed me except that it fell a foot behind sunflowers transom and the force of the seas fall was bounced up from the bar to lift and drive her on on across the bars broken water on past the wolf rock and the bass rock and then just short of the poundstone i gybed her again and i knew i was showing off to the people who were standing ashore to watch my death i was proving that i had mastered one thing and in demonstration of that mastery i had come home in style so i gybed sunflower again turned her and suddenly we were sailing into calmer waters as limebury point stole the winds brute force i looked back the bar was a mass of churning white as bad as id ever seen it but sunflower had come through and i in a proper job had come home charlie wasnt at home his wife who had grudgingly taken my reversecharge call said he was in hertfordshire on business i could tell she was not pleased that i had returned she believed i was a rakehell who might yet take her husband back to the sea when will he be back yvonne i asked i dont know her voice was guarded somewhere in the background a child whined tell him i called and tell him im moored in salcombe yvonne promised she would pass on the news though i doubted if she would be in any hurry i wondered why it was that charlie my best closest and oldest friend should marry someone who so disliked me i said goodbye then ignoring the impatient people who waited to use the public phone i tried to reverse the charges to my mothers house there was no answer so i had the operator call my twin sister in gloucestershire elizabeth was not at home either but her husband grudgingly agreed to accept the charges he had once been a friend of mine but he had chosen his wifes side in our family battle do you think were made of money was his greeting i didnt bother to explain that id only just landed in england and had no small change other than american antiguan and portuguese coins is elizabeth there i asked instead no shes not he sounded drunk i tried to reach mother shes in hospital i waited to see if hed offer more information he didnt which hospital i asked south devon general they took her in last week shes in a private ward which were paying for the inference was that i should help with the cost but i ignored the hint whats the ward called i asked instead the edith cavell ward its on the third floor do you know what the visiting hours are i am not an information service for the national health service he said irritably then relenting you can go any time they dont seem to mind bloody silly i call it if i was running a hospital i wouldnt want visitors traipsing about at all hours of the day or night but i suppose they know their own business perhaps ill see elizabeth there i dont know where she is there was a long pause as though he was about to add some comment but then without another word he put down the receiver there was no one else to telephone i knew i couldnt reach my younger sister who was the only person beside charlie who might be glad to hear i had come home so instead i rowed myself back to sunflower and dug out a tin of baked beans which i mashed with a can of stew and heated over the galley stove the pain in my tooth had miraculously subsided which was a blessing as id run out of both aspirins and irish whiskey it had begun to rain hard the water drummed on sunflowers coachroof and gurgled down her scuppers the wind howled above the moorings to slap halliards against noisy masts i spooned down my meal and thought how i might even now be six seas away and running free but had come home instead the toothache had entirely disappeared by morning for the first time in weeks i woke up without pain except for the bruise on my ribs where id been thrown against the stanchion but that kind of pain was an occupational hazard and therefore to be ignored yet the tooth astonishingly felt fine i bit down hard on it and did not even feel a twinge the spontaneous cure and a good nights sleep combined to fill me with optimism the bus journey soon dissipated that happy mood it wasnt the devon countryside which though damp looked soft and welcoming rather it was my fellow passengers the bus was filled with young mothers and their squalling children the sound of screaming babies is blessedly absent at sea and suddenly exposed to it i felt as if i was listening to nails scratching on slate i stared through a misted window at the cars slopping through puddles and wondered how charlie endured being a father the bus dropped me a mile from the hospital i could have waited for another bus which would have taken me up the hill but the thought of more screaming infants persuaded me to walk i was wearing my heavy oilskin jacket so only my jeans got soaked with rain the oily was smeared with grease and dirt but it was the only coat or jacket i possessed so it had to serve as formal wear i climbed through the pelting rain and cut across the hospitals waterlogged lawns the big entrance hall was loud with more squalling children i ignored the lifts climbed three flights of stairs and wondered just why i had sailed for six weeks across three and a half thousand nautical miles i had been half expecting and half dreading that my sister elizabeth would be visiting the hospital she was not except for the patients the edith cavell ward was empty on the wall opposite the wards two beds a silent television was showing a frenetic childrens cartoon an elderly woman lay in the nearest bed with a pair of earphones over her grey hair she eyed my sodden jeans and sneakers with distaste and her face betrayed relief that i had not come to visit her shes asleep she said reprovingly at the same time jerking her head towards the second bed which was still surrounded by drawn curtains i crossed the rubbertiled floor and gently pulled back the pale curtains my mother was sleeping at first i did not recognise her in the last four years her gold hair had turned a dirty grey even in sleep she looked exhausted she lay wan and emaciated with her grey hair straggling untidily from her pale forehead she had always been a woman of great pride foully excessive pride but now she was reduced to this drawn creature her great beauty was gone vanished like a dream her breath rasped in her throat every heave of her lungs was an effort once she had worn a kings ransom of diamonds but now she struggled for life she was only fiftynine but looked at least a decade older she had a bad night the greyhaired woman volunteered i said nothing the woman took off her earphones she wont have the oxygen tent you see stupid i call it ive told her i have i told her she should listen to the doctors but she wont take a blind bit of notice she says shes got to smoke smoke thats whats killing her but she wont listen she says she cant smoke if shes in an oxygen tent stupid i call it i dropped the curtain behind me which had the happy effect of shutting the woman up the sound of my mothers breathing was horrid a cylinder of oxygen stood by her bed a packet of cigarettes and her gold lighter lay close to an oxygen mask i picked up the mask and heard the hiss of escaping gas i turned off the tap then lay the mask back on the thin blanket i had moved very gently but something must have disturbed my mother for her eyes opened and she stared up at me at first there was no recognition in her face the sun had bleached my pale hair almost white and turned my face the colour of old varnish but then with a palpable start realisation came to her eyes i was her living son and i had come home hello mother i said she said nothing instead she groped for her cigarettes but before she could find them a dreadful cough convulsed her body it was a foul grating and harsh cough as rough as broken glass being crushed by stone it came from deep in her chest and it would not stop i turned on the oxygen and put the mask over her face somehow she fought the cough to draw a desperate breath and as if she was fearful that i would take the mask away she clamped her right hand over mine her crooked thin fingers were like claws it was the first time she had touched me in fourteen years i had been twenty that last time and she had briefly embraced me beside the grave into which my father was being lowered since then we had never touched not till now as she fought for life she put her hand on mine and gripped so tight that it felt like a scaly birds claw clinging to refuge her eyes were closed again her palm was warm on the back of my hand her fingers were contracting and her nails were digging into my skin then very slowly her breathing became easier i could feel the relief course through her body as her grip relaxed she had left two flecks of blood where her nails had driven into my fingers she opened her eyes and stared at me then almost irritably she twitched her hand as if to say that i should take the mask away slowly not certain if that was what she really wanted i lifted the oxygen mask away the paroxysm of coughing had left flecks of blood on my mothers lips while the plump rubber mask had printed a red mark on her white cheeks her eyes against her skins chalky paleness seemed very dark and glinting as she stared up at me hello mother i said again she tried to say something in reply but the effort threatened to turn into another racking cough its all right i said soothingly you dont have to speak i moved the oxygen mask towards her mouth but she shook her head then closed her eyes as though she was concentrating on preventing another coughing fit it took an immense effort of will but she succeeded and instead of coughing again she opened her eyes and looked straight up into my face you bastard she said then she began to cough again and no amount of oxygen could help this time and though i pressed the emergency call button and though nurses and doctors thrust me aside to bring her relief there was nothing anyone could do within twenty minutes of my arrival at her bedside my mother was dead when it was all over a young doctor joined me in the corridor he wanted to know if i was a relative and though i said i was i did not say i was the dead womans son im just a distant relation i said instead she smoked too much the doctor said hopelessly i know i guiltily fingered the pipe in my oilskin pocket i kept meaning to give up smoking id succeeded once but only because id run out of tobacco a thousand miles out of auckland after three weeks id been experimenting with sundried seaweed which tasted foul but was better than abstinence i dragged my attention back to the doctor she was very keen to see her son the doctor peered dubiously at my gaudy oilskin jacket hes supposed to be at sea isnt he i think so i said unhelpfully the doctor looked like a man whod just sailed through a force twelve storm but he was gallantly fighting the weariness in an effort to be kind she received the last rites yesterday he told me and it seemed to calm her im sure it did the doctor stifled a yawn would you like to meet the hospital chaplain sometimes after a death it can be helpful i wasnt that close a relative i said defensively so i suppose we should telephone the eldest daughter about the arrangements that would be best i said much the best two men pushed a trolley into the ward i didnt want to see the shrouded body wheeled away so i walked back to the devon rain youre supposed to feel something i thought youre not supposed to see your mother die and feel nothing at the very least youre supposed to weep my god but a mothers flawed love and a sons reluctant duty should add up to one miserable tear but i could find no appropriate response i could feel neither joy nor sorrow nor surprise nor anything all i felt was an irritation for a wasted trip and an aggravation that i was forced to wait two hours in the rain for a bus back to salcombe once back at the harbour i phoned charlies house but there was no answer so i rowed myself out to sunflower and spliced a new ropetail on to the staysails wire halliard id come home and id felt nothing not even a tear five days later at ten oclock in the morning the family assembled at stowey stowey was the family home pevsner in one of his books called it perhaps the finest late mediaeval dwelling house in england which really meant that the family had been too poor to trick it out with eighteenthcentury gallimaufry or nineteenthcentury gingerbread yet in all truth stowey is pretty its a low stone building just two storeys high with a battlemented tower at the east end halfway through building the house there came the happy realisation that devon was at peace so the western wing was left unfortified instead it was given cosy mullioned windows which now look out on gardens that bring hundreds of visitors each summer weekend today stowey is a country house hotel but it was part of the sale agreement that my mothers funeral party could gather in the old state rooms and that the funeral service could be held in stoweys chapel the chapel was no longer consecrated but the hotel had kept it unchanged and the local priest was happy to indulge my mothers wish she was to be buried in the familys vault beneath the chapel perhaps the last of the family to be so interred for i could not imagine the hotels owners wanting any more such macabre ceremonies indeed they only endured this funeral because they had no legal alternative but i noted the distaste with which they received the scattered and decaying remnants of the rossendale family that family received me with an equal distaste im surprised to see you here john one of my least decrepit uncles said why well you know no i dont i challenged him he backed down muttering something about the weather being dreadful and how it always seemed to rain when a rossendale was buried it rained on frederick he said and on poor michael frederick had been my father michael my elder brother he was always poor michael to the family hed blown his brains out with two barrels of number six shot and the rossendales had been lumbered with me instead my brother michael had been a dull worried man hiding his chronic indecisions behind a badtempered mask but ever since his death he had been something of a hero to the family perhaps because they preferred him to me if only michael had lived they seemed to be saying with their reproachful glances none of this unhappiness would have happened one member of the family was glad to see me that was my younger sister who smiled with innocent joy as i walked towards her chair johnny she held both hands towards me in delighted greeting johnny hello my darling i held georginas hands and bent to kiss her cheeks she smiled happily into my face this had to be one of her good days for she had recognised me she had a young plump nun with her one of the nursing sisters who looked after her in a private catholic hospital in the channel islands how is she i asked the nun were all very proud of her the sister said which might simply have meant that my younger sister was at last toilet trained and sister felicity i asked sister felicity was georginas usual companion shes not well the nun said in a soft irish voice shed have liked to have come today so she would but shes not a well woman were all praying for her sister felicity is going to heaven soon georgina said happily she is twentysix and has the mind of a backward twoyearold no one knows why charlie put it best when he simply said that god left out the yeast when he made georginas loaf shes beautiful with an innocent face as heartbreaking as an angels and a head as nutty as a squirrels larder sister felicitys not going to die i said but georgina had already forgotten the comment i like it here she was still holding my hands you look well i told her i want to live here again johnny with you georgina said with a touching and hopeless appeal i wish you could my darling but youre happy at the convent arent you the convent hospital specialised in the care of the mentally subnormal before my fathers death and the subsequent collapse of the rossendale estates a trust had been established which would provide for the rest of georginas life it was ironic to think that the only family member who did not have money problems was the mad one i like it here georgina said again with a cruel lucidity with you for the first time since my mother had died tears threatened me we were a rotten family but georgina and i had always been close when she was a little child i used to make her laugh and i sometimes thought that it would only take a small miracle to jar the sense out of the place where it was locked so deep inside her head that miracle had never happened instead my mother had found georginas presence oppressive and so my younger sister had been put safely away out of sight and out of mind in her convent home i crouched in front of her chair are you unhappy i asked she did not answer the bubble of sense had burst and now she just stared vacantly into my eyes i doubted she even knew why she had been brought back to stowey people are very kind she said dully then looked up as someone came to stand beside me it was my other sister my twin elizabeth but there was no recognition in georginas eyes elizabeth did not acknowledge georginas presence like my mother she had always been offended by having a mental defective in the family whatever she ignored georgina and waited for me to disengage my hands gently and stand upright elizabeth carried a glass of the hotels sherry her husband peter once my sailing companion but now a failing cotswold landowner glowered at me across the room i was the ghost at the funeral feast they all blamed me for losing the familys money and for bringing the disgrace of poverty on a lineage that had owned this patch of england since the first rossendale had taken it with his bloodyedged sword that man had come to devon in the twelfth century while now his twentiethcentury descendants shuffled with embarrassment in an hotels drawing room all except for elizabeth who had a superb if rancorous poise she drew me away from georginas chair i dont know why shes here elizabeth said irritably why shouldnt she be she doesnt know whats going on elizabeth sipped her sherry then gave me a long disapproving examination i dont know why youre here either a vestige of filial duty i said a little too lightly you look disgustingly healthy her words were grudging it was an effort to be polite to pretend that we were not bitter enemies sun and sea i was glib you look well yourself are you still riding of course elizabeth had very nearly made britains olympic team as a horsewoman perhaps if that success had come to her she would have been less bitter with life since a flurry at the door announced the arrival of father maltravers from london father maltravers had been mothers favourite confessor and would now bury her the sight of the priest made elizabeth drop her small pretence of politeness will you be taking mass she challenged me i dont think so mother would have liked it if you did she paused to look into my eyes as if she expected to read some message there elizabeth is very tall just two inches beneath my own six feet she has our familys bright gold hair and more than her fair share of the rossendale good looks of course she went on with a very poisoned indirectness youll have to make your confession first have you made confession in the last four years john have you i countered feebly the rossendales are one of the ancient catholic families wed been persecuted by the tudor fanatics but had tenaciously clung to our land and put the five oyster shells beside stoweys front door that was the source of the line in the nursery song five for the symbols at your door the five marks being a sign that the old religion was practised inside and that a priest could therefore be found to say mass today the hotel delights in showing its guests a priest hole where the illicit clergymen had hidden from elizabeth is searchers the hotels priest hole was in what had been my fathers bedroom and the guests were told that a jesuit had starved to death in the hole in the s but that was a nonsense the real priest hole was in stoweys stables because a rossendale would never have let a priest into the private rooms the socalled priest hole was actually the low cupboard in which my grandfather had kept his riding boots but the invention keeps the tourists happy did you see mother before she died elizabeth now asked yes and she prompted me i shrugged and decided the truth of mothers last words had better stay my secret she wasnt in a fit state to talk elizabeth paused evidently suspecting an evasion but you know why she wanted to see you she asked after a few seconds i can guess elizabeth did not pursue the topic i noticed how the other family members kept deliberately clear of us as though making an arena for a fight they must have guessed that elizabeth would tackle me and consequently there was a sense of expectancy in the panelled room they pretended to ignore us fussing around father maltravers but i knew they were all keenly alert to my confrontation with elizabeth have you seen mothers will the question like her earlier questions was yet another probing attack no theres nothing in it for you i didnt expect anything i spoke gently because i could sense the danger in elizabeths mood she had the rossendale temper i had it too but i think the sea had taught me to control mine yet now in elizabeths bright eyes i could see the anger brimming she left you nothing because you betrayed her my sisters voice was loud enough to make the nearest relatives turn to watch us all but georgina who was solemnly counting her fingers she hated you elizabeth went on which is why she left me the painting the statement showed that elizabeth had been unable to resist a fullscale assault good i said carelessly which only annoyed her more so where is it she asked with a savage bitterness were twins born eight minutes apart and we hate each other i cant explain that charlie often said we were too much alike as if that was the answer but i cant find the venom in my own soul to explain elizabeths obsessive dislike of me nor do i think we are so much alike i lack elizabeths driving ambition it was an astonishing ambition so nakedly obvious as to be almost pitiful she craved after a status in life which would reflect the past glories of our family she wanted wealth admiration and success yet like me she had a knack of failure i had accepted my lack of ambition turning it into a wanderers life at sea while elizabeth just grew more bitter with every twist of malevolent fate she had married well and the marriage had soured she had been born wealthy and now she was poor and that failure seemed to hurt her most of all wheres the painting she asked me again and this time so loudly that everyone else in the room even the uncomprehending georgina turned to watch us elizabeths husband leaning against the far wall seemed to sneer at me father maltravers took a step forward as though tempted to be a peacemaker but the intensity in elizabeths voice checked him wheres the painting she asked me again ill tell you once more i said and for the very last time i do not know youre a liar john youre a snivelling little liar you always were elizabeths anger had snapped torn from its mooring by my presence she would be hating herself for thus losing her temper in public but she was quite unable to control it my silence in the face of her attack only made her anger more fierce i know youre lying john i have proof i still kept silent so did the rest of the family i doubt if any of them had expected to see me at the funeral and when they did they had doubtless half feared and half relished that this skeleton from the familys crowded bone cupboard would make its ghoulish appearance now it had and none of them wanted to stop its display elizabeth sensing their support and my discomfiture attacked once more youd better run away again john before the police discover youre back youre hysterical my anger was like a gnawing bitch in my belly but i was determined not to show it yet try as i might i could not keep its venom from my voice why dont you go and lie down or take a pill damn you she twitched her wrist and the sticky sherry splashed up on to my face and on to the cheap black suit id bought in honour of the occasion damn you she said again damn you damn you damn you sherry dripped from my chin on to my black tie none of the relatives moved they all agreed with elizabeth they thought i was the bastard who had made them poor if it wasnt for me then stowey would still be in the family the port would flow at christmas and there would be no importunate bank managers and no genteel shame of an old family driven into penury i had not played their game i wasnt one of them and so they all hated me so i didnt stay for the funeral i glanced at georgina but she was in a world of her own father maltravers tried to detain me but i brushed him aside and walked out leaving the family in an embittered silence i washed the sherry from my face in the hotels loo collected my filthy oilskin jacket from its peg then walked through the devon rain to the village street i dialled charlies number on the public phone outside the rossendale arms but there was no reply i threw my sticky black tie into the gutter then lit a pipe as i waited for the bus the tooth suddenly began to ache again i explored the pain with my tongue wondering whether it truly was psychosomatic but decided that no such sharp agony could be purely mental not even if it was provoked by a lacerating homecoming damn the family id come home and they did not want me above the thatched roofs of the village the green pastures curled up to the thick woods where as a child id learned the skills of stalking and killing charlie had taught me those skills hed grown up in one of my familys tied cottages but we had still become friends we had become the best of friends my mother of course had hated charlie she had called him a piece of village muck a dirty little boy from an infamous family but he had still become my best friend he was still my closest friend four years away had not changed that i wanted to see him but i wouldnt wait for him i wanted to be back at sea riding the long winds in sunflower my family would accuse me of running away again and in a sense they were right but i wasnt running from fear just from them my family and all because of a bloody painting it was a good painting a very good painting so good that it could have saved the family fortune my fathers death had been a financial disaster to the family but my mother with a singleminded fury had fought to save stowey and its estates her legal battles had been waged for ten years and at the end she had won her campaign and the key to it was the painting the house had once been filled with fine pictures the national gallery in washington dc has a slew of our gainsboroughs and reynoldses while a gallery in california has the pick of our dutch interiors and the two good constables that londons national gallery had been desperate to acquire but too poor to pay for one by one the walls of stowey had been stripped to pay gambling debts or death duties but on my fathers death there had been nothing of any value left or hardly anything of value there was a canvas which my mother swore was a stubbs but which sothebys could not bring to auction as such there was a poussin which probably wasnt but if it was then the old master had been having a bad day there was a constable drawing which was undoubtedly genuine but a constable drawing doesnt pay the revenue the only recourse was to sell stowey and its lands but that was something my mother would not contemplate stowey had been in our family since the twelfth century but there was one undoubted treasure an odd treasure for a house like stowey and a treasure which strictly speaking did not belong to the family but rather to my mother it was a van gogh the painting should have looked all wrong in the old house as out of place as a drunken punk ensconced in a library yet somehow it seemed perfect it was a glorious superb demented canvas one of the early sunflower paintings it showed eight blossoms topping a halfglazed jar an explosion of yellow paint touched by blue with poor vincents childlike signature painted on the vase itself on a summers day when the sun blazoned stoweys mediaeval gardens with light the painting seemed like a fragment of that brightness trapped and caught inside the house the painting had been brought to the family by my mother she had been left it by her father she had hung the van gogh on the linenfold panelling of her bedroom at stowey my mother refused to lend the picture to any exhibition though once in a while an art historian or a reputable painter would seek permission to visit stowey and i remember the awe with which they gazed at the lovely canvas it was well protected my mothers bedroom had been in stoweys crenellated east tower built for defence and the mediaeval bastion had been supplemented with the most sophisticated alarms no one had even tried to penetrate those defences until the end that end came ten years after my fathers death my mother had fought every month of those years she had cursed and kicked and clawed at the taxmen she had challenged their assessments and fobbed them off with small payments torn from the sale of our outlying pastures she had fought a good fight but then my brother had gone into the gun room and ripped her fight to shreds my brothers suicide gave the taxmen a new carcass of juicy death duties to chew my mother recognising the inevitable knew that either stowey or the van gogh had to go stowey won she agreed a price of four million pounds for the van gogh but on the very day before it should have left the house it was stolen it transpired that my brother had let the insurance lapse one month before his death the police were certain that only a person with intimate knowledge of the alarms could have penetrated to the gun room where the crated painting had been waiting for the security van the police were also certain that i was that person i had put the painting in the gun room to await collection i had the key to the room and to the alarm systems only i was supposed to know where the painting was my fingerprints were on the doors lockplates on the day after the painting was stolen i sailed across the channel in a friends boat presumably carrying my loot away the evidence was all circumstantial and utterly damning i was never charged because my guilt could not be proved but the whole family was nevertheless certain that i was guilty i had done it they said to spite my mother and because i didnt want to give the taxmen their ton of flesh my relatives said i was a rogue that id always been a rogue and that now id broken the rossendale family with my selfish greed the painting was never found my mothers fight and four million pounds was lost yet the taxmen and the lawyers still had to be paid and so stowey was sold and now caters to wellheeled tourists who gape at a boot cupboard in the belief that a priest starved to death inside my mother moved into an old rectory on the edge of the moor and there she slowly died the family had made me an outcast and i had fled to sea in a yacht called sunflower there wasnt much i had to do in salcombe because i didnt plan on a full provisioning in england i would fill up with fresh water put diesel in the tanks and spare cans and stock enough food to reach vigo or lisbon i wanted an estimate for a new trysail but even if i could afford it i would not wait for delivery but rather have charlie send the sail to tenerife there were a slew of small problems one of the winches had worn gearing a bow fairlead needed replacing and sunflowers bottom was filthy with weed and barnacles i planned to strand her at low tide on the mud of one of salcombes lakes then spend a filthy time scraping her clean before giving her a new coat of antifouling she needed a good cleaning inside and out and my clothes needed a rinse in fresh water i would have liked to have found a fibreglass dinghy to replace the inflatable which in turn had replaced a rigid dinghy that had been stolen in antigua but that could wait i wanted a small outboard so i didnt have to row the tender the folding bicycle needed brake pads i needed grease for the sterngland there were a couple of rust spots inside the hull which needed quick attention and there was the bloody tooth which was now flaring up again with all its old intensity at first i ignored the tooth on the principle that a pain ignored will go away it didnt instead it got worse so three days after the funeral i rowed ashore and telephoned dentists until i found one who could see me straightaway that meant another bus ride only to be lectured by a pompous little twerp who told me i didnt brush my gums properly he said id need to make a series of visits while he first drained the abscess then scraped out the root canal to save the tooth i dont want it saved i said irritably just take the damned thing out but it can be saved mr rossendale take it out i insisted teeth are a human design fault like appendixes and all design faults are lifethreatening at sea this tooth wasnt one of my front ones so the lack of it wouldnt make me ugly besides it would be far cheaper for me to have the tooth drawn in england than giving me trouble across the atlantic where you need to take out a mortgage before you dare see a dentist the pompous little twerp was unhappy but finally did what i demanded grunting and heaving with his pliers the novocaine must have been from a weak batch because the extraction hurt like hell but that was better than drawing the tooth myself a thousand miles to sea a friend of mine did that once it took him half a day and the best part of a bottle of scotch and when it was done he found hed pulled the wrong one i consoled my pain with a large whiskey in the pub then went down to the town pontoon where id left sunflowers inflatable no one had stolen her perhaps because id pasted a score of false repair patches on her faded black skin so that she looked as though she was ready to give her last gasp and sink her oars were underwater weighted with a length of chain and tethered by a tatty piece of fraying rope i retrieved them then rowed myself slowly out through the murk it was still raining grey clouds were scurrying low over goodshelter then depositing a misty and obscuring rain on the moorings a crabber engine choked into life but otherwise the estuary seemed as empty as winter i planned to motor sunflower up to the drying mud of callapit creek i would spend a few days scrubbing her hull then go back to sea i made a mental list of things i needed to buy galvanised shackles valve springs welding rods an angle grinder fuses my face felt swollen numb and tender i stopped rowing and turned to see if i was aiming the unwieldy dinghy in the right direction i was a quartermile from sunflower and way off course blown there by the wind which was carrying the dinghy too far to the north thats one reason i hate inflatable dinghies theyre prey to every gust of wind and current but if the dinghy was an unwieldy brute sunflower looked magnificent i rested on the oars admiring her she looked drab and scuffed among the smart yachts on the other moorings but her drabness was the result of long sea miles and it gave her the battered beauty of functionalism she was weatherbeaten tough and practical then as i gazed at her a mans head appeared in her companionway he stared around the moorings glanced at me for a second then ducked back into the cabin for a moment i was shocked into immobility i even doubted what id seen somehow all the years of ocean travel had not diluted the prejudice that blatant thievery is more common abroad than in an english harbour certainly not in genteel yellowwellied salcombe and the intruder if i had not imagined the whole thing had to be a thief id left sunflowers companionway locked tight so he must have broken the big padlock to get inside the cabin the intruder had not been charlie for the man id seen had black hair and charlies thatch was as fair as mine i wouldnt have cared if charlie had broken the cabin lock then drunk all the whiskey on board but i was damned if some stranger would steal from me i began rowing again as i did so the dark head appeared again in the companionway i rowed steadily aiming well away from her and the man must have decided that i posed no threat for he ducked back down into the cabin i rowed on keeping well to sunflowers beam i knew the intruder might still be watching me through one of the thick cabin ports so i pretended to be going to a mooring north and east of the boat i didnt hurry i did nothing to make him suspicious i wanted to trap him he was thieving from my boat and i wanted to make him regret it i knew i would have to be cunning for he was surely alert to the possibility of the owner returning so i kept rowing away from sunflower though now because i was past her i was able to watch her constantly the man did not reappear in the companionway so he must have felt safe i went a good two hundred yards past sunflowers mooring then turned south amongst a gaggle of moored salcombe yawls i rowed until sunflowers bows were pointing directly towards me then i let the ebbing tide carry me down towards her i steered with a single oar over the dinghys transom i noticed there was no tender tied to sunflower which was odd but when i was just twenty yards away i forgot the oddity because i heard voices there were evidently two intruders aboard a man and a woman the womans voice sharp and penetrating seemed to make a protest but the mans voice overrode her i put out a hand and caught the rail of sunflowers pulpit the tide was trying to take the dinghy down sunflowers starboard flank to where i would have been visible through the cabin ports but i held the dinghy back took a breath then slowly hauled myself over the bows the big hull rocked gently under my weight but not enough to warn the intruders of my presence id kept the inflatables painter in my left hand and i quickly hitched it to the pulpit rail the inflatable would bump softly against the steel hull and i prayed the tiny thumping would not alert them the man was speaking again low and urgently but i could not hear his exact words i crouched over the forehatch i guessed that the man and woman would be in the main cabin i could just see the twisted remains where they had forced the hasp of the main companionway i briefly thought of making my entrance there but my footsteps could have alerted them as i negotiated the cabin roof and i wanted to surprise them i took the bunch of keys from my pocket and taking exquisite care not to make them jangle found the small key for the forehatch padlock the dinghy driven by the wind thumped softly and persistently against the hull rain slicked sunflowers teakplanked deck the key went unwillingly into the lock resisted then turned i eased the padlock out of the steel hasp laid it with the keys on the deck then took hold of both latches then a bellowing roar made me twist round i should have realised that the man and woman must have used another boat to reach sunflower which boat to prevent suspicion had left them aboard before going a safe distance away their accomplice on board that other boat had belatedly seen me and now he was accelerating towards the rescue of his companions the rescuer was a huge man built like a prizefighter who conned his small boat with a noticeable clumsiness that boat was a small aluminium dory flat bottomed and driven by a big outboard which was flinging water white to either side the noise must have alerted the intruders for the mans head reappeared in the companionway i saw sleek black hair lying close to a narrow skull then the man turned and stared in astonishment at me i had snatched a boathook from its rack on the cabin roof i kept two boathooks there one was for hooking boats or moorings but the other the one i seized had a more specialised purpose i had sharpened its spike to sailneedle sharpness then ground a blade edge down the outer curve of the hook that done i had hollowed out the head of the shaft and weighted the weapon with lead in effect i had made myself a miniature boarding pike that had proved its worth more than once any yacht in far waters is fair game for a thief and a lone sailor had better take precautions or else he or she will end up as crabmeat now in salcombes supposedly peaceful harbour i swung the weighted blade blunt side forward at the blackhaired man he turned away from the blow which nevertheless caught him on the back of his neck it half felled him or else he was already falling for he disappeared down the companionway i was shouting part in rage that the intruders had dared to break into sunflower and in part to scare the man i scrambled over the liferaft and coachroof then jumped down into the cockpit where i turned and held the boathook like a poised harpoon the dory was slewing round spraying water in a great curved sheet the big man at its controls shouted incoherently at his companions on sunflower i could see the womans legs in my cabin she was sitting on the starboard bunk but i could not see her male companion stay there you bastards i shouted i planned to trap my intruders inside sunflower cow them into docility then use the vhf to call the police the man in the dory was having trouble controlling his boat which was a blessing because i didnt fancy fighting a man of his height and weight i was about to go down into the cabin when the unlocked forehatch swung open and the blackhaired man pulled himself lithely up on to the foredeck he was thin he had a suntanned countrymans face and was wearing a check shirt beneath a waxed cotton coat he had a yellow waistcoat brogues and cavalry twill trousers he was dressed for the racecourse rather than the water the dory thumped alongside ringing like a cracked bell on sunflowers steel hull come on the helmsman shouted at his companion jump i ran forward the thin blackhaired man did not jump into the dory but turned to face me instead he brushed at his tweed jacket and somehow the commonplace gesture slowed my attack then he looked up at me he had very confident eyes he was a handsome man perhaps in his late thirties with a sardonic knowing look about his narrow features it was a face which suggested a long acquaintanceship with human fallibilities but it was also a face with an intrinsic air of command theres really no need to get excited he said to me in a very condescending voice what the hell are you doing on my boat i still advanced on him but slowly now and with the boathook held out like a pike i want to talk to you of course he had a very crisp voice an unashamedly upperclass voice honed by public school and effortless confidence shall we go below only after youve paid for the damage youve done he smiled wearily were going to be tedious are we and for gods sake stop pointing that hook at me the dorys helmsman a much coarser creature than the thin man still held on to sunflowers guardrails he was bald big and was staring with concern at the threatening boathook but the other had already dismissed the weapons menace he reached out with his right hand to fend off the hook i resisted his gesture and in sudden anger he gripped the boathooks head to wrest it out of my hand he was surprisingly strong for such a thin man but a second after he had seized the hook and while he was still pulling his brain registered a stinging pain where he had expected none i added to the pain by twisting the haft blood was spilling out of his hand now dripping on to sunflowers deck i saw the sudden agony on his face he snatched his right hand away dripping blood then groped his left hand beneath his jacket to find a slim longbladed knife that had been sheathed at his belt his larger companion was evidently uncertain whether to come to the thin mans aid or keep the dory alongside so did nothing i lunged skewering the boathooks sharpened point into the thin mans upper arm he swore tried to fend the hook away with his knife but i had swung it away and now hefted it hard back he had taken enough and scrambled desperately over the guardrails he was too slow to escape my swing and the weighted boathook caught him on the back of his head as he jumped blood was bright in his black sleek hair he fell against the big man who let go of sunflower the dory rocked alarmingly i ran forward raised the hook and slammed it down hoping to ram it clean through the aluminium hull instead i punctured a spare petrol can which began adding its fuel to the blood in the dorys scuppers the thin man whom id wounded was much more alert than his big companion he threw himself at the dorys controls and rammed the throttle into reverse the engine roared the boat scuttled backwards like a frightened crab and the big man nearly fell overboard bastards i shouted the thin man just stared at me blood glistened on his waxed coat i had hurt him and his eyes told me that he was not a man to forget or forgive a defeat but let him hate i thought because in a weeks time id be sailing south and he could whistle his enmity at the waning moon i watched as he pushed the dorys motor into forward gear he was a better helmsman than his companion and i suspected that the thin man was capable at most things he turned his hands to he had that kind of confidence about him but he had failed with me i raised two fingers at him as the small boat accelerated away between the moored yachts then the two men vanished among the moorings leaving behind only a haze of blue exhaust smoke and a smear of bright blood on a boathooks head and a woman they had left the woman behind so now i went to find her bloody hell for a second i was too shocked to move then i swung myself down the companionway the girl lay on my starboard bunk where the thin man had evidently gone to work on her there was blood on her face chest and hands she was wearing a woollen skirt a blouse and a sweater the sweater was in remnants and the blouse bloodstained and torn on the companionway were the tattered fragments of her raincoat which looked as if it had been torn apart by dogs she stared at me with whimpering scared eyes the bastard had also gone to work on sunflower hed ripped her cabin to shreds but that could wait who are you i was pumping water from the freshwater tank into an unbroken cup the girl did not answer her hands tried to pull the scraps of her torn sweater together i knelt beside her and she flinched away for gods sake i said im trying to help you now stay still i dont think i reassured her instead i think the abruptness of my tone merely scared her into compliance whatever she did not move as i used a cleanish scrap of rag to wipe the blood from her face she shuddered when the rag first touched her skin then seemed to accept that i was helping her nothings broken i said which meant that her nose was still in one piece the blood had come from a nosebleed but that had stopped one of her cheekbones was badly grazed but the damage was really very slight except to her nerves i did not know about her ribs nor was i about to investigate the thin man had half stripped her to the waist but i was not going to inflict a similar indignity on her what did he do to you i asked he threatened me with a knife she managed to say then hit me her voice was wavering and scared and no wonder for she was still rigid with shock only hit you i asked nothing else she nodded firmly nothing else meaning she hadnt been sexually assaulted he said id come to make an arrangement with you and when i wouldnt tell him more he tore my clothes she had barely been able to articulate the last words which came out as sobs there was nothing to tell she protested to me to the whole boat then began to shiver violently i pulled a sleeping bag from the mess on the cabin floor and draped it round her shoulders she shrank away from my touch i was almost as shocked as the girl the violence of the thin man was so gratuitous and unexpected but any explanations would have to wait till the girl had recovered some of her composure go into the forward cabin i said firmly and clean yourself up youll find some sweaters in the drawers theyre not very clean theyre a bit damp but theyre better than nothing she nodded again but did not move she was clutching the sleeping bag round her body with her bloodstained left hand she was still sobbing each exhalation a tiny whimper of pain its all right i said im not going to hurt you i deliberately backed away and sat on what was left of my portside bunk still she did not move she was struggling to subdue the sobs which slowly died away she took some deep breaths and finally when she felt she was once again in control of her voice she asked if i was the earl of stowey the question was so unexpected and so out of place that i just gaped at her she frowned at me are you the earl she asked me again but this time with a tone of desperation as if her recovery from the ordeal depended on my answer yes i am since my brother died ive been the twentyeighth earl of stowey but i prefer the anonymity of plain john rossendale because a title isnt any damn use at sea but i dont use the title i explained to her so just call me john ok i rummaged through the mess on the cabin sole and found a bottle of antiseptic and a halfclean towel which i held out to her why dont you go forward and clean yourself up ill make some tea she went on staring at me go on i encouraged her she took the bottle and towel but still did not move so i climbed up the companionway steps into the cockpit as though i was making sure that the two men had gone nothing stirred in the harbour except the rain slithering across the grey water smoke rose from chimneys in the town i heard the girl moving in the cabin below then the click as she locked herself into the forecabin i took my binoculars from their clip in the cockpit cavelocker and stared towards the town but i could see no sign of the small aluminium dory my intruder had disappeared i went below again and swore under my breath the thin man had turned sunflower inside out he had forced locked doors open then spilt the locker contents on to the sole hed torn up the sole and rummaged through the bilges hed broken the vhf the radios case looked as if it had been prised apart with a jemmy i switched the set on but nothing happened the damage to the boat was not immense but the cost of making the repairs would be painful i cursed the bastard again then because i could not contemplate starting to clean up i went topsides once more turned on the gas at the aft locker then went below and lit the gas hob the small galley was about the only place on the boat which had escaped the thin mans attention presumably because i had disturbed him before he could start its destruction the chart table had been wrenched off its piano hinge and all my precious rare charts were torn and crumpled the sextant was safe which was a blessing it didnt seem as if anything had been stolen but i could not be certain till i had searched the boat properly i made a strong pot of tea mixed some powdered milk and jammed up a leaf of the cabin table i packed a pipe lit it then waited it was ten minutes before the girl came nervously out of the forecabin she was wearing one of my aran sweaters which suited her she had short black hair dark eyes and honeybrown skin she had also so far as i could tell recovered her composure though there was still a wariness in her expression tea i greeted her the milks reconstituted sugar no sugar she picked her way across the wreckage of the cabin and nervously sat opposite me no milk either please rum instead of milk she shook her head then brushed her fingers through her hair i saw that she was pretty even with a cut face frightened eyes and a mucky damp sweater she was pretty did that bastard take the forecabin apart i asked not as badly as this cabin she shuddered suddenly i was waiting for you in the cockpit when they arrived there were two of them but only one came aboard i thought he was a friend of yours she shivered again and momentarily closed her eyes thank you for frightening him away my pleasure i put a mug of tea in front of her sorry theres no lemon does the pipe smoke bother you no she cradled the tin mug in both hands found it too hot and quickly put it down she glanced around the ransacked cabin and grimaced in the cold damp air sunflowers accommodation seemed dispiriting and drab the girl took a deep breath then looked across the table at me im jennifer pallavicini i did not respond i had been half expecting her to tell me more about the thin man but instead she had offered me the formal introduction so i just smiled an acknowledgement doesnt the name mean anything to you there was a trace of indignation in her voice should it weve been writing to you for three years i shrugged to show that none of her letters had reached me then sipped my tea which id generously laced with rum the heat of the liquid scalded the tender patch where the tooth had been drawn and i winced your letters are probably mouldering in general deliveries all over the world im sorry we wrote care of your mother i half smiled i wasnt the favourite child she never even sent me a birthday card let alone other peoples letters so then we heard youd come home for your mothers funeral she continued and because you never replied to our letters i was sent down to find you to her it all made sense to me none my mother had never forwarded a letter to me i had never heard of jennifer pallavicini and i wondered how she had discovered that sunflower was moored in salcombe i had also noted that she had been sent to find me implying that she was merely a messenger who sent you i asked she gave me an almost hostile look it was clear that miss jennifer pallavicini was recovering very swiftly from her encounter with the thin man this was a tough girl i suspected and that realisation made me look more closely at her there was a lot of character in my visitors face a face blended of intelligence beauty and determination a formidable girl i thought and not one to take lightly so i prompted her i work for sir leon buzzacott ah i said neutrally though in truth her answer made complete sense buzzacott was the rich man who had almost bought stoweys van gogh then been denied it he had never hidden his bitter disappointment buzzacott one of the citys most glittering financiers had established his own art collection the buzzacott museum gallery at his country house he believed that too many of britains art treasures were crossing the atlantic or going to the japanese and he had sworn to stop the haemorrhaging flow of paint the van gogh had been his proudest acquisition filling a great gap in his collection and it evidently still rankled that the painting did not hang on his museums wall what exactly do you do for sir leon i asked im the curator of nineteenthcentury europe it seemed either a large task or an excessive boast anyway it made me smile which annoyed her damn you she said damn me i was taken aback by the sudden hostility id saved her from a worse beating lent her clothes made her tea and now she was treating me like a piece of scum she closed her eyes in exasperation sir leon has never relinquished his hopes of acquiring the painting naturally a new price will have to be negotiated but sir leon will match any offer you may receive indeed my lord john i interrupted her indeed mr rossendale she continued as though i hadnt spoken sir leon will accept any reasonable valuation which in present market terms must make the painting worth at least twenty million pounds its easy to pretend not to care about money to say that a bluewater sailor only needs enough cash to keep the rust out of the hull and to patch up the sails and to buy a few bottles of hooch and tins of stew that derision of money is the chorus of the seagypsies how weve escaped the vulgar greed of the world how we even feel sorry for the pinstriped business executives rushing towards their bypass surgery because of the stress of making money and were so proud that weve escaped the love of the filthy stuff and we profess not to care about it and even to despise it but then along comes a darkhaired girl who casually says her employer is willing to lay out twenty of the big ones and so i gaped at her and wondered if she was mad or if i was going deaf twenty i asked weakly millions she said firmly wow i grinned i told myself that i didnt care about money but twenty million smackeroos the art world must have gone mad in the last four years my mother had thought she had done well to negotiate a price of four million and shed been assured that was at least one million above the highest auction price but twenty at least twenty jennifer pallavicini had said you could buy a lot of boat for twenty big ones i said wistfully you could indeed she said icily theres just one snag i went on which is that i dont have the painting but you know who does it wasnt a question but a statement this girl just like my sister and the rest of my family was convinced of my guilt no i said gently i dont jennifer pallavicini sighed as though i wilfully exasperated her before she died she said flatly your mother found evidence of your guilt she told us as much one of your accomplices confessed whoopee i said except it isnt true your mother wished to confront you with that evidence she ignored my denial and to make one last appeal to you i leaned back the washboards were out of their slots and rain was flicking down into the cabin i rubbed my face and winced as i put pressure on my sore gum i looked up at the barometer which happily wasnt broken and saw that the air pressure was rising too soon for me i needed a few days to make my repairs but as soon as the next depression had passed upchannel id use the backwash of northerly winds to take me away from england and that man jennifer pallavicini shivered at the memory of the thin man told me youd come home to sell the painting that caught my attention he said what that youd come home to sell the painting but he said it wasnt yours to sell i stabbed at the faltering tobacco in my pipe with a shacklespike so if his argument was with me i asked why go to work on you she seemed to consider whether or not to answer then gave a small shrug when he first came aboard he asked me if i knew anything about the painting and i was foolish enough to say i did when i told him i worked for sir leon he wanted to know how much we were paying you for the painting and just when you were going to produce it i said we had no agreement and he didnt believe me so he beat you up she paused then nodded stiffly and i think he rather enjoyed doing it im sorry i said but my sympathy only irritated her the important thing she said distantly is that at last weve succeeded in making contact with you all that we now ask is that you deal with us rather than with anyone else i shook my head but i cant deal with you because i didnt steal the painting and i dont know where it is so you say that churlish answer tempted me to anger it would have been easy to give in to the impulse for i was tired and irritated but on the other hand i was beginning to see that jennifer pallavicini was a very beautiful girl indeed and its astonishing how pretty girls can make mens manners so i hid the anger jennifer pallavicini was collecting together the contents of her handbag which the thin man had spilt across the bunk you should know she said as she restowed her bag that the painting is legally your possession your mothers will cant change that i shrugged i havent even read the will she left the painting to your twin sister but as your mother had already transferred its ownership to the stowey trust before your brothers death then the legacy is unenforceable she looked up at me in effect my lord you stole your own property i could feel a pulse throbbing in the pulpy place where my tooth had been prised out jennifer pallavicinis words were reminding me of the dull responsibilities i had fled after the disappearance of the painting the stowey trust was in effect the wealth of the rossendale family but formed into a trust to minimise taxes and death duties these days the trust was bankrupt made so by the loss of the painting however the chief beneficiary of the trust had always been the earl of stowey which meant that if i had stolen the van gogh then i had indeed robbed myself no one seemed to think that was an odd thing for me to do probably because they were all convinced i was stupid as well as guilty sir leon is willing to overlook any complicity of yours in the paintings disappearance if youll now assist in its recovery jennifer pallavicini told me how very kind of him i said she heard the scorn in my voice and shrugged were only trying to help you my lord dont call me that despite her looks anger had snapped into my voice i heard the sudden emotion and did not like it listen i said patiently my mother never had any proof that i stole the painting because i didnt if she did have such proof then she should have gone to the police i assume she didnt because no policemen have paid me a call since i returned to england so i suspect her proof was all imaginary so go back to buzzacott and tell him i didnt nick the painting that i dont know where the thing is and that i cant help him tell him that four years ago the police questioned me for two days and didnt charge me because they knew they couldnt make a charge stick in short i know nothing about the painting and thats the end of the matter jennifer pallavicini didnt blink an eye at my denial sir leon is offering twenty million pounds for the painting mr rossendale payable in any currency you desire and in any country you choose she paused for a response and when i made none went on you may take that as a negotiating position rather than as a final offer mr rossendale in other words i could name my price for returning the painting and the price would be paid far away from the prying eyes of the taxmen the only fly in that ointment was that i hadnt stolen the van gogh in the first place and didnt know where it was i was also angry at the continued accusations four years had not lessened anyones greed for the canvas nor their conviction that i had stolen it doubtless my mother had thought a deathbed appeal would make me reveal its whereabouts while now sir leon buzzacott had sent this attractive messenger to try and bribe the information from me but i did not share their obsession with the picture and i was offended by their accusations i was also offended by jennifer pallavicinis patronising assumption of my guilt and to show my irritation i picked up her mug of tea and poured it down the sink drain goodbye miss pallavicini if she was startled by my action she was too proud to show it she gathered up her handbag you expect me to swim ashore my lord i rowed her there was no sign of the aluminium dory nor of the two men jennifer pallavicini said nothing during the journey but it was clear she was not enjoying the ride she had gone out to sunflower in one of salcombes water taxis but without a vhf radio i could not summon one for her return journey instead we rowed through the drizzle in sullen silence she didnt speak until i had safely delivered her to the towns pontoon where once she had clambered safely out of the inflatable she turned back to me where shall i return your sweater take it to an oxfam shop im going back to sea for a second she was tempted to take off the aran sweater and throw it contemptuously into the dinghy but modesty and the rain prevailed she turned away then surprisingly turned back one last question mr rossendale try me her dark eyes challenged me why is your boat called sunflower i bought her from a frenchman he called her tournesol its bad luck to change a boats name so i simply translated it in other words miss pallavicini the name is pure coincidence she stared down at me evidently unsure whether to believe my explanation then without another word turned away towards the town while i rowed back to sunflower i sat in my wrecked cabin and tried to string a few explanations together sir leon buzzacott still wanted the painting sir leon was convinced i had stolen it and could therefore betray its present whereabouts my family had convinced him of that error by claiming to have proof of my guilt fine except i wasnt guilty no accomplice of mine could have confessed because there had been no accomplices i suspected that my mother convinced of my guilt had invented the tale which didnt explain the two men or why the wellspoken thin man had wrecked sunflowers cabin from what he had told jennifer pallavicini he clearly believed that i had the painting and was about to sell it had he believed i had the thing concealed in sunflower did he think id hide twenty million quids worth of paint and canvas in a sealocker and who had told him i might have it and what had he meant by saying that the painting wasnt mine to sell jennifer pallavicini had said the painting was mine but mothers will evidently tried to deny me the ownership the disagreement had all the makings of a fine lawyers stew which meant that i should get the hell out of it ive learned a few good lessons in life always shorten sail when the first impulse occurs never sail upwind unless desperate and never never never give a lawyer a fingerhold on your affairs and this wasnt my affair i didnt have the painting didnt want the painting and didnt care about my mothers will the thin man jennifer pallavicini and anyone else who believed i had the van gogh was mistaken so the best thing i could do was forget id ever been offered twenty million pounds and sail away to the blue waters but first there was work to do i did a crude cleanup in the cabin and began an inventory of what had been broken and what had not most of my tools and clothes which had been stored with the spare sails in the forecabin had been scattered about though blessedly my visitor had not used his knives to search my sailbags undoubtedly he would have torn the sails to shreds given time but my unexpected return had frustrated him the thin man had found no evidence of the van gogh because there wasnt any to find nor thank god had he found my subsistence money the cash in a variety of different countries banknotes was stored in a grease tin which in turn lay with other such battered and filthy tins in the tool tray next to the engine no one would give the tin a second glance but then the thin man hadnt been after money just a twenty million pound painting and he hadnt found it but nor had he finished his search and if he really did believe the van gogh was on board then he might very well return to sunflower that thought gave me pause i decided that hunger was a great feeder of fear so i found a tin of stew a tin of new potatoes and a tin of corned beef i mashed the whole lot together then heated the mixture over the stove i sat in the cockpit and wolfed the meal down it tasted wonderful my gum was still tender but the pain of the tooth was blessedly absent yet the meal hardly diminished the scale of my problems first i had only a limited amount of money and the repairs to sunflower would take a great deal of that reserve id be lucky to be left with fifty pounds and that was not nearly sufficient to victual her for the long journey south so i needed a place where i could do most of the repairs myself and i needed a job to make some quick cash i also wanted to hide from the two men not because i feared them but because i wanted no part of their hunt for the missing picture four years ago i had sailed away from all those complications and i would be damned if i would let myself be sucked back into that maelstrom of greed and suspicion no one tried to board sunflower that night which did not mean that either i or she was safe i needed a hiding place a job and somewhere to make my repairs and with the expedient neatness that sometimes characterises our unexpected needs i knew just where i might find all three i slept uneasily woke early and sailed in the dawn the weather had cleared overnight the estuary even at dawn was filled with sails three salcombe yawls pretty little wooden boats hissed past me as i hanked on the jib and staysail a big french sloop loaded to the gunwales with what seemed to be a dozen fecund families made a noisily joyful exit the sun was making the sails open on the water like unfolding white petals my grey battered sails joined them the wind was back in the southwest i motored sunflower as far as the bar which this morning was a pussy cat there was scarcely a ripple where just a few days before id plunged suicidally through the cascading white water once in the outer channel i turned off the motor and let sunflower fall on to a starboard tack the sea glittered under the rising sun after the sordid events of the previous day it felt wonderful to be at sea again a big white catamaran with a cabin the size of a townhouse passed me a bearded man at her wheel shouted a genial good morning he had a startlingly pretty longhaired girl with him she waved at me and her friendly greeting suddenly curdled my high spirits like water poured into oil i like my life i like the moment when after departure i can turn back and see nothing but the empty sea perhaps a ridge of cloud marks where the retreating land lies but soon i know there will be nothing from that moment on i am beholden to no one responsible only to myself and dependent only on my own boat and my own strength there are no lawyers at sea no accountants no estate office no family no expectations no tenants no creditors no tax assessors no bank managers no stockbrokers no land agents those were the darksuited creatures i had fled after my brothers death i had been called home to become head of the family and earl and lord of stowey but instead i had found myself trapped between my mothers grinding ambitions and the dull dull strictures of the men in suits his lordship must sign this document and his lordship should consider the tax advantages of deferring this dividend and his lordship must meet urgently with the revenue or the bank manager and on it went until his lordship told them that he didnt give a monkeys to this day when some petty bureaucrat gives me grief i tell him to go to hell the first earl of stowey was a norman who took the land with the edge of his sword and i would be damned if i would be hagridden to death by a pinstriped army of bores i went back to sea to escape them and till this return i had avoided them but there had been a price for that evasion and the price was loneliness i watched the pretty girl in the big catamaran and i felt a stab of selfpity i hated that sensation my god but id chosen my path and i had better stick to it or else the world would mock my failure that was pride but i was a proud man i might not like being called my lord but the blood in my veins had been old when england was young so damn the loneliness it could always be assuaged there would always be some emptyeyed girl bag slung on her shoulder waiting at a tropical quayside it only took a nod the girl would climb on board and that was that till boredom or irritation dissolved the liaison there were no ties in such relationships no mortgages no screaming children no slow grinding tedium just company i tacked we were well off bolt head now the sea was spattered with yachts many like me heading westwards i was not going far just down the devon coast nor was i hurrying i lashed the tiller then went below where i buttered a piece of bread and made a flask of tea i breakfasted in the cockpit as terns divebombed the sea there was a gentle swell a small chop and a steady wind sunflower was fairly tight on the breeze but she held her course well she bridled sometimes threatening to luff and occasionally as a steeper chop slapped the hull some of the wreckage would rattle down below once clear of bolt tail i turned a few points to the north and sunflower seemed to ease up she was enjoying herself now and i felt the urge to turn her bows towards the open ocean and let her sail far far away but first i had to repair her because only then could the two of us go back where we belonged by midday under a brassy brilliant sun we were sailing into plymouth sound we passed drakes island heading for the hamoaze this was naval and commercial water slicked with oil as romantic as a sludge pump yet out of here had sailed all the ships of english history the victory and the mayflower the revenge and the golden hind yet the place i sought had neither grandeur nor history but only the hopelessness of decay it was a boatyard consisting of a slip a grubby dock an empty grid a filthy quay a workshop a warehouse and a forlorn office a few workboats were tied at the quay but all looked ready for the scrapyard no work seemed to be going on in the yard though i saw an old green jaguar parked by the offices which suggested that someone was minding the shop after four years id half expected to find the old yard sold but it was still here a monument to sloth and carelessness i moored sunflower to a decrepit fishing boat then climbed a rusting ladder to the dock a womans bicycle leaned beside the office door which had a piece of hardboard nailed across the space where a pane of glass had evidently been broken a similar repair disfigured the door at the top of the stairs i pushed the door open astonishing the secretary who sat behind the ancient desk i blew her a kiss youre still here rita god love me rita was a dim goodnatured girl who spent her days reading true romance magazines there was no other work for her to do in the yard except make the tea and answer the phone johnny is it really you its really me i took her hand made an elaborate bow and kissed a painted fingernail is the old sod in hes probably asleep she stared at me you havent half got a suntan then remembering something she dutifully frowned i saw it in the papers about your mother i am sorry john i shrugged as though i was unable to articulate my own sorrow then pushed open the door to the inner office george cullen started awake with a splutter he tried to pretend that he had been working and at the same time offered me a hurt look as though id offended him by not knocking then blinking fully awake he recognised me he smiled decided a smile was not appropriate and stood to offer me a hand my lord its johnny to you i said and how are you you old fraud he shook my hand johnny he said it tentatively as though trying the name out though hed known me as nothing else since id been thirteen still george was one of those men who liked to know a peer johnny he said again this time with pleasure as though he truly was glad to see me quite a surprise youll have a glass of something with an old friend wont you he produced a bottle of scotch which had a label id never seen before and hope never to see again in mozambique which is a destination i would not recommend to passing yachtsmen i had drunk from a bottle which purported to be scotch it was called sbell and bore a very poor copy of a bells label sbell whisky was a drink for a desperate man though it made an excellent allpurpose solvent georges scotch was of the same order i took a sip then grimaced where on earth did you get this muck george it was a business gift johnny from an associate bloody hell i drank it anyway then held out my glass for more george refilled my glass hes an affable crook he looks as bent as any frontbench politician what with his beer belly jowly face and small suspicious eyes but he has a great taste for gossip and a healthy fear of the prison yard he had inherited this hamoaze boatyard from his father but the yard didnt do real business any more georges income came from fencing items thieved from boats the police must have known about him so the only explanation for his continued liberty must have been that he was grassing on someone id known george for twentyone years i used to spend my holidays working in the yard back then there had still been a semblance of industry at cullens boats but that pretence seemed to have been long dropped he waddled to the window and stared down at sunflower been far in her johnny round the world george have you now he gazed at her as he stuffed his pipe with tobacco ive always fancied sailing round the world never had the chance of course too busy george couldnt make it past plymouth breakwater in a gin palace let alone sail round the world but i smiled politely he shrugged then hospitably offered me his tobacco pouch just visiting are you johnny i shook my head i want your grid for a couple of days and whats left of your workshop of course johnny of course ill have to check that no ones booked in of course but shut up george of course no ones booked in and dont worry ill earn my keep ah george frowned i suppose he had been expecting me to offer him cash while now i was suggesting that he paid me for odd jobs but his cupidity was beaten by his snobbishness a lord was a lord even if he was penniless george lit his pipe then went back to his littered desk well work something out johnny and i want something else george he heard the wariness in my voice and matched it with his own something else i dont want anyone to know im here george might be a sluggish old toad but he has a nose for mischief he slumped down in his padded chair the police again johnny not the police a couple of bastards think ive got something they came looking for it yesterday and they might come looking again so i dont want them to know where i am anyone i know i described the two men as i filled my pipe with georges black shag i couldnt give much of a description of the big balding man who had helmed the dory but i offered an excellent description of the thin man who had such a crisp public school accent garrard george interrupted me when i mentioned the thin mans voice garrard trevor garrard used to be in the army a right posh villain he is was he carrying a knife yes thats garrard then you dont have to worry about his mate hes just a thick lump of muscle nothing more but you should watch garrard hes nasty i was not in the least surprised that george knew the two men because there was very little villainy in the southwest that george did not know about garrard was cashiered out the army george went on then he got snared by the fraud squad so now hes a winkler he did a bit of bookies business at one time but i dont suppose he dares show his face on a racecourse these days he was too violent you see and the coppers got a line on him so nowadays hes mostly a winkler a winkler i asked wondering if the winklers were a notorious family of criminals george poured himself more whisky a winkler he said with plump dignity is a rentcontrol operative come again george he sighed suppose youve got a property johnny and theres a sitting tenant in it paying you a lousy rent and the law wont let you turf the useless bugger out but youre losing money on the property and you want to put another tenant inside wholl pay you a proper rent so what do you do you cant hire another bleeding lawyer because youll get the same answer so you hire yourself a winkler things begin to happen to your tenant nasty things the water gets shut off rats take up residence and perhaps half the roof falls in their pussy cats get strangled and their car tyres get slashed the tenant eventually gets fed up moves out and you pay the winkler for his services hes winkled them out you see he added this last explanation helpfully you know this fellow garrard i asked not personally george was being evasive now but i know hes done some jobs for local businessmen he comes from bristol i think ronnys from london but hes not such a bad lot ronnys the bald one george nodded ronny peel hed beat you into pulp if he was told to but hes not an animal know what i mean but that garrard george shook his head worriedly i wouldnt touch him johnny hes trouble i dont want to touch him i just dont want him to know where i am ill keep quiet he promised and i believed the promise because georges criminality does not extend to violence in fact he probably hates the sight of blood besides george and i go back a long way in the faraway past hed given me a refuge from my family and in his lackadaisical way he had introduced me to boats it was in this shabby yard that id learned to weld steel and work wood it was here that id found my first proper job as a crew member on an oceangoing yacht george had known me a long time which by itself did not guarantee any favours but i was also john frederick albert rossendale the twentyeighth earl of stowey and that helped it shouldnt have helped but it did so now because of georges aristocratic tastes sunflower and i were safe i had been wrong about needing georges grid for a couple of days more like a couple of weeks once i got sunflower out of the water i saw just how sorry her hull was the poor thing looked more like a floating compost heap than a yacht it was no wonder shed been so sluggish crossing the atlantic i should have antifouled her in america or the caribbean but id been reluctant to pay american prices for antifouling paint but by waiting i had forced myself to do more than just antifoul sunflower in places the old paint had abraded right back to its epoxy pitch base what i really needed to do was strip the whole hull back to bright steel then start again i should have craned her out of the water screened her off and done what charlie would have called a proper job except i had neither the time nor the money to be so thorough instead i would have to do the best i could on georges grid a grid is simply a raised platform on which a boat can be stranded as the tide falls at mean low tide in georges yard sunflower would be perched about eight feet above the water and between tides i would have around seven hours to work on her before the rising flood forced me to stop id thus be needing a whole series of low tides she was well berthed to the quay but to stop her toppling sideways into georges mucky dock i took a halfinch line from her upper spreaders and tied it to a ringbolt on the outside wall of his workshop i knotted red rags round the rope and put a large sign by the ringbolt leave this rope alone id once watched a beautiful danish ketch fall twelve feet off a grid in brittany it wasnt pretty i fired up georges ancient compressor stripped myself to the waist and hitched up his sandblaster or rather sludgeblaster for i couldnt afford to buy the proper sand so had to make do with a miserable pile that mouldered damply behind the warehouse the diesel fuel which fired the compressor also came from georges stock and was fouled even when i managed to make the compressor work the damp sand clotted and jammed the hoppers throat every few minutes so progress at best was fitful i used the enforced pauses to slap a rustpreventing resin on to the newly cleaned patches of sunflowers hull between later tides i would strip the resin then slap on a holding primer four coats of epoxy tar one coat of antifouling primer and two coats of the antifouling it would be mindnumbing work but if i did it well enough then the hull would be protected from rust for the next ten years when the rising tide forced me to abandon work on the hull i went inside the cabin where i was beginning to rebuild the damaged lockers i made good progress but still my grease tin of money was taking a beating i needed cash that was ironic considering jennifer pallavicini had been dangling twenty million pounds in front of me while now my hopes of earning a few quid from george were clearly illfounded for his yard was utterly bare of work why do you keep it on i asked him gives me something to do johnny gets me away from the wife he chuckled he was standing beside the compressor watching me work the hoppers throat had just choked up and before i dug the soggy sand free i was wiping resin on to the bright steel of sunflowers hull and theres the other side of it george went on i hadnt forgotten the other side of it was the stolen merchandise that went through his warehouse george specialised in bent chandlery forcibly retired decca sets or radios mind you he said ive been thinking of selling out the leisure markets on the way up and someone could make a nice little bundle by turning the yard into a yachtservicing business why not you george im not a well man johnny id forgotten how george was always suffering from some new and undiagnosable ailment so the yards for sale he shrugged for the right price its prime riverside property after all he gestured about the yard as though he was selling a stretch of the st tropez waterfront rather than a scabby junk heap mouldering around a smelly dock are you interested johnny me i laughed just painting sunflower will clean me out not to mention rebuilding your equipment i scrambled up to the dock and tried to restart the compressor but the water in georges diesel fuel wouldnt drive the engine i swore knowing i would have to siphon the fuel and clean the system it was my own fault of course for using georges yard if id had the money id have paid to have sunflower properly shotblasted but instead this old sandblaster would have to suffice george watched me bleed the compressors fuel line johnny he said after a bit george i spat watery diesel into the dock that painting he paused he must have known that my trouble with garrard had been caused by the van gogh but this was the first time he had mentioned it did they ever pin it on you if they had george do you think id be here id be in the scrubs slopping out shit pails he considered that answer and evidently found it convincing of course he said now that your mothers dead i suppose the painting belongs to you not according to her will she left it to my sister i said it to discourage georges speculation though i suspected that jennifer pallavicini was right and that the painting if it could ever be recovered was probably mine twenty million pounds and all mine except of course that if the painting ever did reappear there would be a salivating horde of lawyers and taxmen scrabbling to get their slices of the money but even those rapacious bastards would find it hard to destroy all of twenty million it must be worth a penny or two george must have been guessing my thoughts several million pennies george how much i straightened up from the engine sir leon buzzacott offered twenty million quid the other day which means its probably worth a bit more george puffed at his pipe he clearly wasnt certain whether to believe me in his line of business a good nights work yielded a few thousand not millions i dont like paintings he said eventually i used to deal in a few rubbish most of them seascapes that sort of thing but it was never worth the bother he shrugged evidently regretting some past escapade those two fellows george went on do you think theyre after the painting of course theyre after the painting so is sir leon buzzacott so is my twin sister half the damn world wants the thing but all i want is some clean diesel fuel have you got any he shook his head dismissing the problem of the contaminated fuel so you could be a millionaire johnny i told you it belongs to my sister now bugger off george im trying to work he buggered off and i worked on the compressor till five oclock when i climbed to ritas office where a cup of tea waited for me i telephoned charlies house but he still hadnt returned from hertfordshire is there a number in hertfordshire i asked yvonne she said there was but that charlie was never there she said he telephoned her when he needed to but she gave me the number anyway she sounded desperately tired i asked her to tell charlie that i was now at george cullens boatyard she promised she would but she didnt sound very friendly as she made the promise i tried the hertfordshire number it was the site office of a construction company and a gruff man said he hadnt seen charlie barratt for two days i put the phone down what the hells charlie doing in hertfordshire i asked rita more in frustration than in any hope of fetching an answer she blew on her newlypainted fingernails hes a big man now charlie is hes ever so rich and im the pope i knew charlie had done well since hed settled back home but ritas awed tones seemed to be overegging the pudding he is she insisted plant hire you name it and charlies got it artics tippers cranes earthmovers bulldozers rita shrugged hes got ever such a nice boat too a yacht she shook her head a big cabin cruiser its got one of those thingummyjigs on the front i tried to guess what a thingummyjig was a radar aerial a hot tub she remembered its ever so smart he brought it down here last year charlie clearly had done well when id left england he had been the owneroperator of an ancient commer lorry yet now if rita hadnt confused him with anyone else his business had flourished i was pleased for if any man deserved success it was charlie he had always been a hard worker and had a slew of practical skills to work with when we had been boys he and i had worked together in george cullens yard and even at fourteen charlie had shown the practical skills of an adult his schoolteachers naturally had written him off as a dumb peasant but charlie had always been too smart to let any teacher meddle with his ambitions i finished my tea went back downstairs and stripped down the compressors fuel system by nightfall i had it working ready for the morning it was what charlie would have called a proper job and to celebrate it i poured a glass of georges ghastly whisky made myself a mushy stew then slept i woke at one oclock at first i thought it was the ebbing tide dropping sunflowers keel on to the grid that had woken me then in the tiny light leaking through the companionway i saw the time and realised it was only twentythree minutes away from low tide which meant that sunflower must have been stranded on the grid for at least four hours i listened for whatever had woken me i could only hear the halliards slapping the mast the wind sighing at the spreaders and the slop of river water in georges dock everything seemed normal but nevertheless something had disturbed me in a night watch in the middle of an ocean the slightest change of sunflowers sound or motion would bring me to wakefulness and something even in the safe haven of georges dock had just triggered that alarm system i reached out for the light switch then froze the gate to georges yard squealed i realised that it had been that same creak of unoiled hinges that had woken me it was a sound that always made me alert even in daytime i wanted to be left alone in georges yard and whenever i heard the squeal of the hinges i would warily make sure that the visitor was not some unwelcome person from my past now in the depths of the night i had been woken by the warning sound i left the cabin unlit rolled out of the bunk and pulled on a pair of jeans i had been sleeping with the companionway open so i made no noise as i slipped up to the cockpit by standing on a thwart i could just see over the sill of the quayside a darkpainted van with no lights was being driven slowly into georges yard i did not move it was possible even likely that these were some of georges friends who had permission to use his warehouse the van was probably loaded with stolen goods the only reason i was suspicious was that george had not given me any warning usually when some mayhem was imminent he would tell me not to worry if i heard something go bump in the night the van braked to a halt its motor was cut i slid my special boathook out of its brackets the vans front doors opened quietly two men climbed out george always left a light burning outside his office door and in its glow i could see that one of the men was burly and bald the other thin commanding and blackhaired it was garrard and peel who now stood beside the van staring to where sunflowers masts reared above the grid and how the hell i wondered had they found me it had to be george doubtless he had done a favour to someone by betraying my whereabouts and i promised myself that id kick his fat hide to kingdom come when i had the chance i supposed it was my own fault for telling george that the painting was worth at least twenty million quid georges cupidity must have overwhelmed his love of a lord the two men would have seen me if id tried to climb up over the quay i did not want them to see me they thought i was fast asleep and i wanted them to continue in that blissful ignorance i glanced towards sunflowers dark cabin wondering whether i had time to fetch my rigging knife but knew i dared not waste a second for to hesitate would be to trap myself the two men were already walking softly towards sunflower as i slid over her stern and lowered myself to the grid the water was black beneath me i could hear the mens footsteps as i lowered myself again this time into the black filthy and freezing water i shivered then pushed away from the grids piles towards one of the decrepit fishing boats at the end of the small dock the weighted boathook tried to drag me down but i did not have far to go and the impetus of my push carried me to the docks side wall where a rusty ring gave me a handhold i pushed on again this time hiding in the impenetrable shadow between the fishing boat and the wall a torch beam slashed down into the dock flicked across the water then settled on sunflower the beam was dazzling for a few seconds then was switched off i was struggling forward ducking under the thick tyres which george used as fenders i needed to round the docks corner to the river wall where an iron ladder climbed to the quayside i heard one of the men drop down on to sunflowers deck the torch was switched on again they had abandoned stealth by now but their bird was flown planning his own ambush i was hurrying for i did not want to give the two men time to search sunflower and thus undo all my repair work i cleared the fishing boat hauled myself forward on its bow mooring rope and turned the corner into the tug of the tides current for a second i feared i would be swept downstream by this last feeble ebb but i lunged the boathook forward and managed to snag one of the ladders rungs the hook made a dull clunking noise but the two men were making enough noise of their own and did not hear me they were talking the noise i feared was the splintering sound as they began to search sunflowers halfrepaired cabin but so far they only talked i climbed the ladders rusted rungs the torch beam slashed over my head like the loom of a lighthouse i froze the bastards gone that was garrards distinctive voice i heard him grunt as he hauled himself back to the quays top try the office i heard the office door rattle but it was locked and the big bald man made no attempt to force it the torch beam began circling the yard again i climbed to the top of the ladder waited till the light was probing the rubbish tip behind the warehouse then rolled into the shadow of one of the many junk piles which littered georges yard i would have preferred it if the two men had been on board sunflower for then given the advantage of the quayside i would have been above them id contemplated trapping them there and using the boathook as a weapon forcing some answers from them instead both men were roaming the yard i thought that if i stayed motionless they might abandon the search and leave me in peace it wasnt that i was scared of a fight but theres no point in fighting superior odds unless its really necessary and so i stayed still garrard stayed by sunflower and told peel where to search the bald man thus clambered futilely about georges yard while garrard idled on the quay above my boat and while he idled he discovered the rope that id tied from the upper spreaders to the ringbolt garrard had a smaller torch and in its light he examined the bow and stern ropes and the spring lines then flashed the beam up to trace the rope that was taut at the spreaders he walked to the workshop wall and tugged on the rope and he saw how the added tension dragged the mast towards him he tested the rope again and i knew what was passing through his evil mind without that tether sunflowers balance would be very precarious she was resting on her long deep keel and though she weighed a good few tons it would not take much effort to unbalance her it was just about low tide and with one good push she would fall like a truck into the shallow waters eight feet below her her mast would break and god knew what other damage would be done garrard plucked down my notice which warned no one to touch the rope and tore it into two i tensed ready to charge at him but instead of drawing his knife and slashing the rope he lit a cigarette and leaned against the workshop wall it seemed he had no intention of destroying sunflower just as strangely he showed no sign of wanting to search her it appeared the two men had only one interest this night finding me buggers gone peel trudged disconsolately into view they spoke softly for a minute or two too softly for me to hear anything they said both their torches raked once more round the yard the beams scything over my head but for some reason neither man searched the low heap öf metal behind which i was hidden they did shine their torches down into the moored boats but it was clear they had given up any hope of finding me fetch the van garrard said peel started the van and switched on its headlights in the strong light i could see garrard was dressed in his horsy cavalry twill waistcoat and tweed jacket i could also see that his right hand was bandaged from the savaging id given it with the boathook he looked like the kind of man i used to know well loudvoiced and confident always to be found at a racecourse where hed have known the stable lad of an unfancied horse in the third race which was worth a bob or two on the nose such men had knowing eyes and bitter resentments they could be good companions for an afternoon but not for longer peel put the van into gear the bandage on garrards right hand was not inconveniencing him for almost casually he drew his knife and reached up to sunflowers tethering rope the knife must have been razor sharp for it sliced through the halfinch rope without any apparent effort i tensed again in sudden flaring panic i could see in the vans headlights that sunflower had not moved i had her leaning towards the dock which offered a margin of safety but my heart was flogging like a wet sail in a headwind all the same garrard watched her half expecting to see the yacht crash down into the stygian blackness beneath but she stayed upright he crushed his cigarette under his right shoe opened the passenger door and the van drove away i waited the van disappeared behind the workshop i heard the yard gates open the van growl through then the gates crash shut i listened as the van drove up the street paused at the main road junction then accelerated away silence the wind was lifting the cut rope into the night but sunflower good sunflower was stable and solid i stood up slowly i was freezing cold i was wearing nothing but one pair of sodden jeans and my muscles were stiff as boards i took the wet jeans off walked to the quayside and tossed them down into sunflowers cockpit this was no time to be worrying about being naked my priority was to retrieve that flying rope and rerig it and that i knew would take some careful work the rope was cut so i needed some more to make its length good george had some old rope lying in the yard but i did not trust it instead and taking exquisite care not to upset sunflowers precarious balance i lowered myself into her cockpit i stayed on the dockside gunwales adding my weight to her stability in a cavelocker in the cockpit i had some spare warps i found one and tossed it up to the quay then still staying hard by the dock wall i groped with the boathook for the ropes bitter end the wind was carrying the cut rope away from me out over the dark waters of the dock i reached for the errant line with the boathooks full length but the weighted head made the implement much too unwieldy for such a delicate job i slotted the heavy boathook back into place and pulled out the other one that did the job quickly snagging the windwhipped ropeend that i drew towards me i held on to it as i climbed back to the quayside it took five minutes to disentangle the rope from where it had blown itself about the shrouds the wind dried me as i worked but i was still bitterly cold i tied the cut rope to my spare warp with a sheet bend then made a lorrymans hitch in the warp i threaded the loose end through the ringbolt back through the hitchs loop then hauled it tight i felt sunflowers mast come towards me as the rope took her weight i made two turns and hitches to make the whole thing fast then let out my breath sunflower was secure again clever boy said trevor garrard i turned he was no more than five paces from me he held the knife loosely in his bandaged right hand but it wasnt the long blade which disturbed me rather his face which was lit by the bulb outside georges office he was utterly confident whatever happened now and it was bound to be violent this man had no fear but youre not so clever as you think he went on in a mocking tone because it was really rather obvious that youd make your boat safe as soon as wed gone so all i had to do was stay in the yard he smiled in tribute of his own cleverness then gave me a small mocking bow good evening my lord i said nothing being naked made me feel horribly vulnerable i had no weapon and this mans calm assurance was very frightening he might smile at me but his eyes were feral suggesting a man who knew neither pity nor remorse a bitter man fallen from grace and resentful i backed away from him but there was nowhere to flee to except the river and garrard had carefully placed himself between me and that refuge i backed round the workshop corner in time to hear the main gate creak open again thats peel coming back garrard said you havent met peel properly have you ill introduce you in a moment my right foot jarred against a loose metal stanchion i stooped quickly and picked it up it was a twofoot length of rusting angleiron sharpened to a crude point the weapon gave me some confidence but it did not seem to worry garrard peel he shouted im here mr garrard find a tarpaulin peel garrard gave his orders as though he was still in the army he looked back to me peel is not the brightest luminary to emerge from the stateschool system but he has the gross virtue of huge bodily strength he used to be a professional wrestler if you attack me with that crude piece of iron my lord i shall be forced to hurt you rather nastily i dont have the painting i said in a futile hope that the denial would give him pause of course you dont my task is simply to make certain that you dont get it back he was so foully sure of himself and he was confusing me why was he so confident that i didnt have the painting he had surely suspected me when he had searched sunflower but tonight he had not even bothered to go into her cabin i was trying to snatch answers from a fog and the fog was shot through with rank fear do you have the painting i asked him he laughed but said nothing do you know whos got it i tried i did not expect an answer now i was merely trying to keep him talking while i looked for an opportunity to attack him i was holding the angleiron low like a knife i guessed i could get in one nasty blow before garrard could use his blade i was apprehensive but it wasnt my first fight and i knew these next few moments had to be carefully planned then efficiently executed its like sailing in filthy weather the better prepared you are the more likely your survival is i was outnumbered and plainly garrard was chillingly confident of his skills but i still had an excellent chance i only needed to reach the river and because i was naked and they were fully dressed i knew neither man could outswim me in the meantime i must behave as they expected me to behave timidly do you know whos got the painting i asked again let us say my lord that i know you dont have it then why the hell did you search my boat i almost charged him then but i saw a wariness in his eye that kept me still i searched your boat he said to see if i could discover any correspondence but clearly if you are planning to retrieve the painting youve made the arrangements by phone youre crazy i havent made any arrangements but youre negotiating with buzzacott we have to stop that my lord got it peel had found the filthy sheet of old canvas which had half protected georges pile of sand he dragged it into the yard then grinned when he saw i was barearsed naked i had turned to face him but kept glancing back to make sure garrard did not move he didnt his lordship appears to be shivering with the cold garrard called to his partner so wrap him up but dont mark him peel advanced on me he had spread the canvas out like a matadors cloak i was frightened so much so that i could feel the goosebumps on my naked flesh and i could hear the blood thumping at my eardrums but i was still confident that i might yet outwit these two and reach the river i feared for what might happen to sunflower but at least i would escape a filleting then the import of what garrard had just said dawned on me he didnt want me marked which surely meant he wouldnt use the knife easy now guv peel had a raw east london voice he had lumbered to within a few paces of me and now spread the canvas wide to engulf me i turned and charged at garrard i shouted as i charged the knife in his bandaged right hand was a sliver of mirrorbright light i planned to shouldercharge him and to drive the angleiron like a rusting stake into his belly he seemed frozen by astonishment at my sudden attack and i felt the brief fierce joy of imminent victory i drew the stake back for the single crippling blow then struck and he moved one second he was a sitting duck and the next he had leaped aside like a hare he merely put out a foot i tripped on his foot and sprawled on to the yards cobbles the angleiron clattered away it had all been so shamefully easy for garrard who now stood over me with his knife does your lordship wish to offer us any further amusement i struck up at him with my fist but garrard avoided the blow easily he reached down with his left hand i flailed at it but he simply jabbed his fingers at my neck and a sudden searing pain paralysed me i gasped for breath couldnt scream couldnt move and had to lie there wideeyed as peel swathed me in the canvas he wrapped the clammy material round me with movements that were almost tender there he said soothingly that didnt hurt did it anger and fear and pain flared in me i was angry at being so easily humiliated and suddenly terrified because i was now at their mercy the pain receded and i found i could move again but the canvas restricted me as tightly as a straitjacket i promised not to mark you my lord but i said nothing about not hurting you the sardonic garrard stood above me so kindly cooperate with us i stared up at him resenting and hating him but utterly helpless id been taught a lesson that garrard was an expert in violence and pain the army had trained him to it but had been unable to discipline him so now he was a dangerous animal loose and vicious he sheathed his knife i always believe some explanation is a courtesy so i will merely say my lord that your sin consisted in inheriting the painting i dont know what the hell youre talking about truth and desperation gave my words vehemence but they left garrard quite unmoved so the time has come for you to pay for your sin we must all do it some of us sooner rather than later bring his lordship peel peel lifted me as if id been a child i was trying to free one hand to stab my fingers at his eyes but he sensed what i was doing and just gripped my canvaswrapped body in a crushing bear hug he carried me across the yard then lowered me on to the quays parapet where he knelt beside me to stop any attempt i might make to free myself of the sodden and clinging material the object of the exercise garrard announced confidently is to make it appear as though you drowned in your sleep he swung himself down to sunflowers deck and a moment later reappeared with my sleeping bag which he brought back up to the quayside it has frequently occurred to me my lord that the welleducated should take to violent crime more often has it ever occurred to you that the success of the police is almost always due to the low average intelligence of the criminal i intend your death to be entirely above suspicion which is why i and not peel am in charge of this operation is that not right peel yes mr garrard i dont know what the hell youre talking about i said the fear was making me sob i hadnt been overfearful of the fight i could even contemplate being hurt but now i knew i was going to die and there was an implacability in these two men which told me there would be no escape i was frightened i was more frightened than i have ever been for christs sake i began shut the fuck up garrard said and for the first time there was a real savagery in his voice till now he had been amusing himself by playing with me but now the real evenings business must begin hold him tight peel peel dutifully kept the canvas gripped tight i lurched suddenly attempting to break free but it was hopeless i tried again twisting and thrusting and straining but the huge man held me down with a dismissive ease he had doubtless taken on far bigger men than i in the wrestling ring i was going to die but first i must watch sunflowers downfall garrard was carefully untying the knot which held her hard against the quay there was to be no clean slash of the rope this time for doubtless a cut rope would invite suspicion instead it would look as though the rope had undone itself sunflower had toppled and i had been trapped in her canted and flooded hull for gods sake garrard i shouted i dont know what the hell this is about garrard ignored me but his bigger companion seemed genuinely concerned at my distress calm down peel patted my shoulder all this hollering wont help he sounded like a kindly parent soothing a nervous child at a dentists for christs sake the fear was like bile in my throat i was staring down deaths gullet and i was helpless i was crying and i was ashamed of crying and i was trying vainly to twist my way out of the swathing canvas calm down peel said again it wont last long do you want me to ask mr garrard for a ciggy garrard had freed the rope and now walked with it up one side of the dock out towards the river so that when he pulled he would be dragging sunflower away from the docks end wall no i shouted its all right peel seemed very worried for me are you sure you dont want a ciggy no the cry was despairing sunflower was moving it took all the strength in garrards wiry body at first he could not move the big boat but then he began to pull rhythmically and inch by inch the hull responded i heard the fenders shifting against the docks wall i was trying to protest i was half blinded by tears of rage but i could still see the masttip moving against the nights clouds no i wailed the protest the masttip moved a full foot returned then moved again and this time it did not oscillate back sunflower was teetering on the knife edge of her long keel garrard grunted strained and i saw the mast move away from me no but this time the cry was a sob i twisted to the dock edge so i could watch my boat fall sunflower fell the springs momentarily checked her fall but the weight of her steel hull was too great and i heard the cleats rip clean out of her deck she gathered speed garrard switched on his torch sunflowers chines crashed on to the edge of the grid the whole boat bounced and shook i saw the splash of water as her mast slashed down into the dock then heard the grinding and splintering as the falling hull drove the tall mast down into the docks bottom her keel was still lodged on the grid for a second i thought the whole hull would turn over but then the keel scraped free of the timbers and the steel hull crashed down into the shallow water a small tidal wave creamed white to rock the moored fishing boats the wave crashed against the docks sides then flowed back i half expected the liferaft canister to explode its pneumatic contents but the canister stayed shut as the water in the dock splashed gurgled and subsided most successful garrard said happily as he shone his torch into the dock sunflower lay on her port side half sunk in the black disturbed water her mast was torn off in a tangle of shrouds and halliards from this angle the hull looked relatively unscathed but i knew that her portside guardrails would certainly have sheared and that her scuttles were probably broken as the tide rose she would fill then be sunk what we do now garrard had walked back to where peel guarded me is to drown you my lord do i put him in the sleeping bag first peel asked he will be easier to manage when he is dead just like all the others so take him down there peel and give him a very good baptism total immersion i think garrard mockingly touched his forelock to me goodnight my lord for gods sake i had no fight left in me nothing now but an abject bowelloosening terror i really was going to die in this miserable dock and i didnt even know why for gods sake i havent done anything you inherited my lord that is what you did wrong garrard laughed he was pleased with himself and well he might be the stratagem he had devised for my death was nothing short of brilliant i could not guess what means of my murder he had planned but once he had discovered the condition of my boat he had improvised this apparent accident in the morning when rita or george found sunflower it would be assumed that i had drowned in the night because i had not tethered my boat properly and i still did not know why my death was sought except that it must be connected with the van gogh who sent you i pleaded but garrard was finished with me he pushed back his cuff to look at his watch lets get on with it peel peel hesitated not out of any sudden pity for me but because he was trying to work out how best to carry my wrapped body down the sheer dock wall to the water tie him up garrard sounded exasperated for gods sake peel use what few bloody brains youve got but i havent got any rope god spare me from employing cretins garrard strode away to find a length of rope who sent you i asked peel you know we cant tell you that are you sure you dont want a ciggy who i pleaded jesus christ this was not the answer to my question but rather a symptom of fear peel who had been pinioning me abruptly straightened up mr garrard the police he hardly needed to shout the warning for headlights were suddenly brilliant in the yard throwing a bright light on to garrard who was trying to shield his eyes a cars engine roared loudly peel when he drove the van back to the yard must have left the gate open for id heard nothing a single car accelerated into the yard garrard fled into the alley behind the warehouse i was shouting the driver of the car must have locked his handbrake for the back wheels skidded around to slash the headlights past me the car stopped peel had already abandoned me and was running for dear life into the shadows behind the workshop i rolled over and over trying to free myself of the constricting canvas i could hear peel scrambling away then i saw garrard sprinting across the yard towards the open gate stop him i shouted i freed myself of the canvas and lurched to my feet the cars lights were dazzling me now i saw a tall mans silhouette he was ignoring my attackers and instead just walked slowly towards me you should have stopped them i protested feebly bloody hell fire the man stopped a few paces from me he was still standing in the headlights full glare so all i could see of him was his shape he laughed just look at the state of you boy youre as naked as the day i found you in sally salters caravan except you were having a deal more fun that day oh my god it wasnt the police it was charlie barratt my knees began to shake i was staggering with weakness and relief and happiness and the sheer backwash of a terrible and unnerving fear oh my god hello johnny he ran forward because i was collapsing im all right i said but i wasnt its ok johnny his arms caught me held me then leaned me gently against the workshop wall oh my god my eyes were tight closed but i could still see the dark water into which in another moment id have been plunged head first i imagined the filthy cold water forcing itself down my gullet and so real was the feeling that i suddenly gagged i dropped to my knees and vomited i didnt think i had ever been so near death i was shaking shivering weeping spewing charlie fetched a rug from his car and draped it round my shoulders i was trying to apologise i felt ashamed i was crying helplessly i was shivering and crying and vomiting yet charlie crouched beside me and pushed a flask to my lips drink up johnny it was scotch i gagged on it spat then seized the flask to drink it properly im sorry i said oh god im sorry shut up you bloody fool drink and suddenly i knew everything would be all right because i had found my friend or rather he had found me and saved me part two the bastards charlie had taken a lantern from the boot of his car and in its bright light was staring down at the stranded sunflower his voice was full of disgust and shock almost it seemed to my confused mind full of a personal revulsion at what garrard had done to my boat oh god the bastards he said again then with all his old resilience he plucked optimism out of disaster but dont worry johnny well mend the boat ill have some lads and a crane here at sparrows fart well lift her out bung her on a lowloader and take her to my place well make her good as new eh i was too weak to respond i was still shivering too feeble to help as charlie swung down into the dock and fixed a line to sunflowers transom post at least we know shes not going anywhere he shouted up to me then as he climbed nimbly back to the quays top cheer up boy shell mend ive seen worse charlie hadnt changed except that he was more prosperous he still had the quick smile the same unruly hair and the same competent manner he was a big man hugely capable and scornfully dismissive of all difficulties its not the end of the world johnny he told me so get in the motor and well go home his car was a jaguar brand new with deep leather seats and a dashboard like a fighter planes i protested that i shouldnt sit on the seats in my soaking wet jeans that charlie had fished out of the dock but he didnt care seats can be cleaned you fool just get in he told me he had telephoned home the night before ive been out of touch you see but once yvonne said you were here i came like a shot im bloody lucky you did i was shivering still in shock still ashamed of being so humiliated by garrard and peel we were always lucky you and i charlie grinned at me then used his earphone to wake up his foreman he said he wanted a crane and a lowloader at cullens yard at dawn the foreman evidently did not mind being woken at the dead of night or else was used to it charlie lit each of us a cigarette my pipe was somewhere in the bottom of george cullens dock along with my passport money everything damn george for betraying me i thought i suppose charlie said that you dont want to call the police he offered me the earphone anyway but i shook my head it wasnt that i had anything to hide but after my experiences with the police four years before i didnt want anything more to do with them i just wanted to sail away nothing more then lets get the hell out of here charlie slammed his door and started the motor so what were those bastards doing to you they were going to kill me i began shivering again so i drank more of his whisky and sucked on the cigarette as we bounced out of georges yard and accelerated away there was no sign of either garrard or peel nor of their dark van tell me then charlie ordered i told him all that had happened he grunted an ominous curse when i said that it must have been george cullen who had betrayed me but he said nothing else till i told him that the murder attempt was somehow connected with the theft of the van gogh that bloody picture he said with disgust its a good painting i said defensively piss off johnny its a bloody daub isnt it charlie still had a devon accent as broad as dartmoor ive seen better flower pictures on birthday cards but those arent valued at a handful of millions twenty million to be precise that checked him jesus christ are you serious twenty million thats what ive been offered who by buzzacott he gave a low whistle i understood his incredulity charlie could understand a piece of land being worth twenty million for land could be turned into a profit but a painting he drove in silence for a few minutes then offered a scornful laugh its a load of codswallop johnny what was your mother offered four five four so its gone up five hundred per cent in four years bloody hell i should be in that business ill sell the trucks tomorrow and buy myself a paint box i tell you johnny theres more money than bloody sense in this world no painting can be worth twenty million maybe but those bastards just tried to kill me for it do they think youve got it he asked incredulously no but they seem frightened that i might get hold of it and sell it i paused thinking that nothing made sense they said that my sin was inheriting the painting bastards he offered the dismissive judgment then lit himself another cigarette he had always smoked too much but all charlies appetites were excessive one day i supposed that overindulgence would catch up with him but now in the dashboards dim light he looked incredibly fit and well he drove like a man bent on suicide but he had always been touched by outrageous good luck so i doubted hed ever kill himself at the wheel he turned on the car heater to warm me up then told me about his company i mainly subcontract plant for road construction but ill do anything with a profit ive got a couple of caravan sites in cornwall and i tarted up those three scabby cottages at the bottom of the village and sold them for a wicked sum to folks from london of course im up to my eyeballs in debt but who isnt these days im not you always were an idiot he said fondly theres no point in risking your own money when the banks want to lend it i borrowed a clean million eighteen months after you left and im still borrowing mind you my profits are bigger than the banks interest payments so what the hell we had turned into the devon lanes now and the jaguar was travelling between their narrow hedgerows like a bullet down a rifle barrel once or twice a rabbit froze in the harsh light but charlie just drove over them he was countrybred and had no sentimentality about animals do you still have the dogs i asked him of course charlie had loved hunting with his terriers that was how id first met charlie he had been eight years old i was seven and i had found him poaching my fathers land he had been teaching me tricks ever since there was a thump as another rabbit died i winced charlie frowned but not because of the rabbit i saw that your mother died cursing me he laughed she was a rancid bitch eh she never liked you that was mutual hows georgina same as ever poor maid he tutted charlie had always been kind to georgina though that kindness had never extended to my other sister he used to call elizabeth lady muck and i noticed he did not bother to ask after her now instead after a moments silence he laughed ruefully funny when you think about it what is i dont know he was silent for a moment the headlights were brilliant on the tall hedgerows sometimes as we breasted a rise the light would sweep across pastures there were no lights showing in this deep countryside though off to our west the reflection of plymouths streetlamps glowed against the clouds it was only out at sea i thought that one found real darkness absolute impenetrable black darkness everything was polluted ashore even the night charlie picked up his train of thought when i was growing up we used to look at your house and be real impressed by it when i was just a tot i used to think god lived in stowey and it was damn nearly true that was lordys house we were just his farm labourers and i dont suppose lordy even knew we existed but now look at us ive got more money than all your lot put together well done charlie he smiled and youre lordy now the villagers had always called my father lordy they had not really liked the family there were too many memories of past injustices some of the memories stretching back five centuries but in their own way they had been proud that the earl and countess of stowey lived in their community now lordy was a penniless yachtsman and the labourers son drove a jaguar and owned a house that was half the size of stowey i caught a glimpse of the big house as the jaguars headlights slashed across its façade my impression was of raw brick and broad glass charlie touched a button in the car and the triple garage doors clanked open a dog began yelping in the kennels and charlie shouted at it to be silent it isnt a bad place he said of the house as he parked the car cost me a penny or two it was four oclock in the morning but charlie made no effort to be silent he crashed into the house switching on lights and slamming doors he went to the laundry room and fetched me a pair of dry jeans and a sweater i changed in the kitchen where childrens drawings were held by magnets on the fridge door how many kids have you got now i asked him still just the two johnny and sheila johnny had been named after me despite charlies wife who didnt like me sheila was named for charlies mother yvonne i reflected did not have much say in how this family was run charlie scooped ice out of the freezer and filled two glasses even when wed been teenagers he had liked to take his drinks american fashion that for charlie was the height of sophistication and he hadnt changed he grinned as i jettisoned the ice from my glass then he filled it to the brim with single malt scotch cheers johnny cheers charlie it was good to be home we touched glasses then drank somewhere upstairs a child cried and i heard footsteps as yvonne went to soothe it she must have heard charlies arrival but she did not come down come on johnny lets have a proper chat charlie led me into a wide drawing room before he switched on the lights i saw that the windows looked across sloping pastures to one of salcombes lakes then the view was obliterated by the glare of electric lights he put the whisky bottle on the table sat me down in a leather armchair then insisted on hearing the whole story of my night once more ive told you once i protested but i want to hear it again johnny so i told him again and still nothing made sense i woke at midday the sun was streaming past yellow curtains a thermos of coffee a jug of orange juice and a packet of cigarettes lay on the bedside table my jeans newly washed and ironed were folded on a chair with a clean shirt a radio was playing somewhere in the house i washed shaved with a razor that had been laid out for me in the bathroom then went down to the kitchen yvonne was topping and tailing a bowl of string beans she was a tall thin woman with long dark hair and very pale skin she had grown up in stoweys village and had been the prettiest girl there when charlie married her she was still attractive but now her frail beauty was sullied by an air of brittle nervousness she wasnt glad to see me in trouble again johnny she sounded awkward calling me jonnny but charlie and i had long cured her natural urge to address me as my lord the troubles not of my making yvonne it never is is it you want coffee ive got some i lifted the mug which id filled from the thermos upstairs nice house yvonne he likes it he built it she said it dismissively you dont like it i liked living in the village i miss my friends she tipped the vegetable scraps down the sink then turned on the waste disposer while the machine ground away she stared through the wide window at the far yachts on the distant water he likes it though she said when the machine had stopped its din then with a wry look at me he likes to show off his money you see why shouldnt he its the banks money not ours she sniffed i suppose youll be staying here for a few days now i hadnt thought about it you will if he wants you to what he wants he gets youre supposed to join him now where in the yard its on the exeter road you cant miss it its got his name plastered all over it he says to take the jeep the jeep was a powerful japanese fourbyfour what charlie would call a proper piece of kit i drove it to the exeter road where in charlies vast yard sunflower was standing on the bed of a lowloader shed been expertly cradled in timber it was obvious that someone had worked very fast and very skilfully that morning i couldnt get to sleep charlie greeted me from her cockpit so i went over to georges and knocked up the cradle myself a proper job eh he congratulated himself on his own carpentry then tossed me down a lit cigarette youre looking better im feeling better i climbed the ladder propped against sunflowers starboard flank jesus i swore bitterly sunflowers portside guardrail stanchions were stove in the mast was nothing but a stump and as the mast had buckled and broken it had lifted the coachroof out of true the starboard cleats had ripped from the teakplanked steel deck leaving twofoot holes edged with jagged splinters the deck was thick with filth the liferaft must have been triggered into action after charlie and i had left for it had inflated itself and now torn and cut by the crane wires lay bedraggled and wet over the foredeck i stepped down into the cabin which stank of filthy river water everything was waterlogged in the forepeak the tool drawers had splintered open i found my pipe passport and money and carried them back topsides the boathooks were missing the danbuoys had gone almost anything which had not been shackled to the deck had dropped or floated away the boat was a mess a tragic mess what damage charlie asked cheerfully its nothing ill have the cabin dried out by tomorrow then well put some chippies in to repair the joinery ill shotblast your hull properly instead of the dogs mess you were making of it paint her up and well rig a new mast in a couple of weeks your sails are already drying in my paint shop i cant afford a new mast i said bitterly you probably cant afford to buy my dinner either but we wont go hungry come on you bastard cheer up charlie im serious i cant afford it he paused at the head of the ladder whats friendship for if it cant help out a mate eh dont be daft johnny you wont have to pay ive already ordered your bloody mast now come on im hungry as hell we drove to a pub where the barmaids greeted charlie with a kiss he knew everyone and had a word for all of them he gladhanded the bar like a politician on the make but then took me to a secluded corner where we could talk in peace i told them to make us a proper steak and kidney pie he said as he sat down you could do with some decent food sounds good and no salad he drank half his pint yvonne eats nothing but bloody salad she read this article about diet in one of her womens magazines jesus wept im married to a rabbit she told me i should give up the beer and the beef like hell i said i told her i expected a proper meal on my table and by god shed better provide it i smiled youve got a happy marriage charlie you know how it is johnny he lit a cigarette theyre never happy are they you can give them the world and theyll still find something to bitch about but yvonnes all right he made the concession grudgingly shes a good mother anyway not that im home much business what were you doing in hertfordshire he touched a sly finger to the side of his nose wasnt actually in hertfordshire johnny more like bedfordshire he laughed then changed the subject i had a chat with george cullen this morning i hope you thumped the bastard rotten he says he never told a soul where you were i think he meant it too he was upset about it i wasnt convinced of course he told them he knew who those men were he even told me as much i know he told me the same charlie thickly smeared a bread roll with butter but i dont think george did tell them i think they just found you after all it isnt difficult to find a boat on the devon coast how long can it take to search plymouth the yealm salcombe dartmouth torquay and the exe not long mate not long at all i think you were just unlucky i want to make them unlucky i said with impotent bitterness and i want to know what bastard sent them to kill me and why he leaned back and frowned at me do you really it was an odd question asked in a strangely quizzical tone they tried to kill me i said in outraged explanation and i want to know who sent them till the day before i hadnt cared about the painting or its fate or about the people who pursued the canvas but my humiliation in the night had set up an atavistic desire for revenge we fell silent as the steak and kidney pie arrived charlie fetched two more pints then ladled pie potatoes peas and gravy on to my plate what i mean he said is do you want anything more to do with that bloody painting not with the painting no then bugger off sail away he pointed his knife at me because so long as youre here theyll chase you i was staring through the window elizabeth i said softly what about her if im dead i said then therell be no legal complications about the paintings ownership and garrard told me my sin was inheriting the painting thats it charlie dont you see then my voice tailed away i was suggesting that elizabeth wanted me dead so she could inherit the painting but even as the explanation had convinced me so i found it impossible to believe that my twin sister would do such a thing for christs sake charlie protested in disgust the paintings long gone johnny its in some texas vault or swiss strongroom is it i wondered aloud then answered my own question i suppose it is yes of course it is charlie said with sturdy good sense so sail away and forget the bloody thing but eat your pie first i leaned back ive just discovered something about myself you dont like steak and kidney pie i get pissed off when people try to kill me he laid down his knife and fork listen johnny if its any help ill put the word out on garrard ill find him for you and ill skin him alive but dont you hang about waiting for the chop go back to sea it was good advice but i was still suffering from the shameful memory of the previous night garrard said he was making sure i never got possession of the painting that suggests the thing is still around somewhere charlie of course it isnt around use your loaf johnny it must have been flogged off four years ago garrards probably got his knickers in a twist nothing else but i promise you ill find him and ill discover who wound him up you bugger off back to sea ill help you find him no he spoke very firmly you dont need the trouble johnny leave it to experts i smiled youre an expert enough of one he said it grimly you dont need the aggravation johnny all you need is to go back to sea i also need some transport transport he sounded suspicious some wheels charlie for a girl he understood that reason well enough he laughed who is she just a girl i was thinking of a competent girl with dark hair and a quick temper a girl with an italian name the trouble is i said that shes a good distance away and youve got the itch no problem charlie spread his hands in a gesture suggesting that all my difficulties could be solved by his munificence take the jeep go and chase her you dont mind youre my friend whats mine is yours and whats yours i wouldnt touch with a bloody bargepole now eat your pie i ate the pie comerton castle sir leon buzzacotts country house was neither a castle nor a house it was a lateeighteenthcentury monstrosity a mansion built to display wealth rather than to be a home pillared porticoed winged domed spired lavish and vast comerton had once belonged to a ducal family but just as they had to my own family the taxmen had flensed away until the house had to be sold buzzacott had purchased it ten years before i wondered what he did with all the rooms reputedly a room for every day of the year not that i would find out for my business did not lie in the main house but in the great orangery that was built beside the garden terraces beneath the south front the orangery alone was the size of stowey it was a long singlestoreyed building stuccoed white that had once been a glasshouse summer house and arcadian retreat for the duke and his guests now at astronomical expense sir leon had transformed it into an art gallery many people had criticised the gallery claiming it was too far from any large city and that it was an elitist exercise aimed solely at gaining sir leon the coveted peerage he desired and maybe they were right at least in the first criticism for there was only a handful of cars in the huge car park i paid my pound at the door a moving ramp led to the gallery floor which had been excavated twenty feet below the original ground level the job had been done without disturbing any of the orangerys masonry the air below the ground was conditioned to a consistent coolness and humidity automatic louvres controlled the sunlight entering the glass domes and tall casements which now that the floor had been lowered served as clerestory windows i hadnt asked for jennifer pallavicini at the entrance desk i first wanted to see this rich mans fantasy for myself sir leons critics snidely called him britains secondrate john paul getty it would have been better they said if he had donated his collection to one of the big london galleries they said his museum was a white elephant a monstrous underground irrelevance yet in truth it was magnificent id seen photographs of the galleries and i had read the newspaper accounts of their extraordinary construction but i had never visited so i had never experienced the uncanny sense of peace in the subterranean halls that quietness had earned accusations that sir leon was making a shrine to art when according to modern london thinking art should be an integral part of everyday life meaning i suppose that if someone wanted to slash a rubens to shreds then the act should be seen as necessarily therapeutic as well as a valid criticism for my money these paintings were well away from london the collection was not big sir leon had bought selectively but what he had bought was of the very finest the scarcity of paintings made it possible to hang each to its best advantage instead of crowding jumbled swathes of pictures along a wall each canvas was positioned within its own private area sometimes when juxtaposition would help explain a paintings provenance it would be displayed with others but most of the paintings hung in solitary splendour they hung on the outer walls of the gallery protected by a dry moat visitors walked to a small balcony which faced each painting there were no attendants visible in the gallery which added to the quality of privacy and peace the corridors leading to each balcony contained displays which explained the context and importance of the painting beyond the deep moat the corridors led from the gallerys central spine down which an endless walkway silently moved everything had been done to the highest quality and with exquisite taste it would i thought be a fitting home for stoweys van gogh there was already one van gogh in the collection it was a drawing done with black chalk and showed a woman digging in a bleak field the notes in the corridor frankly said it was not the finest of van goghs drawings but that it was included in the exhibition because for the moment sir leon owned no other works by the artist its an early work jennifer pallavicinis sudden voice startled me he did it in its rather clumsy is it i turned to face her she herself looked anything but clumsy instead she was chillingly pretty she was wearing a simple cream skirt and a striped silk blouse she looked crisp cool competent and distinctly unfriendly its selfconscious she was looking at the drawing rather than at me when we get a suitable painting by van gogh well hang this in sir leons private quarters what are you doing here i came to see you the brown eyes gaze flicked towards me we feared youd come to steal another van gogh mr rossendale i ignored the jibe how did you know i was here she gestured upwards and i saw how television cameras were monitoring every balcony so far she said we havent had any fools trying to throw paint or worse at a canvas but you can never tell we keep a constant watch why did you want to see me those two men i said then faltered for her gaze was so disapproving and so offputting that i felt gauche i do remember them she said icily they tried to murder me two days ago and evidently failed she leaned on the balcony her back to the drawing did you come here for sympathy do we have to talk here i asked i had suddenly found the quietness oppressive the barely audible hiss of the hidden airconditioners seemed somehow threatening she shrugged then without saying anything walked back through the corridor i followed her we crossed the slowmoving walkway to a door which she opened with a key she led me up a whitepainted stair through another door and so into a small formal garden i walked silently beside her down the gravel path round an ornately sculpted fountain to a stone balustrade that looked out on the wiltshire countryside a tractor was harrowing a far field but otherwise nothing moved well she asked i dont like people trying to murder me i said and immediately thought how lame it sounded i imagine thats understandable i didnt much like it when that man molested me it was the most sympathetic thing shed said to me so far and it gave me encouragement they attacked you i said and now theyve attacked me i just thought that together we might find some reason for what theyre doing isnt that a job for the police she challenged me i half smiled you went to the police she hesitated then shook her head what happened in salcombe was trivial it certainly wasnt attempted murder i have to be flattered that you think i might be able to help but i suggest you should approach the real experts the police i leaned on the mossy stone balustrade if i went to the police id have to tell them what happened in salcombe theyll want to talk to you i have nothing to hide mr rossendale nor do i i spoke with sudden vehemence you dont seem to understand no one does i did not steal that painting i had nothing to do with its theft yet everyone you included seems convinced i did steal it why on earth would i want to steal it the usual theory mr rossendale is that you did it to spite your mother you hated her did you not i hesitated i didnt hate her i just disliked her so the theory is partially correct to that we add all the other evidence and you must agree that you remain the likeliest suspect for gods sake that evidence was all circumstantial she let that protest die away on the summers air then began a remorseless cataloguing of the evidence a week before the painting was to be transported you removed it from your mothers room she asked me to she didnt want to be constantly reminded that it was leaving stowey you claim to have stored it in the gun room to which only you had a key rubbish there were a dozen keys my sister had a key half the servants had keys not according to the police the painting was in your charge mr rossendale your fingerprints were the only ones found on the doors lockplate and you told your mother that you had hidden the painting away and told no one its exact whereabouts her voice was biting with disbelief and scorn yet on the morning of the removal it wasnt there its a perfect mystery isnt it a locked room undisturbed alarms and a missing painting i suppose youll tell me that dozens of people knew how to disable the alarm system one or two knew i said feebly and where were you the next day when everyone else was desperately trying to help the police you were sailing across the channel no doubt carrying the painting with you but of course no one suspected you that day why should they you were the earl of stowey the apparent victim of the crime but since then my lord your protestations of innocence have worn a little thin isnt it a fact that every guilty man protests his innocence and does so as vehemently as you are now but why on earth would i steal from myself i challenged her with the obvious defence clearly from your dislike of your mother so long as she was alive she shared control of the stowey trust with you and doubtless she would have spent the proceeds of the painting in ways you did not like she was so damnably cool most of the evidence she had adduced was true but it was still circumstantial or coincidental i hadnt stolen the sunflowers i closed my eyes wondering how i could convince her please listen i said i opened my eyes to see her level judgmental gaze on me those two men came to kill me im trying to find out why they did it because truly i dont understand they said they wanted to prevent me from getting hold of the painting but i cant do that because i dont know where it is she laughed scornfully at my protestation of ignorance i can quite imagine why they should want you dead for gods sake why she hesitated then evidently decided to speak her brutal version of the truth its obvious isnt it its four years since the painting was stolen and in those four years weve heard nothing there hasnt been a whisper weve been listening mr rossendale because there are art dealers who know about stolen paintings and weve been paying them to pass on any rumour they might hear but in four years nothing now suddenly theres a flurry of activity a man questions me brutally the same man allegedly tries to kill you and what has changed two things mr rossendale first your mother has died and secondly you have come home doesnt that suggest something not to me oh come she protested at what she perceived as my intransigence if the painting had been recovered while your mother was alive she would have shared in the proceeds of its legitimate sale now under the terms of the stowey trust you are the sole beneficial owner clearly it is now in your strong interest to retrieve the painting and place it on the open market jesus wept i said in frustrated anger at her glib assumption of my guilt it isnt my place to speculate jennifer said but proceeded to do so anyway but i would imagine that the two men are working for whoever you sold the painting to that person clearly does not want you to betray his possession of stolen goods so is taking care to silence you doubtless you sold it four years ago for a derisory sum or else you would not need to reclaim it now its a classic case of thieves falling out and its all rather sordid and i find it more than a little insulting that you should see fit to involve me in your attempts to avoid trouble im not a thief i said in hopeless protest so you say but you should know that sir leon considers your guilt or innocence entirely irrelevant if you can give us any information that will lead to the van goghs recovery then youll be well rewarded as well as handsomely paid for the painting itself i dont give a monkeys toss about sir leons reward i said brutally but i do give a damn about people who try to have me killed thats just masculine pride she said scornfully no one ever accused you of humility you know nothing about me i said angrily she smiled i know a great deal about you my lord she made the honorific sound like an insult weve spent four years searching for that painting and our starting point and our ending point is always you so my lord i am somewhat of an expert on your grubby life you were expelled from three public schools youve been arrested four times just drunk and disorderlies i protested nothing else anyone can get pissed one charge of grievous bodily harm she insisted icily you served two months in a tasmanian jail for that she had done her homework no one had ever known that it had been the twentyeighth earl of stowey in that jail but she had somehow discovered it mind you the bastard i had knifed had been pleading for trouble but i didnt think jennifer pallavicini would be amenable to that excuse it was all a long time ago i said feebly youre a very destructive man she ignored my plea of mitigation in previous times my lord youd have been sent to a forgotten corner of the empire as a remittance man doubtless your family was very relieved when you and your friend decided to sail away oh i know about mr barratt too what was his attraction for you was it simply that your family hated his influence on you so naturally you flaunted him in front of them no i said hes a friend but hes settled down which must leave you friendless and doubtless not a little short of cash as well is that why youre here my lord do you want some money to hire your own thugs wholl protect you while you doublecross your former accomplices her tone was deliberately offensive but i did not answer i had been staring at the green pastures at the slow tractor and at the long hedgerows which were bright with stitchwort and campion i was suddenly assailed by the strangest notion that i didnt want to go away again i wanted to stay id had my adventures and it was time to put down some roots id seen the ending of the seagypsies id seen them dying of fevers and the pox id seen them selling their bodies in lousy little towns id seen them crawling home in boats that were lashed together with fraying coir and untarred manila and i suddenly felt lonely i disliked the feeling i forgot it as i made one last attempt to convince jennifer pallavicini of my innocence do you really think i said that if id stolen the painting id rock the boat now if id sold it to someone and was now trying to get it back id probably end up in jail myself why should i risk that because doubtless you dont believe that you are in risk of a jail sentence she pushed herself away from the balustrade do you know where the painting is of course i dont ive already told you that did you steal it no can you tell me anything that might help us to recover it beyond what ive told you no then i fail to see how you can help us youll find the car park is through that gate good day to you my lord she walked away wheres my sweater i called after her she did not turn round but just waved in negligent reply it was just possible i thought that she raised two fingers as she waved she was very beautiful and i was very wretched so go back to sea i told myself where nothing matters except the wind and the waters and the cold high stars because here on land i was everybodys scapegoat but there i was as good as the next man and better than most and it was there despite my sudden wish to stay ashore that i belonged so it was there that i would have to go charlie was sharpening his chisels when i got back to his yard whats got up your nose he asked i told him about my visit to buzzacotts gallery and how the girl i had been chasing worked for buzzacott charlie was scornful of my amateur sleuthing youre a berk johnny a prize berk he stropped a blade on his palm and gave me a longsuffering smile you should know better than to get involved i offered to help her find the painting i explained what painting its gone johnny if you miss it buy yourself a tin of yellow emulsion and paint another he tested the newly sharpened chisel by slicing away a sliver of his thumbnail then satisfied dropped the blade into his toolbox i made you a new chart table say thank you thank you i said behind us sunflower was shrouded in a canvas tent ready for the professional shotblasters who were coming the next day i hated to think what the work was going to cost and said as much thats my problem charlie said ive told you ill pay and i will you did enough for me in the old days so you dont need to feel embarrassed now yet i was embarrassed because charlie was clearly spending a small fortune on sunflowers repair but as the days passed i also saw how much pleasure he was taking from the work id forgotten how much fun you can have in getting a boat ready for sea he told me more than once he threw himself enthusiastically at the task so enthusiastically that it seemed at times as if sunflower was his boat and not mine whatever she needed he was determined to supply but only the very best he would leave the house at dawn drive down to the yard and start work he found rust under the transducer plugs so nothing would serve but that the fittings were drilled out of the hull and new steel fairings made for the depthsounder and pitot log heads charlie welded the new fairings into place himself and afterwards in his old fashion congratulated himself on a welldone piece of work proper job that in the next busy days there were dozens of proper jobs performed on sunflower her shotblasted hull was antifouled and above the blue bootline painted a dazzling white her liferaft was sent away to be repaired and restowed in its canister the guardrail stanchions were replaced and new lifelines rigged from bow to stern her cabin joinery was repaired with a lovely pale oak but not before charlie had rewired the whole boat i needed a holiday he told me when i wondered how his business was managing without him though in fact sunflower simply became charlies temporary office he had a cordless telephone in his tool box and if a problem would not yield to bullying on the phone he would drop down from sunflowers gunwales and stride across to his real office i was grateful for his continual presence just to be with charlie gave me a sense of being physically protected from garrard and peel while working with him brought back memories of happy days the biggest difference between our old days and these new ones was the amount of money we now lavished on sunflower a new vhf radio was installed one that was pretuned to all the american and european frequencies charlie wasnt content with such a lavish toy but insisted on installing a shortwave radio as well so you can listen to all those posh voices on the bbc he patted the panel which hed made to house the twin radios proper job that i had to dig my heels in and refuse some of his suggestions i was tempted by a satnav set which snatched position reports from passing satellites but i have a fear of too many electronic toys on a boat so i wouldnt let him buy one he had a decca set which he claimed to have taken off one of his old boats and which he insisted on installing over sunflowers chart table i couldnt refuse the gift but as decca will only give positions in a limited number of waters i did not fear that i would become too used to its electronic magic and forget how to use a sextant charlie wanted me to have a radar set but i adamantly refused they drain too much electricity and their aerials look too ugly i won that battle but charlie won others he insisted that the new mast should have an electronic wind direction and speed vane which would display on twin dials in the cockpit and above the chart table he made new chart drawers and filled them with brand new charts he took a small boys pleasure in surprising me with new purchases danbuoys for the stern a radio direction finder a stripper for the propeller a sun awning for the hot latitudes and bright red canvas dodgers with sunflowers name sewn large in brilliant yellow letters best of all he bought me a new fibreglass tender with a small outboard you can burn that scabby inflatable he said it all cost money so much money embarrassing amounts of money i tackled charlie about the cost but he simply dismissed my embarrassment im enjoying it johnny thats all that matters you must let me pay you back what with bottle tops he grinned wed been working till well past nine oclock and had driven over to the rossendale arms for a goodnight pint some hotel guests from stowey sat at the bar and sneaked surreptitious looks at me the landlord had probably told them they were staying in my ancestral home but i could see from their faces that they werent sure whether to believe that the paintstained scruff truly was a belted earl what is sunflower costing you i pressed charlie im not counting he leaned back on the settle and stretched his long arms im enjoying myself johnny its been too long since i did a proper job i spend too much of my time on the bloody phone these days or in the office i like working with these he held out his hands big and scarred besides its a way of making up to you making up to me i said with astonishment fetch me a pint and ill tell you i fetched two pints that was something id miss i thought the good taste of proper ale instead of the gassy pissweak lager that the germans had persuaded the rest of the world to drink charlie lit himself a cigarette i always felt guilty about deserting you he said in explanation dont be ridiculous its true he was entirely serious when we flew back from australia i was really looking forward to going back to sea we had some good times you and i but then i got yvonne pregnant so like a fool i did the decent thing he was speaking of the time after my brothers suicide four years before it had been a bad time for me trammelled with accountants lawyers and bank managers i had thought then that i would be trapped by all those responsibilities and though charlie and i had often talked of going back to sea i had never been certain that it would be possible i used to escape stoweys hopelessness by delivering yachts in the channel but i had doubted whether i could ever afford to sail far oceans again stoweys problems were too comprehensive for such luxuries charlie felt guilty that he had abandoned me but he had never known that i had been considering abandoning him i confessed as much to him now but charlie shook his head dismissively of course you were going back to sea i knew that you were never going to stay with all those pinstriped wankers for longer than you had to he laughed could you see yourself living with your mother i smiled no there you are then but i should have gone with you johnny i really should no regrets surely ive made some money i suppose he sounded rueful he looked at his watch weve got an early start in the morning you and i so drink up a week later sunflower was taken to kingswear where she was craned into the water next day charlie and i drove to the marina where one of his mobile cranes was parked on the quay lower it now charlie took competent command as soon as he stepped out of the jaguars driving seat he shouted up at his crane driver you take care tom gentle with her now we were stepping sunflowers mast a brand new foilshaped beauty of extruded aluminium charlie had paid for it of course just as he had paid to have all the sails cleaned and a new trysail made he insisted on glueing a silver sixpence under the masts foot for luck but after that ritual he was content to let the riggers get on with their job while he and i moved to the greater comfort of barratry barratry was charlies boat a few days earlier in anticipation of these days on the river dart he had moved her to the kingswear marina she was a fiftyfourfoot motor cruiser with a flying bridge twin monster diesels and the hot tub which had so impressed rita her name was a pun on charlies surname but the word also meant any fraudulent maritime act to charlie it carried overtones of piracy which he liked mind you id have preferred to call her wet dream charlie laughed but none of the girls liked it at midday one of those girls arrived on barratrys pontoon charlie introduced her as a business colleague but offered me a broad wink at the same time her name was joanna and she was ordered to make lunch on board a proper dinner mind you charlie warned her no bloody salads girl johnny heres going to sail to the west indies in a few days so he needs feeding up joanna was a redhead lithe as a whippet in skintight jeans and an expensive shirt she seemed not to resent charlies unbridled caveman chauvinism but charlie had always treated his women thus it worked for him we ate lunch on barratry while the three riggers tensioned sunflowers stays and shrouds joanna had carved two cold roasted chickens one was solely for charlie who though he had the appetite of a horse never seemed to put on an ounce of fat are you really going to the west indies joanna had picked at a chicken wing and now painted her fingernails while we ate probably in truth i was too late for a good tradewind passage but i might yet make the crossing before the hurricane season ill go south first then make up my mind when will you leave as soon as hes provisioned charlie answered for me and no difficulties there eh johnny charlie had opened accounts for me at a halfdozen dartmouth stores whatever i or sunflower needed we were to have food equipment clothing anything where will you go in the west indies joanna persisted probably one of the french islands the foods better and the girls charlie was in high spirits the sun was out he was well fed and joanna had changed into a wispy bikini ive got half a mind to fly over there and join you he said we could have some good sailing eh do you still remember how to sail i teased him my god charlie to think youve bought a motor boat its less trouble than raghanging he shrugged mind you i miss the sailing sometimes but theres a lot to be said for a good motor yacht tell me one thing the beds are wider he grinned despite his professed nostalgia for sail he was clearly proud of barratry shes a good sea boat he claimed with a fervour that made me suspect it wasnt true he gave me the guided tour proudly showing me her radar system the twin state rooms with their kingsize beds and television sets the immaculate engine room and finally the famous hot tub i hardly ever take the damn things cover off he said apologetically because its a bugger to fill up and theres hardly room for two in it but the bloody salesman sold me on it after lunch we fired up the motors and took barratry out into the channel it was a warm bright day and charlie opened up the throttles so that the twin propellers whipped a path of cream across a sunglittering sea the boat banged across the small waves jarring from crest to crest but despite the discomfort it was still an impressive display of power whats her top speed i shouted ive had thirtyeight knots out of her he throttled back letting the hull settle into the water we were already out of sight of land but the decca repeater on the flying bridge offered us a course straight back to dartmouth charlie let the big boat idle while he opened two bottles of beer joanna came out of the cabin beneath us and went to the foredeck where she casually discarded her bikini top before stretching out on deck not a bad looker eh charlie wanted my approval every boat should have one i agreed she works for a construction firm i do a fair bit of work for she tells me how much to tender and if her boss wonders why shes got the money to buy a bmw then hes got too much sense to ask i might bend the rules a bit johnny but i provide a damned good service hey joanna we cant see you properly come closer get lost charlie he laughed he looked immensely happy he sat on the helmsmans chair stripped to the waist and i could see that he was as muscled as ever he had always been tough with immense stamina and monetary success had not softened him his skin was flecked with welding burns and scars making him look as strong and battered as one of his beloved handtools but in the days id worked with him on sunflower id seen a new wariness in his eyes some of charlies toughness had become mental and i guessed he was now a ruthless man to do business with but i was an old friend so the ruthlessness was never turned on me i might just do that you know he said suddenly you might do what fly over to the west indies ill need a break soon and i could take a week or two with you well drink some whisky find some women sail some blue water sounds good charlie like old times he had taken his eyes off joanna and was staring moodily at the southern horizon my god but things have changed do you remember our first boat it had been a fifteenfoot clinkerbuilt wooden dinghy with a gaffed main and a pocketsized jib charlie laughed suddenly you remember those two scrubbers we picked up in cherbourg bloody hell but i thought wed have to push them overboard to get rid of them i smiled i remember their boyfriends chasing us we saw them off though didnt we or rather charlie had seen them off id helped but charlies strength was awesome wed been eighteen then cocksure and cockfree lords of the channel wed crossed in the dinghy to france on a night as cold as charity and wed been ready for mayhem when we arrived in cherbourg it was a good weekend i said we had lots of them my friend lots of them he lit a cigarette and we had some bad ones too do you remember the food poisoning charlie had nearly died after eating some fish wed caught off the reefs in french polynesia id nursed him back to health but it had been a close thing he grimaced i havent eaten fish since you remember the tasman sea i asked that had been another bad time a bitter shipkilling storm which had threatened to overwhelm us but charlies extraordinary stamina had seen us through i had been at breaking point past it in truth but charlie had sung his way through he smiled at the memory but didnt comment instead he shook his head wistfully i do envy you johnny i cant think why of course you can he lightly punched my upper arm free as a bird arent you no kids no wife no accountant just walltowall joannas wherever you go not always charlie but enough eh he asked seriously enough i reassured him youre a lucky bastard meaning youre not i gestured at the nearnaked joanna on the foredeck responsibilities he said darkly he tossed his empty beer bottle overboard and lit a cigarette i dont know johnny i like making money but the more youve got the more the bastards try to take it away from you so the more you have to work to hang on to it i work bloody hard now and its beginning to interfere with my pleasures but when you and i sailed together it seemed to be nothing but beer and bare bodies thats because i was doing all the work he laughed a mile off barratrys port beam a big ketch was closehauled on a course for france she looked like a proper boat one that could take the blue water and charlie watched her wistfully if i could make two million tomorrow johnny id jack it all in id follow you i smiled it doesnt take two million charlie but it does johnny it does i have to settle with the banks you see and i cant just abandon yvonne and the kids ill have to leave them with some money but if i had two million now id pay the debts sell the company and never work again in five years time i might just be ready to do it but now now id need two big ones to be really safe he opened another bottle of beer those two blokes johnny theyve scarpered the change of subject was so abrupt that for a few seconds i couldnt think what he was talking about in the last few days i had become so absorbed in sunflowers repairs that i had almost forgotten garrard and peel how do you know i asked because ive been pulling in favours johnny asking questions but no one knows where they are mind you on the principle that most shit ends up in a cesspit its likely that theyve gone to london but ive put the word around that if they show their scabby faces in devon again ill bury them he punched me lightly on the arm forget em johnny just worry about getting back to sea which was all i was worrying about now the memory of that bad night in cullens yard was fading at first id wanted to find garrard and repay him but id been humiliated when i went to ask jennifer pallavicini for help so now they could all get on without me charlie joanna sat up on the foredeck put some lotion on my back will you he winked at me offered me the wheel then went forward he stayed with joanna evidently lotioning more than her back while i climbed to the lower wheelhouse where i hunched down so that i couldnt see what was happening i was suddenly jealous i supposed that my mistake had been to come home till that moment when i had plunged through the broken water of salcombes bar i had been a happy man now suddenly inexplicably i was frustrated one part of me did not want to go back to sea it was not that i would ever abandon sailing so long as i lived i would need blue seas at my boats cutwater but i wanted something else now i wanted a place to come home to i wanted someone but there was no place and no one i was unwanted except by my sister georgina and she was mad so i would go back to nowhere because for me there was nothing else i sailed a week later id provisioned in dartmouth but before leaving england i sailed round the corner into salcombe to say goodbye to charlie i moored alongside barratry off frogmore creek and charlie brought yvonne and the children out to the boats he also brought two bottles of champagne one of which we broke over sunflowers bow fairlead and the other we drank charlie insisted his children both took a glass even the twoyearold yvonne seemed determined to disguise her dislike of me and to enjoy herself or perhaps she was just glad that i was sailing out of her life again shed brought a picnic of cake and sandwiches and made tea in barratrys galley charlie filled the hot tub on the bows and let the children splash around as we talked about old times we laughed at the memories of charlies poaching expeditions and yvonne shyly recalled how hed once stolen my fathers bentley and parked it outside the house of a notorious local whore it was a happy afternoon and i was glad for i didnt like to think of charlie and yvonne embittered they all went ashore at teatime i held charlie back before he joined yvonne and the children in his dinghy i want to say thank you charlie for nothing he was embarrassed he glanced round to make sure yvonne was well out of earshot ill see you in the caribbean right right maybe ill bring joanna unless you tell me theres a surplus of crumpet over there i smiled there always is charlie he punched me on the arm see you johnny be good charlie he paused then roughly embraced me youre a lucky bugger he said then he climbed over the guardrails and dropped into his dinghys stern his outboard coughed into life as i untied the painter charlie waved then steered away the tide was on the turn about to ebb and i was alone again i was provisioned i had filled in the customs form i was ready i had one port to visit then i would be free there didnt seem any purpose to be served by waiting so i pulled my new rigid tender aboard and stowed it aft of the liferaft on the coachroof i opened the motors seacock gave the sterngland a turn of grease then started the engine the wind was coming dead from the harbour entrance so id need to motor out to sea once at sea there would be no hurry ever again so id let the sails do the work i cast off the lines which held me to barratry pulled in the fenders then turned sunflowers bows to the wind and let the motor idle as i hoisted the big main i let her drift on the slack water as i hoisted the foresails the red ensign battered from a hundred foreign gales lifted at the stern i turned to stare ashore but charlies dinghy was already lost among a host of other little craft there was no one to bid me farewell i put the throttle forward id been home just over a month my mother had died my sister had spurned me two men had tried to kill me and now i was leaving i should have felt some regret but i didnt neither regret nor sadness just the excitement of another voyage beginning and when i felt that small familiar excitement i knew that the selfpitying disease that had made me want to stay ashore was gone i was cured my spirits rose as the boat gathered speed the engine thudded happily the sails sheeted in tight flapped desultorily and the compass shivered on its lubber line i turned due south at the fairway and let the wind belly the sails i throttled back allowing the wind to share the engines load there was a shudder in the sea as we crossed the bar then the bows dipped to the first real wave and a shred of white foam spattered back on to sunflowers gunwales the tide was beginning to help me so i leaned down and cut the motor silencing my world to everything except the noises of water and sails and ropes sunflower heeled to the wind and the tiller stiffened in my hand it was a good wind a skirtlifting force five or six just enough to break some water across our bows i could feel the raw and lovely power in sunflowers big sails now she was hissing in the water smashing the waves creaming them back driving through a fivefoot swell like a thoroughbred the wind was more westerly than south a perfect wind to cross the channel i had to keep an appointment in jersey before i left home waters then i would be gone to the wild seas just one more duty then id be running alone and the bastards couldnt touch me ever again because once more i would be alone and lost and free they called it a convent hospital but in truth it was just a big victorian house that stood on the heights near la corbiere point the sisters and their patients enjoyed six acres of land that fell steeply towards the sea i left sunflower in the st helier marina and rented a bike that i pedalled along the islands southern shore shell be glad to see you so she will sister felicity limped beside me down a path which twisted between laurels and rose bushes i had tried to persuade her not to walk with me for she looked desperately tired and old but she had insisted on coming im not so old that i cant lean on an old friends arm she told me and when i heard you were coming johnny i promised myself id have a day out of bed and how are you i still seem to be getting into trouble nanny i dont try but it comes all the same its your irish blood johnny but i have faith in you so i do one day youll take responsibility for someone and thats the day youll settle down sister felicity was pure irish she had once been our familys nanny at stowey but after we had all left the nursery she had gone to take the veil her fondness for and familiarity with georgina had made this pleasant house an obvious refuge for my younger sister mind you sister felicity went on its past time you did settle down you cant gallivant for ever why ever not she paused to take breath i was worried for her health but she was more worried about me you should have children johnny what will happen to the earldom if you dont make an heir the earldoms gone nanny i said bleakly it disappeared with the house were nothing now were just a tired old family that has squabbled its life away in a few years well all be gone and no one will even remember us youre so full of it your eyes are brown she smiled at her own coarseness as a child as now as a man i loved this woman far more than my real mother felicity had no guile just a heart of pure affection now unwell she held my arm tightly as we began to walk again im sorry i couldnt cross to england for your mothers funeral she told me it wasnt one of my well days i wondered if she ever had well days any more you should rest nanny ah the lord will give me rest in due time but i wept for your mother poor thing i didnt i confessed brutally i havent even requested a mass for her you should johnny she was never good to you but she gave you life for all that and she accused me of stealing her painting who cares about a painting she stopped where the steps turned towards the sea and we could see a small sun terrace where three patients and a nun sat on wroughtiron chairs and there the dear thing is felicity said you go on alone johnny im not sure i can manage the last steps the dear thing was the lady georgina rossendale but i did not go straight down to her preferring to stay a few more seconds with sister felicity is everything all right here nanny with gods blessing it will be the diocese is always talking about selling the house and i could see why theyd want to because it must be worth a wee fortune but so far thank god they havent done it but if they do johnny well just pick up our skirts and find somewhere else dont you worry yourself and georgina on her good days she misses stowey felicity made a small gesture of resignation not that she has many good days but when she does i sometimes think her understanding is just beneath the surface like a bubble that only needs a little nudge if its going to burst but then she falls away again poor thing but shes never any trouble never at all shell be glad to see you i went down to the terrace but it was not one of georginas good days at first i was not even sure that she recognised me she was placid smiling softly and gentle i told her about sunflower and perhaps she understood some of what i said for she pointed out to sea where a slew of yachts were catching the tide before turning north towards guernsey lunch was brought to the terrace on trays and i gently fed georgina and mopped up her spills i left her in midafternoon i climbed the steps and only then did i learn that georgina had remembered me for just before i would have disappeared behind the screen of bushes she called my name johnny johnny i went back to her my love she was crying she was crying very softly but the tears were flowing in copious and silent misery she reached desperately for my hand i want to go home are you unhappy i miss you nannys here i said then in case georgina had forgotten the nursery at stowey sister felicitys here shell die shes going to die johnny and ill be alone no no no i held her tight and i cried because there was sweet sod all i could do i held her for a long time dear god i thought but what misery lay in this girls madness i remembered that the last time i had been with georgina in this garden had been after our brothers death did she somewhere in her tangled mind connect me with death john earl of stowey deaths messenger i held her tight when i relaxed my embrace to look into her face i saw that she had gone back into her mysterious world of gentle nothingness i kissed her cheeks and she smiled at me remembering nothing of her desperate fears she seemed happy again but i was still crying i climbed the garden steps and let myself into the main house to seek out sister felicity but a young nun told me felicity had been ordered back to her bed i thanked the girl then pulled out all my small change which i put into the box beside the door i wouldnt need british coins again for a long while maybe never behold a miracle the earl of stowey is giving money to charity i turned astonished to see my twin sister elizabeth coming from the convent office her husband lord tredgarth was two paces behind her he nodded at me with heavy disapproval while elizabeth just looked scornful i heard you had come to visit this morning she said but i hardly expected to find you still here i came to say goodbye youre going somewhere i shrugged wherever dont let me stop you brother i didnt move the meeting was unexpected and sudden yet despite elizabeths rudeness it seemed churlish just to walk away i was also very curious about what had brought elizabeth here she looked very chic in a black summer dress and with her bright blonde hair cut expensively short she wore a single row of pearls and had an expensivelooking handbag peter tredgarth was certainly not paying for such baubles and i wondered who was she glared at me expecting me to leave but i stayed put as the silence stretched in the big cool hallway which smelt of wax polish and disinfectant lord tredgarth was the first of the three of us to be embarrassed by the silence you found georgina well john no i said shes frightened of the future dont be ridiculous john elizabeth snapped shes halfwitted so how does she even know what the future is shes frightened that nanny will die and leave her alone theres certainly no point in her looking to you for any security if that happens is there what have you ever done for her loved her dont be impertinent weve all loved georgie but some of us have to be practical as well she looked at her watch then grimaced at my dirty jeans and unironed shirt are you flying back to the mainland now no then i neednt offer you a lift to the airport she sounded relieved come along peter i frowned you mean you didnt come here to visit georgina i came here brother to make sure that her funds are still adequate as i said some of us try to be practical there really isnt any point in wasting our time by seeing her she doesnt know me from catherine the great but that doesnt prevent me from worrying about her welfare now come along peter we have a taxi waiting her high heels cracked and snapped over the parquet floor i moved into her path making her stop and provoking a look of utter disdain an alarm bell had rung faintly in my head i did not trust elizabeth when she spoke of georginas funds elizabeth is constantly short of money made so by her husbands ineptitude as a farmer and his failures as an investor are georginas funds adequate i asked her now entirely you dont have to worry not that you ever did now stand aside please tell me something i said on a pure impulse did you send two men to kill me anger blazed in elizabeths eyes peter if john doesnt move out of my way then kindly remove him for me her husband loomed closer hes a big and burly man but everything he touches turns to disaster piss off tredgarth i said nastily and he fell back as id known he would did you send them i asked elizabeth again she paused summoning her artillery you are a fool john she said eventually you behaved disgracefully at mothers funeral and now youre accusing me of planning your murder try not to be so utterly pathetic and ridiculous im quite seriously worried about you clearly theres a strain of lunacy in our family georgina has it and now it seems quite likely you do too no i did not send any men to murder you i sometimes wish i had is there any other crime of which you wish to accuse me no good so kindly get the hell out of my way i got the hell out of her way and i still didnt understand what had happened in england or why or who had set it all in motion i only knew that i had a boat waiting at st helier and an ocean to cross so with the questions still unanswered i found my rented bike and pedalled off to find the world at noon the next day a good west wind whipped me through the passage du fromveur between ushant and the french mainland i should have stood much further out to sea passing ushant well beyond the horizon and thus avoiding the heavy merchant traffic that thrashes round finisterre but i had a fancy to run the headlands tides and as my life was now once more governed by fancy i stood inshore and let sunflower have her head i had an ebbing spring tide in the passage so that we shot through at close to fifteen knots the wind was brisk enough to shatter the waves on the rocks about the kereon light seabirds screamed above the islands that were bright with gorse in the sunlight another british boat was shooting the passage with me but once he had cleared the pierres vertes cardinal buoy he turned due south towards the raz de sein while i held west towards the open ocean at dusk looking back i could see the brilliant sweep of le creach lighthouse marking my last sight of land lisbon next i thought and then i wondered why and supposed it was because the first time id sailed away from devon id made the tagus my first port of call i had no need to go there now instead i decided i would go straight for the azores i would sail into horta and there at those hospitable quays meet the first seagypsies again such gypsies rarely ventured further north than the azores and few even went that far towards the cold latitudes but i knew there would be a handful of weatherbeaten boats and id hear the first tenuous strands of gossip from the world id temporarily deserted perhaps id find a crew who wanted to cross the atlantic or perhaps id change my mind and go south round africa to head up into the paradises of the indian ocean nothing mattered any more so at a whim i decided to skip lisbon sunflower and i fell into our old routine i slept mostly by day when other boats might be expected to keep a better watch than at night i had a new radar reflector at the masttip but i doubted whether any nighttime crew on a merchant vessel would be watching their radar more likely theyd be watching dirty videos and they wouldnt even feel the bump as they drove sunflower under more yachtsmen die crushed under the bows of careless steamers than from their own mistakes so at night when the heavens were dazzling with stars i stayed awake close to the selfsteering gear id doze at times sunflower was behaving beautifully her newly cleaned hull making her sweet in the water we were on a long windward beat but the weather was good lulling me to sleep and to reflection england already seemed like a bad and unreal dream had two men really tried to kill me i knew they had but now where the memory had once made me wake sweating in the night it seemed merely ridiculous it had surely all been a mistake the police had taken no interest in my return and why should they the only resentment had been from my family and from sir leons staff who felt cheated of their glorious picture had they sent the two men the possibility intrigued me but a few moments of thought convinced me that the notion of jennifer pallavicini ordering my death was a nonsense she had no motive that i could see elizabeth was a more likely candidate but none of it seemed to matter any more the whole episode was scoured clean by a northwest wind and the oceans long swell charlie was right i thought the picture was long gone it was in some texan vault or japanese mansion or swiss strongroom whoever had bought it would take care to keep it safe silent and hidden for generations perhaps hundreds of years in the future the picture would surface again and the art historians would recall that it had once been stolen from an obscure british family but for now for elizabeth and me the van gogh might just as well be on the dark side of the moon not that i cared any more i was back at sea chopping my bows into the long ocean waves i slept in the mornings at noon after the ritual sight i made myself a meal in the afternoons i found work to do the new joinery in the cabin needed varnishing and day by day coat by coat the gleam deepened i catnapped in the early evening ate again then read until the sun dropped i had an old battered shakespeare proust the oxford book of english verse and joshua slocums account of his solo voyage round the world there was meat enough in those four volumes to last a lifetime all had been soaked when garrard had dropped sunflower off the grid but the pages had dried out and though crinkled were still readable when the light made the pages indistinguishable i would prepare the sextant for the first star sight of the evening then just sit and let the time drift past at night the phosphorescence glittered in our wake sometimes a large fish would come close to the hull and id see its rising track like a trailing coat of stars deep in the water in seven years id never tired of that sight nor thought i ever would it became warmer as we travelled south by day i rarely wore any clothes why wear out things that cost money to replace at night i pulled on jeans and a sweater and in the early hours when sleep threatened most i would go to the foredeck and exercise till i was sweating there isnt much exercise to be had on a yacht the toughest task is hoisting the mainsail but in a good year it stayed up most of the time i took the sails down once i was fourteen nights from ushant and the weather turned the dawn revealed a sullen oily swell above which my sails hung limp beneath a brassy sky the glass dropped all morning while heavy greasy clouds piled from the west to shroud the sky in an ominous darkness at noon a heavy rain flayed the sea then stopped as abruptly as it had begun the rudder banged in its pintles i sensed a squall there was none in sight but the instinct is enough at sea its best to act on the first impulse for there might not be time for second thoughts i dropped the foresails and lashed them to the pulpit rails then let down the main i tied the heavy sail to its boom then disconnected the selfsteering gear i slid the washboards into their grooves bolted them home and locked the companionway shut a minute later the squall struck it came out of the west like an express train the squall was an onslaught of wind and rain stirred to fury but so confined and travelling so fast that it had neither the time nor space to stir the seas venom into threatening waves the rain seemed to be flying parallel to the sea which was being whipskimmed into a fine spray that struck sunflower with the force of a sandblaster i crouched down from its fury and felt my naked back being stung red by the rains lash i could hear nothing but a maniacal hiss i looked up once and saw the mast straining the forestays were bar taut while the twin backstays were bellying out like bows i dared not look again the pressure of the wind on the bare pole was driving sunflower backwards and i could feel the seas pressure trying to slew the tiller i had never known such fury in an atlantic squall id experienced them in the pacific but this was a timely reminder never to take the sea lightly then as suddenly as it had come the squall went the wind dropped to nothing a gentle heavy rain pattered down behind me i could see the sea being scourged white but ahead and around sunflower the water was just a dappled black the hull seemed to shiver as the cockpit drains gurgled two other squalls struck neither as fierce as the first and an hour after the second the black clouds rent to show sunlight by nightfall we were under full sail again beating west and south as though there had been no interruption i played myself tunes on my pennywhistle and opened a rare bottle of wine two dolphins investigated me and stayed with the boat halfway through the night next morning the first dawn rays of sun reflected pink on the undersides of the wings of two gulls it was a sign that i was nearing the azores and by dusk i could see the white clouds heaping above the mountains of graciosa twelve hours later after a sweet nights sail sunflower was safe alongside the painted wall in horta i recognised two yachts in the busy harbour one a graceful doubleender belonged to an hospitable american couple whom i had last met in tasmania while the other an immaculately maintained wooden yawl was sailed by an obnoxious swede who was the bane of every sailor on the seven seas i asked in the café sport where the americans were they had family trouble johnny so they flew home thats a mistake i said fervently my own mistake was to go to the café sport i was just addressing a dirty postcard to charlie when ulf the loathsome swede slapped my back i saw sunflower here thats johnny i said to myself how are you because i was back where i belonged and therefore feeling welldisposed to all mankind even to the gruesome ulf i said i was in wonderful health which rather disappointed him i asked how he was a redundant question johnny as you well know i do not get the illness ever physical sickness is an aberration of the subconscious mind he was off unstoppable and unbearable id once heard an australian threaten to break ulfs bloody legs to test his theories that all ailments were in the mind but the trouble is that the repugnant ulf stands nearly six feet eight inches tall and is built like an advert for steroids he drank lemonade while i drank beer once he had expounded his theory of human sickness he launched himself on sunflowers ills you have a new mast yes is that what it is ulf i was trying to work out what that big stick was i remember telling you to get a new mast you were wise to take my advice johnny but it should have been a wooden mast wooden masts are more easily repaired your shrouds are still too far forward theyre not i know about these things if you dont want to move the chainplates i should take three feet off the mast that will cure the weatherhelm balls she doesnt have weatherhelm well a touch i confessed to myself but nothing to worry about balls i said again he smiled ulf always smiles when hes insulted and hes insulted often because he always knows what is wrong with everyones boat and quite unasked offers his tedious advice i shall come and look her over for you johnny i dont want you to i will make no charge my only concern is your safety i ordered another beer i was trying to think of some outrageous fault which i could assign to ulfs yawl but my imagination wasnt up to the task the big bastard kept an exemplary boat someone was asking about you last week ulf said suddenly who i dont know i just mentioned it a man a woman a swede ulf missed the feeble joke he has no sense of humour just a skin as thick as a sharks hide just a man he said airily a portuguese man i think he wore a suit he wasnt local or at least i havent seen him since last week i didnt like that the man wore a suit to my mind that made him a suspicious character but at least it hadnt been an englishman which meant that it could not have been garrard did this man say why he wanted me no youre a fat lot of help ulf i try to be he offered me his benevolent smile that is my purpose in life to help people but the man did say one thing that i found most notable what that you are an earl of england a real aristocrat i spluttered laughter into my beer oh come off it ulf for christs sake how long have you known me we first met i remember in the marquesas so it has been just over three years do you really think an earl would be a barearsed sailor it surprised me i confess it isnt true so dont tell people it is my father bred laboratory rats and my mother was a marriage guidance counsellor before she did a bunk with one of her clients he was sceptical if you say so johnny i do say so then i must believe you he sipped his lemonade and if this mistaken man returns what do i tell him to take a flying fuck at the moon of course it has often occurred to me he said blandly that in sweden we do not have such an offensive language as in england poor bloody sweden i thought you havent seen me ulf i laid it on the line for him you understand that i dont exist ive vanished i understand johnny trust me i didnt care who searched for me i just wanted to be left alone or almost alone i lingered a few days in horta trying to sense a pattern in the atlantic weather and hoping that some girl would offer herself as sunflowers crew the delay also gave ulf a chance to inflict himself on sunflower he told me that her cockpit drains were inadequate her bow fairleads misplaced and that her selfsteering lacked robustness he told me to replace the aluminium whiskerpoles with carbon fibre rods and when i asked him how the hell i was supposed to find carbon fibre rods on some remote islands in the middle of the bloody atlantic he told me to buy sailboard masts it was actually a good idea thats the trouble with ulf hes usually right but contrariness makes most people do the very opposite of whatever he advises he advised me to give up smoking so i puffed pipe smoke at him till he left that evening i met a dutch girl who was almost persuaded to jump her friends yacht to cross the atlantic with me but next morning she thought twice about it before disappearing northwards to mother and safety i began to think about leaving myself it wasnt really the season for a southern run across the atlantic and the weather charts were not helpful so i decided i should sail south far south i remembered how joshua slocum had set out to sail round the world from west to east but chased by pirates off the african shore had abruptly decided to go east to west instead if such whimsical decisions were good enough for joshua and spray then they were good enough for johnny and sunflower so i dragged out the charts of the southern oceans there was a river on the coast of africa where id once made some friends and where i knew i could find provisions sunflower despite ulfs gloomy prognostications was in fine fettle and ready to go so next morning i bought wine cheese fresh fruit and vegetables i had decided to leave at nightfall i finished provisioning at midday sent georgina and sister felicity a postcard then went down to the cabin to sleep it was hot and the smell of varnish still lingered in the close air it was made worse by the odour of powdered boric acid which id scattered in the bilges as a lethal present to the azorean cockroaches i wore nothing but a faded pair of denim shorts but i was still sweating id closed the companionway to make a sleepinducing darkness but instead of sleeping i lay fretfully awake i listened to the lap of water on the steel hull and tried to let it lull me into drowsing i had just succeeded in dropping into a halfdoze when someone stepped from the quay ladder on to sunflowers deck i swore at the interruption with any luck it was only someone mooring their boat alongside but then i heard the footsteps climb down into the cockpit followed by a tentative knock on the closed washboards if thats you ulf i shouted get lost mr rossendale it was a womans voice i slid off the bunk and shot back the companionway the sudden brightness of the afternoon sun made me blink at my visitor i was so astonished that at first i thought i was sleeping and this was some dream apparition good god in his merciful heaven i said in greeting good afternoon said jennifer pallavicini hello i didnt know what else to say nor evidently did she because her customary certitude had deserted her she was desperately ill at ease perhaps because instead of being in an airconditioned art gallery she was on a tiny island in a scruffy yacht with a man she had recently accused of being a thief she looked cool enough despite the wretched heat in a loose white blouse and a pair of bleached designer jeans but there was a timidity in her eyes that seemed unnatural to this chillingly capable girl i rested my forearms on the washboards ive been wondering i said irrelevantly how come an english girl has a name like pallavicini my father was italian of course my mothers english was i asked my father died ten years ago she said it almost defiantly as if challenging me to find the right response i grunted some dutiful regret then slid the washboards out of place and dumped them on the chart tables chair i can offer you tea i said hospitably rotgut azorean wine irish whiskey beer orange juice or instant coffee i havent come to be sociable mr rossendale that was said with a touch of her old asperity then stay thirsty damn you i poured myself a mug of the rotgut wine took it and the bottle to the cockpit and sat down jennifer pallavicini remained standing sir leon sent me she said as though it entirely explained her presence i thought youd come because you found me irresistible or was it to apologise i saw the flash of angered pride on her face oh for gods sake girl sit down and have a drink i wont poison you tea she said as she sat please neither of us spoke as i made the tea this was evidently not to be a very jolly meeting i remembered she drank her tea without either sugar or milk so i served it black with a slice of lemon she thanked me i asked her how she had known where i was sir leon alerted all the ports where you might be found we had a man here some days ago and he arranged with a swedish yachtsman to tell us if you arrived ulf i thought the smug treacherous bloody bastard i hoped his precious yawl sank i didnt say as much instead because of the searing heat i rigged the awning over the boom to shade the cockpit if jennifer pallavicini was grateful for my solicitousness she didnt thank me i sat down and sipped my warm wine presumably sir leon is making one last desperate appeal to me she did not reply and i shook my head i didnt steal the bloody thing i had nothing whatever to do with it she ignored my denial instead and in a very fervent voice she asked whether i had liked the van gogh her question and the sincere tone in which it was asked took me by surprise yes i did like it very much i smiled it was like a splinter of sunlight hanging on the wall he was good at colour she said dispassionately perhaps the best of them all i used to go to my mothers room to look at it i went on she didnt approve of my doing that but she didnt approve of much that i did in the end she kept the east wing locked to stop what she called my trespassing but you could pick the locks indeed i could miss pallavicini and i frequently did does that make me a thief she did not answer i suddenly wondered whether she really was miss pallavicini she wore no rings she saw my glance at her hands and seemed amused by it in turn she examined me i was sweaty scarred suntanned and filthy i supposed she was a girl who liked her men ponced up with armpit antifouling and eaudecologne which rather spoilt any chance i might have with her sitting there i realised that i really did rather want a chance with her but that could have been mere disappointment at being turned down by the dutch girl we checked your story about the boats name jennifer said suddenly you were telling the truth thank you your honour i mocked her by tugging at a sunbleached forelock she stared quizzically at me how do you make a living with these i held up my hands in a month or two ill be in waters where there are no boatyards no chandleries no saillofts but enough broken yachts to need a slew of skills ill mend engines tension rigging and rebuild hulls if i cant mend it then its probably broken for life and those activities support you she sounded incredulous ive a little money i had an uncle thomas who shared my views about the rest of the family so he left me a legacy i poured myself another mug of the wine it was rotgut but i was used to rotgut what is this miss pallavicini a crossexamination she stared at me as though she might find a truth hidden behind my eyes i wish i knew whether you did steal the painting she said after a while i didnt cross my heart and hope to die but i didnt she paused as if waiting to see whether i would be struck dead as a result of my childish words i stayed alive if you didnt steal it she asked why would those two men think you might know where to find it because theyve got their wires crossed i paused i thought that perhaps you or sir leon might have sent them thats ridiculous she was genuinely astonished at the accusation they attacked me too a setup i suggested but not too forcefully to make me think you didnt know them youre an idiot she said in utter scorn but not in her usual hostile manner i shrugged but said nothing a gull swooped down to sunflowers stern hovered for a second then glided away a fishing boat high prowed and brightly painted belched its engine into life to gust a cloud of filthy smoke over the harbour we need your help mr rossendale jennifer pallavicini said when the silence between us had stretched too long im sailing south i said i provisioned today ive done my chart work and im going south ill probably call in at las palmas in the canary islands because a lot of girls hang about the yacht dock there looking for a lift to nowhere and after that im sailing south to an african river i visited two years ago the villagers there dont see yachtsmen from one years end to the next and theyre as friendly as hell the approach to the place is a bit bloody one rusted buoy ten miles off shore and shoals that shift around like a snake in a sleeping bag but please jennifer pallavicini interrupted me i rebuilt their generator when i was last there i ignored her appeal and i promised id go back to make sure it was still working jennifer pallavicini said nothing i was as tempted as hell to say id help her but only because she was such a beautiful girl i applied sound feminist principles and made my decision as if she was as ugly as a baboons behind the answers no i said i offered you my help last month and you turned it down she opened her handbag and took out an envelope i thought for a second that she was going to offer me sir leon buzzacotts autograph on a cheque but instead she took a photograph from the envelope she held it out to me the photograph showed a pale yellow triangle on a white background next to the yellow triangle was a blackandwhite measuring stick which told me that each side of the triangle was three inches long im not really an expert on modern art i said but if i were you i wouldnt buy it she ignored my feeble sarcasm its a corner of a painted canvas jennifer pallavicini said pedantically and our tests confirm that it was almost certainly cut from the stowey sunflowers a letter came with it mr rossendale demanding four million pounds for the rest of the painting the letter was posted two weeks ago the letter stated that if we dont pay the ransom by the end of august then the painting will be burned and we will be sent the ashes then pay the four million i said casually it seems a fair enough price for a twentymillionquid painting pay four million pounds to a blackmailer to a man who will only demand more who once we pay the first monies will cut a sunflower from the canvas and demand another four million she was suddenly and vehemently passionate for gods sake mr rossendale dont you understand the thieves will mutilate it to make their money theyre barbarians and they have to be stopped hang on i said a month ago you thought i was the thief now youve selected a group of barbarians maybe its whoever you sold the painting to she said angrily i shrugged and shook my head not guilty or maybe its you she said maybe you think well ransom the painting then buy it from you give me a cheque for twentyfour million i said flippantly and the paintings yours damn you she said angrily then pushed the photograph back into her handbag behind me a french sloop was ghosting into the harbour i turned to watch as it dropped its sails and a girl in a bikini went forward to pick up a mooring ulf was doing strenuous calisthenics on his foredeck and i saw him straighten up to eye the deficiencies of the newcomers boat there wasnt much wrong with the girl not that i could see i looked back to jennifer pallavicini and decided she too would look very good in a bikini why do you need me i asked her you must have hired ransom experts have you told the police of course we have the officer who was in charge of the original theft has been assigned to us not harry abbott detective inspector abbott she corrected me yes bloody hell i said in disgust harry abbott is someone who lives under a stone along with all the other nasty things that crawl and creep on slimy bellies in the stygian dark he had been the policeman who had tried to pin the theft of the van gogh on to me in the first place he had failed then but i didnt fancy him trying again what does the bastard say you should do persuade you to come home i wouldnt go to paradise on harrys recommendation which doesnt alter the fact that you should be doing everything in your power to assist us you are after all the legal owner of the painting a minute ago i pointed out you accused me of being the blackmailer its inspector abbotts belief her voice made it clear that she did not entirely share his certainty that the blackmailers waited till you sailed away before they made an approach to sir leon why would they do that she shrugged to show that she had no answer what i do know she said is that we need your authorisation for any attempts we may make to recover it otherwise sir leon could be accused of accepting stolen goods so we need your permission to negotiate that seemed fair enough does that mean i asked her that if sir leon retrieves it hell have to give it back to me of course she said defiantly as though under those circumstances she would dare me to take possession i smiled at her i wouldnt want it where could i hang it there might be room on the lavatory bulkhead but it would probably get in the way of the wet locker that small joke went down like a cement balloon i sighed went below to the cabin and tore a page out of a notebook i found a pencil and scribbled a quick message sir leon buzzacott and his wageslaves have my full authority to do whatever they think necessary for the safe recovery of one painting by vincent van gogh commonly known as the stowey sunflowers this authorisation is signed by john rossendale lord stowey earl of stowey and master under god of the good ship sunflower i dated it then embellished it with an ornate rubber stamp that has sunflowers name a quasiroyal crown and some nonsense numbers i use the stamp to impress immigration officials in selfimportant but trivial countries it doesnt reduce the bureaucracy or the scale of the necessary bribes but it sometimes makes them a trifle more respectful there you go i handed the note to jennifer pallavicini thats what you want isnt it pity you flew all the way here to fetch it you could have asked me nicely and id have posted it to you still its very good to see you would you like an early dinner before i sail i do a very good corned boeuf à la bourguignonne ive even got some fresh vegetables she ignored my babbling instead she tore my note into shreds which in defiance of greenpeaces valiant endeavours she scattered into the harbour water we need your personal help my lord i leaned back on the thwart im always suspicious when you call me my lord what do you plan to do if i return to england torture a confession out of me if you agree to help us she said we shall naturally assume your innocence i feigned grateful astonishment oh my god youre so kind she had the grace to blush but continued pressing her case we need your knowledge you can remember what happened four years ago you know more than i do about those two wretched men someone fears what you know but if youre lost in the oceans then they wont show themselves again so please come back my lord and help us she had asked very nicely and she was so very pretty so i very nearly agreed but every time i went home i regretted it id been back at sea just long enough to get the taste again and i was dreaming of those palmedged rivers and impossibly blue lagoons you have my verbal authority i said wearily to do whatever you want so go and do it but leave me alone she nodded almost as if she had expected the refusal i have some other news for you i waved a negligent hand as if to suggest that i did not much care whether she revealed the news or not your sister lady elizabeth tredgarth is initiating proceedings to take your younger sister back to england she had spoken in a very matteroffact voice a pokerplayers voice she had also appalled me as she had doubtless hoped to do shes doing what i could not keep the anger from my voice jennifer pallavicini shrugged as if to suggest that none of this was of much importance to her it seems theres a nun who is particularly fond of the lady georgina sister felicity yes the lady elizabeth feels that sister felicity is too old and too sick to look after lady georgina any longer theres also a possibility that the convent hospital might be sold so lady elizabeth wants her younger sister brought home home to where she lives of course in gloucestershire isnt it i stared in horror at jennifer pallavicini thats ridiculous i said elizabeth cant stand the sight of georgina jennifer pallavicini didnt reply how the hell do you know all this i demanded angrily because we take a great deal of interest in your family she said equably its a family that might bring our gallery a great treasure youre making this up i said youre telling me this nonsense in the hope that it will bring me back to england your sister didnt want you to know she said indeed she didnt institute proceedings until shed heard you had sailed away of course you dont have to believe me but i thought perhaps the news might be of some slight interest to you the trouble was that i did believe her why else had elizabeth been at the convent but we paid for georgina i protested for her lifetime a large sum of money was put into trust for your younger sisters care jennifer pallavicini said pedantically but our legal informant tells us that the trustees retain the right to dictate how that money should be spent if the lady elizabeth is confident that she can care for her sister then there is no reason why the trust fund should not also be given into her care and how that made sense brilliant clear lucid sense elizabeth married to her impoverished and useless husband would get her claws into georginas money while georgina could be stuck into a cottage on the tredgarth farm with some harridan to guard her the matter hasnt been decided yet jennifer pallavicini went on the trustees need to be convinced that the lady elizabeth can provide a proper home for your younger sister but there seems little doubt that she will succeed in so convincing them damn you i said to jennifer pallavicini damn you damn you damn you the ties of duty unavoidable duty were wrapping about me i could desert stowey i could watch my mother die and not shed a tear because of it but georgina was different the only people who had ever been able to pierce that tremulous insanity had been nanny myself and charlie now she needed me sir leon jennifer pallavicini could not resist a small smile as she played her ace is willing to guarantee a secure future for the lady georgina whether the painting is retrieved or not i said nothing i was remembering the spitefulness with which elizabeth had treated georgina as a child it wasnt a deliberate spitefulness merely a reflection of elizabeths impatience but deliberate or not it was unthinkable that georgina should be put into elizabeths care jennifer pallavicini watched me then opened her handbag and took out an air ticket which she laid on the thwart beside me if you go to your familys solicitors my lord you can doubtless stop this nonsense instantly i picked up the ticket it was for a firstclass seat azores to lisbon and lisbon to london when it comes to my family i said haughtily to jennifer pallavicini i dont need your damned help i tore the ticket into shreds then scattered the scraps into the water goodbye miss pallavicini i had angered her but i had also succeeded in surprising her she took a few seconds to recover then tried to turn the screw on my guilt it will be no good writing to your solicitors my lord your objections to the lady georginas fate wont be taken seriously unless youre in england to take some personal responsibility for her i said i dont need your help to look after my family miss pallavicini so goodbye youre not going to help your younger sister she asked incredulously i smiled at her im going to sail away jennifer i suddenly clicked my fingers as though i had been struck with a brilliant and timely idea would you like to sail with me you can cook cant you she stood up i cannot believe she said with a frigid dignity that you could be so careless of your younger sisters future she paused evidently seeking some final and crushing farewell you are undoubtedly the most selfish and unfeeling man i have ever met and youre cluttering up my boat so if you dont want to come with me go away she went away an hour later as i was taking off the mainsail cover i saw her being ferried out to ulfs yawl i assumed she was going to pay her informant his reward so i wrestled my fibreglass dinghy over the guardrails took the outboard from the stern locker and motored over to join the happy party i ignored miss pallavicini instead i killed the small engine drifted alongside the yawl and told ulf that he was a slimebag johnny how nice to see you you know miss pallavicini i think you would like a drink with us i wouldnt drink your bloody prune juice if i was dying of constipation i climbed out of the dinghy hitched it to one of his shrouds and walked down his scuppers i told you to keep your swedish mouth shut jennifer pallavicinis eyes were wide with alarm she clutched her handbag to her belly but otherwise seemed unable to move she doubtless believed that the huge swede was about to pulverise me and doubtless in principle she approved of that pulverisation but its one thing to want someone beaten up and quite another to see real blood on the deck i also believed that ulf would pulverise me but i was fed up with the bastard and wanted to hit him it was only a business arrangement ulf said smugly and this is your profit i jumped into his scrubbed cockpit and punched him in the belly he gasped but did not hit back so i smacked him hard across the mouth the blow jarred his head and brought a fleck of blood to his lips he still wouldnt fight johnny he wiped his mouth this is not like you thats because you dont know me so listen if you ever open your mouth about me again anywhere to anyone ill find your rotten carcass and ill feed it to the bloody fish do you understand me he had backed away jennifer pallavicinis face showed utter horror she made a small noise of protest but i ignored her ulf waved a placatory hand i was only trying to help you johnny maybe it was important to you yes maybe it wasnt your business you swedish bastard his reward money in portuguese escudos was strewn across the cockpit grating it was just business johnny just business he sounded miserable while i was mildly astonished to discover that he had a streak of jelly instead of a backbone id expected one hell of a fight from him but he was plainly scared nor was there any point in hitting him again because he wasnt going to fight back youre a creep ulf youre a real pain in the arse he nodded eager agreement with my judgment but you are a real english earl johnny yes he had backed to stand beside the mizzen mast at the far end of his cockpit from where he nodded towards jennifer pallavicini to prove the source of his information and youre queen of the bloody fairies ulf piss off i had hardly acknowledged jennifer pallavicinis presence though if i was honest with myself i knew id been showing off to her these days women might claim that they prefer enlightened men who can change nappies do the ironing and whip up tasty little soufflés but in truth i suspect they prefer men who can beat the shit out of loathsome swedes i motored back to sunflower the confrontation had made me feel much better which was some consolation two hours later i cast off hoisted my sails and did what i had promised to jennifer pallavicini i sailed away part three i sailed away but i didnt go south i went north it was a bastard of a voyage into the teeth of a nasty wind and a voyage made worse by a persistent equinoctial gale that tried to drive sunflower into biscay luckily we had enough westing to weather the two days and nights of wind but it made the approach to the channel a long fight against the northwesterlies that followed the storm once again i saw sunflowers reluctance to go to england she blew out the clew of the storm jib the topping lift broke and a pin came out of a sheave in the selfsteering gear they were all simple enough repairs but were best done in calmer weather that weather came as we passed the lizard the wind died and there was only a long long greasy swell from the west over which we crept on sunflowers motor i passed salcombe by i couldnt face charlie he had repaired my boat provisioned me and i knew all that generosity had been a vicarious adventure for charlie he could not be a seagypsy any more so he had made it possible for me to go back to the deep waters in his place but now i was crawling back with my tail between my legs the time would come when id explain everything to him but for now i could not bear to see the disappointment on his face so i sailed up the devon coast to the anonymity of the river exe where i moored sunflower at a vacant buoy the sky clouded over at dusk and by nightfall it was raining welcome to england i was woken at three in the morning by an irate man who had just motored from guernsey and wanted his mooring buoy back i obliged him anchoring sunflower in what seemed like a vacant patch of the river instead at five in the morning i was woken again as the falling tide grounded me by seven sunflower was lying canted on her starboard chine in the middle of a drying sandbank it was still raining it took me the rest of the day to find a pub that could point me towards a man who might just have a spare mooring that i could possibly rent in the end i found such a man and he didnt charge me a penny he was a fisherman whose boat had stayed ashore since the winter it aint worth the bother he told me because theres nothing left out there not even scruff theyve fished it clean you can spend a week out there and only get a wet arse for your trouble i consoled him with a pint then told him i had to go to london for two days your yachtll be safe boy never you mind but put your oars behind my garden shed otherwise theyll be stolen sure as eggs id rowed the dinghy ashore because i didnt want to risk using the outboard and it being stolen while the dinghy was marooned on the foreshore i caught a train next morning and because there wasnt a spare seat stood all the way from devon to london by the time the train pulled into paddington i was in a foul temper london didnt help my mood id just spent six weeks in the atlantic where the greatest inconvenience had been listening to a yellowbellied swede but london was nothing but inconvenience it was crowded stinking and selfimportant the people had faces wan as curdled milk they scurried like rats through their noisy tunnels they littered and all about them was noise noise noise goddamned bloody noise trains clattering taxis thumping horns and voices and sirens and jackhammers battered the air i had not visited london in over four years and i hoped to god i would never have to visit the place again i caught a bus to the strand then walked to the solicitors office sir oliver bulstrode was not in the building but would i like to leave a message the girl at the reception desk was plainly intimating that scruffy men walking unannounced off the pavement were not welcome as clients at bulstrode finch finch and mcelroy ill wait i said curtly i sat down in an ancient leather chair and picked up a copy of the field are you a client sir the receptionist was looking understandably alarmed i was wearing my cleanest jeans my least dirty shirt and a pair of fairly new tennis shoes but i still didnt look much like the usual class of goldplated shit that did business with bulstrode im a client i said my names rossendale rossendale as in stowey earl of i said there was a pause of two heartbeats would you like coffee my lord or something stronger perhaps i smiled back at her it wasnt her fault that british rail couldnt run a railroad or that i was pissed off with london or that i was angry at my twin sister or that i was dressed like a vagabond what id really like i said is to take you out to lunch but as i have to speak with sir oliver ill settle for a glass of his best scotch instead sir oliver arrived a halfhour later hes a plump man with a kindly face a real santa claus of a face but the benign look is utterly deceptive for like all the top lawyers he has a heart of flint and the morals of a rabid weasel he raised plump hands in astonishment when he saw me my lord i had no idea you were coming have i mislaid our appointment no oliver you have not this is by nature of a surprise visit and a very welcome surprise too upon my word what a distinct pleasure this is i shall cancel my luncheon engagement immediately which was his way of telling me that he would double his hourly fees for this unannounced visit which did not bother me because i had no intention of paying sir oliver and his partners had sent their children to the best schools and their wives to the most expensive fat farms on the proceeds of the stowey estate and i considered it was high time he did something for me i see youve been given some whisky he said good good do come into my sanctum john he always greeted me as my lord and thereafter used my christian name to show that he could assume intimate terms with the nobility the mans a creep but a clever one he fussed me into his office which was stiff with leather chairs and ancient hunting prints at weekends he plays the country squire plodding round six damp essex acres with a shotgun and a mangy spaniel sit down john do i shall just rearrange luncheon if youll allow me ten minutes later we were served plates of salmon salad in his office he opened a bottle of entredeuxmers i was so sorry not to have attended your mothers funeral he told me as he poured the wine i had an unbreakable engagement that day which was so very sad he lied of course if the rossendale family had still had any flesh on their bones hed have been down to the funeral like a shot but as he thought hed squeezed us dry then there had clearly been no profit for him in making the journey so sad he murmured i missed the funeral too i said i walked out before it began he must have known that already for he showed no reaction not even to enquire why i had abandoned the ceremony instead he smiled beneficently i must say john you do look very well sun and sea eh and still as thin as ever you do put the rest of us to shame he paused for a split second i thought you were even now sailing into the unknown so very brave of you i always think he bestowed me an admiring look in fact sir oliver dislikes me intensely hes been our familys solicitor for almost as long as i can remember and when i inherited the title he had thought that i would be naïve enough to do whatever he told me in the end i told him to get stuffed and went off to sea hes never forgiven me and probably never will i sailed back evidently he smiled then forked a chunk of salmon and mayonnaise into his mouth i assume youre worried about your mothers will i havent even seen the will ah he clearly wished he hadnt raised the matter and swiftly moved the conversation on so to what precisely do i owe the pleasure of this visit i came to see you oliver because of what that bitch elizabeth is doing to georgina he dabbed at his lips with a linen napkin dear lady elizabeth the answer is no no he smiled happily no one appreciates the merits of brevity more than i my dear john but i must confess that your meaning has momentarily eluded even me georgina is not going to live with elizabeth thats clear enough isnt it eminently he sipped his wine somewhere beyond the heavily curtained window a piledriver began smacking insistently i raised my voice over the din if you want me to sign something i will as head of my benighted family oliver im telling you that georginas future is not up for grabs i dont think were quite ready for signatures yet he said ominously he poured each of us another glass of wine might i ask why youre so adamantly opposed because elizabeth is a moneygrubbing witch who hates georgina she only wants her out of jersey so she can get her hands on georginas trust fund you know all that so why ask me he swivelled his chair to stare at a print of stowey that hung above a leather sofa i suppose he said airily that at sea you must learn to view the world in very simple terms theres no room for doubt in the ocean is there yet on shore my dear john things can become so deucedly complicated stop wrapping it up oliver tell me he swivelled his chair to face me its all a question of options john so long as your dear mother was alive she wanted georgina to stay in jersey but now things are changing the good sisters of the convent are under a great deal of pressure to sell the property indeed it seems increasingly likely that the diocese will force the sale which would mean that the sisters are most likely to retreat to their mother house at nantes will the lady georgina be happy in france he spread his hands to show that he did not know the answer then we must consider dear sister felicity shes not well john not at all and all of us fear for dear lady georgina when felicity dies imagine it if you can georgina would be alone and bereft in a strange country with no solace but the sacraments the weight of it crushed down on me i could see what was in sir oliver bulstrodes evil mind the last vestiges of my familys cash were in georginas trust fund if elizabeth took control of that money then oliver would get his fee the trustees of the fund would need to be persuaded but there were few men better at buttering parsnips than sir oliver bloody bulstrode in short the pigs had found a honey trough and were ready to snuffle and none of them cared a monkeys toss for georgina she can be found a good institution in england cant she i tried oh undoubtedly he said with fake enthusiasm there must be scores of institutions which would gladly care for your sister yet would any court of law i ask you prefer such an institution to the love and care of a family member not i hope that this matter will ever reach any court he added hastily im sure we can work it out most amicably youd call elizabeth loving and caring i asked incredulously the lady elizabeth tredgarth he said huffily has undertaken to provide the most proper care and attention for her sister i note with the deepest regrets your reservations about the lady elizabeths suitability yet i must tell you frankly my lord that i cannot see any court refusing her a supervision order not when you consider the alternatives i had noted that he had called me my lord that was a danger signal which told me sir oliver was on elizabeths side he was on her side because she had a prospect of scooping the cash sir oliver is a venal bastard but so are most top lawyers thats why so many of them become politicians supposing i offered georgina a home i asked he feigned astonished pleasure my dear john what a very splendid idea and so typical of your generosity can you do it naturally you would have to provide constant nursing care the premises would have to be suitable or were you thinking of making her a shipmate he chuckled at his own jest seriously john such a responsibility will involve a great deal of money theres georginas trust fund which would hardly be made available to someone with a police record the steel was in his voice now you would be asking the trustees to grant you authority over a great deal of money before they would even consider doing that they would need to be satisfied that you have demonstrated some fiscal responsibility and domestic stability i believe unless i am entirely out of touch with your personal affairs that you possess neither a house nor a wife i stood up i had not touched any of the salmon salad georgina can stay where she is so long as felicity is alive and the hospital remains unsold i had not inflected it as a question but sir oliver chose to treat it as such she can certainly remain where she is for a time yes the lady elizabeth has not i understand finished preparing her domestic arrangements he paused to shake his head sadly as though i was disappointing him by my wilfulness i really do think you may be misjudging your sister i grant you that elizabeth can be tiresome but i do assure you that she is making the most thorough preparations for georginas welfare why dont you inspect those arrangements im quite sure the lady elizabeth would welcome such an inspection have you inspected them i asked of course i lunched at perilly last week where i found the lady elizabeths proposed arrangements entirely satisfactory they had me boxed in id just sailed twelve hundred horrid miles to find that i had been utterly outmanoeuvred i left sir olivers office ran down the stairs and once on the pavement took a deep breath to rid my lungs of the leathery stench of his hypocrisy the street air stank of fumes and filth and georgina like me was trapped i walked beside the embankment i went there because there are boats moored to the wall but theyre boats which are never again going to feel ocean waves on their cutwaters or heel to a cold cold wind as clean as a rigging knife the boats are trapped theyre there to serve as pubs or museum pieces london has taken their guts and their pride away from them and reduced them to gewgaws and i was trapped but god help me i had some guts and pride left enough i hoped to fillet a twin sister and her fat lawyer i paced the river it began to rain but i was oblivious to both the rain and the passing time up and down i went between blackfriars and westminster thinking i was head of the rossendale family but my titular authority counted for nothing because i was poor had a police record and a reputation for being irresponsible yet truly neither the police record nor the irresponsibility mattered because when dealing with lawyers only one thing carries real weight it isnt justice or probity or any other of their fine words its cash lots of cash lawyers love cash they grovel for it swill in it lie in it cheat for it flatter for it and dream of it so i needed cash the trustees of georginas fund might never entrust the money to me but georgina wasnt tied to the trust if i could replace the trust fund then i could arrange her future so the first question to be thrashed out along the embankment was where i could find a lot of money there was an obvious answer of course but my pride wouldnt let me grovel to jennifer pallavicini so i had to find another way i could sell the few shares left in uncle thomass legacy and i could sell sunflower id probably raise about one hundred thousand pounds which would be enough to buy a small house in devon i could find a job if no one needed a welder or carpenter then i could sell my title to some idiot who wanted an aristocrats name on his firms letterhead i could join the other clowns in the house of lords and claim my attendance money perhaps i could write a book belting round the world an earls story perhaps the heavens would open and rain golden sovereigns on me perhaps pigs would fly it was hopeless a small house in devon and a job would not solve my problem because elizabeth would still hold all the cards she had a large house a husband and no record of being drunk and disorderly what i needed was a lot of money very fast enough to buy a sharper lawyer than sir oliver charlie that thought stopped my walking the lights were coming on across the river and reflecting in shaking streaks on the darkening water charlie would help charlie would throw himself into this battle with all his huge heart and soul and strength but charlie would be no match for a cunning bastard like sir oliver bulstrode charlie would give me money but the lawyers would soon drain that away and charlie despite his success and despite his flashy toys was deeply in debt besides this was family this was my responsibility and i had already taken too much money from charlie what i needed now was my own money gobs of money a lawyers wet dream of money what i needed was a patch of canvas two feet three inches wide by a shade over three feet long on which some poor halfmad genius had once painted a vase of sunflowers in short i needed sir leon buzzacott he had known that which was why he had sent jennifer pallavicini with the message that he would look after georginas future but to secure that future i would have to crawl abjectly to jennifer pallavicini otherwise i was trapped by the short and curlies unless of course sir oliver was right and i was being unfair in my judgment of elizabeth that was the last straw of hope i could cling to and if that straw failed me then i would have to eat humble pie i turned towards westminster for the last time it was late fully dark and i was soaked to the skin so i phoned an old girlfriend and asked if i could have a bed for the night she agreed though she didnt offer her own bed but i hadnt expected her to because nothing was going right these days nothing in the morning i went to gloucestershire during the night i had half persuaded myself that elizabeth was indeed doing the decent thing and that i had been blinded to her decency by my own unreasonable dislike of her it was nonsense i told myself to think that elizabeth could cheat the trustees she would need to satisfy them that she could provide georgina with proper care and livingquarters and so by the time i caught the train i was more than half convinced that my troubles would soon be over georgina would have a safe haven and i would be free to return to my life and sunflower jennifer pallavicini had called me uncaring and selfish she was wrong about the first i cared for georgina it was simply that when jennifer pallavicini confronted me in horta i had been unwilling to dance to her insistent tune selfish i thought about that as i stood in the crowded train going from london to the cotswolds yes i thought she was probably right i was selfish i had always done what i wanted id worked for it if welding steel hulls in some humid tropical hell hole was called work but i had still pursued my own desires yet not i decided to the detriment of others i had never betrayed anyone to get what i wanted id fought a few but it takes two to fight so the pallavicini i decided did not understand me half as well as she believed she had believed that i would need her assistance to settle georginas future but now i was proving that i could look after my sister without sir leons help i would do it quickly then take myself back to sunflower and the open sea i caught a bus from the station to elizabeths village then walked a lane between drystone walls to where the drive led to lord tredgarths farm a big sign on the gate said entrance to perilly house and equestrian centre only private no trespassing while another sign ordered tradesmen to use the entrance on the gloucester road i decided i wasnt a tradesman and pushed open the tall wroughtiron gates the sun was trying to break through the clouds as i walked between the stumps of trees killed by dutch elm disease to my right was a thistlerich paddock where a few fat ponies grazed between low jumps made from painted oil drums and striped poles elizabeths equestrian centre was really a scabby ridingschool which catered to the fat children of middleclass mothers who liked to boast they were acquainted with the lady elizabeth tredgarth it was a toss up which elizabeth hated the most the mothers or their children shed never had children herself which i considered a blessing to the unborn the grandly named perilly house was really just a large farmhouse it was a very pleasant farmhouse built of cotswold stone with a big central gable and two large wings roses grew about the front door which had been tricked out with a white georgian portico and an antique brass bellpull a nervous cleaning woman answered the bell and told me her ladyship was not at home her ladyship had gone to a hospital charity committee meeting in cirencester which answer despite my attempts to convince myself that elizabeth was behaving well triggered a rush of uncharitable thoughts i imagined elizabeth earning every brownie point she could so long as she saw georginas trust fund in her sights i imagined she would suddenly be active on the hospital charity and the mental health fundraising committee and even the flower rota at the parish church but his lordships at home the cleaning lady volunteered would you tell him john rossendales here is it business sir she had clearly been trained to be wary of all strange visitors no i was about to say i was a friend but decided that would stretch the truth too far its a private matter the woman looked dubious but seemed reassured that i was not in a suit which meant i was probably not serving a writ or otherwise adding to peter tredgarths troubles hes at the camp sir i knew where that was in the early days of my sisters marriage when peter and i had still been friends i had been a frequent visitor to perilly and i remembered the old camp which had been hastily built in the war to house italian prisoners doing farm work on the surrounding estates by the time i first saw the camp it was already derelict at one time peter had thought to turn the old wooden huts into a chicken farm but in the end he had done nothing and the timber had rotted away and the undergrowth had all but hidden the concrete foundations i walked down a tractorrutted path past a spinney of alders then turned alongside the stream which would lead me to the low hill where the camp had been built i saw peter tredgarth standing beside the stream staring gloomily at the water he had a shotgun under his arm making him look uncommonly like a man contemplating the benefits of suicide he jerked guiltily when i called his name then stared with surprise as he recognised me what the hell are you doing here he asked i could hardly expect him to be glad to see me after our last meeting in the channel islands ive come to see you and elizabeth of course but i gather shes not at home she never is these days i sometimes forget what she looks like he peered at me evidently trying to decide whether to be grudgingly polite or dismissiyely nasty he didnt have the guts to be nasty so offered me a grunt of welcome instead dyou see any heron i looked up and down the stream no heron peter one of the labourers told me he saw a nesting couple up by the weir thought id shoot them arent they a protected species i teased him bad for the fishing you see bloody bad best thing to do is shoot them he broke the gun and took out the cartridges why dont you have a waterbailiff to look after the fishing i asked i did retired sergeant from my regiment nice chap but i couldnt afford to pay him he looked unhappily at his water which was choking with weeds needs a bit of work eh a bit must get down to it one day you can get a lot for the fishing rights these days and its good water you know no damn fish farms filling it up with troutshit why dont you build your own fish farm i asked him and pollute it yourself i tried that john but they wouldnt give me planning permission bastards theyll let some upstart grocer build a brick bungalow on a beauty spot but they wont let a landowner make a decent living i should have bribed them of course but i couldnt afford their fees he frowned at me seemingly puzzled by my unexpected visit if i were you i wouldnt be here when elizabeth gets back she had a telephone call from her lawyer chappie yesterday the one in london you must know who i mean he lunched here last week and scoffed the best part of a brisket anyway elizabeths not exactly happy with you livid in fact shouldnt be talking to you myself but he could not think quite why he was talking to me so his voice tailed away you dont have elizabeths capacity to hate i suggested yours is a ghastly family he said always squabbling and yours isnt theyre pretty ghastly too he admitted peter tredgarth is big and heavy with a permanently worried expression he had not always been like that when i first introduced him to elizabeth he had been a trim guards officer lively and quick who used to sail the channel with me he had long since given up sailing and was now weighed down with the worlds griefs i thought youd gone back to sea he said irritably i did i came back bloody silly of you if i was you id stay out there thats what i should have done gone off and stayed away he fell silent and for a moment neither of us could find anything to say i hear you were up at the camp i said to fill the silence he gave me a fierce look did you drive here i caught a bus from the station then walked i dont think ive been on a bus since i was at prep school he grimaced either at the memory or as he tried to decide what to do with my unwelcome presence tell you what ill do he said at last ill drive you to the station that way she wont find you on the premises and i wont tell her youve visited we can stop for a bite of lunch on the way i know a decent little pub which does a good midday meal wait here he didnt let me respond but just turned away and began walking towards the treefringed hill where the camp lay i started after him ill come with you wait he turned on me angrily then as if to explain his rudeness tossed me the gun and its two cartridges keep an eye out for the heron theres a good chap i waited the two heron flew past me i ignored them instead i watched peter plod up the hill and disappear into the undergrowth beyond the trees there was a pause then his mudstained land rover appeared and bounced down the slope towards me see the heron he asked as he braked beside me not a sign peter i climbed into the passenger seat and pushed the gun into the back steak and kidney pie and a decent pint eh peter was suddenly very jocular i put my hand over the gear lever to stop him driving away i dont want to go to the pub yet peter ive come here to see what preparations youre making for georgina if i approve of them then i wont oppose elizabeth and she can get her claws on georginas money so why dont i just go up to the house and wait for elizabeth he stared at me biting a strand of his moustache georgina he finally said georgina i confirmed youre worried about her he seemed astonished at the thought of course im worried about her and you think elizabeths going to cheat on the trust fund it occurred to me yes i said bluntly for a few seconds i thought he was going to throw me out of the vehicle for insulting his wife but instead he just pushed my hand away from the gear lever and crashed it into first right he spoke angrily and decisively youve asked for it so youll damn well get it operation georgina we lurched forward turned on to the rutted track and accelerated up towards the farm elizabeth wont take kindly to you poking about the place but georginas your sister so why the hell shouldnt you see where shes going to live he laughed but at what i could not tell he drove furiously we went past the house past the farmyard and up a track edged with blackberry bushes at the end of the track and facing on to a quiet country lane was a pretty stone cottage building work was evident from the scaffolding which reached up to the chimney and from the pile of plumbers junk that lay outside the door but no builders were actually visible primrose cottage peter tredgarth announced as he stamped on the land rovers brakes a horrible name but it has three bedrooms two bathrooms a kitchen living room walled garden at the rear and one garage central heating is being installed a perfect residence you will agree for one loony sister and her livein nurse perfect i agreed i was astonished and pleased i might have persuaded myself that elizabeth was going to do the decent thing but i had not really believed it yet primrose cottage was indeed perfect it offered privacy and comfort as well as restfulness i felt my worries dropping away i would be free again the livein nurse peter had left the motor running will be hired from an agency in cheltenham the agency specialises in cases like georginas naturally the woman will have to be given time off so the agency will supply weekend cover and supplementary nursing care for two nights a week as part of the contract price his voice became heavy with sarcasm does that meet with your approval i think it sounds marvellous peter i said warmly he sneered at the humility in my voice elizabeth has already shown the cottage to the trustees and they agree with you theyve also interviewed the agency and found them entirely satisfactory elizabeths been wonderful i ate more humble pie and i apologise for doubting her he laughed his victory over me complete youve got a nerve john he took a silver flask from a pocket of his tweed jacket unscrewed its cap and took a long pull he suddenly looked very morose and why the hell would you care about georgina i just do you care about her money he said savagely but you wont get it john you abdicated you gave up you bottled out you pissed off to sea and you probably screwed the family by nicking their bloody picture as well he began to laugh id never realised before this moment that he was an alcoholic hed probably been drinking before i met him and he would probably be drinking for the rest of the day did you steal that picture he asked me suddenly no she says you did she says shes met someone who helped you do it youre a fool john i suppose you threw the money away i didnt steal the picture peter he ignored that it was left to elizabeth in your mothers will i know and it ought to go to her he said heavily as though making a point i might not have considered before shes got plans for the money you see plans buy stowey back run a proper equestrian centre he took a pull on the flask then chuckled i think she imagines the queen coming down to admire the horses but the point of it is john that elizabeth wants to use the money she wants to restore the familys position in society you dont do you all you want to do is arse around in a boat if you had any decency at all youd tell her where the picture is then disappear i dont know where it is peter i paused who told her id stolen it buggered if i know nor did he care it was enough that he shared elizabeths belief in my guilt he peered at his watch she might come home for lunch so youd best leave he leaned across me to open the door go to the end of the lane and you can catch a bus at the crossroads no pub lunch i asked him out he ordered me it was hard to believe we had once been friends now whatever his unhappiness he was on his wifes side in our familys civil war i climbed out and slammed the land rovers door and dont tell her ive spoken to you lord tredgarth shouted at me i wont he took another pull at his flask then viciously wrenched the steering wheel to slew the land rover back towards the farm i had to jump fast to save myself from being sideswiped by the skidding vehicle its rear wheels spattered me with mud as he drove away i waited till he had disappeared then walked up the path to primrose cottage the new front door had still not been fitted with a lock so i pushed into the big living room which was littered with builders scraps the walls were newly painted a wood stove had been fitted in the old hearth it was a lovely cottage its southern windows facing across the water meadows i wandered into the kitchen where a new double sink had been fitted there was a pile of builders brochures and invoices on the draining board i sifted idly through them only one of the brochures was not about building materials but was an invitation from a firm which specialised in letting holiday cottages do you have an unused farm cottage let us turn your empty property into profit i stared through the window i could see the camp hill across the valley why had peter not wanted me to walk to the landrover with him i tried to dismiss the nagging worry i wanted to walk away to go to the crossroads and catch my bus then to take sunflower to the limitless freedom of the seas but there was something wrong here i looked down at the holiday cottage brochure was elizabeth planning to renovate primrose cottage at the expense of georginas fund then let it to summer visitors i leafed through the stained and crumpled paperwork on the draining board one sheet of paper was a carbon copy of an estimate from a plumbing firm it was a hefty estimate covering the installation of a new hot water tank a central heating boiler a shower room and at the very bottom for the provision of a standpipe and two cold water connections to caravans the estimate had evidently been successful for the plumbers were using it as a checklist for work completed i saw the standpipe had already been finished i swore very softly not really believing what i was suspecting but knowing that i would have to find out for myself and knowing too that if i was right then my troubles were only just beginning i didnt cross peters land instead i walked a mile up the lane turned south on to the gloucester road and crossed the stream by the new bridge trucks carrying chipboard and frozen chickens thundered past me at the top of the hill there was a layby where a glum family picnicked within yards of the growling lorries i walked past them and climbed over the gate on to peters property the mud track had been newly used i followed it a hundred yards through the screen of dark trees then through the tangled undergrowth to where a clearing had been hacked out in the old camp two caravans stood on the concrete foundation slabs of the old huts around the slabs the undergrowth had been cleared away with a harrow leaving scarred raw earth in which the first nettles were already growing the caravans were quite large but clearly secondhand both were locked the standpipe was between them their windows were obscured by net curtains two caravans one for georgina and the other for whom girls from the west of ireland perhaps inveigled by an advertisement in a catholic newspaper such girls came cheap my mother had used them as servants and i imagined elizabeth would do the same she would pretend that primrose cottage was to be georginas home and doubtless it would be for a few months and doubtless the cheltenham agency would provide the nursing care but after a while it would all quietly change and georgina would be shuttled up the hill to this dank tomb of a wood and primrose cottage could be profitably let to appreciative holidaymakers and all of it would be done with georginas money bugger i shouted the curse aloud and thumped an impotent fist against the metal skin of the nearest caravan there was to be no freedom after all but only duty because it was time to catch a thief i went back to devon that night retrieved my oars rowed myself out to sunflower and poured myself the dregs of my last bottle of whiskey i felt an insidious temptation to let the ebbing tide take me to sea but instead i slept and in the morning went ashore and found a public phone the bullet had to be bitten charlie must know that i was back in england and that all his generosity had not bought me the freedom he so envied i phoned his yard but he wasnt in his office so i called yvonne she sounded surprised to hear my voice but did not ask where i was or what i wanted she said charlie was away from home in hertfordshire again scotland i think she didnt sound as if it mattered very much hes subcontracting on a roadwidening scheme tell him im back yvonne im moored in the exe at the moment but i dont know how long ill stay here but he can always try the channel radio stations she did not sound very pleased but promised to tell charlie when he called home perhaps she thought id come to take more money off him i said goodbye to her then called directory enquiries to find the number of the buzzacott museum gallery this was a harder bullet to bite but it had to be done i asked for jennifer pallavicini but the man who answered the phone in her office said she was in new york she was expected back soon but in the meantime was there any message tell her that john rossendale called and that im back in england tell her she can probably reach me by radio i gave him a list of coast radio stations and sunflowers call sign the man was clearly bemused but docilely took down the information then because i had nothing better to do i took sunflower to sea i knocked about the channel for a few days i was tempted to visit jersey but i did not know what good it would do georgina might be pleased to see me but i could offer her no reassurances so i chickened out i visited a friend in lèzardrieux and tried to persuade myself i was in love with a waitress in his riverfront cafe jacques drove me to the casino at dinard where despite my avowal that i couldnt afford to gamble i won three thousand francs when the francs didnt change the waitresss mind i went downstream and anchored off the ile bréhat where i stayed for two days i listened to the traffic lists on the vhf but neither sunflowers name nor her call sign were ever mentioned i made one link call to the buzzacott museum gallery charging the cost to elizabeths home number but jennifer pallavicini had still not returned after two days i decided to sail to the scilly isles which id never visited the forecast had promised a southeast wind but three hours off the breton coast the wind veered round the compass which meant that i was faced by a devil of a windward flog i held to it lured by the unknown scillies which i reached just after dusk the next day i anchored in porth cressa and spent a miserable night heaving and sheering in strong seas driven by a rising west wind the morning was filthy with rain and blowing half a gale so without going ashore i hauled up the anchor let the foresails turn sunflower and took myself off the wind was gusting to force eight and the seas were heaping into thumping great monsters white crests cascaded down the wave faces another yacht a big moody left the scillies at the same time but by midday i had lost her in the misting squalls which were slithering up towards cornwall i was enjoying myself sunflower was running well hard before the wind and rolling her boom under every few minutes in the early afternoon i caught a glimpse of the lizard black in the grey murk but then a rainstorm blotted it out i heard thunder to the north and saw one stabbing crack of lightning pierce the gloom sunflower slammed her stem into a wave scattered white water twelve feet high then dipped her nose as a following sea swept under her counter this was channel sailing at its best hard fast wet and exhilarating next morning in dartmouth i rowed to the marina where sunflower had been relaunched but there was no sign of barratry i had not really expected to see her so i went ashore found a telephone but could get no answer from charlies house i tried the yard but he wasnt there either i called jennifer pallavicini but she was evidently not back from america for there was no answer from her office to hell with it i thought to hell with it i walked in a gusting breeze among the tourists on the quayside and i wished i was far away except that two caravans in a corner of elizabeths farm were holding me home i needed to solve that problem and i was achieving nothing by knocking about the channel and brooding i went back to the telephone box jennifer pallavicini had told me in horta that harry abbott was the policeman in charge of discovering the mutilated van gogh harry was a bastard but he was a bastard who could be reached by telephone so i called him he wasnt in his exeter office but i held on while he was tracked down he couldnt come to the phone but passed on a message that i should meet him next morning in the café on dartmouths quay i spent the day drying out the boat and washing the salt out of my hair and clothes next morning i rowed ashore early and ordered a double helping of bacon egg sausages and chips i had bought a tabloid and was amusing myself by reading about the vicar whod run off with the organists husband when a hand tapped my shoulder i turned harry abbotts lugubrious and unhealthy face gazed solemnly down into mine the face smiled revealing long yellow teeth oh god i said i havent been promoted that high yet im only a detective inspector but that is very close to being god he reached over my shoulder and stole one of my chips i like chips for breakfast if you want some chips order your own he stole another ive already had a plateful very nice they were too with a spot of vinegar he sat opposite me and sprinkled vinegar on his stolen chip youre looking very well johnny he said if id had my way youd still be in prison now so you failed justice is like the pox he said in the end it gets everyone very funny harry he ordered himself a coffee and spooned sugar into the cup he then lit a cigarette and blew smoke at me did you know jimmy nicholls no he died of smoking just like your mother were you upset by her death johnny piss off harry detective inspector harry abbott looks like a joke hes cadaverous tall grey and apparently always at deaths door but hes a cunning sod when he had interrogated me about the stolen van gogh he had come foully close to persuading me to tell him exactly what he wanted to hear id been innocent but harry had been relentless almost persuading me that i had to be guilty he is not a man to underestimate how do you feel about some nastyminded bleeder taking the kitchen scissors to your mums painting he asked it pisses me off you always did like the painting didnt you you pretended not to but i knew you liked it me now i dont understand it i like a proper painting tits and bums he ignored that it occurred to me once that you might have nicked it because you liked it so much oddly enough im not so very sure that you did nick it now in fact id even go so far as to say that i believe in your innocence johnny perhaps im getting soft in my old age or perhaps ive caught a nasty case of food poisoning from the milk of human kindness but i really do believe that i did you an injustice all those years ago then say youre sorry im sorry johnny he bared his horses teeth at me so tell me you bastard why didnt you report an attempt on your life i know its a miserable life and probably not worth preserving but we are mildly interested in murder attempts i abandoned the rest of my breakfast who told you about that who the hell do you think told me harry took the last sausage from my plate the contessa of course the contessa the only contessa i could think of was a make of boat a very nice make of boat id nearly bought a contessa once harry shook his head in grief for my sanity the contessa pallavicini who else jennifer pallavicini oh of course i keep forgetting youre a nob as well you probably dont use titles amongst yourselves i suppose you call her jennybaby or passionknickers yes johnny i mean jennifer pallavicini bloody hell fire i said softly i had thought i was the one earning pennies from heaven by not using my title and all the time jennifer pallavicini was hiding her own i felt stupid and astonished i didnt know she was a contessa i said limply her mother married the title but shes lady buzzacott now so the daughter uses the handle mind you those italians seem to give away titles with their cornflakes so perhaps it doesnt mean anything i gaped at him shes buzzacotts stepdaughter you didnt know that either no abbott was pleased with himself he leaned back in his chair surprised you did i as a matter of fact yes well you can stop fancying her you evilminded bastard shes engaged to some swiss businessman she doesnt wear a ring i protested a little too hastily thats the modern way isnt it equality and all that rubbish or else she keeps the ring in a bank vault the swiss bloke must be a zillionaire he looked at me closely then gave an evil grin you do fancy her dont you who wouldnt then its your lucky day johnny because she wants to see you i thought she was in new york abbott rolled his bloodshot eyes not everyone crosses the ocean by hanging rags on sticks she flew back yesterday in concorde were going to meet the family you and i itll be very ladida are you sure you dont want to put on a suit im sure i hated the thought of meeting the buzzacott family for i was in no mood for social politeness but by phoning harry abbott i had condemned myself to whatever inconvenience followed for georginas sake harry swallowed the rest of his coffee and snapped his fingers for the waitress to bring the bill its nice to be back on crime again he said happily they took you off it what are you now in charge of school crossings im just a dogsbody he said mysteriously they just gave me this case for old times sake and to save some other poor sod from looking up the files so shall we go johnny boy ive got a car outside but pay the bill first i paid then joined harry in a clappedout rover that he proudly claimed as his own car we drove north and i wondered about a contessa and whether she knew that the swiss are rotten sailors theyre good at making cuckooclocks and presumably they can ski but theyre sod all use at anything else except making money and that was a depressing thought so i tried to forget jennifer pallavicini instead at harrys insistence i told him all about garrard and peel and how charlie had saved me in the nick of time and then when harry had sucked all the juice out of that he told me golf stories all the way to wiltshire we parked on the airportsized forecourt of comerton castle two footmen ran down the steps to open the car doors harry smirked and said he could get used to this style of life we were ceremoniously conducted to the entrance hall where a pinstriped butler waited to greet us he already knew harry but didnt bat an eyelid at my dirty jeans and crumpled shirt welcome to comerton castle your lordship if you would care to follow me we did so care following his silent footfalls through rooms big enough to hold fully rigged schooners the ceilings were painted with riotous gods and the walls fluted with marble columns the furniture was worth a small fortune while the pictures on the walls would not have disgraced any gallery though clearly sir leon did not consider them worthy of his own harry abbott wet his fingertips and tried to smear back his thinning grey hair not a bad pad is it he confided in me then jerked at his jacket and straightened his tie uncomfortable harry i asked christ no we coppers are always slumming with the nobs the nobs were waiting in a glazed terrace filled with potted palms and comfortable sofas sir leon and lady buzzacott smiled a gracious welcome there was no sign of jennifer i made polite small talk i agreed it was a lovely day and such a change after the recent stormy weather yes i had been to sir leons gallery and had been very impressed my daughter told me shed met you at the gallery lady buzzacott said very blandly which suggested that her daughter had also told her that she had put the boot in as well i do wish shed brought you to the house that day and introduced you that would have been very pleasant i said with insincere gallantry i was being polite for georginas sake but i was feeling increasingly resentful it was not that i felt out of place for i didnt but i did feel patronised two days ago i had been racing a gale and now i had to tiptoe through the conversational tulips jenny also told us about her visit to the azores lady buzzacott went on she said you hit a veritable giant only twice lady buzzacott you must call me helen and i shall call you john leon i think john could do with a drink and i know harry wants one i suppose the loveliest thing about being a policeman is that you can drink and drive as much as you like quite right your ladyship harry was being very obsequious and i realised that he probably fancied lady buzzacott which wasnt surprising for she was a beautiful woman the beauty was genuine not purchased in spas and health farms or on some surgeons operating table her hair like her daughters was dark but just beginning to show grey and clearly lady buzzacott had no intention of hiding the grey if she impressed me her husband rather surprised me sir leon was very small very rotund and seemingly rather timid i had expected to meet a frightening tycoon but instead he seemed very eager to please he ordered drinks then took harry abbott off to see some orchids theyll talk golf lady buzzacott said despairingly and i began to like her ive had little else but golf all the way from devon you poor man no wonder you need that drink i had just been served a very large whisky i must say im delighted to meet you she continued because ive heard a great deal about you youre probably a throwback arent you am i of course you are ive no doubt your ancestors went swanning off across the seas to find giant swedes they could hit but youre not really supposed to do it nowadays were all meant to be dull like hans hans jennifers intended im afraid hes having lunch with us he does something in cheese or i think he does but hes so crushingly tedious that ive never really listened i was beginning to like lady buzzacott very much and you i asked how do you stave off dullness i watch leon at work its fascinating is it i must have sounded dubious because i could not understand what the attractive lady buzzacott saw in the diminutive and myopic sir leon except that he was coining the loot like a bandit a lot of people underestimate leon she said with just a touch of warning in her voice hes a pirate i know he doesnt look like one but he is he started in property of course most of the new money did he still has some property interests but mostly he deals in companies now thats how we met hans he owns some food conglomerate and leon couldnt take it over because the swiss government is very protective of their firms so now were all a big happy partnership hans plays golf too she shuddered is there anything more boring than golf now come and sit down and tell me why youre so wretchedly unhelpful about recovering your own picture i sat down at the far end of the terrace sir leon was demonstrating a golf swing with a longstemmed watering can well lady buzzacott prompted me im still not at all sure it is my picture theres no doubt about that lady buzzacott said dismissively then after a few seconds of reflection she looked rather more sceptical well of course theres always doubt about things once the lawyers get involved but leon has taken counsels opinion and it seems that the picture has to belong to your familys trust and that means you your mothers will shouldnt be able to change that i remembered how sir oliver had skated swiftly away from the subject of my mothers will i havent seen the will i said hoping for enlightenment i wasnt disappointed theres nothing in it for you lady buzzacott said apart from some badtempered advice which im sure youd do best to ignore instead your mother left all her property to your sister elizabeth and specifically included the van gogh in that bequest but its very doubtful whether she had the power to leave the painting to anyone shed already given it to the family trust you see in an effort to avoid tax doubtless when she made her will she was hoping that the lawyers could somehow disentangle the mess i dont know why people believe that of lawyers in my experience they almost always make things a great deal more complicated but elizabeth probably believes the will has greater power than the original deed of gift to the trust i said im sure she does lady buzzacott said firmly then with a small prevaricating shrug or perhaps not she and your mother did try to have the trust wound up two years ago they did that was news to me but of course everyone needed your signature and you were swanning off being unpleasant to scandinavians so the trust still inconveniently exists though of course if you died without having any children then elizabeth becomes the trusts main beneficiary its very strange i said how this family knows so much more about my affairs than i do thats because you dont care you have to be very dull to wade through all those tedious documents ah and speaking of dullness heres hans a young tall and sleekly handsome man had come on to the terrace he was one of those foreigners who dress in the english manner which meant he was wearing the most expensive brogues and a tweed suit but all the money had only succeeded in making him look like a tailors dummy hans had yet to learn that the shoes and suit should be worn by his gardener for a full years hard labour before they would look properly english he seemed somewhat taken aback by my wardrobe but looked reassured when i was introduced as an earl perhaps he thought i was one of the eccentric english aristocrats he had heard so much about i asked him how the cheese was going cheese he sounded worried helen told me you were in cheese ah the processed cheese he brightened up indeed but it is only a very small part of our overall business my lord we would like to expand it especially in the american market but the american taste for cheese is not like our own we have to develop brands with a flavour that can endure extreme refrigeration oh look at the time lady buzzacott smiled graciously at her prospective soninlaw would you very much mind telephoning jenny and telling her that if shes lunching with us she should come soon hans clearly confused by his reception dutifully obeyed lady buzzacott caught my eye and i saw from her gaze that she was an altogether more formidable lady than i had at first supposed if you think im being especially nice to you john you are entirely right i am trying to suborn you i want leon to have his sunflowers and i want you to have a good price for them i do hate the way this family patronises me i said though without rancour she laughed delightedly then glanced through the window ah i see that jenny is already on her way from the gallery we shall go through to luncheon and you can hear more about cheese then we shall have our council of war but without hans because he isnt family yet and i suspected from her tone she was not at all sure that she ever wanted hans as family i decided i liked this lady very much indeed so i offered her my arm and took her through for luncheon sir leon and lady buzzacott the contessa pallavicini inspector harry abbott and myself formed the council of war harry did most of the talking and was actually rather impressive lady buzzacott said very little but listened acutely sir leon spoke when necessary and took notes jennifer pallavicini was disdainfully cold she had been cold throughout luncheon almost ignoring me i had noticed that unlike our previous meetings she was wearing an engagement ring a great chunk of diamond which must have cost a lot of processed cheese harry began by describing the world of stolen art the lecture was clearly for my benefit though it did not stop sir leon from making notes in a small leatherbound book the stealing of art works harry said was a most specialised occupation only a very few professional criminals were involved their qualifications were not the obvious ones of breaking and entering premises even though those premises were usually superbly guarded with high technology alarms the essential qualification was the knowledge of who would be willing to pay for the stolen picture the breaking and entering harry said can be subcontracted to runofthemill villains naturally those villains seek an inside accomplice which is why when the stowey sunflowers was nicked we thought johnny here was their inside man lady buzzacott offered me a dazzling smile sir leon made a note in his tiny handwriting while jennifer stared at the ceiling i stared at her she really was very beautiful and somehow the existence of hans had made her even more desirable once the painting is successfully stolen harry went on the contract labour is paid off its a straight fee no percentage and no contingencies his lordship may not know what contingencies you speak of inspector sir leon pointed out in his low voice like if the painting isnt sold no cash the contract labour gets its money as agreed whatever happens got that my lord harry hated calling me my lord but clearly felt it was incumbent in these palatial surroundings i understand you inspector please go on he gave me a filthy look as a reward for my own punctiliousness then heaped sugar into his coffee once the paintings nicked he went on its taken straight to whoever has agreed to buy it and thats the key you see because the buyer is usually lined up before the jobs ever done i mean no one wants ten million quids worth of rembrandt hanging about their house while they try to find a bloke with a bit of unused space on his livingroom wall quite sir leon said in a disapproving tone so the painting goes to the buyer the final cash changes hands and thats the end of the matter the new owner takes care to keep the picture hidden and it may never be found until long after hes dead and the buyers sir leon asked who are they increasingly these days sir the nips but why dont they just buy at auction i asked because the particular painting they want may not be up for sale harry said and because if the deals successful its a lot cheaper than buying at auction you can probably get a topflight rembrandt for a straight million on the black market i still didnt understand why a man able to pay a million pounds could not satisfy himself at auctions i said as much prompting sir leon to lay down his gold pen and look at me you have to understand my lord the nature of a collectors mind it is and i speak with some knowledge a singleminded passion which is entirely consuming it might apply to postage stamps model railways vintage cars porcelain cigarette cards or he paused and i thought he was going to say women works of art whatever is the object of that passion becomes nothing short of obsession even if i might use the words a form of unreasonable and uncontrollable lust a man desires say a particular canvas by picasso and he will not be happy he will not know any satisfaction until that painting is in his possession this form of lust is a disease my lord that distorts a mans perception of reality until he believes that his happiness will be incomplete until he satisfies the desire in all other respects he may seem a most normal man but in that one area so secret and deep he is unreasonable you will have noted my lord that i have constantly referred to the male gender it seems that women are not subject to this particular affliction have i answered your question he had and i realised he had also been describing himself he wanted the van gogh and he would devote his life to finding it sir leon was a collector a very rich one and though he might never stoop to criminality he clearly understood the minds of those who did and was very sympathetic to them but he had no sympathy at all for men who would hold a painting to ransom by mutilating it and it now seems certain sir leon said that the fragment of canvas was cut from the stowey van gogh how can you be sure i asked jennifer answered describing how she had carried the cut corner to new york where the metropolitan museum had subjected it to tests the pigment and canvas are identical to other compositions he painted in the late s her voice sounded rather despairing and i realised how much she must have been hoping that the mutilated corner was not genuine it was not that the painting had been irrevocably ruined by the small excision but she was anguished by the implicit threat that yet more of the canvas could be cut she spilt the scrap of canvas out of its envelope on to the table i picked it up the paint was rough and striated like the texture of a sea blowing up in a brisk wind we dont even know jennifer said whether this was the only corner they sent to a collector perhaps theyre trying to ransom the painting to a dozen rich men maybe harry sounded unconcerned but ill bet my next months wages that they only sent the one fragment they know how badly sir leon wants the painting which means theyre confident hell pay their ransom their biggest worry is exactly how to engineer that payment because theyre frightened of getting caught redhanded thats why theyve given us so much time they know sir leon doesnt need till the end of august to raise the money but they need that time to work out a foolproof handover he plucked the scrap of precious canvas from my fingers and waved it like a small trophy in short he said happily were dealing with amateurs amateurs i asked were not dealing with professional art thieves thats for sure or else the painting would have disappeared long ago and no professional would ransom a painting its too risky do you mean i asked slowly that these people have kept the painting hidden all this time why would they do that why wouldnt they have ransomed it four years ago harry was enjoying himself he had his audience and was relishing his careful reconstruction of an old crime lets go back four years to when the painting was first stolen he thrust an accusing cigarette towards me i reckoned that you nicked the damn thing to stop your mother selling it why on earth would i do that because your mother would have spent the money on preserving stowey which you clearly didnt want so if you stole the painting then hid it till she died you could have kept all the proceeds for yourself in other words my lord i believed you were defending the value of your inheritance by a nasty bit of theft but i was wrong jennifer glanced at me and i wondered if i saw the faintest blush of shame on her face probably not so what makes you think i didnt nick it i asked harry its obvious isnt it the painting belongs to you now so why should you continue to hide it if you had it you could pretend that it had merely been mislaid all these years discover it sell it to sir leon then go out and buy yourself a proper suit lady buzzacott smiled jennifer perhaps reluctant to discard her belief in my guilt frowned sir leon glanced from me to harry then asked the obvious question so who did steal it johnny knows harry in his happiness easily dropped my honorific dont you johnny i think i did but i wasnt entirely ready to believe my suspicions so i said nothing same motive different villain harry lit the cigarette hed been holding for the last few minutes he had clearly been nervous of offending lady buzzacott but his craving for a smoke overcame his diffidence he sucked gratefully at the smoke then looked at me who becomes the beneficiary of the family trust if you die so long as i dont have children i said softly elizabeth the lady elizabeth tredgarth harry confirmed who is a bitter and disappointed lady and a very ambitious one and in her view you are a very unsuitable heir you dont care about the title you never cared about stowey and you dont seem to mind if the rossendale family slides into poverty yet those are things which your twin sister takes very seriously it would suit her very well to inherit a van gogh which she could turn into ready cash and who stood between elizabeth and that tasty little fortune my mother and i i answered dutifully exactly and now theres just you and if you died now johnny your sister will simply claim to have found the painting in your baggage thats why shes so busy telling everyone that shes met your accomplice she has to prove your guilt to establish her innocence he was making elizabeth into a very coldblooded murderer a west country lady macbeth and the portrait did not fit elizabeth was bitter and she was proud and she could be heartlessly ruthless as the two caravans in a nettle patch proved yet i could not see her as a murderess shes no killer i protested to harry women may not be collectors lady buzzacott observed mildly but they are not innocent of greed and many have conceived of murder shes an opportunist harry took up the condemnation of my twin sister i dont think shes had this planned for ever it was your mothers death that sparked her that and your return to england he paused to tap ash into his saucer and remember she has a partner and he is a killer garrard i said more to myself than to anyone else i could understand garrard being a killer but that did not explain why he had beaten jennifer pallavicini on board sunflower that was fear harry explained when i raised the objection ive no doubt garrard went to salcombe to kill you but he discovered the contessa instead what was he to think that i was making a deal with her i ventured which implied harry went on that your sister had made a deal with you garrard was scared that he was being doublecrossed by a brothersister agreement he was frightened that elizabeth would give you the painting to sell on condition that you shared the price with her it wasnt true but ill bet my last brass farthing thats what garrard believed when he found the contessa on your boat sometime in the next few days your sister must have reassured him so he went to georges yard to finish the job properly would your sister have guessed you might be at cullens place i nodded elizabeth would indeed have remembered my old association with cullens yard the pieces were falling into place but i did not like the picture they made its hard to see ones twin as a killer and when your friend charlie barratt stopped that second murder attempt harry went on what happened i sailed away which meant she and garrard had failed harry was pleased with his exposition you were still alive youd disappeared so now elizabeth has a problem the painting is still not legally hers but shes desperate for the money so she has to run the risk of a ransom but she was a little too greedy she tried to put the screws on to your little sisters money as well and that brought you home maybe she even wanted you to come home because my belief is that shed still rather have you dead he looked at sir leon the painting must be worth a great deal more than the amount demanded in the ransom note sir leon hesitated then nodded the value is around twenty million so there you are harry looked back at me your death is worth sixteen million quid to your sister not a bad profit i stood and walked to the window but if shes already got the painting i was seeking a loophole in harrys thesis why doesnt she just fight me in the courts for possession shes got my mothers will as ammunition because shell lose sir leon said harshly but she wasnt even at stowey when the painting was stolen i raised another objection garrard nicked it harry said easily she must have given him keys and told him how to work the alarm system but elizabeth wouldnt know where to find men like garrard and peel i protested harry dismissed that objection horses garrard used to be a good amateur steeplechaser before he turned bad and the racecourses are full of villains he looked happily at the buzzacott family if you ever need a crook thats where to go the racecourse lady buzzacott smiled her thanks for the advice while sir leon looked pained and jennifer just frowned it all worked i could see that harry had presented a wonderful concoction of greed violence and inheritance a very upperclass concoction indeed but i still did not want to believe that my twin sister was a killer that was not because i loved her but rather because just as elizabeth feared the genetic taint of georginas madness so i feared the taint of elizabeths murderous nature i shook my head i dont know harry i just dont know so lets find out harry said cheerfully youre back now so lets see if she tries to knock you off again after all shed much rather sell the painting legally than go through the risks of collecting a ransom and if she and garrard do try murder again well catch them redhanded there was silence so this was why they had wanted my return to be a target none of them looked at me perhaps embarrassed by what they expected of me sir leon cleared his throat i fail to see why collecting a ransom should be riskier than committing murder murder comes out of the dark when you least expect it harry said but if you want a ransom you have to specify a time and a place which gives your enemies a chance to ambush you sir leon shook his head impatiently for my part i find it hard to believe that the recovery of the painting is intrinsically bound up in an attempt at murder he shrugged as though suggesting that his qualifications for making that judgment were not as good as harrys i do believe however in their willingness to exchange the painting for a ransom he turned his myopic gaze to me they have requested that we insert a coded message in the personal column of the times which message would indicate our willingness to pay the ransom of four million pounds on receipt of that message they will instruct us in the method to be used for making that payment i sensed that i was hearing the echoes of an old disagreement sir leon was quite ready to pay any price for the painting while harry was more intent on trapping elizabeth and garrard sir leon still looked at me i see no need for you to be a murder target my lord if youre content then i suggest you allow me to ransom the painting then to negotiate a fair price with you no harry with a surprising asperity slapped the suggestion down once youve agreed to pay the ransom youve no assurance theyll give up the painting theyll just soak you for another four million he looked back to me id rather trick the bastards into showing themselves if youll help oh ill help you i said easily but there is a condition for my help i do assure you sir leon perhaps piqued by harrys strong opposition spoke very irritably that i will pay you the highest imaginable price for the painting indeed im quite certain your eventual price will be far too high i have after all conducted negotiations with your family before those final words whipped at my pride like the recoiling slash of a broken wirerope sir leons voice had been smug and scornful implying that my family though broken and poor had shown nothing but greed the words told me that sir leon despised me and he was showing that derision by letting me know that my greed could never match his fortune he had the power of new money over old families but i would be damned before i would let him patronise me bugger your price i said that shook all of them i dont give a toss about your price and dont equate me with the rest of the family if you negotiate with me then you satisfy my terms and those terms are very simple sir leon you take care of georginas future all of it sir leon blinked at me he had clearly been astonished by my vehemence but not so astonished as to forget that he was at a negotiating table your price as i understand it is your younger sisters security and happiness he gazed at me he had very pale eyes and i suddenly saw that he was not a timid little man at all but a very hard one and your monetary price besides he asked in his most mocking voice he must have known he would get under my skin you can have the bloody painting i matched his scorn with my own why the hell do you think im here because i care about being rich for gods sake i inherited stowey and the painting four years ago and i didnt want them then and i dont want them now i came here sir leon not to save a painting but to save my sister from a squalid caravan in a dripping wood jennifer was staring at me i knew id overreacted to her stepfathers patronising tone id lost my temper said far more than i had wanted to say and now found myself on the brink of giving up a fortune just to prove to this small bastard that not everyone would lick his arse to become rich but at least i had succeeded in astonishing jennifer who was now staring at me as though she had never quite seen me before sir leon smiled i accept your terms my lord one painting in return for your sisters lifelong security he held out his hand think carefully john lady buzzacott warned me in a soft voice jennifer shook her head slightly as though disbelieving that i would take the offered hand sir leon smiled at my hesitation so youre not as pure as youd have us believe my lord you wish to amend the terms of the agreement bugger your amendments i shook his hand which meant that to surprise a multimillionaire and to impress his stepdaughter who was engaged to a squillionaire and despised me anyway id just given away a van gogh and i knew just how my ancestor the seventeenth earl must have felt when he lost all the familys irish estates and all our rich sugar plantations in the caribbean on the single turn of the ace of diamonds i felt like a proper fool harry was almost doubled over with laughter we had left the family and gone into the garden where we were hidden from the house by a big yew hedge what a berk you are sweet jesus what a bloody berk shut up i was far more angry with myself than i was with harry sweet suffering christ he laughed again you gave it away and you only did it to impress that bird how much is it worth twenty million he shook his head in wonderment you gave away a van gogh worth twenty millions i dont care about the bloody money i said bitterly of course you care johnny you just dont want to admit it harry gave a final hoot of delighted laughter i dont care about the money i insisted i never have i wouldnt be a bluewater sailor if i cared about money a bluewater sailor he mocked me with cruel mimicry but you care about the contessa dont you and itll take more than a shabby boat to get into her knickers shes the kind that needs a diamond necklace before every tumble and i reckon youve just blown away your chances johnny youre a crude swine harry but lets hope im a clever one my son he lit a cigarette and stared at a statue of a halfnaked nymph which graced an alcove in the hedge clever enough to stop sir leon paying the ransom thats all he wants to do pay up because he thinks thats the surest way to get his picture he cant wait hes like a kid locked out of the toyshop but i dont believe its as easy as he thinks if they can winkle four million out of him now whats to stop them going back to the well with a bigger bucket they cant be fools they must know its worth more than four million i didnt answer i was still trying to accustom myself to a belief in elizabeths guilt i didnt like her id really never liked her but it was hard to think of her as wanting my death yet harrys arguments had been persuasive why dont you just search elizabeths house i asked him if you find the picture then it will all be over funnily enough my grandmother taught me to suck eggs before you were born johnny dont be a cretin she wont have a bloody van gogh tucked away in the attic its been hidden away for four years and were going to have to be clever if were to get it back then find garrard i suggested im looking for mr garrard abbott said grimly but hes done a bunk so we have to persuade mr garrard to find us he still squinted up at the nymphs mossy breasts a nasty piece of work mr garrard you know him of course i know him harry abandoned the nymph to walk slowly up the newly cut grass to where a fountain sparkled prettily in the afternoon sunshine he sat on the wall that circled the fountains pool and looked at me quizzically he got slung out of the paras for nicking the mess funds then because the fraud squad found him monkeying about with some dodgy bonds he did a bunk and joined one of those mercenary groups in southern africa about five years ago he came home on leave and he never went back hes been smalltime ever since bookies and winkling which is very puzzling harry tapped cigarette ash into the fountains pool why does a topdrawer bastard with a good brain scratch around with lowlife villains he was making good money in africa he must be making more here not now he isnt harry frowned but i reckon garrards bought a share of that picture hes not hired labour johnny but a full partner with your sister and hell be coming after you with a knife because he smells several million quid at the end of the road how do you feel about that im not ecstatic at the prospect but at least youd die in the knowledge that youd helped me solve an old crime up yours too because if im right harry went on theyd still rather have you out of the way with you dead elizabeth can sell the painting on the open market and she wont have to answer any awkward questions about where her fortune came from shell be free rich and laughing and ill be dead not with your uncle harry looking after you he gave me an evil grin with his tombstone teeth and if im clever he went on ill have your sister and garrard behind bars jennybaby will be married to that swiss cheese sir leon will have his painting and youll be as poor as a church mouse because you gave your family fortune away so shall we start letting the evil ones know that you cant wait to be knifed i went to a gap in the hedge to see if jennifer had followed us out to the gardens but the empty lawns just shimmered in the days heat which meant i was alone and poor and about to be a target five days later on a summers day as beautiful as any that could be wished i sailed sunflower into dartmouth the sun shone benevolently and the wind was a wellbehaved force three just enough to shift sunflower along nicely yet not strong enough to jar the launches which carried the television news crews this was harrys malicious way of baiting his hook publicity sir leons publicity department had made the arrangements john earl of stowey once suspected of stealing his familys van gogh was returning to england to help the authorities find it the press release carefully ignored the fact that i had twice visited england earlier in the year instead it was implied that like a prodigal i had just sailed back from unknown waters as i neared the river mouth more launches joined the procession till i began to feel like one of those recordbreaking circumnavigators coming home questions were shouted across to my cockpit but i waved them away i wanted to berth safely first a berth had been reserved for me on the inner side of the town pontoon i sailed sunflower into the narrow space which was just but only just wide enough for me to turn her i was showing off most people would have used the motor for the final approach and the turn into the tide but i hoped jennifer pallavicini was waiting for me on the quay so i sailed sunflower into the confined water between pontoon and quay swung her bows hard over knew id misjudged the flooding tide began to panic and prayed desperately that sunflower would keep way on her as we came up to wind and tide she didnt but hung up and i realised that in twenty seconds the wind and tide would drive my new mast against the bridge which led from the town quay to the pontoon i didnt have time to start the engine so swore instead but then sunflower was saved by a quickwitted yachtsman who told me to heave him a line i did and was ignominiously hauled into the vacant berth where one of the waiting reporters sincerely congratulated me on a fine piece of seamanship the questions were unavoidable now had i heard about the damage done to the painting yes what had made me change my mind and come home to help that damage where had i been everywhere would i sell the painting if it was recovered all the time i was trying to secure sunflower properly tensioning her warps and springs and sometimes cursing at a reporter who got in my way two of sir leons publicity men were trying to impose order on the chaos and only managed to make things worse one photographer went down into sunflowers cabin and started taking flash photographs so i hauled him out and threw him on to the pontoon photographs were taken of that another photographer cheered me up by falling overboard i finally succeeded in locking the boat the publicity men shepherded me towards a nearby hotel where a room had been reserved for a formal press conference jennifer pallavicini was already there i said good morning she said good morning the two of us then sat behind a table while the rabble arranged their lights and microphones a full size reproduction of the stowey sunflowers was framed on the wall behind us i noticed that jennifer was not wearing her engagement ring and decided that she must keep it for private occasions only or perhaps harry abbott was right and most of the time it was kept in a bank vault was it true a woman reporter opened the proceedings that the painting was being held to ransom yes i said could i afford the price you must be joking i said im skint so how will you save the painting by cooperating with sir leon buzzacott which was a cue for the questions to be directed to jennifer who was present on behalf of the buzzacott museum gallery she coolly confirmed that her stepfather was taking full financial responsibility for the paintings recovery but if he pays the ransom the first woman asked will he then have to pay a purchase price to the earl of stowey that purchase price has already been agreed jennifer said how much that was about fifty voices i waited for quiet ive decided to donate the painting to sir leons gallery that reply caused pandemonium i patiently confirmed that they had not misheard me and that i had indeed given the painting to sir leon and wanted nothing for myself why a dozen voices wanted to know because i want the painting to stay in britain and because sir leons gallery will provide the perfect home but why had i given it away werent there galleries that would have paid me millions for the picture im a philanthropist i said ask the contessa here she can vouch for the benevolent side of my character jennifers lips tightened slightly not that any of the reporters noticed how did i feel now they asked instead about my arrest four years before i was never charged i said so i feel it was all a mistake but i had been the chief suspect how did i feel about that flattered did you steal it one idiot asked of course i didnt bloody steal it dont be so bloody stupid sir leons publicity men had impressed on me that i must not be nasty to the press but i didnt really see why they were nasty to me how had i heard about the damage done to the painting the contessa flew out to the azores and told me how did i think my presence in england would assist the police in finding the picture i dont know i said ask them had the police given me any indication of who they thought might have stolen the picture yes that simple affirmative as it was meant to caused a flurry of further eager questions and just as harry had instructed me i qualified the answer i hadnt been given any names i lied but i had received the strong impression that the police werent entirely clueless the reporters tried to suck more meat off that bone but both jennifer and i refused to elaborate jennifer then confirmed that her stepfather was employing specialists in ransom psychology to back up the police effort that was news to me but i imagined it was all a part of panicking elizabeth into rashness jennifer gave the impression that a vast organisation was about to descend on the thieves she was very impressive after the press conference i went back to sunflower and did four interviews for television reporters they all asked the same questions and all got the same answers i obliged the radio reporters afterwards then posed like an idiot for some press photographers by midday the fuss had died down all but for one man who waited till the other reporters had gone then told me his paper would pay me a sixfigure sum if id dictate a candid account of how id nicked the painting from my mother i told him to get lost think about it my lord i told you to get lost come up to london and chat to the editor why not were not talking peanuts here fuck you i said and thumped him in the belly his photographer took a picture of that so i thumped the photographer as well i didnt hurt either man which was a pity but at least my actions saw them off jennifer pallavicini had watched the proceedings from the pontoon and now she stepped down on to sunflowers foredeck youre really trying to be popular arent you i thought the object of the exercise was to announce my intention of retrieving the painting not to win a beauty competition she shrugged that answer off do you always hit people who annoy you she asked only men are you ever hit back frequently i once had the shit knocked out of me in australia she frowned i thought shed taken offence at my language but it seemed there was something else on her mind what do you care about mr rossendale georgina whom i had carefully not mentioned to any of the press why jennifer asked i paused wondering whether to answer because i finally said shes too loopy to worry about herself does that concern apply to everyone whos too weak to look after themselves maybe meaning its none of my business she looked at her watch i think that on the whole and despite your hostility that was a most successful exercise ill see you in the morning mr rossendale i knew she was spending the night with some relatives in totnes but id somehow hoped she might spend some small part of the day with me because just as sir leon was obsessed with my van gogh i was becoming obsessed with his stepdaughter she was truly beautiful but just too selfcomposed she had become a challenge just like the bar at salcombe you wouldnt like some lunch i asked as she walked away no thank you she called over her shoulder not today and up yours too i thought but didnt say it the hook was wellbaited now elizabeth knew where i was and knew i was trying to retrieve the painting harry had warned me that from this moment on garrard and peel might pay me another visit they would be walking into an ambush two plainclothes policemen were always on duty to watch me not quite always harry told me that he couldnt find the manpower or the money to have me guarded throughout england so my guardians would only be on duty when i was in dartmouth itself if i went away from the river harry reasoned garrard and peel could not possibly know where i was going so would have no chance of finding me suppose they follow me i had asked him youd be dead johnny but dont worry the force will send a nice wreath to your funeral after which grim jest he told me his men would work in shifts by day idling with the tourists on the quay above the pontoon while the night shift would keep watch from a cabin cruiser moored astern of sunflower i didnt entirely trust the watchfulness of harrys men so once the pressmen had finally abandoned me i took my dinghy upstream and found a boatyard that could sell me a couple of pounds of lead and a scrap piece of sheet aluminium i went back to sunflower took the head off my new boathook and drilled a hollow into the top of the wooden shaft i didnt have a crucible or furnace so i used an oxyacetylene lamp to melt the lead i dripped it piece by piece into the hollow space i worked on sunflowers foredeck which i shielded with a sheet of scrap iron when id finished melting the lead i wrapped the aluminium about the hollowed section of shaft to give it strength then drilled a hole so that the metal hook could be bolted back into place i used a file to sharpen the back edge of the hook and when it was done congratulated myself on a proper job then because i might not get a chance to use the hook i prepared my other weapons some like the rocket alarm flares were potentially lethal while others like the fireextinguishers were merely nasty if garrard and peel did appear then at least i would have a reception for them and i knew i might need all the weapons garrards reputation was frightening an officer gone bad a trained killer and a man in desperate need of money he did not come that first night i slept nervously but undisturbed in the morning i shaved in sunflowers cockpit and watched the yachts motoring towards the sea it promised to be a warm day there was no sign of any plainclothes policemen but harry had warned me that they would not be highly visible if you can see them he had told me then so can the nasties i slung my shaving water overboard then went below and fried myself a big pan of eggs and bacon i made a thermos flask of coffee then carried the whole breakfast up to the cockpit just in time to see jennifer pallavicini walking down the pontoon good morning i said cheerfully coffee she ignored the offer telling me instead that we had both been asked to appear on an early evening television programme ive said yes for you she said coffee i asked again she looked at her watch thank you she said in a rather grudging voice she stepped down into the cockpit and sat opposite me she was carrying a heavy bag that she gratefully dropped into the cockpit sole bacon and eggs i offered her my own plate she shuddered no thank you i fetched a mug and poured her some coffee as she drank it she watched me wolf down the bacon and eggs dont you ever put on weight she asked at last no lucky you she flinched as i mopped up the egg yolk and brown sauce with a piece of wellbuttered white bread dont you have any idea about healthy eating she was driven to ask well fried and lots of it i said enthusiastically you like to shock people dont you what me never tell me about this television programme i dont want to appear on its in london i groaned tell me how im supposed to get to london for this television programme i dont want to appear on well arrange transport for you how are you getting there i asked hopefully my stepfathers helicopter she answered very distantly letting me know that even if politeness forced her to offer me a ride i should be wellmannered enough to refuse i can give you a lift if you like but im leaving very soon hans and i have to go to a lunch reception at the hayward gallery what are they showing this month i asked collages of squashed cockroaches municipal litter baskets fingerpainting by the islington lesbian collective lateeighteenthcentury english landscapes if you must know i gave her a wink ill give it a miss philistine she said but not angrily indeed it was said almost fondly and the warm tone seemed to surprise her as much as it did me we looked at each other i think we were both taken aback by the affection she had unintentionally expressed she half smiled then hurried to cover that tiny moment of truth well you are she protested too hastily only a philistine would give away a van gogh i did it so youd be hugely impressed by my generosity not to mention my quixotic soul i have this theory you see that women prefer irresponsible rogues to swiss cheese merchants rogues with twenty million pounds she pointed out are marginally more attractive than rogues without i laughed it was an odd moment at one instant we had been at each others throats and suddenly for no apparent reason that i could snatch from the air we were smiling at each other if you must know she said i thought you were an idiot to give it away i nodded thats probably a very fair assessment do you regret doing it she asked in genuine interest i pretended to think about it if it didnt impress you then it was clearly a wasted gesture she smiled and i thought how beautiful she was it impressed me she confessed but if you regret it then i promise you my stepfather wont keep you to it i dont back out of contracts she didnt pursue the subject did you see the television news last night i dont have a television they gave our press conference a lot of time she said and they were especially kind to you they didnt show you hitting anyone and they didnt let anyone hear you swearing untruthful bastards arent they and here are the morning papers she spilt the big bag at my feet i picked up the papers one by one the serious papers had given us a fair bit of space but nothing compared to the tabloids which had jumped all over the story there were a lot of pictures of me most of them in sunflower but a fair number also showed me sitting in the hotel with jennifer pallavicini vagabond earl sails home one caption said you will notice jennifer said that your presence guaranteed us a heavy coverage my presence not yours im not newsworthy she said disparagingly no its the vagabond earl who caught their fancy i lifted a tabloid which had printed her picture larger than mine she looked very sexy in the picture perhaps because the photographer had been almost under the floorboards to aim his camera up her skirt i thought again how good shed look in a bikini or out of one do you ever go sailing i asked her suddenly sometimes she sounded defensive with hans i sounded defensive hans doesnt have time for sailing no a friend of mummys has a ketch a friend of mummys would i thought a big ketch i asked instead at least twice the size of sunflower she said airily you should try small boat sailing i said its wetter and more intimate why dont you come for a sail in sunflower i expected her usual refusal especially after id used the word intimate but surprisingly and after a moments hesitation she gave an abrupt nod all right maybe one day only maybe i asked she smiled a definite maybe it was worth giving up a van gogh for that feeling it really was i must have smiled for she smiled back at me but then i had to look away because running footsteps were suddenly loud on the pontoon bridge and a voice was shouting for me johnny you bastard johnny i twisted round already reaching for the weighted boathook but my importunate visitor was neither garrard nor peel but charlie i noticed one of the plainclothes policemen running along the quay towards the pontoons bridge but when i stood with a welcoming expression on my face my guardian angel relaxed charlie i shouted god almighty he ran down the pontoon leaped on to sunflowers counter then jumped down on to the mass of newspapers in the cockpit you bastard he was clearly pleased to see me he slapped my back i introduced him to jennifer who nodded very coolly mr barratt she said in acknowledgement of the introduction charlie looked from jennifer to me then back to jennifer im not interrupting am i no mr barratt you are not all her previous coolness had returned she retrieved her bag ill see you this evening my lord where at the studios of course a car will pick you up here at one oclock youre supposed to be in london by fivethirty so that should give you more than enough time its nice to have met you mr barratt charlie watched her walk all the way down the pontoon then sighed that is tasty johnny that is very tasty and engaged to a swiss cheese zillionaire he snapped his fingers suddenly shes the one who was on the telly with you last night thats the one hell fire he sat down heavily tell me it isnt true tell you what isnt true he was staring up at me with a very worried expression you didnt really give the picture away did you yes he closed his eyes christ on the cross i saw you on the telly last night and i couldnt believe what you were saying hes mad i thought off his poor little twist youre as bad as georgina come on charlie his accusation had angered me what the hell am i supposed to do with the bloody thing sell it you bloody fool he said just as angrily i laughed i couldnt stay angry with charlie i sat opposite him and told him all about georgina and elizabeth and how id visited perilly house and seen the two caravans which i suspected were intended to be georginas new home i explained how sir leon had promised to take care of her future for me and how that was more important than some damned picture however glorious that picture might be charlie leaned his head against the lower guardrail elizabeth was going to shove georgina into a caravan yes he uttered a crisp judgment of elizabeth then another less crisp on me but you still gave it away i dont believe it he seemed extraordinarily worried and it suddenly occurred to me that perhaps he had thought that should i succeed in finding the picture i would pay him back for all the thousands he had spent on sunflower if its the money charlie i said then dont worry sir leon will give me enough to pay you i might have given up the purchase money but i dont mind asking for a few thousand as a reward bugger the money im thinking about you he helped himself to the mug of coffee jennifer had abandoned i suppose you realise that elizabeth will probably take you to court and challenge your right to give it away perhaps but not i thought if she was hiding it charlie sighed you have a rare talent johnny for going up shitfilled creeks and chucking away paddles he offered me a lit cigarette then lit one for himself whos the copper on this one harry abbott again jesus wept he was truly disgusted youre not bunking up with bloody harry are you he frowned evidently thinking of the press conference and harry knows whos got the painting i smiled knowing my next answer would amuse charlie elizabeth charlie stared at me in surprise then scornfully rejected the idea harrys off his twist he reckons elizabeth stole the painting or someone did it for her bloody hell but elizabeth married money didnt she theyre skint he thought about it for a few seconds then tacitly conceded that his initial scornful rejection might have been mistaken she always liked money didnt she he stared at me and i saw the penny drop johnny she tried to have you killed thats what harry thinks which means shell try again charlie was smart very smart and he twisted on the thwart to stare at the man who had chased him down the bridge on to the pontoon he snapped his fingers at me youre being guarded johnny you got it charlie not all the time because harrys a cheapskate copper but so long as im on the river ive got company youre daft he said plain daft he had spoken ruefully now he stood up i dont know johnny i thought youd be halfway to the west indies by now hell i was going to bring joanna out there for a fortnight therell be other fortnights charlie maybe he looked at his watch ive got a meeting up on the m extension its a brand new motorway and its already crumbling to shreds still i mustnt complain its all money look after yourself johnny im trying but if you want my advice he said morosely id bugger off i wouldnt trust harry abbott and i certainly wouldnt trust that buzzacott mob theyve already conned a painting out of you so what will they take next he climbed on to the pontoon maybe ill drop by on my way home i wont be here this afternoon charlie oh of course youre off to london with your girlfriend he paused on the pontoon youre an idiot johnny am i youre getting involved he flicked his halfsmoked cigarette into the river then stared gloomily at me do you know why i like you because from the very beginning right from the beginning you were always different you never gave a damn you didnt give a monkeys about a bloody thing youd do anything for a dare but now now youre letting those rich buggers call your tune youre joining them johnny and theyll use you he pointed an accusing finger at me go back to sea johnny youll be happier there ill go back soon go now before they tame you i smiled then watched him walk away had charlie been tamed i didnt know what i did know was that i had let down my friend i had let him down by throwing in my lot with other people and i abruptly realised that charlie was upset because till now he had always seen himself as my protector now he felt betrayed and i felt rotten but i wouldnt change my course not yet for georginas future and my own stupid hopes depended on it not hopes of a painting nor of a reward but of jennifer i chained the dinghy to the coachroof so that no thieving creep would steal it locked sunflower told my police guards that id be going away and that id phone the local station before i returned then went to london to my chagrin hans had accompanied jennifer pallavicini to the television studio the happy couple were waiting for me in the hospitality room where hans greeted me politely then stood smiling by as jennifer and i made small talk her friendliness of the morning had dissipated though she did say that she liked charlie you did i sounded surprised for shed behaved very coolly when she met him he looks a very capable sort of man hes that right enough i told her tales of our adventures together and recounted the time when we had nearly died in the tasman sea storm and how charlie had sung all the way through the ordeal because he said hed be buggered if he went to hell crying hes a good man i said warmly and you define a good man she observed icily as being someone who can sail small boats in big storms i reflected that it was a more reliable definition than being a genius with the processed cheese but managed to avoid saying as much instead i was buttonholed by the programmes presenter who told me what he wanted me to say it was evident that id been cast as the rogue aristocrat unstable unreliable and somewhat mysterious while jennifer i assumed had been invited in case i proved to be tonguetied in which case she could be relied on to keep speaking we did our television programme the interviewer treated me like a cretin and i obliged by being suitably arrogant when i was asked why id given away the van gogh i simply replied that i didnt want it the audience seemed to like the interview jennifer was more loquacious explaining the importance of the missing painting then paying a very nice tribute to my generosity the audience applauded me the whole thing was quite painless and all over within twenty minutes we were shown back to the hospitality room where we were offered warm white wine and stale sandwiches there was no sign of hans he had to catch a flight to geneva jennifer explained she looked very excited perhaps because she had enjoyed the interview more than she had expected it was fun wasnt it was it of course it was dont be so boring i think id like to be on telly more often you were very good i said loyally then we shall celebrate my success by having dinner she was suddenly bouncing with happiness and my own happiness was increasing because of it we went to a restaurant where we could eat outside and in the lanternlight she told me about her childhood and about the american university where shed majored in fine arts then about her apprenticeship at a london auction house and her first proper gallery job in florence i tried to put a timespan on various jobs and decided she must be twentyseven and you she asked what about you i thought youd done all that research on me maybe it was wrong she caught my eye and we said nothing for a moment and i wondered if all the former hostility between us had been merely a disguise for what we had both been feeling i think i already knew that this was a girl worth staying ashore for and if that was an exciting thought it was also somewhat frightening maybe she felt the same fear for she suddenly looked away and posed a brutal question tell me about your brother why did he kill himself he couldnt cope with what the problems of stowey mother life debts disappointment jennifer frowned disappointment i lit a pipe taking my time over the job it was very important to michael that he was going to be an earl he thought it would make him important he couldnt wait for father to die he wanted to see the forelocks twitching when he walked by and he wanted to wear the ermine and he fancied hobnobbing in the house of lords and when he finally inherited he suddenly discovered that it didnt make a blind bit of difference he was still just the same indecisive idiot that hed always been mother kept pushing him to do things to the estate which he didnt have the guts to try and she also wanted him to marry some monstrous creature from the fens which he couldnt face so in the end he just bunged a doublebarrel into his mouth and put his big toe on the trigger for a few seconds she didnt speak then she frowned you can be very flippant at times can i she didnt reply instead she just stared at me as though this was the very first time she had really taken notice of me and i suddenly was frightened because i knew i was being judged and i wanted that judgment to be favourable listen i said life can be very shitty it can be tough it can be the pits so theres only one rule and thats never to give in bad luck comes to all of us so what must you do you fight it you claw at it you kick the shit out of it but you never ever ever give in you only go through this vale of tears once so for gods sake make it a good voyage so if im flippant thats only because its better to make light of a disaster than to cry over it i had spoken with more vehemence than i had intended jennifer had looked away from me to stare down at the table so i could not see what she had made of my words what do you think about when youre out there she asked after a while on your own at sea survival is that all it isnt all i started though i couldnt explain the rest of it so shrugged instead you have to be there to know i knew my words had been inadequate i looked round the small courtyard where diners sat at a dozen tables they looked content wealthy attractive happy they also looked plump selfimportant and trapped once i said awkwardly i watched a meteor fall past the southern cross it was a big one a great blazon of light across the darkness and i cant explain why thats important or what i felt except that to see it even once in all its glory is worth an awful lot were you alone yes and you didnt want to share it with anyone oh yes she smiled at that answer but kept silent so tomorrow i took the plunge for happiness why dont you come to devon with me and well have a day at sea to watch the stars fall maybe she raised her glass waited for me to do the same then touched her rim against mine ok she said simply and i was in heaven we stayed that night at sir leons house in mayfair i was given a guest room and didnt ask for more we were up long before dawn and while i made coffee and toast jennifer raided the freezers and kitchen cupboards for our lunch we were much too early for a radio weather forecast so i phoned the commercial service and listened to their tape recording what do they say jennifer asked me when i put the phone down sounds good i said absentmindedly a real skirtlifter a real what she turned on me with mock fierceness force six gusting seven i said contritely then carried the bags down to the garage where she opened the door of a battered ford escort yours i asked she heard the surprise in my voice what did you expect a lamborghini a porsche at least im sorry to disappoint you she dangled the keys above the car roof do you want to drive no thats good i like driving she raced the car through empty dark streets neither of us spoke much at first it was too early in the morning yet there was a distinct feeling of excitement just days before we had been snapping at each other like strange dogs now suddenly we had the comfortable intimacy of friendship there was also the anticipation of something more than friendship it was that anticipation which touched our commonplace with excitement we both felt it and we were both happy she drove like charlie fast competently and with a blithe confidence that the police would ignore her they did we sped past heathrow and windsor and only then did she break our silence she talked about the books she was reading and scorned me with laughter when i told her i thought four books sufficient for life she described the buzzacott museum gallery calling it her stepfathers fantasy and obsession thats why he pursued money so ruthlessly she went on just so he could build his fantasy and hes very rich i commented sourly very she ignored the jealousy in my voice it was the property world that started him off it still pays well i think but he keeps mummy and me a long way away from the seamier side of his activities seamy i asked a bit i think she didnt elaborate the sun rose behind us casting long shadows and promising a fine day though i doubted looking at the bare sky whether the forecast of a skirtlifting force six would prove correct not that it mattered for this day was not really about sailing but about exploring a friendship and we had plenty of time for that exploration for we were in dartmouth long before breakfast time i hadnt told harry that i was returning which meant my guardian angels were home in their own beds their absence made me feel oddly nervous so i didnt waste any time getting ready for sea i cast off sunflowers springs led the bow warp back to the cockpit hanked on the big genoa and took off the mainsail cover arent you going to motor her out jennifer asked me im going to show off and sail us out it was a happier experiment than my arrival on the pontoon the breeze was from the east an errant morning wind caused by the hills about the river the tide was ebbing i hoisted the jib let it flap released the bow warp then hauled the jib flat to starboard the wind swung our bows fast off the pontoon just clearing the transom of the boat ahead i slipped the stern warp let the jib sheet run so that the sail was reaching then hauled in all my loose warps sunflower ghosted out of the narrow space like magic jennifer applauded im impressed did you see my arrival she shook her head dont tell me i missed another of the master mariners impressive displays technically i said my arrival here was what we master mariners call a cockup i thought you might be watching tried to impress you by doing it the hard way and very nearly wrapped the mast round the bridge she laughed serves you right i gave her the helm while i stowed the fenders then hauled up the big main the wind was fitful backing north but at least blowing us to sea it was obvious the weathermen had got it wrong again the wind was force two sometimes three but i sensed even that gentle breeze wouldnt last the sun was climbing to shimmer the sea and already there was a haze above the slowly receding coast i watched the river entrance as we drew away a gaffrigged cutter had followed us out but had now turned eastwards towards torbay a whaledecked brixham trawler was plugging in the opposite direction but apart from a handful of dinghy sails in the river mouth there was nothing else in sight safe at last i said facetiously jennifer looked back towards the coast id rather forgotten about those two men i hadnt she grimaced my stepfather thinks youre being very foolish hed prefer to pay the ransom but i suppose he cant really argue with inspector abbott hes meant to be the expert harrys no fool i said i might be though making myself a target still were safe now she frowned suppose they saw us leaving suppose theyre following us i shook my head theyre too late already the river mouth was indistinct and the land fading like a mirage in a few minutes we would be alone in the empty sea besides i went on to reassure her ive got a radio so if we see anything suspicious ill scream blue murder to the coastguards it occurred to me that harry would be the one screaming blue murder when he discovered that id returned without informing him so i punctiliously called the brixham coastguard and gave them a routine passage report yacht sunflower daysailing off dartmouth expecting to return to port sometime that evening i asked them to relay that information to the dartmouth police station they must have been mildly surprised at the request but promised to make the call jennifer had installed herself in the navigators chair and was admiring the electronic display which charlie had insisted on building over the chart table whats this she asked a decca set whats a decca set i explained the chain of coast radio transmitters which pulsed their signals to sea and how the little black box translated the signals into a position this was the first time id used charlies gift so i had to tell the machine roughly where we were it paused then the aerial found the signals and the display updated itself with our exact position jennifer was enthralled i entered the latitude and longitude of st helier in the channel islands and jennifer read the course and distance off the display so all you have to do is follow that course and youll get there not exactly i found a chart and showed her how the decca course would take us straight across the islands of guernsey and jersey so what wed have to do i said is put in another waypoint here i pointed to a patch of sea north of the roches douvres then make st helier the second waypoint waypoint she asked posh name for destination you pick the waypoint and the machine tells you how to get there she looked at the electronic display which was showing a small bent arrow and some apparently meaningless figures whats it telling us now its assuming were trying to sail the direct line to st helier so its telling us that were a tenth of a nautical mile off course to port travelling at knots on a heading of true and that we should be heading true she stared admiringly at the display i thought you master mariners did it all with sextants most of the time we do i said because you run out of decca range as soon as you leave europe so then she wanted to see the sextant i took her up to the cockpit and showed her how to bring the sun down to the horizon she wanted to try for herself so i settled back and watched as she braced herself against the companionway she was worth watching she was wearing a shirt and jeans and had her short black hair tied back with a band its green she exclaimed when she first saw the sun in the mirror then frowned as a quiver of her right hand jarred the sun loose a moment later she managed to hold the sun steady on the mirror then bit her lower lip in fierce concentration as she moved the index arm the trick of it was to move the index arm to bring the sun down while holding the rest of the instrument absolutely steady so that the horizon stayed fixed in the sight glass done it she said triumphantly read me the scale she had done it too i checked by taking my own sight is that all there is to it she asked mockingly that and a lot of very tedious mathematics its also a bit trickier to do when the boats heaving up and down in a rough sea or if youre trying to find one star among a million but on the whole thats all there is to it the genoa slapped a protest at the fading wind i switched off the decca and put the sextant away i let jennifer steer though there was little to do for the wind was dying on us whistle i said to her whistle its supposed to bring the wind she laughed but didnt try the old magic i stretched myself lazily on the leeward thwart shouldnt you be working i teased her of course i should be working why arent you because im rich and spoilt and can take days off when i like isnt that what you expected me to say is it true she made a face partly which is why i usually work very hard she hauled in the mainsheet but it didnt make the boat go any faster i also wanted to be with you she added in a shy and surprising explanation she had not looked at me as she spoke i said nothing waiting till she caught my eye mutual i said then happiness sometimes comes in cloudbursts there was a pause as we shared that happiness then in friendly warning she deliberately broke the mood but dont be too hopeful john rossendale hans has my heart such as it is lucky hans except this is work really she said hastily perhaps wondering whether she had said too much and was now trying to draw a little of it back if were going to get the painting back then i have to cooperate with you dont i absolutely we sailed on in companionable silence the coast was nothing but a dark blur in the shimmering haze a small workboat sped past a halfmile to starboard id watched it approach from astern but it had made no effort to come near us i stared at it through the binoculars and saw that it carried a halfdozen hopeful men with seaangling gear i could not see garrard on the boat so i relaxed it was getting warmer so i stripped off my shirt then lay back again and pillowed my head on the coiled genoa sheet sleepy jennifer asked just lazy im not used to being chauffeured dont you get bored with sailing alone i dont always sail alone she thought about that for a while girls thank god yes i told her about the hitchhikers who wandered the tradewind routes how they lived from island to island boat to boat and one summers day to the next they make me feel very dull she said i cant think why you seem very exotic to me exotic rich beautiful and engaged to the king of swiss processed cheese she laughed i cant think why youre so nasty about hans you only met him twice and he was perfectly pleasant to you it was my turn to betray an intimacy to offer her some vulnerability of my own i dislike him because hes engaged to you im jealous she smiled acceptance how nice it was that kind of morning flirtatious and happy and the flirting sometimes veered very close to something deeper but we both avoided it i wasnt going to hurry her one learns patience at sea and i would be patient by late morning we had entirely lost sight of land the wind had died to nothing and the sea was slapping petulantly at sunflowers hull we simply wallowed in a long lazy swell the small fishing boat was drifting a mile away i guessed the men had abandoned hunting inshore for bass and had come out to the deeper water to find mackerel jennifer stood up and rather decisively peeled off her jeans and shirt the abruptness of the gesture somehow invested it with importance as though she had taken another deliberate step on the road to intimacy she was wearing a yellow bikini i had been right she did look good in a bikini in fact she looked wonderful and i said as much i didnt think youd be able to resist a comment she said tartly and i very much hoped i wouldnt be able to resist one the hull rocked in the small waves as the sails slatted from side to side jennifer abandoned trying to sail sunflower and instead stretched herself out on the opposite thwart she lay with her head towards the stern while mine was nearer the cabin so we could look at each other across the cockpit daddy didnt want me to go to the azores she said suddenly i assumed daddy was sir leon why not he thought inspector abbott should go i persuaded him that i stood a better chance of convincing you if youd have dressed like that youd have succeeded if we become friends she said will you persist in making sexist remarks yes she smiled you are a philistine so why did you go to the azores i asked she paused for a heartbeat wondering whether to offer the confession then looked across at me because i wanted to see you i thought that must have been it i said complacently you are a bastard i grinned for someone who wanted to see me you werent very friendly what was i supposed to do jump into your boat singing im just a girl who cant say no it might have broken the ice i sat up momentarily to check that no shipping threatened to run us down nothing did the only vessel in sight was the mackerel boat which had drifted slightly closer i lay down again i very nearly did go back to england with you why didnt you because you made me feel like a puppet something went right then i laughed a gull floated above us decided we werent a fishing boat and slid away sunflowers sails and her red ensign hung limp while charlies wind vane at the masthead lazily boxed the compass mummy likes you jennifer said suddenly i like mummy do you yes im sure you do men always do i prefer her daughter jennifer treated that compliment as merely dutiful did she talk to you about hans yes what did she say in the first place that hes dull in the second that hes duller and in the third that hes very dull she added later that hes extremely dull she laughed but didnt say anything is she right i asked mummys usually very acute about people i digested that one id left the vhf switched on to channel and i heard a squawk as someone called the coastguard to report their passage i waited for the conversation to be switched to the working channel and in the ensuing silence looked across the cockpit jennifer john she mocked my solemnity with her own perhaps i wasnt so patient after all for i suddenly wanted to shortcircuit the mornings flirtatiousness i think im in love with you she looked at me for a long time in silence i wondered if i had spoilt the mood by being too serious but then she smiled how very inconvenient we smiled at each other i knew then that everything was going to be all right it really was hans had lost i didnt know how it had happened so quickly or what would happen next but i knew everything was wonderful happiness filled me like a great glow she sat up pulled off her headband and ran fingers through her hair im told she said happily that the way to a mans heart is through his stomach there are alternative routes she stood and gave my belly a reproving slap for now john rossendale it will be the stomach lunch ill get it you stay there i know what food i packed and you dont besides you doubtless believe a womans place is in the galley so why pretend otherwise she stooped and gave me a very swift kiss on the lips i made a grab for her but she was too fast for me she laughed and swung herself down the companionway steps i listened to her unpacking the food i was happy so very happy transported to some new region of goldtouched warm and loving contentment wheres the tinopener she called in the cavelocker behind the sink wine glasses hanging in a rack over your head soup plates use the big coffee mugs she began singing im just a girl who cant say no and i wanted to laugh aloud because i knew she was as happy as i was sunflower rocked gently small waves slapped at her steel chines the sky was pale blue with just the faintest hint of high cloud wisping she stopped singing matches in a waterproof plastic container beside the cutlery tray you strike the match on the inside of the container lid she started singing again then stopped almost immediately why wont the gas turn on because you have to switch on the gas feed tap which youll find by the engine bulkhead under the companionway steps and i have to switch the main feed on back here then do it she said aye aye captain i sat up i saw that the skipper of the mackerel boat had started his engine and was going away from us into the heat haze i opened the transom locker where i kept the cooking gas bottles the locker had a drain to the open air thus if one of the bottles leaked the lethal gas would drain harmlessly outboard i heard jennifer grunt as she turned the feed tap which was uncomfortably stiff she started singing again as she went back to the narrow galley which was midships on the starboard side i reached into the locker and tried to turn on the main valve it wouldnt turn i heard the rattle as jennifer opened the matches and i suddenly realised that the gas valve was already turned on and i had never ever left it turned on not once in four years which meant that someone else had been aboard sunflower i twisted desperately round no i roared but she struck the match just as i shouted and the happiness vanished ask any sailor what they fear most and they wont cite the sea or careless merchant ships or rocks but fire and almost every yacht afloat carries a firebomb aboard the bottles of liquid gas they use for cooking the gas is heavier than air if it leaks it settles down to the bilges where it lies hidden and deadly waiting for the spark some yachts carry a gas detector but id never thought to put one on sunflower instead i relied on the taps one on the bottle itself one where the gas pipe enters the main cabin and the usual taps on the galley stove i was punctilious about keeping all the taps closed unless i was actually cooking for there is nothing i fear so much as a gas leak most days i hand pumped the bilges not for any water but just in case a tiny amount of gas had leaked the pump will carry it to the outside air but it was a chore i usually performed in the evening that day wallowing in the swell off the hidden devon coast the bilge and the cabin sole were unpumped and lethal because while i had been in london and while the boat had been unguarded someone had been aboard sunflower and they had turned the taps and let the silent deadly gas seep into the cabin the gas doesnt smell it just waits for a spark or a flame jennifer struck the match and screamed it was not an earsplitting explosion it was a soft roar red flame filled the cabin i could hear jennifer screaming beyond the fires noise her scream seemed to go on and on and on the fire was thickening with appalling swiftness flame and smoke pouring out of the open companionway as if it was a chimney the slatting mainsail was already scorched up to the third reef points the noise of the fire was like a seething hiss beyond which jennifers scream slowly faded i was shouting incoherently merely making a noise to tell her that i was there and shouting to give myself courage there were a dozen things i maybe should have done i should have turned off the main gas valve i should have dragged one of the fire extinguishers out of the starboard cockpit locker i should have darted a hand through the fire to grab the vhf microphone and send a mayday i did none of them instead and without really thinking i plunged down into the flame i had been turning and shouting in the cockpit as the explosion erupted out of the cabin and i did not pause to think that i was throwing myself down into the fire i simply kept moving towards the sound of jennifers fading scream i put my hands on the coachroof either side of the companionway and swung myself down i dropped into unimaginable pain it was like falling into the jetflame of an oxyacetylene lamp and i saw as i dropped down how a piercing lance of flame was seething into the cabin from the engine bulkhead my ankle was on fire bubbling and spitting even through the pain i realised that it was there where the pipe came through the bulkhead that the gas line had been cut i scrambled away from the flame jet and fell against the cabin table i had to take a breath and filled my lungs with burning gas i was blinded by heat and smoke choking and sobbing and still trying to shout to jennifer i wanted to tell her to survive to hold on to live light flared to my right a brilliant and searing light as the charts caught fire i didnt feel the pain i lunged through the smoke to the galley compartment where i felt jennifer rather than saw her she was crouched down and i simply scooped her up as if she was an unwieldy sailbag and kept on moving i hit the forecabins door and smashed it down with our combined weight jennifer screamed with pain the air was suddenly cool then instantly heated as the fire found the new oxygen and slashed in after us jennifer was moaning black smoke writhed round us i dropped her against my small workbench reached up and undogged the forehatch get out i was shouting at her but at the same time pushing her upwards smoke poured past us i realised she was beyond helping herself so shoved her out i followed her then slammed the hatch shut the main cabin looked like a blast furnace as it belched a horror of flame and smoke out of the companionway the mainsail was on fire there was no chance of reaching the radio now i could already feel the heat coming through the teak planks laid over the thin steel deck i could see no other boats i didnt want to look at jennifer i had caught glimpses of her burned skin and i had heard her screams the dinghy was still chained to the coachroof so i yanked the liferafts lanyard the lanyard pulled out the split pin which held the metal container to its securing bolt the container rolled towards me i picked it up and hurled it over the guardrails it splashed into the calm sea tethered to sunflower by its line and ripcord i yanked the ripcord which was supposed to inflate the raft but instead it just floated like a fat white keg of beer i jerked the cord again achieving nothing i swore at the bloody thing the deck was already burning the soles of my feet and i knew the coachroof would already be red hot so i couldnt reach the chained dinghy a scrap of burning sail material landed in my hair something exploded in the cabin below and i assumed the fire had reached the emergency flares the hull lurched and i knew the fire must have burned through the plastic lavatory pipes and that the sea was already flooding through the seacocks into sunflower she was doomed i had two lifejackets but they were aft where the fire was hottest so was my single lifebelt which was attached to the danbuoy on the stern i began to dance on the deck trying to cool my feet jennifer was twitching and moaning her scalp was smoking where her hair had burned away her legs looked as if theyd been skinned and blackened she was going to die because the bloody liferaft wouldnt work and because i didnt have a radio any more and because some bastard had broken into my boat and made it into a death trap jennifer suddenly screamed again because of the heat in the deck she reached towards me with fingers turned into stiff dark claws further aft the teak deck planks were lifting and smoking burning scraps of sail were falling around us to hiss on the sea or flame on the deck there was no choice left now none i picked jennifer up in my arms making her scream and i knew she would scream more in a moment because of the salt water but i would give her a few more minutes of life because theres always a chance of a miracle so long as you dont give up never give up never i carried her to the port gunwale put one foot over the guardrail then jumped the sea was blessedly cold but the salt must have been like acid on her burned skin i held her body above mine so that her grotesquely blackened head was out of the water i had one arm round her neck the other about her waist while i kicked with my legs to force us away from the burning boat i could smell her roasted flesh she was babbling moaning screaming choking i was talking to her telling her she would live that everything would be all right that she mustnt give in every few seconds the water would slop into my mouth choking me i twisted my head to catch a glimpse of sunflower the fire had reached the aft locker where the spare gas bottle was kept at first the fire merely melted the regulator valve so that a white spear of flame seared across the smoke in the cockpit then the gas bottle exploded the diesel fuel was making the flames deep red and the smoke even blacker her red ensign disappeared in a single flare of fire she was settling by the bows her mainsail was gone and her genoa was burning into ash somehow the mast stayed up i could see the liferaft container bobbing merrily and uselessly alongside the blistering hull the bows dropped further everything flammable in the cabin must have been well aflame by now lockers foam bedding papers clothes cooking oil table chart table my money my passport everything in the world i owned all now an inferno that pumped flame and smoke out of the open companionway sunflower suddenly lurched sideways and i feared the mast would fall on us so i kicked with my feet again and the motion pushed my head underwater when i surfaced again i saw she had dipped her bows under the sea reached the hawsehole and filled the chain locker she sank further i was treading water desperately i was tiring i was beginning to feel the pain where my legs had been burned and the moment i began to feel it so the pain suddenly became excruciating and i knew that the anaesthetic effect of adrenalin was wearing off it must have been worse for jennifer except she was only half conscious the sea reached sunflowers forehatch which undogged fell open and let the water surge in the stern swung further up so that i could see her rudder and propeller steam was hissing and mingling with the smoke as the fire fought the sea the sea would win because it always does and slowly slowly i saw my boat begin her long slide down to the sea bed shed taken me to far far places wed sailed the bloodred sea off cape non and hove to off the cliffs at cape bojador which the old navigators had thought was the place the world ended wed sailed the whitsunday islands and dared the pirates in the philippines wed anchored in mangrove swamps in florida and sailed the harbours of maine wed rounded the horn twice but wed never sail together again for now she was sinking and it seemed as if the fire was compressed or else the steam was superheated for the jet of vapour and flames and smoke became a solid roaring plume that was being pumped three hundred feet into the summer sky it seemed extraordinary that one small boat could make so much filth then she went the masttip went under the cockpit reared up then with one last puff of flame and dark smoke sunflower dragged herself down something hissed on the seas bubbling surface there was a pause then the liferaft still tied by its rope to the sinking hull was pulled down and out of sight floating burnt wreckage was all that was left that and a dirty smear of smoke that lingered in the summer air jennifer was moaning and i knew she was dying i also knew i was tiring and that soon i would be forced to let her go and she would roll over her mouth would fill with water and she would drown that realisation made me angry so i cursed her for dying i told her she would live i told her she would bloody well live i told her to stop her pathetic whimpering and to start kicking with her legs i told her she was a spoilt damned rich bloody bitch who deserved to die if she didnt wake up and swim i cursed her in three languages and four letters and i might as well have saved my breath for she did not recover consciousness and i was tiring and every swear word drained another scrap of precious energy in the end i stopped cursing her i remember telling her that i loved her but then i had no more energy to talk for all my strength was needed to keep us afloat my legs were agony and felt like lead more and more often the water would slop into my mouth i would choke and spit and struggle to gain an extra inch of airspace i held jennifer with one arm and paddled with the other but i was losing the battle the hallucinations began i saw a boat coming to pick us up it was a great schooner whitehulled with a reaching bowsprit the illusion was so exact that i could see the chain bobstay beneath the bowsprit and the gilded wood carving where her figurehead might be men leaned over from the bows to pluck us from the water and i reached up to catch their hands and the act of reaching up plunged me underwater and the hallucination vanished in a blow of reality as sea water choked my gullet i struggled up and pulled jennifers burned head from the water for all i knew she was already dead but i would not let her go i was crying not out of pity but frustration there was no schooner there was nothing but the sea and sunflowers funeral smoke and one seagull gliding past i saw a beach it was very close the beach was long and sandy backed by low grasscovered dunes no one was on the beach but a shingle roof rising above the dunes promised a refuge i swam towards the beach the hope of safety seemed to give me a new manic energy and i muttered in jennifers ear that we were going to be all right now that all we had to do was survive the surf and id go to the house and find help weve reached america i said because now i could see the stars and stripes flying from a flagpole in front of the house the illusion was so damned real that i was even wondering how to persuade an american hospital to treat us when we didnt have any credit cards but then a small wave splashed my face and when i opened my eyes again the beach was gone and the flag and the house had vanished with it and there was only the empty sea and sky jennifer was heavy in my arm the sea was seeping its fatal coldness into me and the tiredness was filling me with a great weakness i almost let her go but i made myself hold on to her burned flesh i tried to keep her head above water but my kicking was becoming more and more feeble so that more and more water broke over my face to sting my eyes and fill my throat i told her once more that i loved her she neither made a sound nor moved a helicopter appeared in the sky i cursed this new hallucination because now i only wanted to die in peace the helicopter made a huge clattering noise disturbing me and i swam feebly away from it in the hope of finding a place of great quiet and slow gentle dying again the illusion was crystal clear even to such details as the helicopters shadow sweeping over us and the water churning beneath the blades downdraught i saw the winchman peering down but i fought the illusion because i dared not cling to such imaginary hopes yet the mind persisted and i hallucinated the rope dropping down and touching the water to discharge the helicopters static electricity i cursed the dream a wave swamped us i choked but this time there was no air to breathe i had gone underwater i still clung to jennifer but now i was drowning and she was drowning with me i opened my eyes and found peace the waters surface was like a sheet of waving silver above me no helicopter disturbed that pretty sight my pain had gone my ears were filled with the long hollow booming of the sea and there was peace and gentleness and a shotsilk silver sky of coalescing wonder then the great shape hammered the silver black and it seemed that a man was in the water huge and thrashing and intrusive and i closed my eyes to get rid of the dream and i let jennifer go as i drifted away to nowhere and nothing because it was all over now it was all over and i was finished and everything was ended part four ulf of all people bloody ulf was telling me that sunflowers mast was too high and mounted too far aft he was saying to wake up and move the thing i tried to tell him to shut up but his voice droned on youre all right johnny he said youre not going to die because death is just a mentally induced selfdeception and i told him to stuff his opinions and then i saw that ulf was dressed all in white and had a black face and i wondered how the hell hed ever got into heaven to become a whiterobed angel and i felt a vague surprise that everyone in heaven was black though it did seem a fairly heavenly solution to an earthly problem then i wondered how id ever got permission to enter heaven myself theres been a mistake i said youre all right now said the hallucination of ulf which resolved itself into a blackbespectacled doctor who was bending over me move your hand he said thats good my left ankle and calf were a mass of pain like the time id been stung by a jellyfish off the malaysian coast i hissed and jerked as the pain struck me then tried to explain it jellyfish i said my names mortimer the doctor said doctor mortimer and youre the earl of stowey yes john i said call me john a siren was wailing somewhere and the sound reminded me of jennifers screaming i turned my head to see i was in a small brightly lit room and there was no sign of jennifer is she alive shes alive the doctor said but i was already responding to the drugs that were sparing me pain i slept it had been the mackerel boat which saved our lives they had seen the smoke churning up turned back to investigate and seen sunflower burning they had called the coastguard on channel who had summoned the royal naval air service it had taken just eight minutes from the time that the skipper of the mackerel boat had made his emergency call to the arrival of the helicopter it had seemed like an hour even now looking back and having read the coastguards log i cannot believe it was only eight minutes my legs were badly burned id inhaled smoke and my hands and forearms were scorched it could have been much worse for jennifer it was though just how bad in those first days i wasnt told harry abbott was my first visitor i was barely conscious or coherent i gathered that as soon as the police heard of the burning boat they had feared it might be sunflower and had sent a man to the hospital to identify us i tried to tell harry it was attempted murder but he must already have assumed that because i later learned that a police guard stayed in the corridor outside my ward all the time i was in the hospital i do remember that harry brought me some grapes that he ate himself i asked about jennifer and he just shrugged and said shed been flown to a big london hospital that specialised in burn victims charlie came the next day i had never seen him so troubled i tried to tell him that i was all right that i would walk again but charlie seemed to think he had let me down i should have found those two blokes and fucking killed them you tried charlie bastards he sat beside the bed bastards im going to find them i said and i promise you theyll wish theyd never been born bastards he was too restless to stay seated and began pacing the floor what happened i told him about the severed gas pipe they did a proper job charlie i said bitterly they must have cut the gas pipe in the engine compartment then pushed the broken end into the hole in the bulkhead they had also done it without dislodging the feed tap inside the cabin because otherwise jennifer would have seen the break didnt you lock the engine compartment charlie asked it was only a cheap padlock there you go he said hopelessly it was charlie who had first taught me how to open a locked padlock you just brace the loop against something solid then tap the keyhole end with a hammer if the lock doesnt jump open first time tap harder there are expensive makes that wont respond to the treatment but id lost my good padlock when the two men had pulled sunflower off the grid and my replacement had been a runofthemill lock and the liferaft didnt work i added jesus he was horribly depressed but he forced himself to talk optimistically about the boat which would replace sunflower he said wed pick her out together equip her together and make her maiden voyage together but this time well make sure theres a gas alarm in her i shook my head there wont be another boat charlie of course there will i cant afford one and i wont take your money youve given me enough already youll take what youre given johnny he stopped his pacing and stood staring out of the window bastards he said softly then he turned ruefully towards the bed i told you not to get involved im involved now im going to kill those two for jennifers sake he smiled like that is it its like that he grimaced i often wondered when youd fall johnny i get yvonne and you end up with a millionaires stepdaughter if she lives and if she wants me you saved her life he said as though that gave me full rights over that life no i said disparagingly yet i probably had saved her the helicopter pilot came to tell me as much and so did harry abbott on his second visit he listened glumly as i described the fire and to my conviction that the gas pipe had been deliberately cut i didnt think to guard the boat harry said ruefully only you he seemed genuinely upset at what had happened i want those two harry were looking for them johnny were looking for them and elizabeth if shes behind it who else he lit a cigarette and stared moodily at the bandages on my ankle mind you he went on shes taking damned good care to keep a long way out of it out of it shes done a runner i went to question her see but her husband says he thinks shes in france thinks harry said disgustedly ill not be able to nail her johnny not unless i can find garrard and persuade him to talk then find him harry and give me a few minutes alone with him when you do you know i cant promise you that i took a cigarette off him my precious pipes were gone as was everything else doctor mortimer my black angel had forcibly suggested i use the opportunity to give up smoking but id failed again how the hell does elizabeth have the money to go to france i asked harry i asked her husband that he says she sold your mothers house harry frowned pensively that lord tredgarth hes a miserable sod isnt he i didnt want to talk about peter tredgarth tell me how jennifer is harry he didnt answer for a long time then he shrugged bad how bad i dont know he shook his head dont ask me johnny because i dont know i found out the next day when helen lady buzzacott came to visit me i was sitting in an armchair by the bed and tried to stand when she came into the room she told me not to be so silly and to stay seated she put a bunch of grapes on the bedside table why do the english always take grapes to hospital patients its really a ridiculous habit but quite unbreakable i was getting quite frantic because i hadnt bought you any so i made higgs drive through the town centre and stop outside a fruiterer so there they are and youll probably tell me you hate grapes i like grapes she sat on the edge of my bed youre looking better than i expected john i closed my eyes im sorry i said whatever for she asked the question too lightly i opened my eyes this was difficult this was a meeting i had been dreading but i had to say my piece and i had to let her know that i meant what i was saying im sorry for taking jennifer out in the boat im sorry that i didnt check the gas line before we sailed im sorry i didnt pump the bilges im just sorry about what happened i had begun to cry so closed my eyes again im just sorry lady buzzacott it was my fault im sorry too she said but i dont blame you i couldnt say anything i was blubbing like a child i felt entirely responsible for what had happened to jennifer id taken a lovely girl and i had turned her into burnt meat it wasnt your fault helen buzzacott said very clearly of course you can look back and see a score of things you might have done to prevent it happening but that isnt the point john the point is that you did nothing to cause the accident all you did was go for a days sailing and i cant think of anything more innocent than that shit i said and reached for a paper handkerchief and jennifers going to be all right helen said i looked at her through a blur of tears but said nothing or rather we hope shell be all right helen amended the statement the burns are really quite frightful but im told theyre very skilled at these things nowadays she spoke in a very matteroffact voice but it was clear that she had suffered agonies for her daughter in the last few days of course it will take a lot of time and a horrible amount of surgery but shes got a very pompous doctor who says that in the end shell be as good as new of course one cant tell if hes just telling professional lies but hes certainly a very expensive liar if he is tears were glinting on her cheeks she tried to ignore them theyre starting the first skin grafts tomorrow but i shouldnt be telling you all this i should be asking about you i pushed the box of paper handkerchiefs towards her she took one then caught my eye shit she said through the tears she blew her nose sniffed and wiped her eyes i dont know john i looked at her and i think its impossible that shell ever recover shes no hair left but her face isnt too bad it seems she crouched down and put her face in her hands you see her hands are quite shocking and i gather theyre the most difficult to repair properly but at least she can wear gloves cant she she was crying again then her legs and her back are very bad her bottom is awful but the pompous man says it really will be all right and i cant do anything but believe him hans says she should go to switzerland but i cant see why nor can i i said fervently hans says theyve got very good cosmetic surgeons there but i think hes just being xenophobic he did go to see jennifer but he found it rather upsetting shes been on one of those air beds like an upsidedown hovercraft its too silly really she blew her nose again shes not entirely compos mentis but she did ask after you tell her im fine and very sorry i wont tell her youre sorry you can do that yourself and are you fine doctor mortimer says youre an appalling patient he says you wont give up smoking i cant you should but i didnt think you would so i went to dunhills and bought you some pipes i dont know anything about pipes so ive probably done the wrong thing but here you are she gave me a big bag full of the most expensive pipes i chose some tobacco at random she went on the man in the shop said youd probably be very particular but i just bought what smelt the nicest i took the tobacco youre very kind you did save my daughters life and risked it i said bitterly dont start all that again leon spoke with the helicopter crew and heard all about what you did youre a very brave man no im not i wont argue she took a deep breath i came here to cheer you up and all i do is weep poor john poor jennifer shes a tough creature she takes after her father i think shes certainly too good for that bloody swiss man i agree with that but leon doesnt hes very keen on the marriage he never had children of his own you see so he rather thinks of jennifer as a daughter i keep telling him that all hans ever did was to inherit a vast business any fool can inherit money while it takes a sensible man to make it i asked and reflected that i had made none helen smiled mischievously a sensible man marries it john but i think you know that already now i wont tire you any more i know leon wants to see you soon hes made some arrangements for your younger sister and im sure theyre perfect but you need to take a look for yourself she balled up the scraps of paper tissues then collected her handbag if youve got nowhere to go when you leave hospital then youll be very welcome at comerton i shall be fine dont worry and give my love to jennifer i already have she stood up let us know where you are and dont hesitate to ask if you need somewhere to stay i left the hospital a week later i went with charlie and because i felt safe in his company i told harry to take away the police guard charlie drove me to his house where i limped upstairs and lay down on the bed my legs still hurt like the devil but apart from the one ankle the scarring would be minimal i flinched when i thought of jennifer and the ordeal she faced so that evening i phoned comerton castle and asked for lady buzzacott sir leon came to the phone instead and told me his wife was with jennifer in london and where was i he asked i gave him charlies number there was a pause as i imagined him writing it down in his small leatherbound book then he said he wanted to see me of course i want your approval for the arrangements im proposing for the lady georgina will tomorrow be convenient i wasnt certain i really felt fit enough but nor did i think i could bear a day of yvonnes long face so i said tomorrow would be fine shall i send a car im afraid youll have to i was not only homeless but penniless as well the car came in the morning the driver took me to the mendip hills where in a sheltered southfacing village we turned into a long driveway which led to a large whitepainted victorian house sir leon himself met me at the front door and introduced me to a freshfaced man of about my age this is doctor grove sir leon said the medical doctor of lovelace house sir leon was touchingly anxious that i should approve of lovelace house i had my staff do a great deal of research he told me and i assure you that lovelace met our most stringent requirements it was so far as i could tell ideal lovelace house was privately run outrageously expensive and selfevidently caring many such places catering to the lunatic members of rich or titled families are scarcely more than prisons but at lovelace each patient had a private suite personal nurses and as much freedom as their condition would allow them to receive whenever we met a patient in one of the airy corridors i was gravely and courteously introduced a marchioness enquired whether i had planted the banana tree yet i replied no and she told me my employment was in severe jeopardy i bowed then limped on to see the suite that had been reserved for georgina wide french windows opened on to a terraced lawn beyond which empty paddocks stretched to the wooded hillside the view was not unlike that from the windows of stowey and i said as much except for the horses of course is the lady georgina fond of horses doctor grove asked she used to be my sister wouldnt let her ride but a friend and i used to lead her round on a docile old mare she was always very happy when we did that doctor grove made a note i think perhaps we should explore that avenue thank you my lord john i said automatically call me john i dutifully inspected the kitchens the drawing rooms the communal dining room and the consultation rooms where i was told the best london psychiatrists came to weave their spells if georgina could be happy anywhere i thought then surely it was in this kindly place after the inspection and after i had expressed my wholehearted approval to doctor grove sir leon asked for a moment alone with me he led me out to the southern gardens where a curious group of patients inspected his helicopter which stood with drooping rotors on the wide lawn sir leon steered me away from the machine preferring the solitude of a gravel walk my lawyers have already opened negotiations with the lady georginas trustees sir leon said in his precise and pedantic voice i think i can assure you that there will be no hindrance to her coming here sir oliver bulstrode might not agree i suggested grimly sir oliver like all top london lawyers will decide in favour of the richest party i smiled to hear this dry little man confirm my own opinion of lawyers i was beginning to feel quite fond of sir leon which i thought was only appropriate considering how i felt about his stepdaughter we paced on in silence for a few yards then he shot me a very shrewd and rather unfriendly glance and what of your own future my lord something in his tone alerted me perhaps id been too quick in my warm feelings id thought it slightly strange that a man of his importance should see fit to show me round a highclass lunatic asylum but now i sensed he had quite another reason for meeting me this day i havent thought much about my future i said casually and please do stop calling me my lord if you wish sir leon had noticed how walking pained me even with the help of a walking stick that charlie had found in his junk room so now he stopped by an ornamental urn forgive me asking but was your boat insured no he frowned severe disapproval that was imprudent was it not insurance companies wont touch deepwater yachts if you stick to cruising the channel or the north sea theyll offer you a quotation but if you sail beyond the sunset and especially if you sail alone they wont look at you i see he stared down at the urns base frowning slightly so forgive me again but what is the extent of your loss ninety thousand pounds it was a guess he looked up sharply as much as that she was a good boat i said defensively she wasnt a plastic tub tricked out with veneered chipboard she was a deepwater steel boat with hardwood fittings she was well equipped sir leon she was what a sailor would call a proper boat that i supposed was sunflowers obituary and a good one too she had been a proper boat and i mourned her but i dont think the full extent of the loss had yet occurred to me i might put a financial value on the hull and rigging and fittings but there was an emotional loss that was incalculable a boat becomes a companion a person you talk to a creature that shares the good times and helps you survive the bad sunflower had also been my home and id lost her i would take it as a great kindness if you would find yourself another yacht sir leon said it so softly that at first i thought i had misheard at my expense of course he added just as softly im sorry i said with incredulity his manner in the last few minutes had been touched with a cold hostility yet now he was offering me a boat i warmed to him again its quite simple he seemed irritated by my obtuseness i am offering to buy you another oceangoing yacht but thats ridiculous i hoped to god he wouldnt agree with me pride would make me protest but not for long i needed another boat desperately he offered me the ghost of a smile not so ridiculous my lord as giving away a van gogh he was plainly determined to go on calling me my lord of course he continued if you dont want another boat then i shall quite understand i do want one i said fervently his equation of my gift of the van gogh with his present of a replacement boat made the transaction seem less astonishing and more acceptable i had also decided that this was a man who liked to hide his kindnesses behind a pernickety façade sir leon stirred the gravel with a wellpolished shoe i assume my lord that if you have another boat you will resume your wandering way of life i really dont know he had asked the question casually and my reply had been just as offhand yet my careless answer provoked a very cold look indeed does your uncertainty have anything to do with my stepdaughter the abruptness of the question and its acuity astonished me i said nothing and sir leon frowned my wife seems to think that the two of you might be suited but i must tell you that i often find lady buzzacotts ideas whimsical now the thing lay in the open the boat wasnt a recompense for the gift of a painting but a bribe to take me away from jennifer this wasnt a man who hid his kindnesses but simply purchased what he wanted now he wanted my absence i felt foolish for liking him for it was suddenly plain that he detested me youd prefer hans to become jennifers husband i asked forthrightly of course i would sir leon said blandly as though we merely discussed our preferences for cars or boats hans is a most steady and sensible man it might take flair to build a financial empire my lord but it takes steadiness to maintain it and hans has succeeded very well at preserving and expanding his inheritance so you see and here he offered me the smallest of smiles i would be very well advised to help you find a suitable boat and thus tempt you to very distant waters at least i thought the bastard was honest he wanted me gone because i wasnt suitable i was a rogue and vagabond i was a mongrel sniffing round his thoroughbred and i assume he pressed me that if you are equipped with a suitable boat you will indeed resume your previous way of life not necessarily no i would not give him that satisfaction even if it meant that the bastard withdrew his offer may i ask what other inducements might keep you ashore besides jennifer i might go into business i said airily then despite my dislike of him found myself articulating an idea which must have been simmering in my mind ever since i had returned to england i sometimes think its time to give myself a proper base i live on a very narrow knife edge between poverty and bankruptcy and thats fine for a time sir leon but after a while it becomes tedious i need something to make some money something that will let me sail away when i want to but something that will go on earning money while im away it sounds very desirable he was amused but rather a pipe dream surely theres a property on the hamoaze i heard myself saying it belongs to a plump old crook called george cullen and if i could raise the money i could make it into one of the finest yachtrepair yards on the south coast its no good looking to the banks of course so it is probably a pipe dream but ive got a friend who might be interested except that hes rather overextended financially you have the necessary skills to run a yachtrepair business all of them i said proudly sir leon looked up at me if you had not given me the van gogh my lord you would doubtless have received all the capital you might need but alas your own generosity seems to have condemned you to the wanderers life he gave me one of his very small smiles as if to show that he had proved that my only chance of financial survival lay in accepting his offer and thus leaving his stepdaughter alone he glanced towards his helicopter and i assumed he was about to walk away but instead he offered me an irritated frown i must admit that i am sorely disappointed in inspector abbott his ploy of making you a target seems to have misfired very badly indeed i could only agree it now seems clear to me that inspector abbott has very small chance of finding these wretched people so it seems i have no choice but to deal with them myself pay the ransom you mean what else sir leon did not sound dismayed at the prospect i have already inserted the coded advertisement in the times indicating my willingness to do so i now await their instructions which i will follow punctiliously inspector abbott advises me that the criminals might renege on the arrangements but that is a risk i must be willing to take following inspector abbotts advice has so far only succeeded in putting my stepdaughter into hospital so you may imagine that i am not enamoured with his ideas he had spoken with unnatural venom when he mentioned jennifer i blushed im sorry i began my wife has already assured you that there is no need for an apology he interrupted me i dont entirely agree with her but we shall nevertheless consider the matter closed the important thing now is to provide jennifer with the very finest medical attention hans has some very sound ideas but i do assure you my lord that none of this any longer concerns you he looked up at me and i saw how deceptive were those myopic pale eyes this was a very formidable man indeed and one who disliked me intensely i believe in making things very plain in negotiations he went on so i am here to tell you my lord that your association with my affairs and with my family is concluded jennifer will be moved to a private clinic in switzerland where i assure you her visitors will be strictly controlled i hope you understand me keep my dirty hands off her i said flippantly i annoyed him as id meant to but he controlled the annoyance instead he took a business card from his top pocket that is the name and address of my financial controller he will henceforth make all the arrangements concerning the lady georgina and he will also pay the bills contingent on your new boat i shall instruct him that you are to be given credit of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds should you wish to have that money paid to you in cash then feel free to ask but i should advise you to arrange payment in some place where the taxman might not notice he handed me the business card then took a long brown envelope from his inside pocket at the same time my lord i do not wish you to think that i am ungrateful for your efforts on my behalf so perhaps you will also accept this small token of my thanks i took the envelope i didnt open it i was hoping he had been so generous that i would feel constrained to refuse the gift and i knew i couldnt afford that quixotic gesture not since my own money had sunk to the bottom of the english channel sir leon held his hand out to me should your sister challenge your right to give me the painting then i trust you will make yourself available to my lawyers my driver is at your disposal for the rest of the day i shook his hand then he turned away i wondered how such a dry little sod had ever attracted a woman like helen not a week before she had offered me a bedroom in comerton castle now her husband was giving me the boot sir leon i called out when he was a dozen paces away my lord he turned back i havent given up my hopes of jennifer he shrugged i cannot command your hopes my lord i can only make my own views very plain to you both good day to you he nodded coldly then walked between the lunatics to where his pilot waited i opened the envelope it had a thousand pounds in it and i knew i probably would have felt obliged to hand it back i wondered if he would have taken it he wanted rid of me and would happily pay a hundred and twentyone thousand pounds for the privilege i watched his helicopter take off and reflected on the fact that for the first time in my life id actually been fired and that i was in love and that i had a new enemy i had sir leons driver take me to exeter where in a shabby pub close to the police station i found harry abbott he watched me limp between the tables then ordered me a pint of bitter i tried to telephone you today he said grumpily as though id inconvenienced him by being away from charlies house i was with sir leon buzzacott i took a first sip of the pint and sighed with relief at the taste ive just been fired harry it was very nicely done and he even gave me a golden handshake but it was still a firing fired harry asked in puzzlement my services are no longer required for the retrieval of the painting in truth i was still rather dazed by the experience sir leon had spent weeks seeking my help and at the first stiff hurdle had brushed me away like dirt he gave me the heaveho harry then warned me off his stepdaughter you cant blame him for that harry said reasonably who wants a nice girl like jennifer being mauled by some dirtyminded bastard like you i was beginning to like you in the last few days harry i can see i was wrong he grinned so whats little sir leon going to do now pay the ransom yes harry grimaced he was bound to do it in the end he wants to get his paws on that picture doesnt he god knows why i know a fellow in okehampton who could knock him up an identical fake in a couple of weeks whod know the difference beats me harry so why were you trying to telephone me to tell you to bugger off johnny he spilt a packet of pork scratchings on to the bar and generously pushed one small sliver towards me ive drawn a blank you see garrards gone and so has his thick friend i cant find hide nor hair of them im sorry johnny but theyve disappeared just like elizabeth i said grimly whos probably still in france he said and i cant issue a warrant for her because ive got damnall evidence i cant even get a search warrant for her bloody house of course thered be plenty enough evidence for a warrant if she was just some housewife but as shes the lady ladida tredgarth i cant get near her i thought you said it wasnt worth searching her house i dont expect to find a van gogh hanging in the downstairs loo johnny but im getting desperate now ill settle for her private telephone book or her diary or anything he wiped beer off his lips you never know we might find garrards phone number written down in her book but without a search warrant he shrugged then flinched as a piece of scratching irritated a loose filling in his teeth what about george cullen i asked what about george he knows garrard listen harry tapped my forearm to emphasise his next words george cullen is terrified of me hed fly to the moon rather than hold out on his uncle harry i told you i talked to him and george doesnt know a dickybird about it so who does thats what im trying to tell you johnny no one unless those bastards have another go at you were done and frankly i cant get the manpower to look after you any more so the best thing you can do is go get yourself another boat and piss off sir leon had given me the same advice though couched in politer and more practical terms i scooped a handful of harrys pork scratchings off the bar can you give me a lift to charlies house all the way to salcombe he sounded outraged ill buy you a pint on the way youll buy my bloody supper you miserable hound so he gave me a lift and i wondered just what i would do now all i knew was that i didnt want to run away to sea again because this time i had someone worth staying for which meant that despite the bastards who were trying to see me off i would stay charlie was not at home that night which made staying at his house an awkward experience yvonne was watching television when i arrived so i went straight to bed at four in the morning i woke up in a muck sweat panicking because i had been dreaming that i was drowning i couldnt get back to sleep so as soon as i heard yvonne up and moving i went down to the kitchen and asked if shed mind driving me to where i could catch a bus she grudgingly agreed he should be home tonight she told me as she drew up at the bus stop in kingsbridge but you can never tell i might be back i might not ive got a lot to do today youre just like him arent you she drove off before i could thank her for the lift i caught the first bus to plymouth the weather was warm and calm the south coast seemed trapped in one of those rare bubbles of high pressure which would fill the beaches and becalm the yachts not that my concern this day was with the sea instead and perhaps foolishly i would retrace harry abbotts steps i reached george cullens yard a few minutes after nine rita was making the days first cup of tea look at you she said in shocked sympathy i was still using charlies cane for my left ankle was fearsomely painful you poor man i saw it in the papers how did it happen like they said an accident gas leak the papers had speculated about sabotage but someone presumably harry had killed that notion the story had run for a day or two then disappeared you should take more care of yourself johnny rita took down a third chipped mug into which she poured a dollop of milk hes in there she said and ill bring your tea in george half smiled when i limped into his office then his face assumed a properly sympathetic look johnny he said as greeting i didnt say anything but just limped over to the desk he had a tabloid open at a page showing a naked girl with a pair of breasts like overinflated lifebelts other similar pictures faded on his walls johnny he said again you had a spot of bother i hear i slammed the stick on to his newspaper so hard that everything on his desktop jumped a full inch into the air listen you fat swine im going to ask you some questions and your miserable life depends on the answers you give me do you understand that george he golloped at me like a dying fish then nodded hastily of course my lord of course i do anything you want just ask i shoved the metal ferrule of the stick into his fat gut you know who garrard and peel are dont you course i do yes i told you i did he was staring bugeyed at me so did you tell them where they could find me on the night when they tipped sunflower into the dock no johnny no my lord honest i didnt i was driving the stick into his belly making his waistcoat distend about the bulging and displaced flesh on my mothers grave johnny i didnt i believed him because i was sure by now that it had been elizabeth who had guessed that id make for georges junk yard that wasnt the question id come to ask george but it was a good way of softening him up for my real query i released the stick and george scrabbled in a drawer for a bottle of pills and quickly swallowed two of them i didnt say a word johnny i wouldnt youre a friend so where do i find them george he gaped at me i dont know he flinched from the raised stick i mean they could be anywhere it depends who theyre working for so who do they work for george he shrugged anyone of course i slammed the stick down again spilling pills across the naked girls photograph who you bastard anyone whos got property troubles of course name them he was saved the need to answer by the arrival of rita carrying a tray of tea and biscuits she must have overheard my angry voice and the noise of the walking stick hitting the desk but she only beamed a happy smile and said it looked like being another fine day i waited till she had left who do they work for george he gave me the names of two men who owned discos and pubs in union street but then warned me against those men i had enough sense to heed his warning every maritime city has a union street a place for homecoming sailors to get drunk and laid and the men who ran such streets were harder than steel if i limped down union street with naïve questions then i would be lucky to leave alive harry abbott could have done it but i guessed harry had already exhausted the names george had just given me i havent seen hide or hair of them in weeks george said miserably id tell you if i had johnny you know that they tried to kill me i told george harry told me george tutted disapprovingly to show that his sympathies were with me not just that night in your yard but last week they filled my boat with gas and like a fool i didnt check jesus he gaped at me thats why i want to find them george so i can cut out their livers i wish i could help you johnny you know that id help you if i could id drawn a blank i swore i crossed to the window and stared down into the dock it could make a very nice business i thought a most splendid business i could store boats in the winter have two covered repair shops and a permanent berth for whatever boat i ended up buying for myself except to buy georges yard would take more money than i was ever likely to have have a drink george said soothingly it might help not this early i sounded annoyed ill do anything to help george said pleadingly you know that johnny ill do anything then drive me to the train station he drove me to the station and id learned nothing i caught a train to london i had a piece of personal business to transact before i resumed harrys trail the business was with jennifer i wondered if id be refused entry into the hospital but evidently sir leons prohibition either carried no weight or had yet to be pronounced jennifer had been taken off the air bed and now lay belly down on a high metalsided bed i couldnt see how badly she was burned for her body was covered with a kind of plastic tent tubes had been poked into her nostrils other tubes disappeared under the tent her scalp was smothered with a wig made of some pale liquid over which had been pasted small squares of cotton gauze lady buzzacott had said her face had been spared but it was patched with the same small squares of cotton the truth was that she looked dreadful hello gorgeous i said hello her voice was very hoarse where can i kiss you you cant mummy kisses one of the drip bottles i kissed one of the drip bottles i hoped youd come she said i came to apologise she made a tiny shaking motion with her head no need i feel like a shit and everyones being so nice i could feel the tears pricking my eyes it was my fault i should have checked the gas im sorry but youre all right she asked you look tired ive been sleeping badly and i limp a bit but itll pass they tell me youre going to be fine they say that her voice was very laboured the effect i guessed of all the fumes shed inhaled but they would wouldnt they no i said theyll tell the truth again there was the little shaking motion of the head its going to take a long time my front isnt too bad but my back is pretty foul my hands are the worst my hair is beginning to grow again the doctors say i was lucky that the fire blew past me but i dont feel very lucky she gave another tiny shake of her head almost in resignation it doesnt hurt nearly as much as it did but its still pretty bloody im sorry i said helplessly they tell me it will be all right she went on but when its all done i know ill still look horrid no i said though looking at her i could not see how they could possibly put her beauty back together i should have brought you some grapes youd have had to mash them up and put them in a tube actually i said i brought you something else what this i could not give it to her so i opened the box and showed it to her it was an engagement ring it wasnt a very fine ring not a chunk of diamond like hans had bought her but it was the best i could find in the jewellery shop closest to the hospital oh john she said and sounded rather sad it isnt a very good ring i confessed but your stepfather is trying to buy me off and gave me a chunk of cash so i blew most of it on the ring i didnt blow it all because i need a bit for bus fares but it isnt a bad little ring it glints in all the right places look she smiled at me under the cotton pads youre mad john so marry me she didnt say anything so i burbled on your stepfather disapproves he thinks you should marry hans because hans is sensible and steady and the buzzacott millions will need a bore to run them so i have to tell you that youll be upsetting your stepfather when you marry me but i think hell get over it i suspect your mother will approve and i imagine she can usually get her own way with him jennifer nodded very slightly is that acceptance i asked no it isnt i cant marry you why not im eligible i shall be ugly good i dont want other men lusting after you i shall do all the lusting youll ever need she watched me with her dark eyes the only recognisable things left of her youre being foolish she said i love you thats what i mean she took a rasping breath anyway theres hans bugger hans i said hell just put you down as a bad business investment and find himself a little swiss bird with big tits and skiers thighs she shook slightly and i think she was laughing i cant marry you she said after a while youre just making a gesture of course im making a gesture you silly woman i love you for our honeymoon well sail somewhere delicious john again there was a sadness in her voice mind you i said i cant marry you yet because ive got to find the two bastards who boobytrapped the boat and when i do im going to kill them ill bet hans wouldnt kill someone for you i dont think he would no that proves it then im a better man youre a very impractical man youre just making a gesture because you pity me balls in fact im being very practical im marrying an excessively rich girl and it occurs to me that youll probably inherit the van gogh if we ever get it back so im not really giving it away at all i smiled down at her would you very much mind marrying me for your money she paused youll hate me john ill be ugly i will love you i looked into her dark eyes and within a year you and i will be married and two years from now well have a child and though i must confess i cant stand the sound of a baby screaming i will love him because hes yours so hold on my love because we have a lot of living to do hold on she repeated my words you said that to me in the water you remember you were swearing she said and i saw she was crying and i was crying too so i bent down and kissed one of her closed eyelids her tears tasted salty you told me i was a pathetic bloody girl she said and that i was too feeble to live and i thought ill show you ill prove im not feeble good for you i said so now prove that you can get better she smiled making the little gauze squares twitch i will i promise but its going to take a long time ill wait the edge of the plastic tent shifted and i saw she was putting out her hand i thought she wanted me to hold it then i saw that her hand was nothing but black claws inside a plastic bag she was watching me and i sensed this was a test she wanted to see if id flinch from the sight instead i bent down and very gently kissed the plastic bag its a bit difficult to put a ring on now i said but i will one day maybe she said she sounded tired so i placed the ring on the bedside table where she could see it ill come back i said please her voice was a whisper i thought she was falling asleep so i tiptoed to the door john her voice was very low i turned back my love i waited a long time for her to speak and when she did her voice was distorted because she was crying i love you she said but it all seems so bloody hopeless i love you too i replied and everything will be fine then i left so she shouldnt see my own tears i limped through dusty london streets i was oblivious to the traffic or to the noise oblivious to all the horrors of the city blind to everything except the realisation that at last i had found someone to love to cherish but first and most important of all someone to avenge i reached perilly house in the early evening i had gone by train bus and foot and my left ankle felt as if a white hot steel band was being slowly contracted about the bones i wasnt very sure how best to proceed for despite my reputation i was not a practised burglar yet this evening i planned a burglary because if harry could not legally search elizabeths house then i would do it illegally it was clear that i had arrived at an inopportune time for elizabeths two stable girls were still busy giving riding lessons and the presence of a car parked beside the land rover outside the front door suggested that peter had a visitor so i decided to wait till the house was either empty or peter was alone and presumably drinking i limped off the driveway to a copse of trees and settled down to wait by half past six the riding school pupils had been driven away by their mothers forty minutes later the stable girls locked up the yard and rode their bicycles down the tradesmens driveway peters visitor stayed another halfhour then drove away i stayed where i was giving peter time to start on his second or third bottle of the day but it seemed my luck was in for just a few moments after the visitor had left peter appeared at the front door climbed into the land rover and accelerated down the drive i stood up brushed the leaf mould off my jeans and walked across the pastureland id seen peter lock the front door so i went round the back where the house was an ugly clutter of gun room dairy sculleries kitchen and coal stores the doors were all locked but i spotted a halfopen window high up on the main scullery wall and abandoning charlies walking stick i used an empty rainbutt to climb up to the window it was a tight squeeze and my left ankle threatened to spill me off the wobbly barrel but i finally wriggled through the window on to a cobwebby shelf that creaked dangerously under my weight there was a clatter of food tins hitting the floor as i pulled my legs through the window i was proving to be a lousy burglar but it was evident the house was deserted for no one came to investigate the noise i put the tins back on the shelf wiped the cobwebs off my face and opened the door i knew the house from the old days i was in the kitchen passage that was thickly hung with reins bridles and whips the kitchen was to the right and the family rooms to the left i went left through the baizecovered door and paused in the hallway i knew elizabeth had a small office behind the dining room so i decided to begin there i first unlocked the front door so that if anyone came home i could claim to have found the door open the decor of the house had not been changed in the years id been barred from perilly house peters gloomy pictures of longforgotten battles and elizabeths prints of spindlylegged racehorses jostled for position on the fading wallpaper a dish of dusty cobnuts sat on the vast sideboard in the dining room i opened one with the silvergilt nutcrackers and ate it as i pushed open the unlocked door of elizabeths office i knew within minutes that i would find nothing incriminating in the office the only papers in the file drawers were records of her horses receipts from the feed companies vets bills and details of forthcoming pony club events it was plain that the stable girls also used the office for elizabeth had left them a message pinned to the top of the rolltop desk mrs peabody owes us so her wretched child is not to be given any rides until the bill is paid in full i scouted the living room but found no place where any papers might be hidden i went upstairs it was obvious that lord and lady tredgarth slept apart for the large bedroom was filled with peters things and held nothing whatever of elizabeths his clothes were strewn on the floor suggesting that the cleaning woman never reached this dismal domain a halfempty bottle of whisky stood on a side table with a copy of the farmers weekly there was a blurred photograph of his old yacht hanging on the wall i remembered the boat well a fine old vertue that had been his pride and joy but marriage and financial worries had scuppered that dream next to it was a framed photograph of elizabeth taken some years earlier at an exotic tropical resort she was in a bikini top and wrapround skirt smiling at the camera and the photograph reminded me of just how attractive my sister was i wondered if peter kept the two pictures on his wall as a reminder of old and happier days the present days were typified by a girly magazine that lay under the unmade bed the rooms decrepitude reminded me of my brothers bedroom and also made me feel dirty there was something very distasteful in my prying but there was something equally distasteful in a bilge filled with lethal gas i closed peters door then searched the four guest rooms and the two bathrooms but they were all quite innocent which just left elizabeths room i tried the door but as id feared it was locked i had a choice now so far if id been found i could righteously claim to be lady tredgarths brother who had come into an open house to wait for her but if i broke down the door i would be committing an offence i tested the lock by pushing on the door but there was no play in it it was an oldfashioned keyholetype lock of the sort i had used to pick at stowey but i had no tools nor did i know whether the skill was still with me i tried i found some skewers in the kitchen bent their tips and tried to find the locks levers after fifteen minutes i had achieved nothing other than a frayed temper it also occurred to me that peter might have gone no further than the local pub and could be home at any moment so i gave up being delicate and just put my shoulder to the door it took a halfdozen huge heaves and one painful kick with my right foot but finally the lockplate splintered off the jamb and the door swung open there was a bed a chest of drawers a dressing table a vast wardrobe that had once been in my fathers room at stowey and to the left of her fireplace a long table covered with papers above the table was a crucifix carved in ancient hard wood while beneath the table was a japanned tin trunk that was closed with a padlock i started with the papers on the table there were letters from old schoolfriends minutes of charity committee meetings specimens of wallpaper and overdue invoices from the builders who were renovating primrose cottage i found the newspaper cuttings of the press conference id given with jennifer but that was the only matter relevant to my search and it neither confirmed elizabeths guilt nor added to what i already knew i pulled open the drawers and found nothing but a tangle of underwear and stockings i opened the wardrobe nothing i looked under the high brass bed and found nothing but an oldfashioned chamber pot and a pair of furry slippers i looked round the room for a hidden safe but the lumpy plaster walls were covered with a fading wallpaper which clearly concealed nothing i tested some of the floorboards but they were nailed tight there wasnt a diary or a phone book and i supposed she must have taken such personal things to france all that was left was the japanned tin trunk i pulled the trunk from under the table and used the brass handle of the poker as a hammer to open its padlock it yielded to the third smart tap i eased the shank out of the hasp and pushed back the lid it was getting darker outside but i dared not switch on a light so instead i took the bundles of papers to the window they were letters packets and packets of letters held together with elastic bands there were scores of packets holding hundreds of letters and all of them so far as i could see were love letters they were addressed to elizabeth at the riding school and i supposed that the schools mail came separately from that addressed to the main house some of the letters were ten years old but others were very recent i recognised none of the handwriting some of the packets had dried flowers trapped under their elastic bands while others had photographs small reminders of a stolen moments happiness i dont know why i was so astonished elizabeths marriage was dead yet presumably she was trapped in it by her ancestral attachment to the faith i looked at the crucifix hanging on her wall then back to the bundled evidence of her carnal sins and i suddenly felt sorry for her and even guilty at having discovered the letters elizabeth herself appeared in some of the photographs smiling and happy holding on to the arm of her lover she seemed to like tall athletic men they were photographed on ski slopes or mounted on powerful horses seeing their strong confident faces made me realise how horribly unhappy elizabeth must be even the window light had now faded to a velvety gloom so i risked turning on the small bedside lamp to look at the pictures i was hoping to find a photograph of garrard but he was not there there were only her hardeyed anonymous lovers i dropped their letters back into the trunk and refastened the padlock id failed there was nothing here for harry abbott nothing at all i sat on the bed ran my fingers through my hair and stared up at the cold grate where spiders had made thick webs about the unburnt birch logs damn it i thought damn it damn it damn it sir leon would pay his ransom he would get his picture and i would never prove who had so nearly killed jennifer and me a door creaked downstairs and like a guilty thing i jumped i should have run for it but my ankle would not let me whoever you are peters slurred voice shouted from the downstairs hallway stay there ive got a gun and im calling the police dont worry about the police peter i limped to the door then out to the landing its me john he switched on the hall lights then came a few suspicious feet up the stairs he held a doublebarrelled shotgun very menacingly it is you he sounded disappointed as though hed been looking forward to shooting an intruder you broke into her bedroom im sorry about that i thought id found a burglar he let the barrels drop i was driving back from the pub you see and saw a light in lizs room thats it i thought ill have the bugger left the motor at the end of the driveway and walked the rest of the way very clever of you peter he gave me an unfriendly look so what the hell are you doing here i came to see you and elizabeth i said very nicely i thought it was time to make peace i was winging it hoping that he wouldnt use the shotgun he was certainly well on his way to being drunk and i didnt trust him make peace id puzzled him silly family squabbles i said vaguely i hobbled down the stairs peter let me pass then followed me down to the hall so long as youre here he said grudgingly you might as well have a drink he led me into the drawing room and poured two very stiff whiskies she wont be back not for a bit anyway how do you know because she phoned her bloody riding girls and told them she wouldnt telephone me cheers he drank that first glass of whisky as if he were a dying man coming out of the desert then poured himself another just as generous funny thing the telephone he was drunk morose and lonely i wondered how he managed to drive but supposed the pub was nearby the lanes empty and the police a long way off it rings sometimes he went on and i answer it and theres no one there no one does that strike you as odd john i mean youre a man whos knocked about the world a bit so doesnt that strike you as odd very odd peter ill tell you something even odder it never happens to elizabeth he was peering at me with the fervent intensity of a drunken man holding on to a scrap of good sense it never happens to her do you think the telephone knows when a womans going to answer no peter i dont think that i dont know he said he had dropped the gun across an armchair i wondered if it was loaded and whether i should take it a safe distance away from him he drank most of the second glass of whisky then shuddered i can talk to you he said suddenly good youre one of us you see i mean theyre a very nice set of fellows down the pub all top drawer but theres always a bit of you know what i didnt but he explained for me anyway they know im a lord and it makes them what do you call it shy shy i confirmed youre not shy he poured himself more whisky youre quite right silly family squabbles they shouldnt be allowed its her lovers of course he didnt sound drunk at all as he said the last words lovers who telephone you fool and dont say a word when i answer im not an idiot john people think i am but im not no youre not and shes a goodlooking woman he said sadly shes a damn goodlooking woman all your familys goodlooking blast you he stared at me balefully what were you doing in her room looking for a van gogh he stared at me for a few seconds then guffawed thats rich john very good seriously peter he swallowed a gulp of whisky its your own bloody fault john i can understand why you did it truly i can he had become drunkenly earnest but what i dont understand is why you dont come clean im sure elizabeth doesnt want to see you in jail why dont you cough the damn thing up and give liz half the proceeds because i dont have the painting peter he wagged a finger at me as though i was an irritating child sold it did you i never had it peter thats where youre wrong old boy liz nailed you on that one three years ago found one of your partners in crime you see he was being entirely serious even though he was as drunk as a judge i gave him a rueful smile as though i was playing along with his ideas how did she find me out she hired some private detective some slimy type she met at newbury dont know much about him to be honest never met the fellow liz keeps herself to herself you see he was beginning to make less sense as the whisky fractured his memories why didnt she go to the police thats what i said i was told it was none of my business mind you she went to that jumpedup little businessman buzzafuck or whatever hes called buzzacott he gave her money im sure of it two of his henchmen came round with an attaché case its my belief here he slumped down on to the arm of a sofa and pointed an unsteady finger at me that liz wanted to wait till your mother was dead no need to share the loot what so why hasnt she found the picture now damned if i know perhaps you hid it too well he chuckled conspiratorially and i smiled back so where is it john i spread innocent hands beats me peter he drained the whisky you can tell me why did buzzacott give her money he walked unsteadily to the sideboard and poured himself another whisky to pay for the private detective chap of course garrard maybe i was jumping to a conclusion but somehow i reckoned the private detective had to be garrard which meant that quite unknowingly sir leon had bankrolled the bastard who had half killed his stepdaughter but if elizabeth had stolen the painting why would she need a private detective or perhaps there never had been a private detective perhaps that was just elizabeths story part of the necessary deception that i was guilty and perhaps buzzacotts payments were a sweetener to make sure that elizabeth did eventually sell him the painting whatever the little bastard had clearly been backing both horses elizabeth and me or perhaps peters drunken maunderings added up to sweet nothing what i reckon peter turned back to me is that you sold the painting to someone liz has found you out and youre protecting whoever it is it isnt like that peter then for gods sake tell me the truth he was angry suddenly no one tells me a bloody thing ill tell you i said if you tell me which of the caravans you planned to put georgina in he stared at me with pretended outrage for a few seconds then laughed youre a fly one john ill give you that too fly for your own good eh i smiled then glanced through the big window to where the bats flickered dark in the newly fallen night was there a fellow named garrard in your regiment peter dont remember him what sort of fellow was he thin dark joined the paras he shook his head never heard of him why because he tried to kill me thats why that answer was a mistake because peter immediately thought id accused him of being an accomplice to attempted murder and his face flushed with a sudden and dangerous anger get the hell out of here i held up a placatory hand peter i said chidingly i said get out he snatched up the gun ill use it i bloody well used it on some mormons last year i left him he didnt follow me i half expected him to fire a volley over my head but he just stayed with his misery and the whisky decanter i limped to the village but the last bus had already left i knew id be lucky to reach the station in time for the last exeter train but i began to walk anyway id left the walking stick in peters back yard and my ankle was hurting i tried to hitch a lift but it was over an hour before anyone took pity on my hobbling i was too late for the train so i asked the driver to drop me near the motorway i stood on the access road for what seemed like hours and though i left my thumb stuck out no one stopped i probably looked too scruffy the headlights flicked past me and i tried to make sense of peters alcoholsodden memories elizabeth had probably been taking money from buzzacott and that money had been extracted on the promise that she had located one of my accomplices that meant i was certain that elizabeth had begun to cover her tracks very early in the game she had spent at least three years spreading tales of my guilt so that when she did produce the painting no one would accuse her of stealing it yet as i stood in the darkness beside the road i realised just how little peter had revealed perhaps i hoped one of the lovers whose letters lay hidden in the trunk was concealing the painting and perhaps harry could get a search warrant and go through the bundled letters but it seemed like a very long shot my day i thought had yielded nothing except an engagement ring i began to wonder if i should have to sleep rough but finally a lorry driver took pity on me he was carrying steel reinforcing rods to plymouth so took me all the way to devon and dropped me off at the kingsbridge turning it was two in the morning i walked for another hour but my ankle was making me sob with the pain there was no traffic thus no chance of a lift so in the end i climbed a gate into a field kicked a protesting sheep to its feet then lay down on the warm dry patch of earth id uncovered i slept badly for three hours and woke shivering and wet to a limpid dawn it occurred to me that i really was homeless just another tramp on the southern summer roads the first earl of stowey had ridden down these valleys with a retinue of steelhelmed men and now the twentyeighth earl stumbled unshaven and filthy out of a sheep run i walked till i found a public telephone in a village i phoned charlie i hesitated because it was early and i didnt want to wake yvonne but she had said charlie would probably be at home so i took the risk charlie answered i had woken him up but he didnt mind indeed he seemed immensely relieved to hear my voice i shared his relief for christs sake come and get me charlie im all in where the hell have you been hitchhiking sleeping rough for christs sake johnny theyve been looking everywhere for you who has harry abbott buzzacott he started phoning yesterday afternoon hes desperate for you why he wouldnt tell me mate im not a bleeding earl christ almighty look at the time where the hell are you i told him hang on there johnny ill be with you in half an hour so i hung on and charlie was as good as his word i wondered how on earth id survive without a friend like him then collapsed into his japanese fourbyfour and fell fast asleep charlie woke yvonne and demanded breakfast she came downstairs in dressing gown and slippers offered me one disgusted look then banged the frying pan about the stove in noisy protest im sorry to be a nuisance yvonne i said humbly she didnt reply she didnt need to i was about as welcome as a skunk hes only a bloody earl charlie said in an attempt to placate her with humour and hes been sleeping rough so have i yvonne slapped a packet of bacon on to the counter charlie gave me a wry look then took me out to his kennels where we fed his terriers he kept some of his dogs for ratting and others trained to bite less hard for rabbiting dont get married he told me as he tossed raw meat into the troughs it was a comment that didnt require a response so i made none charlie fondled one of his favourite dogs then stared at the early morning mist shrouding the salcombe lakes i dont know if it matters he said casually but buzzacott said you should telephone him he doesnt care how early you call sod buzzacott i said charlie laughed fallen out have you he doesnt want my help any more hes paid me off he told me to buy myself a boat disappear and never talk to his stepdaughter again buy yourself a boat charlie was immediately interested i grinned you and i have got a hundred and twenty thousand quid to spend charlie didnt believe me youre joking im not i promise you back indoors we found some childrens crayons and drawing paper and i made charlie a quick sketch of the hull that i was planning itll have to be steel of course long keeled i drew in two masts im thinking of a ketch why more flexible sail arrangements more to go wrong he said dubiously ill double rig her we spent a happy breakfast planning the perfect oceangoing boat not that i intended going permanently to sea not till i sailed with jennifer but planning the dream boat was a good way to start the day charlie and i had done almost everything to that boat except paint her name on the stern when the telephone rang it was sir leon buzzacott and he wanted me shall i tell the bugger youre here charlie didnt bother to put a hand over the receiver as he asked me the question ill speak to him i took the phone sir leons message in the times had been answered the kidnappers thats how he described them had sent him their demands the money was to be paid over by me they would accept no one else only the earl of stowey he finished speaking i said nothing it was so blindingly obvious why they wanted me to deliver the money so they could kill me and thus bequeath the picture to elizabeth but elizabeth i thought had been taking money from sir leon money which had let her hire the thugs who would do her killing today how much did you pay my sister i asked sir leon there was a silence then sir leons cautious voice my lord how much did you pay my sister three years ago an honorarium he said evasively merely an honorarium you bastard dont you realise what she did with your damned honorarium she hired garrard she hired the man who put jennifer into hospital you bankrolled this sir leon you gave her the money that let her wait till our mother died at that time i had no reason to believe in your sisters guilt his voice was very stiff and what did it matter anyway of course sir leon would back both of us because all he had ever wanted was the painting he did not care who had stolen it only that it came to him i had said nothing for a few seconds my lord sir leon prompted me how did these people communicate with you i asked he paused evidently finding the question irrelevant by letter it was delivered by messenger yesterday have you given it to the police i dont intend to involve the police damned if im going to be involved then those people have tried to kill me twice and if you think ill wander into their trap just to get you a pretty picture youre wrong i beg you sir leon began call harry abbott i was tired and i really didnt care any more i hung up the phone before he could say another word what was all that about charlie asked i told him it was all so clear to me if elizabeths plans went well today she would receive a ransom of four million pounds she would also receive the gift of my death which would make her the beneficial owner of a van gogh sir leon if he wanted to hang that painting in his gallery would be forced to negotiate a price with her and i was damned sure the price would be greater than twenty million sir leon would doubtless claim that i had given him the painting but he had nothing on paper and sir oliver bulstrode would chop him into shreds in brief elizabeth was about to become a very rich woman she could buy stowey back and start an equestrian centre that would dazzle the world she doubtless imagined royalty coming to her stables and she foresaw winters in warm palaces and summers on the languorous beaches of the very rich and to make all that happen to give my sister the fulfilment of all her dreams i only had to deliver the ransom dont do it charlie said earnestly you heard me i said i told him to call harry except i thought my one last chance of revenging jennifer was to cooperate with sir leon but i was not the best instrument of justice harry abbott was and if sir leon wouldnt tell the police that the ransom was being paid then i would can i use the phone charlie help yourself the phone rang a halfsecond before i picked it up it was harry abbott himself i was about to phone you i said dont do a thing johnny he sounded excited im coming to get you what for why do you bloody think were off and running of course buzzacott just phoned me ive got a police chopper harry i almost shouted his name to calm him down for christs sake they want to kill me of course they want to kill you just stay there johnny im coming to get you he slammed the phone down bloody hell i said to charlie harrys bought the idea they want me to pay the ransom i felt a chill crawl up my back charlie pointed at me dont do it johnny dont do it theyll push you up shit creek without a paddle i know but id also made a promise to a girl i wanted to marry so perhaps the creek had to be risked and a paddle improvised for revenge harry arrived in a police helicopter the thing thwacked across salcombe harbour reared up to flatten charlies unmown grass then settled down close to his kids sandpit harry jumped out and ran crouching across to the house he was full of his own importance theyd given him a chopper all of his own and he felt like a policeman in a tv programme are you ready he shouted at me no im bloody well not ready come in he was clearly reluctant things were at last moving and the villains were being forced to show their hand and i was being obstreperous but harry needed me so he had to come into charlies kitchen where the double glazing cut down the thumping noise of the helicopters engine so tell me what they want me to do i said harry glanced at charlie then realised that i would insist on charlie listening anyway we dont know yet oh terrific i said you mean were skidding about the sky like a bluearsed fly and we dont know why we have to go to exeter theres a plane waiting there to take us to guernsey we meet sir leon at st peter port and wait at the outdoors café at the victoria marina thats all we know dont go charlie said to me piss off charlie harry had known charlie a long time whos we i asked just you really harry admitted the bastards insist theyll only deal with you but ive got a backup team arranged to listen to him youd have thought the sas were on alert but i suspected the backup team was an overweight squad of harrys usual dipsomaniacs theyve already tried to kill johnny twice charlie protested i know that harry said impatiently and of course its a trap a demented four year old would know its a trap but if you go slowly johnny well be with you all the way you dont have to go the whole way not if you think its dangerous well be a halfstep behind you but if you lose us then get the hell out of it and if i think its becoming too risky ill stop everything the object of the exercise isnt to give them the money but to spot them and once weve done that you can leave the rest to me dont do it charlie said to me its only a bloody picture of some rotten flowers the helicopter whined and pulsed beyond the window and charlies dogs safely kennelled whined back harry waited for my decision and when none came tried a last appeal theyre showing themselves johnny if we dont respond then they might not risk it again weve got to go for gods sake dont you want to know who tried to kill you i know who it is i said its garrard and peel and if you lot were any good harry youd have had both of them wired up to a generator and singing their hearts out by now ill never have a chance of doing that if we dont catch them dont do it charlie said to me except i knew harry was right by collecting the ransom our enemies had to show themselves which meant we had a chance a very narrow chance of trapping them and it was garrard i was certain who had condemned jennifer to months of pain and i had promised her to pay back that pain i sighed then i shrugged ok harry charlies face stiffened into an expression that i knew only too well it was charlies stubborn look the face he wore when things were bad and when the only solution lay in his own strength and abilities he had worn that face in the tasman sea and now he had it again if youre going he said to me then im going too hang on harry began to protest then realised it was no use youll be about as much use as an ashtray on a motorbike he grumbled johnny needs someone to look after him harry and thats me charlie grinned his tiredness dropped away because there was a prospect of mischief and he was involved the two of us were back in business together he grabbed his coat shouted to yvonne that she shouldnt wait up for him then followed us out the helicopter took us to exeter airport where a small plane waited to fly us to the channel islands two plainclothes policemen waited by the plane but one of them had to stay on the ground because charlie claimed his seat harry unhappy at losing one of his men could only agree for he knew how unstoppable a determined charlie could be both harry and his man had guns they showed the weapons to us as we climbed up from the devon coast the sight of the blackhandled automatics made my blood run chill it reminded me that this was a very deadly game and not just another adventure with charlie harry sensed my change of mood remember johnny you dont have to go through with it go as far as you can but dont risk your life i wont let him charlie said the further you go harry ignored charlie the more chance you give us of spotting the bastards but i dont want to be scraping you off the floor johnny so dont push your luck do i get a gun i asked harry shook his head not from me johnny these are police issue it would be more than my jobs worth to let you have one i shrugged off his refusal he was probably right to turn me down id never fired a handgun in anger and would probably make a mess of it i stared down at the sea it looked so very calm all its treachery smoothed out by our height i took a cigarette from charlie i was nervous i was being enticed into danger like making a night approach to an unlit coast without any charts i suddenly wished i had not accepted so easily then thought of jennifers pain and knew i had no choice why guernsey i wondered aloud harry could only guess at the answer perhaps they think the island police are dozy and think of all those tight little lanes you could get lost there very easily is that what they want they want to know theyre safe the danger point of a ransom is the handover because its possible the police will be watching so the usual trick is to send the bagman from public phone to public phone the route will appear to be random but theyll be watching somewhere and looking out for cars following you if they see the same cars too often then theyll pull out the pilot turned in his seat to interrupt harry fog he said laconically and i twisted round to see that a milkwhite fog bank was stretching across the sea ahead the channel islands were notorious for their fogs and the recent still weather had made such fogs more likely bugger harry said viciously the pilot was radioing ahead he listened on his earphones then turned to give us the news guernseys still clear that lots over alderney and the casquets but they think the larger islands may get socked in later just get us there harry said never mind what happens later charlie was peering down at the thick white cloud blanketing the sea remember that night off the casquets i nodded wed been seventeen or eighteen years old and had made a night crossing to cherbourg except that we misread the tides and had been swept much further west and south than we knew the wind had piped up the sea was kicking and we were in our open dinghy wed turned east on to a broad reach expecting to see the lights on the cap de la hague and instead wed found ourselves being driven on to the rocks about the casquets light it was one of our earlier lessons in seamanship a tough lesson too for we damn nearly died on the vicious casquets bank but somehow wed scraped round to the west and had run down to guernsey where wed gone ashore like halfdrowned rats it seemed funny now but at the time wed both been scared rigid the fog bank slipped away behind revealing a calm sea though more fog lingered towards the french coast the forecast says there could be wind later the pilot volunteered thatll get rid of the fog the plainclothes policeman said not round here charlie said with the satisfaction of superior knowledge ive seen these waters blowing a full gale and still shrouded in a fog as dense as a frenchmans armpit bloody dangerous place this cheer me up harry said gloomily then settled back to watch as we descended towards guernsey the island came nearer a labyrinth of narrow roads ugly bungalows greenhouses and cars then our wheels thumped on the tarmac the smoke spurted from the protesting rubber and we had arrived the local police met us and drove us to st peter port where sir leon buzzacott waited at an outdoors table by the marina café an untouched cup of coffee stood beside a very slim leather attache case on the table two very large and taciturn men flanked and dwarfed sir leon if we were trying to be inconspicuous then we were failing hopelessly for with harrys local reinforcements we now numbered ten men and all but charlie and myself were dressed in heavy suits while around us the holidaymakers and yacht crews lounged in shorts or jeans ive got other chaps located round the marina the local policeman said theyre disguised of course sir leon greeted me considering that i was about to risk my life to get him a picture that id already given to him i thought his greeting lacked warmth but then my last conversation with him had not exactly been amicable we didnt mention elizabeth nor his dealings with her i introduced charlie sir leon gave him a cold look and a bare acknowledgement charlie nodded happily back nice morning for a bit of nonsense he said cheerfully sir leon ignored the remark the money he said and nudged the thin leather case towards me four million i said disbelievingly ive seen enough movies and television films to know that four million pounds would need a fairsized suitcase rather than this slender and expensive case for a second i even wondered whether sir leon had simply written them a cheque sir leon unzipped the bag and showed me its contents these are unregistered municipal bearer bonds my lord from the united states safer than cash just as anonymous and negotiable anywhere in the world but traceable harry abbott asked hopefully if you can persuade the authorities in various tropical tax havens to cooperate with you yes sir leon said disparagingly but i wouldnt pin your hopes on that cooperation i assure you that our enemies wont be using the bond coupons to claim their interest payments which would betray them but will simply sell the bonds themselves nor will they have any shortage of buyers unregistered bonds are becoming a rare and precious commodity so are van goghs i said helpfully sir leon ignored that harry zipped up the case and pushed it towards me lets hope we get the blackmailers before johnny has to hand the stuff over harry was in a fine mood again relishing the chase he looked round the marina as if he expected to see men with stocking masks over their faces i looked at sir leon you know they want to kill me he nodded primly it had occurred to me my lord and you set this up you encouraged my sister you gave her the money to hire the killers the pale eyes didnt blink i shall assume he said that the days events are making you overwrought i trust that when the moment of crisis comes you will not allow that stress to affect your judgment and fuck you too i doubted whether anyone had ever said that to sir leon buzzacott and he looked gratifyingly startled i leaned over the table tell me something what will you put on my gravestone that i wasnt good enough to marry your stepdaughter but i graciously died for your gallery he said nothing one of the security guards moved closer to me perhaps fearing that i would hit buzzacott but i ignored the man do you know why im doing this sir leon im doing it for jennifer i dont give a tinkers cuss for your painting but im going to find the man who burned jennifer and im going to pull his guts out and shove them down his throat and when ive done that sir leon im going back to jennifer and ill marry her and if you try to stop me ill have your guts for dinner too charlie laughed sir leon just blinked i turned away from him my anger had cowed sir leon but it had been nothing but bravado my chances of taking revenge this day were very slight the best i could hope for was that harry would succeed in making an arrest i looked around the marina complex but i could see nothing untoward the huge car park which served the town centre was full if harry was right then one of the parked cars would probably be the one in which i would spend the next few hours crisscrossing the islands leafy and twisting lanes the thought made me nervous i distracted myself by watching the boats the victoria marina at st peter port is a stonewalled harbour filled with pontoons the entrance has a raised sill to trap the falling tide but we had arrived just after high tide so the sill was invisible and the passage was still clear for yachts to leave or enter i guessed there were a hundred yachts berthed at the pontoons most were french the channel islands are a wonderful playground for french yachtsmen two girls in tiny shorts climbed one of the pontoon bridges and walked towards us all of us except sir leon watched them they put on a wiggle for our benefit called bonjour and strolled past us into the café if we werent here on business charlie said wistfully id be doing a spot of parleyvoo by now like old times charlie then the girls had to be forgotten because an ancient taxi blue smoke pouring from its exhaust braked close to the café tables the driver clearly puzzled by his errand leaned out of his window is one of you the earl of stowey for a second none of us moved then plunged into unreality i nodded i am i dont know what this is about but this is for you the driver held out a brown business envelope then gasped as four policemen closed in on his car hang on he protested but the police had their first link with the villains and the driver was hauled away to be questioned not that well learn anything harry said complacently these people arent fools but we have to go through the motions sir leon wanted to open the envelope as did harry but i was the addressee and i insisted on the privilege one of the local policemen had a pair of plastic tweezers which i used to extract the single page after i had read the page it would be taken away to be fingerprinted though none of us really believed the senders would be so foolish as to leave such marks i clumsily unfolded the sheet and read aloud its typed instructions the instructions were very simple and very clear i was to strip down to shorts pick up the money and go to the pontoon nearest to the marina café i was to carry nothing except the money and should i feel like disobeying that order i should know that i would be watched all the way at the end of the pontoon i would find a yacht named marianne i was to get on board alone no one was even to walk down the pontoon with me once on board i should take marianne to sea where further instructions would be provided no boat should follow me and if such a boat was detected the van gogh would be destroyed but if the instructions were followed faithfully and the money was safely handed over a telephone call to sir leons gallery would reveal where the van gogh could be found damn it harry said softly till that moment i dont think any of us had imagined that the money might be handed over at sea yet the insistence on me because i was a sailor and the choice of guernsey a yachtsmens paradise should have told us that the handover might be made afloat right harry was trying to regain the initiative marianne there must be a record of her i want her photographed and i want the registers searched who owns her who sold her wheres she normally berthed talk to the frogs the name sounds french go on move im coming with you charlie said to me no sir leon snapped charlie leaned on the table so that his big shaggy head was very close to sir leons face hes my friend and if hes going to risk his life im going with him sir leon was quite unmoved by charlies physical proximity we are going to follow the instructions very precisely i assume he turned to one of the guernsey policemen that this boat can be followed with an aircraft indeed sir then be so good as to arrange it but tell your people not to make the coverage obvious he looked down at the notes he had made are there any naval forces on the island one of the local policemen thought that a fisheries protection vessel was in the outer harbour sir leon looked up at harry i imagine a telephone call to london will secure their cooperation but tell them theyre to stay out of sight of the yacht they will have to follow directions from the covering aircraft harry pushed buttons on his mobile phone while sir leon glanced down at his notebook sir leon had taken over he was showing an impressive natural authority but expressing it so calmly that he radiated an air of confidence he ticked two items off his list of notes then offered me a cold look i trust my lord that these precautions will convince you that i am not attempting your murder he didnt wait for an answer but just glanced at his notes again i imagine their insistence on your wearing nothing but shorts is to make certain that you carry no weapons on board or a radio i said i hadnt thought of that he sounded surprised that i might have had a notion denied to him and even made a small note to that effect quite well my lord are you willing to follow these instructions i supposed i was i certainly hadnt come this far to back down the only immediate difficulty i could see was that we had four million pounds in funny money but not a single pair of shorts between us give us your knife charlie he gave me his penknife and i slashed at the legs of my jeans once the denim was cut they tore easily i ripped the legs off stepped out of them then pulled off my shirt and deck shoes i saw sir leon look at the fresh scars on my legs and give a small grimace of distaste im coming with you charlie said stubbornly he couldnt win that argument both sir leon and harry abbott were against it if we broke the rules both men insisted then all might be lost so our best hope was to follow the instructions exactly but remember harry was trying to demonstrate his own authority in the face of sir leons formidable competition ill pull you out if it looks dangerous johnny im going to be ok harry i sounded a great deal more confident than i felt all around me men were talking urgently into police radios but i was the one who had to walk almost naked down the pontoon which i was sure would lead me to two killers i want everyone watching harry said loudly theyve got a lookout here and i want him spotted he turned back to me shrugged and pushed the attaché case towards me we might as well do it johnny i pushed my pipe my pouch of tobacco and some matches into the seat of my sawnoff jeans then picked up the attaché case of money it was featherlight see you harry one minute sir leon frowned these people were particular that you carried nothing but the case leave your pipe here my lord i smiled very sweetly at him i might risk my life for your painting sir leon but im damned if ill do it without a smoke he looked into my eyes saw he would lose so gave a cold nod of reluctant acceptance harry and his men wished me luck then charlie walked with me across the car park to the head of the pontoon are you sure about this johnny of course im not sure charlie but what the hell else can i do bugger off leave them its only a rich man and his painting it isnt life or death but it is charlie they tried to kill me and they damn nearly killed jennifer so its personal youre a fool his solemnity surprised me but then he shrugged away his unnatural gloom and forced a grin on to his broad face we could make a run with the money why not id been waiting for him to make that suggestion we both laughed but there was suddenly nothing else to say so i punched him on the shoulder have a pint waiting for me ok how about one of those french birds as well he slapped my bare arm in friendly farewell then stepped back i knew he was watching me all the way down the pontoon and i was touched by the worry id detected in him but it was too late to turn back now so i went on alone part five i think id known from the very start that i wouldnt follow harrys advice once i had committed myself i would not pull back at the end i wanted to go through with it just like that day when id plunged into the heart of a galebroken sea above the bar at salcombe i would risk death because if i did not i would prove myself a coward i didnt want to do this thing but once committed i would go as far as i could and not just to prove that i was brave but because of a girl who lay in foul pain on a hospital bed i wanted to find the bastards who had done that to her and i wanted them to regret what they had done an ignoble motive i know these days a man is supposed to be above such stupidity today were supposed to exemplify the virtues of sympathetic understanding were supposed to feel sorry for the criminal because its clearly his education or his broken home or just society itself that has driven him to crime in short were supposed to eat lettuce instead of raw meat but im a throwback im the twentyeighth earl of nothing very much but theres still enough pride left in the nothingness to want to see my enemies wishing they hadnt been born and enough pride to want to tell my woman that id revenged her and enough pride to go to the bitter end of a nasty little game in which i was naked and my enemies held all the cards i felt truly naked as i walked barefoot down that pontoon i knew i was being watched not just by the police but by one of elizabeths people that person could have been any one of the loungers on the big moored yachts or any of the idling holidaymakers who leaned on the railings to stare down into the marinas pool who were these people whom elizabeth had found id met two of them garrard and peel but who else then i saw marianne she was a filthy little boat a homemade french job glued together out of marine ply then painted oxblood red you see hundreds of boats like her throughout europe id even seen a couple in the pacific sailed there by french youngsters who couldnt afford anything sturdier this boat was about eighteen feet long with a small cabin a single mast and an outboard motor mounted in a stern well there was a compass mounted on her cabin roof a grubby mainsail was roughly lashed to her boom and a single jib was hanked to her forestay i looked at her masthead and saw neither a radar reflector nor a vhf aerial but oddly a decca aerial was bolted just behind the outboard well except for the decca the villains had clearly found the cheapest boat they could i stepped down into her cockpit she might have been a scabby little boat hardly fit to cross a park pond but she was still a yacht and it felt good to be afloat again i tried the companionway and found it unlocked the interior of the boat had been stripped bare there were no bunks no galley not even a cockpit sole the bilges were exposed and i noted dry they had been swept bare and clean evidence that whoever had provided this boat had been intent on leaving no traces yet strangely out of place in such a bare boat some hightech aids had been put aboard a decca set was screwed to the after bulkhead and to power it a twelvevolt car battery rested on the ribs beside the centreboard case there was also a handheld vhf radio and the existence of that radio cheered me up for it seemed to be the first mistake my enemies had made doubtless they had provided the radio so they could communicate with me but it also meant that i could talk to harry i crouched inside the empty cabin and stowed the thin case of bearer bonds beside the battery then lowered the centreboard i noticed the decca was already switched on registering the latitude and longitude of st peter port i left it on and picked up the radio it was the size of a telephone handset with a short rubbersheathed aerial and powered by internal batteries i carried the radio up to the cockpit and ostentatiously waved it so harry could see it i turned it on tuned it to channel and laid it on the back cockpit thwart i opened the petrol tank of the outboard and saw i had a full tank it was only a threeandahalf horsepower engine so it wouldnt drive me more than six knots but i guessed it would run for a long time on a full tank the engine started on the first pull of the rope i left it in neutral while i went forward to cast off the bow line marianne had not been given any springs nor any fenders just two warps i cast off aft we drifted backwards till i put the engine into gear marianne and i puttered out of the marina into the harbour i followed the buoys round the outer perimeter past the fuel stage and out to the lighthouse which marks the harbour entrance a fast patrol boat of the navys fisheries protection squadron was moored close to the harbour entrance an officer stared down from the greypainted bridge with more than usual interest as marianne passed and i wondered whether harry had succeeded in coopting the patrol boat it had huge speed a splendid radar and a wickedlooking gun it would be nice to have such a vessel on my side but its presence would clearly upset the careful ransom arrangements so i didnt expect to see it again i gave the officer a wave then marianne was out of the harbour and in the little russel we had no choice of which way to turn the tide goes through the little russel with the force of a steam train so marianne and i would go north for we didnt have the power to fight our way southwards i turned north slowed the engine and went forward to hoist the jib it was a rough piece of sailcloth but i guessed it had some life left in it i pulled up the main even sunflower after crossing the pacific and rounding the horn had not had a sail so dirty but this one drew well enough so i went back aft and switched off the motor to save fuel i tilted the motor up so the propeller wouldnt drag then sat at the tiller the wind was a light southwesterly it wouldnt have moved sunflower very far but the small light marianne seemed to like it she didnt sail badly she chopped a bit and she could fall off the wind very fast but her helm eased when i trimmed her sails i opened the cockpit lockers to find them empty there was nothing on board except the decca its battery me a compass a radio and four million pounds and i remembered the two mooring warps i used one to lash the tiller and coiled the other on the cockpit sole my enemies had taken care to leave me without weapons but i had the two ropes and perhaps they would be useful a small plane was flying above st peter port towards herm it banked halfway across the little russel and swooped down low the sun flashed harsh off its windscreen then the plane was past me and climbing away it seemed i had friends i glanced at the radio half expecting harry to make contact but it was silent a fishing boat thumped past me there were at least a dozen yachts in sight one of the big hydroplane ferries was coming up from the south and a small coaster was moored off st sampsons the coaster had just fired her boilers and i saw how the smoke from her funnel drooped in a sagging plume to drift low above the water i wondered who watched me i wondered what they had in store for me then the radio startled me it hissed suddenly then a womans stilted voice sounded loud fourteen the voice said i didnt respond i was tuned to channel the emergency and contact channel so i could expect to hear a lot of stray traffic the single word id heard seemed to have been broken from a longer transmission and i wondered if the radio was working properly then perhaps a minute later the voice sounded again fourteen still i didnt react another minute or so passed then the single word was patiently transmitted again fourteen the intonation was bland not at all insistent almost robotic it occurred to me that id heard no other traffic and clearly the word meant something so i picked up the radio and pressed the transmit button station calling marianne station calling marianne identify yourself and say again over i suspected harry would already have arranged for directionfinding gear to track down the source of any mysterious transmissions and i wanted to make the caller speak longer to give that gear a chance at least i thought the woman had used channel the emergency and calling channel and the obvious wavelength for harry to monitor so all i had to do now was persuade the woman to speak for the two or three seconds it would need for the df to spot her station calling marianne i transmitted again identify yourself and say again your message over the radio was silent and i began to suspect that my enemies were not so foolish as id thought i tested that assumption by pressing the transmitter button again st peter port radio st peter port radio this is yacht marianne yacht marianne radio check please over there was no answer i switched to channel st peter port radios working channel and asked for a radio check again nothing which meant the radio wasnt transmitting it could receive but it wouldnt transmit the clever bastards i thought the clever clever bastards and i began to turn the dial back to channel when the radio ignoring the fact that i was flicking the tuner across the channels sounded once more fourteen said the toneless voice so not only had the enemy made sure that i couldnt transmit but they had bypassed the tuner so that the radio was permanently fixed on an unidentifiable channel it could have been any one of the fiftyfive public channels or one of a dozen private channels or they might even have installed an american channel into the radio doubtless harry was combing the vhf bands to find any transmissions that sounded suspect but i was beginning to have a great respect for the people who had designed this voyage and i did not see harry succeeding quickly fourteen the womans voice said a moment later so what the hell did that mean it clearly wasnt a course a buoy perhaps i looked around to see if there were any numbered buoys in sight and then the solution struck me marianne had been stripped to functional bareness yet someone had thought fit to install a very expensive decca set that wasnt there for decoration whoever was transmitting to me was providing me with a waypoint these people were not just clever they were very clever they had doubtless programmed the decca with ninetynine waypoints scattered randomly throughout the channel islands and they could use the waypoints to send me skittering about the sea while they made sure i was not being followed finally when they were certain that i was alone they would use the decca to point me towards the rendezvous instead of public telephones they were using invisible points in a vast sea i crouched in the low cabin the instruction book for the decca was jammed behind the powerlead but it was the same brand of set as the one id possessed for such a brief time on sunflower and that made me remember jennifers childish delight in the machine i said a brief prayer that i would one day share that childish delight with her again then punched the buttons for waypoint fourteen the machine blinked then ordered a course of to reach a point nautical miles away i went back to the cockpit if i went more than a halfmile on a heading of id pile marianne on to the rocks of herm but i turned nevertheless i let out the main sheet and marianne picked up her dowdy skirts and fairly flew in front of the wind i watched the shore approach twentyfive the girls voice said a few minutes before i would have struck rock i rammed the tiller hard over to bring marianne swivelling round into the wind i left her hoveto while i went down to the cabin and asked the decca where to go waypoint twentyfive was ten miles due north i wondered whether to compensate for magnetic north the decca could have been giving me a true course pointing me at the north pole or perhaps it had the magnetic correction programmed in so that its instructions would match my compass i decided my enemies had thought of everything else so why should i guess the compass correction for them id trust their machinery and see where it took me i eased mariannes head round and settled back on a reach the tide was with me sweeping us north towards the open sea i looked up and saw my attendant plane circling high above and where i wondered was the girl who was transmitting the waypoint numbers she had to be within my view for a vhf will only work within line of sight but it was hopeless to look for she could have been on any of the score of boats within view or on guernsey or on the smaller islands of herm and sark that lie to the east of the little russel i sailed on the radio had gone silent and i guessed that i had passed the first test by following the first instructions i cleared the platte fougere light at the northern end of the little russel and felt the western swell lifting mariannes frail hull the wind was light but steady the air was warm thirtysix the voice said from the radio and there was something oddly familiar and annoyingly complacent about that voice i was feeling rebellious so i didnt obey and a moment later the number was repeated and this time i noticed that the intonation of the repeated message was exactly the same as when the number had first been transmitted i also recognised the voice it belonged to a girl who read out the marine forecasts on radio four my opponents had taped her chopped the numbers from her forecasts and were now playing me those numbers over the air damn their cleverness waypoint thirtysix took me on a course fine into the southwesterly wind marianne was too light to head up into wind so i started the engine and let the sails hang while the propeller plugged me into the seas small chop the new course would take me plumb through a score of boats which fished for bass off the islands northern reefs any one of those boats could contain my enemies yet i was helpless to determine which if any it might be i deliberately steered close to some of the boats yet all looked innocent a woman waved to me from one boat while a man on another called out that it was a fine day twentyfive the voice said id been given that waypoint before and knew it lay due north i let mariannes head fall off the wind hardened her into a reach then stopped the engine the waypoint number wasnt repeated which meant they must have been watching me for they only repeated the transmissions when i failed to obey and that annoyed me they were training me programming me i had become a rat in a maze of invisible electronic commands that spanned the sea and their game was to spin me round the maze till i was tired hungry and ready to be slaughtered six said the voice which took me northwest eighteen which took me a few points north of east thirteen an unlucky number but which merely took me west eightyfour a brief curtsey to the southeast then they gave me twentyfive again to send me reaching northwards once more they played with me for two hours at first i could divine no pattern in the commands i sailed towards every point of the compass but was never given enough time to reach the invisible waypoint which lay at the end of the required course always and usually within a mile of the last command i would be made to change my heading gradually though i was being pushed northwards zigzagging away from the fading coast i was being sent into the empty sea far from any help my mouth was dry but at least the humid air was warm on my naked skin fortyfour the voice broke into my thoughts well practised now i pressed the decca buttons waypoint fortyfour lay fifty miles off on a bearing of virtually due east which would place it somewhere on the cherbourg peninsula so clearly waypoint fortyfour was not my rendezvous yet for the first time since i had cleared the little russel my controllers let me sail on undisturbed by now they must have been confident that i presented no danger to their careful plans they had made me sail in a random pattern and they must have watched till they were satisfied that no ships followed my intricate manoeuvres so now the real business of the day could begin they must i thought be unaware of my shepherding plane which was far off to the west the radio stayed silent as marianne held her eastwards course to the north i could see the sails of two yachts running away from me towards the alderney race while to the south the islands of sark and guernsey were a dark blur on a hazed horizon behind me in the west a plane droned aimlessly about the sky while to the east was nothing but the games ending death or revenge and the waiting night i lost track of time except for a rough estimate gained from the suns decline i was thirsty as hell the tide was ebbing from the east there had been a time when these waters had been a playground for charlie and me and in those happy days wed learned the vagaries of the notorious channel island tides marianne and i were fighting a neap tide the weakest but it was still like trying to run up a down escalator i knew id have a couple more hours of contrary tide before a period of slack after which the set would come strong from the north so we just plugged on marianne wasnt quick and she wasnt elegant but i was beginning to feel fond of her she was after all my boat if only for this one day we received no more waypoints but just stemmed the tide always heading east by low water when the tidal force subsided we were quite alone we had crossed the passage line for boats coming from cherbourg down to guernsey we were also well out of sight of land which suggested there would be no more radio transmissions for a while the wind was light but the long western swell was carrying the spiteful remnants of an atlantic storm sunflower would not have noticed such small waves but marianne was light and short enough to suffer she slapped her way across the crests and plunged hard down into shallow troughs i had lifted her centreboard to add a halfknot to her speed but the higher centre of gravity also made her roll like a bluewater yacht running before the trade winds after living on sunflower so long it seemed odd to be in such a cramped and low cockpit id never thought of sunflower as a big yacht but compared to marianne she had been a leviathan my aerial escort stayed in fitful touch the pilot did not stay close to me but rather he would fly a course which crossed mine disappear then come back a few minutes later it wasnt always the same plane sometimes it was a singleengined highwinged model and at other times it was a sleek machine with an engine nacelle on each wing i imagined harry abbott plotting my course in the police station the mappins creeping east towards the french coast east and south for the decca betrayed the first twitch of the new tidal surge from now until deep into the night the water would pour round the cap de la hague to fill the channel islands basin i put our head to the north to compensate for the new drift and knew that from now on i would be steering more and more northerly just to keep my easterly progress constant mariannes speed over the sea bed slowed and because we were now showing some beam to the ragged swell we began to roll uncomfortably so i sacrificed yet more speed by dropping the centreboard the board damped the rolling a little but marianne was still tender and every few minutes we would slam down into a trough and the water would come shattering back over the deck if the game didnt end soon i thought then id be in for a cold wet night but it wasnt my game it belonged to someone else and theyd planned it well sometime in the early evening i saw the southern and eastern horizons misting at first i dared to hope it was just a distant bank of cloud but i soon knew the truth that it was a rolling wall of fog my enemies must have chosen today because the weather forecast had warned against fog and it was somewhere inside that thick shrouding seahugging cloud that the games ending would be played out i knew that once i was inside the fog my shepherding aircraft would be useless and even the navys radar would be fortunate to find such a tiny boat as marianne harry must have shared my fear for when i was scarcely a mile from the fog bank the twinengined plane dropped out of the sky like a divebomber levelled above the sea and raced towards me the pilot flashed bright landing lights as if i hadnt already seen him the machine roared so close above me that its backwash of air set mariannes sails aback she was so light and tender that she threatened to heel right over but somehow steadied herself he came back again but this time he flew slower and well to one side of me i looked up to catch a glimpse of harrys ugly face he was gesturing westwards indicating that he wanted me to turn back the plane roared on banked and turned again towards me once more harry pointed westwards i looked back a tiny grey smear broke the horizon and i guessed that the royal navy patrol boat was after all keeping me company the navy must have been shadowing me from below the horizon kept in touch by the aircraft reports but now the fast patrol boat was accelerating towards me to make sure i obeyed harrys orders he feared for my safety in that clinging hiding fog or perhaps and this struck me as a more likely explanation sir leon feared id use the fog to sail away with four million pounds worth of unregistered bonds i waved reassuringly to harry shoved mariannes tiller hard over brought her into wind and started the motor the plane flew over me waggled its wings in approval of my obedience in turning back then climbed away mariannes outboard pushed us west the patrol boat seemed to come no closer so far as harry was concerned the days excitement was over and all we could do was lick our wounds and hope our enemies tried again only i wasnt buying that safe course i had a girl to revenge and a curiosity to assuage so i waited till i could hardly see the plane then i turned marianne again i let the sails out to catch the faltering wind and throttled the motor hard up now it was a race between me and the patrol boat but id gained some precious time by my pretended compliance and it would be some minutes before the naval boat was certain that i really had turned back to the east i pulled the centreboard up to add that precious ounce of speed and raced for the fog which was much closer now scarcely a halfmile away and rolling fast towards me from the south it looked white and pretty but i knew what waited inside i watched westwards rather than east sure enough after a few minutes i saw a bow wave flash beneath the distant grey dot the race was on now one crummy little french yacht made of plywood and glue against the turbines of a fast patrol boat except the crummy little yacht was already so close to the concealing fog the first tendrils of the fog wisped past me and i felt the instant drop in temperature the fog had been formed by warm air over cold sea but the vapour stole all the days warmth and it felt as if i had gone from summer into instant winter i kept the motor at full throttle banging mariannes light bows across the choppy waves i looked behind to see the fog wrapping about me i kept on my course but after a minute or so i looked up and saw my masttip hidden in the vapour so i turned hard to port so that i was travelling behind the moving face of the fog bank and into the tide i was hoping that my pursuers would presume that i had turned downtide to add the waters speed to my own the outboard motor suddenly seemed very loud i counted the seconds one minute passed two then i turned off the engine and let marianne drift silence already my sails boom and sheets were beaded with moisture it was a grandfather of fogs this one a thick grey horror that restricted visibility to less than thirty yards the temperature must have dropped twenty degrees marianne rocked in the waves there was wind in the fog enough to slap her wet sails about so i sheeted her in and turned her bows northeast i let most of the power slip from the sails so i could listen for the naval vessel silence again then apparently not far off my starboard bow i heard the sound of engines idling i knew the apparent closeness of the sound could be deceiving for noise does strange things in fog the naval crew might be a hundred yards to port or a mile to starboard the only certainty was that they would be concentrating on their radar but without a reflector in mariannes rigging my sails and wooden mast offered them lousy echoes that would be further confused by the watersoaked air the wavetops were probably reflecting as much as marianne it was dark cold and dank in the fog if it had not been for the compass i would have been lost in minutes but i crept onwards i was steering northeast but the tides effect was to drive me almost due east i imagined the patrol boat would be idling along on scarceturning engines making a boxsearch in the whiteness my hope was that id decoyed them into going too far south then i dared to hope that i might have escaped them altogether by crossing the invisible line which separated british waters from french that was a happy thought which i celebrated by rubbing my hand along the underside of the boom then licking the condensation off my palm i was parched and the fresh water tasted good the patrol boats engines suddenly roared faded roared again i swivelled in alarm but saw nothing a moment later i thought i saw the patrol boats lean dark shape in the fog but the dark shape was just a phantom of the fog which roiled and faded a ships bell clanged apparently from the port side i heard a distant voice shouting and i wondered whether the game was over had they found garrard and peel was that it had harry been cleverer than my opponents and already made his arrests was elizabeth sitting in a police interview room protesting her nobility that thought almost tempted me to shout a reply but there was only one way to be sure of this games ending and that was to see it through and so i kept silent and let my little boat sail on after a half hour or so i hauled in the sheets to power the sails and marianne began to slam her hollow bows this was a fog such as charlie had described that morning a fog that did not blanket a wind but was carried by it the fogs on this coast could come with gale force shipkilling winds cloaked in invisibility and this light southwesterly air would never clear such a fog but merely stir it i judged from our wake that we were making close to three knots and knew marianne would go no faster without her engine i heard nothing more of the patrol boat maybe an hour passed maybe more the only hint of time was the slow darkening of the fog as it went from pearl grey to dirty smoke my evasive action had taken me too far to port and the decca was telling me to steer a good fifteen points further south i obeyed it i still didnt use the engine in case the patrol boat had not given up the chase another hour passed and the dirty grey turned into wet gloom i didnt see the patrol boat again nor hear him i was alone there was neither radar nor human eye neither boat nor aircraft to watch me there was only the dumb instructions of the decca beckoning me on into the darkening fog it was a lonely place lonely and cold and frightening the sea had lost all colour to become a dull grey and black broken by a few feeble whitecaps sometimes i would sail into a less dense patch of fog but always the wraithlike clouds wrapped around us again and sometimes so thickly that i completely lost sight of mariannes stemhead once night came it was as if we sailed in a thick black and silent limbo there was no light in the compass no moon could penetrate this fog and the stars were hidden it was dark but not quite silent waves slapped against my thin hull the frayed ropes rasped in their blocks and the mast creaked but there was none of the seas great noise because the fog absorbed it all it also dampened my matches but i managed to light a pipeful of tobacco with the last useful match i was cold and beginning to think i was wasting my time perhaps harry had won and all i now did was sail blindly towards the treacherous coast north of carteret surely by now i reasoned my enemies would have revealed themselves but nothing untoward disturbed the thick blank night the pipe went out i tried to light another match but they were useless for supper i scraped moisture off the boom trickled it into my cupped palm and lapped like a dog i slapped my arms about my chest to keep warm but still shivered fifteen said a voice on the radio and the sudden word made me cry aloud in scared astonishment it had been so long since i had been disturbed by a command now suddenly the radio had sounded and i twitched on the thwart then stared about the darkness as though i might see my enemy nothing stirred in the night it was so dark that i could not even see the fog i was in an absolute darkness the blackness of the blind i could feel the fog cold on my skin but i could see nothing fifteen the voice repeated again only this command wasnt being transmitted in the voice of the radio announcer but was being given in a mans voice fifteen he said yet again as though he did not trust the electronic wizardry at his command and this time i recognised the clipped savage tones of garrard i slid into the cabin and pressed the decca buttons the small illuminated numerals instructed me to head southeast towards a waypoint that was just miles distant that was a mere two hours sailing away less with the tides help and i knew i was close to the games end for my enemies had been forced to abandon their first radio the one with the tapecassette attached and must be using a radio aboard a boat my killers waited there but they lacked the assurance of my first controller for they had repeated the number three times in quick succession they didnt trust their machinery and that lack of trust told me they were nervous garrard was a confident and able man but perhaps he was no seaman and perhaps he was frightened by this utter blackness above a colourless sea and that thought gave me a pulse of hope in the cold darkness mariannes motion was easier after we turned now instead of fighting the tide set we travelled with the water the wind had edged southerly so we were tight hauled but i could hear the purposeful slap and hiss of the water at her bows that betrayed a quicker progress fifteen garrard said again and i felt a fierce joy he was nervous hed been told what to do and he didnt really trust the instructions he was making sure by repetition and that repetition betrayed his uncertainty to me he was not at home out here but i had spent years of my life on the ocean it was not much of an advantage but it was all i had that and two lengths of rope he did not transmit again i had stopped noticing the cold because i was thinking hard and the results of that thinking were helping my confidence till now they had played with me they had sent me on a variety of courses but they had never once let me sail so far that i reached the waypoint to which they pointed me they had used the courses alone and when i had travelled far enough along any particular line they had turned me in a new direction yet this new waypoint was close suggesting that i was being guided to the rendezvous itself my enemies i reasoned would not trust the conjunction of two courses to define the rendezvous for the crossing of two invisible lines drawn across the sea left too much room for error either of the boats could overshoot the mark and the decca would never betray that overshoot instead the careful clever mind that had prepared this meeting would have made the rendezvous the waypoint itself for the silicon chips inside the decca were designed to take a boat to that exact spot if i passed the waypoint the decca would tell me if i went too far to port or starboard the decca would tell me the decca was taking the four million pounds home but the decca was also telling me exactly where my enemies waited they had set an ambush but to make their ambush foolproof they had been forced to tell the victim just where it was placed i knew where they were and they did not know where i was all they knew was that by some electronic trickery i should sail docilely into their grip so god damn their cleverness because it might yet let me win i watched the decca like a hawk the tide was quickening helping me my speed over the ground inched up three knots the distance decreased fast i went too far to port and the decca told me so i took marianne back until the little box said i was aiming true three point eight knots then four and i began looking about marianne for a weapon there was the decca aerial itself a whiplike thing but it would be clumsy to carry and i needed to keep it in place till the very last minute i wondered if i could wrench the drive shaft from the outboard motor but knew it would be a hopeless task without tools so i had nothing but the two mooring ropes i also had cleverness except that i wasnt being very clever for garrard must have known roughly what time i should reach the waypoint thanks to the tide i had little choice but to approach from the north but i could control the time of my arrival yet now i was doing exactly what he had been told to expect he was waiting for me and i needed to stretch his nerves in this cold dark so i turned marianne on to a broad reach that took her eastwards i knew garrard wouldnt give up i was carrying four million good reasons why he wouldnt give up and why i wondered was garrard trusted to collect the money i could understand why elizabeth would not get close to the transaction herself but why trust a crook i would not have trusted garrard with four pence let alone four million pounds in bonds the only answer i could devise was that elizabeth was relying on garrards lack of seamanship he had a boat and doubtless a decca like mine if he followed the deccas preprogrammed instructions he would be safe but if he struck out on his own he would be lost in some of the worlds most dangerous waters to the east lay a lee shore to the west and south were the rocks about the islands and the savage rocks of the minkies while to the north lay the fearsome tidal races of alderney and the swinge that thought gave me a new confidence i was the seaman out here and that had to be worth something fifteen garrard said again perhaps an hour after he transmitted the instruction fifteen so he was nervous and he was wondering why the lamb hadnt turned up at the slaughterhouse on time hed be fidgeting at the waypoint staring northwest into the black void and wondering if everything had gone wrong i sailed on eastwards let the bastard worry the decca continually updated the waypoints bearing i went on sailing east long after the waypoint was due south from me i sailed on for what i guessed was a further hour and only then did i let marianne run south and west the decca gave me the course pointing an invisible line to my revenge now once more the distance to the waypoint began shortening the tide was helping me and marianne was making knots over the ground two miles to go the wind had picked up it was blowing against the tide with just enough force to make small badtempered waves over which mariannes light hull bounced sickeningly at one mile to go i dropped the mainsail i let it fall roughly over the boom my speed dropped i let the jib sheet fly and waited till i was sure we were dead in the water then as the boat wallowed drunkenly i crouched by the decca i wanted to know exactly how the tide was flowing marianne herself was not moving in relation to the water but the sea itself was sweeping us south at half a knot the drift was not exactly south the decca said our present course was which was east of south i needed to know that tidal direction if the halfplan in my head stood any chance of working that halfplan also needed the luck of the devil i hauled in the jib so that we ghosted onwards the decca told me marianne had one mile to sail then her job was done i stared into the black fog seeking a hint of shadow a sharper edge of darkness amid the night a light anything that would betray my enemies i was looking but i heard them first classical music vivaldi i thought i rammed the tiller hard to port so that marianne came slowly round i tied off the tiller marianne was sailing a point north of west now and i crouched by the decca again waiting till the machine told me that the waypoint was bearing exactly degrees from me once it did i went topsides unlashed the tiller and let the jib fall on to the foredeck i was a quartermile from my enemies drifting towards their soft betraying noise marianne rocked to the waves as the sweet sound came intermittently across the water now i was drifting to the ambush carried there by the weakening tide and still i stared southwards and saw the light and knew where i was the light flashed fast nothing but a pearled flicker in the fog the flicker was so hazed by the vapour that the quick flashes were reduced to mere dissipated blinks but i could see it was a white light flashing nine times in quick succession a cardinal buoy a buoy marking a hazard and there was only one such buoy i could think of in this part of the sea if i was right we were four or five miles off the french coast hard by the shoaling rocks called les trois grunes which were marked by a single cardinal buoy which lay to the west of the dangerous bank i was relying on my memory of the old days when charlie and i had made these waters our hunting territory that the buoy was the rendezvous made absolute sense garrard i suspected was no seaman for him to jockey a boat against wind and tide to hold it motionless at an exact point in the sea would be an impossible job even with the deccas help instead he had been guided to this lonely buoy to which doubtless he had made his boat fast the light flickered again and this time i saw the boat which was indeed moored illegally to the buoy she was a lowsterned working boat with a wheelhouse behind a raised foredeck she must have been close to thirty feet long a substantial boat wellengined sturdy and solid enough to give its unfamiliar crew a sense of safety i blinked as another light showed this one a searchlight that flickered out into the fog so garrard was risking his night vision as well as his hearing put not your trust in killers i thought unless theyre good seamen i wouldnt want to meet garrard on land but out here he was in my cold world not his i closed mariannes companionway leaving the money below i took the coiled rope from the cockpit sole and wrapped it round my waist we were drifting towards the workboat and even the nightblinded garrard must see us soon so it was time to go i took a breath then lowered myself over mariannes port side the water was very cold it might have been late summer but the channel waters can still strike to the heart like an icepick i shivered and shuddered but i had to depend on unsettling my ambushers id frayed their nerves by coming late now i must fray them further by a vanishing act i breaststroked away from marianne the tide was carrying us both southwards but perhaps a little to the east of the buoy i couldnt see the light now not from the water but i breaststroked southwards and hoped to god that i hadnt misjudged the tides i was trying to keep pace with the drifting marianne but staying far enough away from her so that i would not be seen when she was discovered the rope about my waist was absorbing the water and threatening to drag me down a bank of fog closed round me hiding even marianne from me i trod water the rope was getting heavy and i felt a moment of panic that i had already been swept past the cardinal buoy but then i saw the nine flashes hazing in the fog and heard the small waves slapping at the hull of the big waiting boat the searchlight stabbed out again its beam swallowed and scattered by the fog but this time mariannes red hull reflected dimly and i heard a shout the music was abruptly switched off get up front the voice was garrards clear as a bell i could see two men on board the workboat clearly the old firm of garrard and peel had come to finish their work i swam southwards i could hear garrard shouting he had assumed i was on board marianne and now ordered me to steer for his boat i was shivering a drift of fog hid their boat from me then i heard its motor choke into life and i feared being left in the cold water and turned desperately towards the noise and the now blinding flash of the cardinal buoy garrard must have cast off from the buoy and was now edging his big boat towards the wallowing marianne my estimate of the tidal drift had been good but not so accurate that the small yacht would have drifted directly on to the buoy and thus garrard had been forced to go to her he only needed to travel about fifteen yards the two boats were east of me and i swam hard going close by the tall yellowandblack buoy that heaved up on the short choppy seas its intermittent light strobed on the workboats stern that was now just a few yards ahead of me i heard a splintering thump as garrard misjudged his approach and laid his boats bows into mariannes hull then his engine subsided into a soft thumping growl a man from his size and weight i guessed him to be peel was on the workboats foredeck with a boathook then when he brought it to his shoulder i saw it wasnt a boathook but a shotgun or rifle i swam a little closer my teeth were chattering cant see the bugger that was peel hes inside garrard was sheltering from the nights cold in the workboats brightly lit wheelhouse i saw him light a cigarette then i swam under the workboats counter and lost sight of him the cardinal buoy flashed behind and in its quick light i saw the workboats name painted above my head mistspinner of poole christ but it was cold the cold was slowing me my wounded ankles were numb id planned to climb aboard their boat somehow when they were busy with marianne but i doubted i would have the strength to make that climb it sounds easy climbing aboard a boat but in a choppy sea it can take an immense effort without a helping hand or a boarding ladder the workboats platform was long and low an easy enough gunwale to climb but not when youre cold and weak get on board garrard shouted i guessed peel was somehow clinging to mariannes shrouds holding her alongside mistspinner and fearful of making the jump between the unevenly moving hulls tie her up first for christs sake garrards temper was clearly at snapping point but he must have turned on the searchlight to help his companion for i saw its reflection hazed in the fog all around me drop the bloody gun you fool tie her up then get on board they couldnt see me they were blinded by their searchlight and too intent on trying to lash the two bumping boats together now jump i heard garrard shout from his warm wheelhouse i was under mistspinners stern she was bucking up and down and i feared that her transom might crush down on my head a foot above her waterline was an empty outboard bracket which i tried to hold on to for support i missed the first time and the hull grazed agonisingly down my left arm i grabbed again held it and gasped for breath i had to work fast but it was hard mistspinners pitching threatened to pull my left arm out of its socket but i held on while with my right hand i untwisted the rope from my waist it was a heavy piece of oldfashioned manila really nothing but a discarded piece of junk but perfect for my purposes except my fingers were now so numb that i did not know if i could do what i had planned i fumbled the rope almost dropped it once but finally managed to drape the rope over the outboard bracket i took a deep breath kept hold of the ropes end with my left hand then ducked under the heaving stern i struggled forward found nothing took a numbing blew from the dropping hull on my left shoulder and had to come back up for air i took another deep breath ducked again and kicked my way forward under mistspinners stern the metal rudder scraped against my bruised and bleeding shoulder it was black here black and freezing and airless and frightening tons of thumping boat were rising and falling above me i felt forward with my right hand and found what i wanted a threebladed propeller mounted amidships which meant just a single engine driving just this single prop the engine was still in neutral and its throbbing seemed to fill the claustrophobic darkness with menace i dragged the rope behind me i was holding on to the propeller which was vibrating with the rhythm of the idling motor if garrard put the boat into gear now id lose my hand i forced the rope into the narrow space between the propeller and the rudder i was desperate for air but i needed to fasten the rope first i looped it over the upright blade hitched it round once more then dragged myself back and bobbed up to the surface where i gulped air into my lungs hes not here that was peels voice i was gasping for breath sure i would be heard but they were too intent on their own concerns of course hes there garrard snarled hes bloody not then look for the damned money i ducked down again went forward and this time because i knew where the propeller was i had more time to work i had time but fear and cold were making me clumsy i remembered some old rules for bad moments at sea dont hurry and do one thing at a time i might be freezing and terrified but all i had to do was work the thick rope round and round mistspinners propeller blades barnacles on her hull scraped my back bloody as i stuffed handfuls of the heavy manila into the blade gaps i finished the job by putting two turns of the rope about the rudders stock then my lungs bursting with pain i pushed myself back and upwards christ i thought as i broke water i must give up smoking the moneys here but he must have fallen off and drowned peel shouted from marianne i dont give a damn where he is garrard said just get back here i was gripping the outboard bracket at mistspinners stern my lungs hurt my back was stinging and i was cold but i knew i must push myself away from the hull before garrard put his engine into gear i knew he would probably use reverse gear to back away from marianne and if i had done a proper job mistspinner wouldnt move but i still didnt want to risk the rope shredding the propeller biting and me being driven under her hull put it down and shut up garrard shouted from above me and untie that boat hurry i had already paddled three or four yards clear of mistspinners stern i heard peel shout that the yacht was free and i saw garrard glance behind as if he was reversing a truck then he pulled the gear lever back and i heard the motor roar then stop dead it just stopped the gearing had transferred the engines power to the shaft but the propeller was held fast by the rope i had jammed about the blades and the sudden resistance stopped the motor with a brutal abruptness there was a seconds silence then garrard swore put the gear lever into neutral and turned the starting key the engine backfired then settled into life a billow of black smoke drifted over me garrard pulled the lever back and again the motor was jarred dead fucking things broke peel offered helpfully garrard cursed the engine and started it again he left it in neutral while it settled into a steady rhythm i had swum back to the stern and was once again holding on to the outboard bracket i could see marianne drifting away as garrard raced the mistspinners engine achieving nothing except a cloud of burnt oil that added to the fog then when the engine was racing he shoved it into gear it stopped dead christ albloodymighty garrard swore viciously i was praying he would not try to jar the motor into gear again for each time he did so he put a killing strain on the engine if he persisted time and again in forcing its brute power against the jammed propeller then he could shear the crankshaft then all of us would be stranded on this foggy lee shore i glanced behind to see we had drifted a good two hundred yards from the cardinal buoy its light was again hazed by fog i knew we could not be far from the rocks of les trois grunes i also knew the tide set was swinging and weakening and though the tide should take us south of the hazard the wind was a counterforce that might just be driving us on to the danger a seaman would have realised the danger but garrard and peel were no seamen i heard the engine cover being lifted all right mr garrard peel shouted the engine started in neutral without the obstructed propeller it ran sweetly sounds all right peel said hopefully garrard rammed it into gear the engine stopped dead garrard let loose a string of curses they were amateurs their engine was broken and they didnt know what to do a seaman would have realised there was an outboard bracket on mistspinners stern for just such emergencies and swum to retrieve marianne so that her engine could be utilised but garrard and peel didnt think of that they were already in the spiral of selffeeding panic that causes most disasters at sea one apparently small thing goes wrong then another and slowly inexorably the tragedies mount up on land neither man would have been so prey to fear but out here the unfamiliar cold and dark and seadanger had unbalanced their susceptibilities they were drifting in the night they didnt know it but they were drifting towards les trois grunes id only seen those rocks once in my life and then from a safe distance but i well remembered the broken and turbulent water surrounding them i clung on to mistspinner shivering and weakening waiting to add to their panic its the shaft garrards voice sounded very close above me and i guessed he must have been leaning over the engine go and take a look he said at last i dont know about engines im not talking about the engine you fool the engine works doesnt it im talking about the bloody propeller garrard had at last worked out what might be wrong lean over the back and tell me what you can see he might be there peel at least had not forgotten the mystery of my absence garrard swore i pulled myself round mistspinners counter so that i would be hidden when peel leaned over the stern i held on to a rubbing strake and prayed that the cold would not sap my last reserves of strength then despite the cold i almost screamed in fear a gun fired the flash of it was blinding and the sound of it deafening garrard had gone to the stern and blasted a shotgun into the water if i had not moved round the counter i would have taken that cartridge clean in the skull garrard fired again hes not there now peel i heard the heavy gun drop on to the deck so bloody look while i try again i was shivering with fear and cold but made myself edge to the very corner of the stern peel was very close to me but he wouldnt have seen me if id been waving at him his eyes were so lightblinded give it a go he shouted garrard started the engine put it in gear and it stopped i shivered and said a small prayer of thanks that the crankshaft had not broken well garrard asked i dont know what they expected to see they were just groping in the frightening dark searching for any straw to clutch i cant see nothing peel shouted then lean over properly you bastard peel leaned over there was a single lifting derrick at mistspinners stern put there for hauling pots and he held on to it as he craned far out over the transom go on then garrard started the engine again peel leaned out to look down into the blackness and i pulled myself up on the outboard bracket as i pulled mistspinners hull dropped on a wave so that i shot up from the black sea shedding water like a drowned man coming to life peel could not even call out before my cold hands had gripped the collar of his coat i fell back pulling he was a huge man far heavier than i but terror and shock were on my side he was already leaning outwards and now i dragged him down he lost his grip on the derrick opened his mouth to shout then hit the water the motor roared surrounding us with noise and smoke then abruptly died as garrard pushed it into gear i let go of peel and twisted desperately away so that he could not grab hold of me garrard looking from the lit wheelhouse into the foggy darkness did not know what had happened he shouted for peel who was splashing and spluttering two yards from mistspinners stern help peel finally shouted then spluttered as he went under again i was working my way forward along the hull i was cold and weak but desperation was giving me a last surge of warming adrenalin you fucking idiot garrard twisted off the helmsmans chair and ran aft it was him peel shouted then more urgently and pathetically i cant swim garrard seized a lifebelt and hurled it towards his partner i grabbed the gunwale said a prayer and pulled i had worked my way forward so that i was close to the open afterend of the wheelhouse the freeboard was low here to give men room to work crab pots or longlines i grabbed and heaved trusting that garrard would still be confused by the panic he saw me as i rolled my right leg up to the gunwale for a second he didnt quite believe what he saw then he ran towards me to kick me off the gunwale he would have finished me there and then but les trois grunes saved me we had been taken to where the sea bed rose to undercut the waves the swell was breaking and lurching and mistspinner suddenly heaved up to one such broken sea garrard staggered desperately away and almost went overboard only steadying himself at the last moment with a despairing lunge for the derrick the delay let me roll over the gunwale on to the deck i needed a weapon any weapon and i saw an old rope fender by my hand so i picked it up and threw it blindly towards him garrard ducked out of its way the searchlight mounted on the wheelhouse roof was still pointing forward and i could see in the pearly fog where marianne was rolling in water broken white about the shoals i hadnt been looking for that danger but for another weapon the only thing i could find was an empty plastic fishbox the kind that are packed with ice and newly caught fish i snatched it up turned back and saw that garrard had drawn his longbladed knife he ignored the discarded shotgun clearly it was empty and he had no cartridges in the pockets of his tweed jacket very clever my lord he smiled at me his confidence so abraded by the night and the sea was returning for now he was in a situation he could master one man against one man with death as the finale very clever he said again then he let go of the derrick and came towards me i raised the heavy fishbox as a shield mistspinner heaved up then thumped down garrard lost his balance and i charged him i was still cold and weak but i was used to a pitching deck and he was not i whirled the heavy box like a club hoping to slam him overboard but he dropped to one knee under my wild swing and lunged the knife like a poniard i stepped back just in time tried to crush him with the box but a heave of the sea threw him back from my blow i could hear peel splashing at the stern he had the lifebelt now and it could only be a matter of time before he was back on board all around us the sea was fretting white while beneath us the sea bed was rising to shatter the waves into churning chaos now garrard shouted at the same time glancing over my shoulder towards the companionway that led to the forward cuddy i fell for the trick because i had still not convinced myself that elizabeth would trust garrard and that she might therefore have been sheltering in the tiny cabin i glanced back for a halfsecond realised id been fooled but by the time i looked back garrard was already moving he threw himself forward knife reaching i swung the fishbox but he was past my defence and i felt a dull punch on my right side the boat rocked to port garrard staggered and i hit him hard in the face with the plastic box the blow jarred him sideways so that he fell on to the open engine hatch i was hurt blood was streaming down my wet shorts and dripping on to the deck garrard had fallen heavily across the engine it was the moment for me to finish him off but i was too weakened by the cold all i could do was clumsily swing the plastic box at him the blow achieved nothing garrard rolled off the engine towards the stern and picked himself up mistspinner was broaching to the waves jerking and rolling garrard braced himself against the stern gunwale waiting for a wave to pass when it did and mistspinner was momentarily stable he came forward with short dancing steps like a boxer approaching cautiously for a final attack i was only just realising how much the cold sea had weakened me i was shivering bleeding gasping for breath and i think garrard knew i was finished he smiled had enough fuck off it was a feeble defiance he was still braced against the stern one hand on the derrick the other holding the knife he gave the sea rapid glances waiting for a calm trough of the waves to give himself a moments peace during which he could kill me peel was clinging to the stern unable to haul his huge weight over the transom you didnt kill me before i tried to goad garrard and you wont now he laughed we werent meant to kill you the first time just scare the shit out of you he edged forward but a surge of sea water made him stagger back to the derricks security i wondered if hed been telling the truth and that the attempt on my life in cullens yard had been nothing but a scare tactic so why kill me now why ever not he was amusing himself whatever elizabeths paying you i said ill double i was not planning to make any deals just to kill him but i wanted to distract him for a few seconds instead i had amused him your sisters paying me nothing were partners he was mocking my ignorance but behind the mockery i detected an odd tenderness youre lovers i said in astonishment and understood at last why she trusted him with the money and partners it was i after all who discovered the picture and it was i who graciously allowed your sister to invest in that discovery he glanced astern and i saw a smooth trough approaching behind a steep crest and i knew that when that smooth water settled the pitching hull he would come for me what do you mean i asked discovered it elizabeth and you stole it he laughed proclaim your innocence to the end my lord and much good may it do you he looked behind again judging the waves approach and while he was looking away from me i charged he must have sensed the attack for he looked back quickly saw me stagger as the wave heaved mistspinner high then as her bows dropped he let go of the derrick and came at me he lunged with the knife i swung the fishbox but his lunge had been a feint he danced away but i had released the box so that it hit him a glancing blow on the hip mistspinner tilted backwards on the waves crest and the violent motion together with my small blow gave me just enough time to twist away and scramble on to the narrow walkway beside the wheelhouse garrard followed me but he wasnt so nimble about a boat and his desperate slash at my right thigh missed i was defeated and fleeing i wanted to reach the foredeck from where i would dive overboard and swim after the drifting marianne which id last seen off mistspinners bows i was too cold and weak to defeat garrard but i could leave him here stranded and helpless while i sailed away to fetch reinforcements it wasnt brave but it was sensible garrard clambered desperately after me i limped forward the searchlight was still switched on aimed blindly forward to where the waves shattered about les trois grunes marianne was thirty yards off the port bow and rolling violently in the shoal water it would be a tough swim perhaps a killing swim but better to die in the seas cold cleanness than from garrards knife i took a breath then in the fogged beam of the searchlight i saw the second shotgun it was peels shotgun the weapon he must have discarded on the foredeck when he had first boarded marianne the gun now lay in mistspinners bow scuppers trapped there by the pulpit bars i threw myself at the weapon a lurch of the sea made me trip on the forehatch rim i fell but the boats motion slid me on my bloodslicked belly to where the gun waited a steel cleat ripped at my thigh garrard saw the weapon and jumped desperately from the small platform beside the wheelhouse his knife was raised mistspinner corkscrewed in a sudden upsurge of the sea then thumped down into a trough my cold hands could not grip the weapon and when the boat lurched to starboard i almost let the gun fall into the water i half slid off the deck after it only saving myself by grabbing the pulpit rail with my left hand white water seethed and broke under me garrard shouted as the deck heaved back up and i imagined his voice was shouting in triumph and i almost screamed because my imagination felt his blades deep slash the gun was precarious in my nerveless right hand the knife still didnt strike the shout had been garrards protest as a roll of the deck jarred him back against the wheelhouse i twisted on to my back life was counted in fractions of seconds now if garrard could reach me then i would be dead but if the boats violence in the shoals made him clumsy and gave me time then i would live i turned to face him and could see nothing except the blinding white brilliance of the searchlight beam i was still half overboard clinging to the pulpit with my left hand i tried to sit up but an upward surge of the bows drove me down i could not see garrard i was blinded by light paralysed by weakness and terrified mistspinner hammered off the wave crest and a spout of breaking water exploded up beside me i was tempted to let myself fall and to strike out for the drifting marianne i did not even know if this gun was loaded let alone cocked but then a slice of silver light dazzled from the great white blinding flood of the searchlight it was the knife blade raised to strike and beside it was a ghost of a face mouth open teeth showing shouting then the light was blotted out by garrards body as he hurled himself towards me my thumb groped for the guns hammers no time i was screaming defiance and fear i barely had time to pull the triggers my right hand was round the narrow part of the stock the guns butt was against my ribs and the barrels were pointing somewhere at the shadow above me i pulled both triggers i was still screaming now in anticipation of the knifes strike the gun had been cocked the butt drove into my ribs like a kicking horse noise filled the chaotic air garrards head simply disappeared blood fountained in a halo about the searchlight beam i watched appalled the first strong colour of this black night his knife clattered down to the deck and lodged against my right ankle while his body twitched back as if plucked by strings it slammed against the sloping wheelhouse windows then slid down on to the foredeck i closed my eyes i was still half overboard my ribs hurt i was cold and shaking i pulled with my left hand and slowly very slowly i inched myself aboard white water broke at mistspinners stem and drenched the foredeck and when i opened my eyes i saw garrards diluted blood flooding the shallow scuppers i rolled on to my side safe now inside the pulpit rails and slowly very slowly knelt upright i still clutched the gun garrards expensive tweed jacket was soaked in blood the cloth of the jacket had snagged on a cleat and the motion of the boat was twitching him from side to side in a sick parody of life but he was dead id blown away his knowing confident face all that was left of his head was a butchers mess of blood brains and bone i just stared at him as if i expected the headless corpse somehow to stand and come back to the attack i was shaking id never killed a man before id promised jennifer to kill this one but making the promise was one thing fulfilling it was quite another blood gurgled in the scuppers and drained overboard help peel shouted from the stern very slowly very stiffly i picked myself up i felt weak and sick and cold mistspinner heaved and fell i took a huge breath realised i wasnt going to vomit so picked a careful path through the offal on the deck i edged past the wheelhouse to see peel clinging to the stern hed used the lifebelts rope to reach the transom but he was too cold to pull himself aboard i swivelled the searchlight to dazzle him his eyes became huge as i walked down the aft deck i put the double barrels close to his left eye what was the signal you were supposed to send when youd got the money dont shoot for christs sake dont shoot his teeth were chattering what was the signal you were supposed to send when youd got the money my voice was toneless there had to be such a signal i knew fingers he said i stared at him such a banal word fingers i said incredulously honest dont shoot please and where were you taking the money i dont know i jerked the barrels to cut one of his eyebrows where peel where its on the little box i cant work it i dont know mate he was sobbing with terror and cold now i dont know mr garrard worked the box not me the decca of course i pulled the guns triggers and the hammers fell on to the dead chambers get in the boat if you can i said and if you cant drown the boat slammed down into white water so far as i could remember the rocks at les trois grunes only dried out at the lowest tides yet that was small consolation a dip in the long swell could easily drop us on to one of the rock pinnacles and rip the bottom out of mistspinner so my first task was to clear mistspinner away from the hazard and only then look for the clever mind that had spun me through this electronic maze the night wasnt over yet and maybe the killing wasnt done but at least i had evened the game if garrard had known boats he would still have been alive and i would have been dead for mistspinner had a prop plate most working boats have such a plate put there against the eventuality of drifting across their towed lines because no fisherman wants to go overboard to clear a fouled prop just aft of the sternbox they put a bolted plate which lifted gives access to the propeller i found some tools in the wheelhouse it needed all my strength on the big wrench to shift the bolts one of the old rusted bolts sheared but the others came free and i swung the plate aside to reveal the small black well of cold water i could have fetched garrards knife from the foredeck but i didnt fancy the sight of his corpse so instead i rummaged through the wheelhouse cavelockers and found an old gutting knife i reached down into the cold water and cut the rope free from the propeller blades it took less than five minutes peel whimpered at the stern alternately calling for help and cursing once or twice he tried to climb aboard but the cold had sapped his huge strength i ignored him as i bolted the prop plate home and laid the deck planks back into place then i picked up garrards discarded shotgun and tossed it overboard help please peel whimpered i unshackled the pulley from the lifting derrick hold on to that i told him he grasped the pulleys hook with his right hand i took the tackles strain inching him up the transom mistspinner was thumping and lurching in the broken water i couldnt see any of the hidden rocks but i knew where they were because their presence was betrayed by a swirling turmoil of water not far from the port bow the water seemed to be sucked down towards the rock pinnacles then to shatter upwards in a white misting spray come on you bastard i shouted at peel urging him to use some of his great strength to help himself he must have sensed the danger for he gave a great heave just as a surge of the swell tipped up the stern so that he fell gasping and exhausted into the boat i could hear the suck and rebound of the water about the rocks we were close to the rock pinnacles too close and the suction of the white water was drawing us closer i staggered forward started the engine and pushed the gear lever forward for a second the engine faltered and i thought for a terrible second that i hadnt cleared the propeller blades properly and that we would be drawn crashingly down into the rocks i rammed the throttle forward prayed and somehow the engine recovered the rocks were perilously close now just off the port beam we tipped towards them and i thought we were doomed to slide sideways down the smooth face of the indrawn water to hammer our gunwales on the black rock i gave mistspinner full rudder and raced the engine a wave shattered to port spewing water high over mistspinners aerials the propeller seemed to be spinning uselessly in the broken water i felt a sideways lurch then the blades bit the sea and the boat began to fight her way free a rebound of water shoved us on our way i spun the wheel amidships to lessen the resistance to the propellers thrust and inch by inch then foot by foot mistspinner gained speed i turned her to starboard again and this time there was no resistance and she went sweetly away towards safety i said a prayer of thanks pulled back the throttle then turned to watch the broken sea recede peel had not moved perhaps he had been too scared to move or perhaps he had been too weakened by his long immersion he just watched me beyond him was the rockshattered swell and beyond that somehow safe in the turmoil was marianne she had drifted north of the rising pinnacle she was pitching and rolling and i supposed she would drift onwards to be tumbled ashore on a french beach then the fog and the night hid her from me and i turned mistspinner westwards id found four spare shotgun cartridges when id searched for the knife to free mistspinners propellers now i took them from the cavelocker and let peel watch me as i loaded the shotgun he didnt move not even when i put the gun down while i checked the fuel she had two extra tanks in sidelockers plenty enough for whatever else this night might bring peel watched me go back to the wheelhouse wheres mr garrard he asked nervously on the foredeck he hasnt got a head any more if you move you wont have one either i lifted the shotgun on to my lap as i accelerated mistspinner into the shredding fog i saw the flash of the cardinal buoy went past it and only then did i let mistspinner drift because it was time to find my way out of the electronic maze the decca had two waypoints only we were already at the first so the mysterys end must lie at the second i summoned that second waypoint to the screen it lay at fifty degrees twelve minutes and forty seconds of arc north by zero three degrees fortysix minutes and sixty seconds of arc west it was miles away at a course of so very precise i thought so very well planned how were you supposed to kill me peel i didnt turn round to ask the question that wasnt insouciance or bravery because i could see his reflection in the windscreen and he wasnt moving he did not answer how were you supposed to kill me peel i asked again he still did not answer so i whipped round on the helmsmans chair and fired the right barrel two feet above his head the pellets probably grazed his bald head for he whimpered how were you supposed to kill me peel we was just supposed to drown you he almost whispered in reply then sink the little boat to make it look like youd drowned and the money had sunk to make it look as if id stolen the money as well as the painting yes guv thank you peel i said very politely then turned away from him i found some old stained charts in a drawer but i didnt really need them i knew where fifty twelve zero three fortysix was i could probably have got there blindfold but i spread a passage chart out all the same then reloaded the guns right barrel did you turn the gas on in my boat peel i asked it very casually no guv honest did mr garrard no in the glass i could see he was shivering a big shivering musclebound man honest he added pathetically he was trying to help me now i turned again and fired the gun hammered at the night and peel cowered and shivered i lowered the gun so that it was pointing into his face did you or mr garrard turn the gas on in my boat peel no guv we didnt as god is my witness we didnt i dont know nothing about any gas weve been in france mr garrard and me we aint been anywhere near your boat not since that night he tipped it over and he wasnt even supposed to do that we werent even supposed to kill you that time guv we was only scaring you he was staring at me with doggish devotion now i was his master and he would please me we was just supposed to scare you and that first time mr garrard was only going to talk to you but he found the girl on your boat and he thought you was doublecrossing us he was staring into the twin black holes of the gun barrels honest guv he paused evidently remembering who i was honest my lord i turned away from him i reloaded the gun with the last cartridge then laid the weapon down the vhf was screwed to the wheelhouse roof and tuned to channel the private marina channel that was the channel on which my instructions had been relayed and presumably the channel on which my enemies were even now listening they had to be close within thirty or forty miles which meant france or the islands i thought france the likeliest answer perhaps it was elizabeth keeping a radio watch wondering what was happening out in the fogshrouded waters and it was time to put my sister out of her apprehensive misery i unhooked the microphone held it a little too far from my mouth and said the single word fingers i paused then repeated the word before hanging up the microphone there was no acknowledgement but id expected none this nights trickery had been designed to keep the radio traffic to a minimum to avoid detection it had all been so very clever and nothing i thought was cleverer than the way elizabeth had used the decca navigation system for only a decca set could have sent two landlubbers safely across the channel i doubted whether garrard could have navigated his way through the shoals tides and rocks of the channel islands but any fool could read the little arrows on the decca which told him to go left or right forwards or backwards cleverest of all i thought was the selection of les trois grunes the only cardinal buoy in the islands which offered a straight course back to the second waypoint a course that went arrow straight between the rocks of the casquets and the northern reefs of guernsey no need to dogleg no need to read a chart all that was required was to follow the little arrows they had been clever so very clever had peter in one of his soberer moments told elizabeth about the decca or about the gas bottle she would find on any deepsea yacht i turned right peel i said enthusiastically on your feet and into the cuddy the what the cabin there i pointed under the foredeck where a tiny space afforded two bunks and a galley dry yourself off and make us some tea or coffee no sugar for me just milk and hurry he hurried he saw his partners blood smeared across the windscreen as he passed me but he didnt react i must have looked fearsome halfnaked and bloody so he just ducked down and scuttled gratefully into the cuddy throw me up a towel i shouted after him and any spare clothes down there i pushed the throttle forward and felt the stern dig down into the water eightyseven miles to go then the last confrontation and all for one picture peel made tea mistspinner thumped happily through the waves i had dried myself wrapped the towel about the cut at my waist then pulled on a thick sweater which peel had brought up from the cuddy he was eager for my approval now good cup of tea he asked me what youre going to do now i ignored his friendliness is clear up the boat you see that boxlike thing on the front yes guv my lord its called a forehatch open it then tip garrard inside tip do it he did it once id heard garrards corpse thump down into the cuddy i gave peel a bucket and mop now clean off the blood he started work i pulled the case of bearer bonds on to the chart table and left it there the engine ran happily i was making ten knots a good enough speed the fog cleared when we were north of the casquets i turned off all the wheelhouse lights so i could see better we were about to cross the traffic separation zones where the big tankers thumped oblivious in and out of the atlantic mistspinner left a clean clear wake on the dark swell peel his job done crouched at the far side of the wheelhouse and stared in awe at the giant ships whats your name i asked him peel your first name you idiot ronny i rewarded him with a smile got any cigarettes ronny dont smoke guv garrard did didnt he he did yes any in his pockets do you think he stared in horror at me you want me to then he realised that was precisely what i wanted him to do so he opened the cuddy door took a breath and climbed down i could hear his noises of disgust but after a few minutes he reappeared with a halfempty packet and a lighter thank you ronny he was pathetically grateful for a kind word i lit a cigarette and dragged the smoke into my lungs am i in trouble peel asked after a while a lot i throttled back to let a bulk carrier slide a halfmile ahead of me the beam from the channel light vessel was reflected from the long waves to starboard i only did what mr garrard told me to do peel pleaded and what else did mr garrard tell you ronny did he tell you about my sister he nodded she was going to get the painting when you was dead see and then she was going to sell it and she was going to give mr garrard his share of the money because he bought it you see i dont see no right back at the beginning when he met your sister at the races she asked him to help her find it and she gave him money for the expenses like and he did find it and he bought a third share off the bloke because the bloke was short of readies and couldnt find a proper buyer its too hot you see mr garrard said you couldnt sell really famous paintings only the rubbish i was staring ahead at the empty sea peel was worried by my silence but for a long time i just steered the compass course and ignored him a third share i asked him at last thats right one for mr garrard one for your sister though of course she didnt have to pay anything cos she was going to sell it like and the other third shut up ronny but i said shut up because i think id known ever since id keyed mistspinners decca only i didnt believe it dear god i thought but let me be wrong i unhooked the microphone i knew my enemies would be listening to channel and they would probably be monitoring channel as well but unless they had two radios each with a dualwatch capability they could only monitor the two vhf channels so i switched to the coastguards working channel i broke all the rules i didnt identify myself i just broadcast a cryptic message to the whole english channel this is a message for inspector abbott i said of the devon and cornwall police fifty twelve forty north zero three fortysix sixty west i say again for harry abbott devon and cornwall police fifty twelve forty north zero three fortysix sixty west the coastguards were on to me like a ton of bricks who was transmitting why would i identify myself i told them to get off the air and pass on the message and to do it fast but listen for further transmissions on this channel i added before switching the radio off the first light was gilding the wavetops fancy another cup of tea ronny not really guv he didnt want to go below with the corpse i do i really wanted to be alone for a few minutes so get it an hour later i saw the english coast i switched off the decca because i didnt need it any longer i hadnt really needed it at all not once id known the final rendezvous because these were my home waters and here in the dawn was my last waypoint we came home in a lovely sunrise it was all so ordinary all so very ordinary the waypoint was outside the harbour but even a helmsman as inexperienced as garrard would have been able to negotiate the entrance just keep well to the lefthand side of the channel steer due north and dont try it in southern gales there was a slight swell on the bar then mistspinner moved smoothly into the outer channel we turned northeast and i let her idle through the moored yachts it promised to be a warm day some yachts had already left the moorings while others were shaking out their sails there had been a mist earlier but it was gone all but from the deepest creeks where the trees grew so close above the water gulls screamed and wheeled while far to the north a helicopter chopped the air i had found some rusting binoculars in a cavelocker and i used them to search the anchorages i knew what i was looking for but somehow hoped not to see it then i did a man and a woman standing together on the flying bridge of a big motor cruiser they were waving behind them far off beyond the fields i could see charlies house the kids would be going off to nursery school and yvonne would be wondering where charlie was the man and woman waved again they looked so happy together like lovers at dreams fulfilment their boat gleamed white in the rising sun the same sun that was reflecting off mistspinners windscreen so the couple could not see me behind the goldglossed glass they only saw their fortune coming their damned great fortune brought from the channel islands to salcombe by the magic of a decca set thats them peel said helpfully but i didnt respond there was nothing to say i waited till we were fifty yards from the waiting boat then turned on the vhf and unhooked the microphone harry abbott he answered immediately is that you johnny im off frogmore creek harry my boats called mistspinner and the bastards you want are on a ginpalace called barratry come and get them i killed mistspinners engine and i ran her gently down the side of my best friends boat charlie waited on barratrys afterdeck boathook in hand he hooked our pulpit rail well done he called i told you it would be easy then his voice faded away as i stepped out from under the wheelhouse roof i carried the shotgun and the attaché case hello charlie i said elizabeth screamed she was still on barratrys flying bridge i looked up at her then with the shotgun in my right hand and the money in my left i stepped over on to barratrys stern johnny charlie was staring in shock but still trying to smile as if this was a fortuitous meeting of friends shut up charlie i said then with a foul anger for christs sake shut up i looked up at elizabeth come down she climbed slowly down the chrome ladder she was dressed in a silk bathrobe as though she had only just got up from the big bed in barratrys stateroom i wondered how long they had been lovers you bastards i said mistspinner and peel drifted slowly away charlie and elizabeth looked at the blood on my legs and at the gun in my hand and said nothing why i asked charlie he didnt answer but i suddenly saw how it must seem to him to be the lover of lordys daughter that was the ultimate revenge the sweetest revenge of all when the despised labourers son makes the earls daughter moan in his bed and it was you i said to charlie who nicked the bloody picture he hesitated then smiled it was just a joke johnny he waited but for what i couldnt tell for me to smile to laugh it was only a joke he protested i did it for you for me charlie i did it for you i thought that if your mother sold the painting then youd never go back to sea youd become like your father youd have hated that johnny because you never belonged in the big house you belonged at sea johnny at sea he paused again but i said nothing and charlie made an expansive gesture as if to suggest that with a little humour and understanding the whole mess could be resolved it was only a joke he said again but weakly and i wasnt laughing i looked at elizabeth its hard to see your own sister as beautiful but she looked beautiful that morning beautiful and hurt i think she was ashamed not about the painting but because i had found her with charlie that was a game she had played in secret and now i had discovered her you knew i accused her you knew i didnt steal it you must have known that as soon as garrard found charlie she shrugged as if to suggest that my innocence was irrelevant so why didnt you go to the police when garrard found charlie i asked her because the money would still have been yours when mother died and she didnt want you to have it she hated you you destroyed our family and i was going to save it elizabeth spat the words at me and i saw that she like my mother hated me and i saw too how much elizabeth must have enjoyed betraying my closest friendship she would win it all and leave me nothing not even a friend i looked back to charlie it seemed so obvious now and it must have seemed obvious to garrard who seeking the painting and still believing in my guilt had gone straight to my oldest friend why didnt you just ransom the painting i asked charlie was it really worth a death it wasnt like that johnny charlie spoke energetically he was still hoping that charm and friendship could ease him off this hook no one was supposed to die garrard died i said brutally i blew his head away whats left of him is in that boat i jerked my head towards the drifting mistspinner but i had been looking at elizabeth as i spoke and i saw that her face had shown no reaction to my news dont you care i asked her you were bedding him just as youre bedding charlie did you know that charlie that she was screwing garrard as well he didnt reply but all the charm and energy went from his face as if hed been struck he hadnt known and he was hurt he thought he had been using elizabeth and now at last he sensed that she had been using him elizabeths face still did not show any emotion my god i thought but how she had used her men shed used garrard to kill and charlie to set up the clever rendezvous with the decca sets and charlie clever charlie had coolly gone to guernsey and sent me off to my death then spun me through the electronic maze before flying home for this rendezvous clever charlie i raised the muzzles of the gun charlie shook his head desperately i tried to warn you johnny how many times did i warn you how many times did i tell you to bugger off charlie saw no softening in my face for gods sake i even tried to stop you yesterday i didnt want you to die that was her and garrard i just wanted to scare you back to sea out of the way good god johnny i even repaired your boat i only wanted the ransom it was garrard who said we should kill you to get the price as well it was all garrards idea not mine it was a version of the truth spoken passionately to carry conviction and perhaps at the beginning he alone of the three had not wanted my death and i thought how scared elizabeth and garrard must have been when i returned when they found jennifer on sunflower and how they must have believed that charlie was betraying them and how charlie must have argued for my life agreeing only that i should be scared away from england and perhaps i thought he had only wanted the ransom reckoning that i would share my good fortune with him if the painting was recovered and i sold it but then i had given the painting away and charlies friendship for me had been corroded by the acid of lust and greed and so he had gone aboard sunflower and filled her bilges with gas i looked into his eyes trying to understand tell me about the gas charlie he found nothing to say what was there to say that he regretted it i was sure he did but he regretted the loss of all the money more i looked past charlie far beyond barratrys bows and saw two launches heading towards us i looked back to my best friend still trying to understand how he could try to kill me one day and smother me with his generosity the next id slept in his house but of course i had been safe there for he would never have wanted my death to seem like murder but rather to have looked like an accident that way he would have been safe my god charlie i said sadly but you are a bastard i remembered jennifer and aimed the barrels at his eyes but i couldnt kill him hed saved my life once singing his way through a shipkilling storm in the tasman sea i stared at him over the guns crude sights so wheres the painting charlie he didnt answer till i twitched the gun then he shrugged in the cellar johnny wrapped up and safe and its mine elizabeth almost screamed at me mother left it to me its mine damn you i said damn you both then the first launch bumped alongside and big efficient men climbed aboard barratry i dropped gun and money on the deck then turned away to face the rising sun friendship was anything worth the betrayal of friendship except lovers take precedence over friendship and charlie had found his lady and he would kill his friend to make her rich and himself rich with her i closed my eyes not because i was staring at the sun but because i had come home and was crying epilogue lazy water lapped at sunflowers hull the sun was brilliant remorseless high but the white awning which was stretched from sunflowers mizzen to her mainmast sheltered me the ketch was properly called sunflower ii but id left off the roman numerals when id painted her name on the stern i had wanted to call the boat jennifer but jennifer pallavicini wouldnt let me she had dictated a letter from her hospital in switzerland saying she didnt want the boat named after her i hadnt understood her reasoning but she had been adamant and so i had called the boat sunflower ii instead the new sunflower was a good yacht steelhulled eight feet longer than the original sunflower and with two gas alarms in her bilges she had been launched five months ago and now she was berthed in the leeward islands it was midday hot as hell but i was shadowed by the awning and had a cold beer id taken from the galley fridge id never had a fridge on a boat before but nor had i ever been given a millionaires cheque book to build a boat before and given that cheque book id made a good sea boat shed rolled incessantly on the long crossing from madeira to the west indies but every boat rolls in the trade route shed proved fast despite her long keel and heavy hull none of her gear had gone disastrously wrong nothing but the usual small crop of problems a chafing halliard a lifting sail seam a leaking deck fitting nothing i couldnt mend with my own two hands and nothing that would stop this long lovely boat from going around the world she was in truth a proper job the odious ulf would probably find something wrong with her but the odious ulf wasnt here there was just me sunflower ii and at the landward end of the rickety wharf that jutted out into this impossibly blue water a girl id watched the girl step down from the island bus once the bus had growled away she had looked towards sunflower but then hesitated she had been carrying four string shopping bags and perhaps they had been too heavy for her because she had left two of the bags under a palm tree adjusted the handles of the others then walked slowly down the wharf towards my berth good legs i thought appreciatively very good legs i could tell for she was wearing shorts a lovely body really i thought how wonderful that body would look in a bikini the girl had short black hair and a suntanned skin and as she came closer a very nice smile you might have helped me you bastard she said in greeting i nonchalantly waved the beer can i was watching you and thinking what a very satisfactory crewperson you are and one day youll make a satisfactory galley slave she tossed the string bags into my lap they actually had american lettuce at that nice little shop it was horribly expensive but i couldnt resist it so that means we can have a proper salad at last and i bought a very weird vegetable i havent a clue what it is but that lovely lady who laughs every time she sees you says that you cut it in half scoop out the pulp and eat it raw oh and you peel it as well jennifer countess of stowey stepped down into the cockpit and gratefully collapsed into the shade under the awning i left the two heavy bags at the end of the wharf she added and you can go and fetch them did you buy my tobacco of course i bought your tobacco you horrible man oh and there was a letter at the general delivery mummy and daddy are going to antigua and would love to see us theyve taken a house there and we can have a proper bath she closed her eyes in pretended ecstasy a proper bath unfortunately i said the winds are entirely wrong for going to antigua the winds jennifer said firmly could not be better and mummys bringing georgina sister felicity had died but somehow helen lady buzzacott had gained georginas confidence georgina was hugely improved she had her own horse at lovelace house and that therapy together with helens friendship had given her great happiness the cause of my own immediate happiness took the beer can from my hand and drank what was left of it now go and get the groceries she ordered me yes maam jenny still has some scars but except for those on her hands you have to know her very well to find them and i dont have any intention of anyone but me knowing my wife that well sir leon would like her to go back to switzerland for more cosmetic surgery on her hands but ive said no not till our years cruise is over and sir leon is learning that an earl outranks a mere knight not that he minds because he has his picture the stowey sunflowers hang in his gallery and one day ill go and see them again but not yet i have a wife and a boat and a great happiness though sometimes when i look up to find a star among the million points of light i remember a friend and his laughter and i wonder just how it all went so wrong but things go right too its called love and even if it does mean eating salad sometimes it works and sunflowers a proper boat and jennifers happy again and the oceans are huge and love seems to touch even the mundane with gladness in short its a proper job
