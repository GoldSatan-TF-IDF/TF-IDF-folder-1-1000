her eyes were so sore and swollen from weeping that she thought by right she should have no tears left at all she was so tired that she couldnt keep her mind focused on anything it flitted from one thought to another no matter how she tried to concentrate one kept recurring in a neverending refrain of lament what am i doing here i should be at oxford eleanor robinson rested her aching head against the cold wet glass of the tiny window in the twilight gloom of her attic bedroom with an effort she closed her sore tired eyes as her shoulders hunched inside an old woolen shawl the bleak december weather had turned rotten and rainy utterly unchristmaslike not that she cared about christmas it was worse in flanders or so the boys home on leave said though the papers pretended otherwise she knew better the boys on leave told the truth when the papers lied but surely papa wouldnt be there up to his knees in the freezing water of the trenches of the western front he wasnt a young man surely they wouldnt put him there beastly weather beastly war beastly germans surely papa was somewhere warm in the rear surely they were using his clever organized mind at some clerking job for some big officer she was the one who should be pitied the worst that would happen to papa was that he wouldnt get leave for christmas she wasnt likely to see anything of christmas at all and she should be at oxford right this minute papa had promised promised faithfully that she should go to oxford this year and his betrayal of that promise ate like bitter acid into her heart and soul shed done everything that had been asked of her she had passed every examination even the latin even the greek and no one else had ever wanted to learn greek in the entire village of broom except for little jimmy grimsley the boys schoolmaster michael stone had had to tutor her especially she had passed her interview with the principal of somerville college shed been accepted all that had been needed was to pay the fees and go well go meant making all sorts of arrangements but the important part had been done why hadnt he made the arrangements before hed volunteered why hadnt he done so after hadnt she had known from the time she could read almost that she all she really wanted was to go to oxford to study literature hadnt she told papa that over and over until he finally agreed never mind that they didnt award degrees to women now it was the going there that was the important partthere where you would spend all day learning amazing things and half the night talking about them and it wasnt as if this was a new thing there was more than one womens college now and someday they would give degrees and on that day eleanor meant to be right there to receive hers it wasnt as if she would be going for nothing and it wouldnt be here not this closedin place where nothing mattered except that you somehow managed to marry a man of a higher station than yours or indeed past a certain age married any man at all oxford well itsits another world maybe a better one reggie fenyxs eyes had shone when hed said that shed seen the reflection of that world in his eyes and she wanted it she wanted it even this beastly weather wouldnt be so bad if she was looking at it from inside her study in somerville or perhaps going to listen to a distinguished speaker at the debating society as reggie fenyx had described but her tired mind drifted away from the imagined delights of rooms at somerville college or the stimulation of an erudite speaker and obstinately towards reggie fenyx not that she should call him reggie or at least not outside the walls of oxford where learning made all men and women equals not that she had ever called him reggie except in her own mind but there in her mind and her memory he was reggie heroworshipped by all the boys in broom and probably half the grown men as well whenever the drone of his aeroplane drew eyes involuntarily upward and off her mind flitted to halcyon skies of june above a green green field she could still hear his drawling cheerful voice above the howl and clatter of his aeroplane engine out there in the fallow field hed claimed for his own where he stabled his bird in an old haybarn and used to land and take off hed looked down at her from his superior height with a smile but it wasnt a patronizing smile shed seen the aeroplane land known that in this weather he was only going to refuel before taking off again and pelted off to longacre like a tomboy she found him pouring a can of petrol into the plane and breathlessly asked him about oxford he was the only person she knew who was a student there or ever had been a student therewell hardly a surprise that he was a student there since he was the son of sir devlin fenyx and the field the aeroplane and everything as far as she could see where she stood belonged to lord devlin and longacre park where else but oxford was good enough for reggie fenyx perhaps cambridge butno not for someone from warwickshire and shakespeare country i want to go to university she had told him when hed asked her why she wanted to know as she stood looking up at him breathless at her own daring i want to go to oxford oxford well i dont know why not hed said the first person to sound encouraging about her dream since her governess first put the notion in her head and nearly the only one since other than the head of somerville college thered been no teasing about lady dons or girlgraduates no i dont know why not one of these days theyll be giving out womens degrees you mark my words ought to be ashamed that they arent if you ask me the girls i know he pronounced it gels which she found fascinating work harder than most of my mates i say if your parents think its all bunk for a gel to go to university you tell em i said its a deuced good plan and in ten years a geld be ashamed not to have gone if shes got the chance here hed said then shoving a rope at her dye think you can take this ropeend run over to there and haul the chocks away when i shout he hadnt waited for an answer hed simply assumed she would treating her just as he would have treated any of the heroworshipping boys whod come to see him fly and she hadnt acted like a silly girl either shed run a little to a safe distance waited for his signal after he swung himself up into the seat of his frail ship of canvas and sticks and hauled on the rope with all her might pulling the blocks of wood that kept the plane from rolling forward out from under the wheels and the contraption had roared into life and bounced along the field making one final leap into the air and climbing until he was out of sight among the white puffy clouds and from that moment on shed heroworshipped him as much as any boy that wasnt the only time shed helped him before alison had come she had been more out of the house than in it when she wasnt reading and studying and she went where she wanted and did pretty much as she liked if her mother had been alive shed likely have earned a scolding for such hoydenish behavior but her mother had died too long ago for her to remember clearly her father scarcely seemed to notice what she did and she had only herself to please reggie had been amused hed ruffled her hair called her a jolly little thing and treated her like the boys who came to help in fact once after that breathless query about oxford he had given her papers about somerville college and magazines and articles about the lady dons and lecturers and even a clipping about women who were flying aeroplanesaviatrixes he called themwith the unspoken but clearly understood implication that if anyone gave her trouble about wanting to go to oxford she should show them the clipping as well as give them his endorsement of the plan to show that nice girls did all sorts of things these days women are doing great things great things hed said with enthusiasm why women are doctorsi know one a grand gel married to a friend of mine works in london women should go exercising their brains makes em interesting these gels that mater keeps dragging round hed made a face and hadnt finished the sentence but eleanor could guess at it not that she had any broad acquaintance with ladies of society but she could read about them and the london newspapers were full of stories about society and the women who ornamented it to her way of thinking they didnt seem like the sorts that would be terribly interesting to someone like reggie no doubt they could keep up a sparkling conversation on nothing whatsoever and select a cigar and hold a dinner party without offending anyone and organize a country weekend to great acclaim but as for being interesting to someone like reggienot likely even she an insignificant village tomboy was more interesting to him than they were ever likely to be not that she was all that interesting to someone like reggie for all that she looked up to him and evenyes she admitted itwas a bit in love with him he was as outofreach as oxford was now in fact everything was out of reach now and the remembered sun and warmth faded from her thoughts replaced by the chill gloom of the drafty attic room and the emptiness of her life nothing much mattered now the war had swallowed up reggie as it had swallowed up her father as it had smothered her hopes the bright and confident declarations of home by christmas had died in the rout at mons and were buried in the trenches at ypres as buried as her dreams she had thought she was through with weeping but sobs rose in her throat again papa papa she cried silently as her eyes burned anew papa why did you leave me why did you leave me with her for it wasnt the war that was keeping her from oxford anyway oh noher current misery was due to another cause surely papa would have remembered his promise if it hadnt been for the manipulations of alison robinson eleanors stepmother two more tears oozed out from under her closed lids to etch their way down her sore cheeks she wouldnt be able to treat me like this if papa hadnt gone would she horrible horrible woman shed stolen papa from her then stole her very life from her and no one else could or would see it even people that should know better who could see how alison treated her stepdaughter seemed to think there was nothing amiss ill hear one more time how lucky i am that papa married her and left her to care for me while hes gone i think i shall be sick the day she first appeared had been had eleanor only known it the blackest day of eleanors life she pounded an impotent fist against her thigh as she stifled her sobs lest she should hear papa had gone on business it had seemed just like any other of dozens of such absences eleanor was accustomed to father being absent to tend to his business from time to time most fathers in broom didnt do that but charles robinson was different for he was in trade and his business interests all lay outside broom even outside of warwickshire he was a man of business he often told her when she was old enough to understand and business didnt tend to itself although her father never flaunted the fact she had always known that they lived well shed had a governess when most children in the village just went to the local school miss severn had been a good governess one in fact who had put the idea of oxford into her head in the first place and good highly educated governesses were she knew now quite difficult to find and expensive besides that they had maids and a cookwell there were others in broom who had help but not many had maids that lived in or a cook at all and they lived in one of the nicest houses in broom the arrows a tudor building was supposed to have been there at the time shakespeare passed through the village after a poaching expedition got drunk and fell asleep under the oak tree in front of the tavern but her papa hadnt made much of their prosperity so neither had she he socialized with the village not the gentry and other than visits to longacre to see reggie fly so had she they werent members of the hunt they werent invited to dinners or balls or even to tea as the vicar was the governess the special tutoring laterthis was to her not much different from the piano lessons the butchers and bakers daughters got in fact she hadnt really known how prosperous they were papas business was hardly glamoroushe made sacks or rather his factories made sacks all sorts of sacks from grainbags to the rough sailcloth duffels that sailors hauled their personal gear in well someone had to make them she supposed and from time to time papa would visit one or another of his factories making sure that everything was operating properly and look over the books his trips always happened the same way hed tell her and cook when he was going and when he would be back and theyd plan on simple meals till he returned he would drive their automobile chugging and rattling to catch the train and at the appointed time drive home again but last june something different had happened hed gone offthen sent a telegram that something had happened not to worry and he would be back a week later than he had planned and hed be bringing a grand surprise she more fool hadnt thought any more of itexcept perhaps that he was buying a new automobile that was what he had done when hed gotten the first one after all come back a week later driving it all bundled up in goggles and hat and drivingcoat and full of the adventure of bringing it all the way from london and he came back as she had half expected not in the old rattlebang auto but in a sleek longbonneted thing that purred up the street the problem was he hadnt been alone she had been with him and right behind them in their own car they had come she had come arrayed in an enormous scarlet hat with yards and yards of scarlet scarves and veils and a startling scarlet coat of dramatic cut father had handed her out as if she was a queen and as she raised a scarletgloved hand to remove her goggles he had said beaming with pride and heres my surprise this is your new mother he hadnt said stepmother but eleanor would never ever call that horrible woman mother alison this is my daughter and look eleanor here are two new sisters to keep you company lauralee carolyn this is your sister eleanor im sure youre going to be the best of friends in no time two elegant languid creatures descended from the rear of the second automobile wearing pastel blue and lavender versions of her getup and removed their goggles to regard her with stares as blank and unreadable as the goggles had been broom had never seen anything quite like them they looked as if they had come directly from the pages of some london quarterly only she smiled a knowing little smile a condescending smile that immediately made eleanor aware of her untidy hair that was loosely tied with a ribbon like a childs her very plain linen daydress not in vogue and not new of her uncorseted figure and her thick clumsy walking shoes the two girls raised their heads just a trifle and gave her little patronizing smirks of their own then all three had sailed into the house without so much as a word spoken and with a shock eleanor had found herself sharing the house and her papa with a stepmother and two stepsisters exceptfrom the moment they entered the door there wasnt a great deal of sharing going on the first sign of trouble came immediately when the girls inspected the house and the elder lauralee claimed the secondbest bedroomeleanors roomas her own and before eleanor could protest she found herself and her things bundled up the stairs to an untenanted attic room that had been used until that moment as a lumber room with the excuse well youll be at oxford in the autumn and you wont need such a big room now will you followed by a whispered dont be ungracious eleanorjealousy is a very ugly thing and a frown on her papas face that shocked her into silence the thing that still baffled her was the speed with which it had all happened thered been not a hint of any such thing as a romance much less a marriage ever papa had always said that after mama no woman could ever claim his hearthed gone a dozen times to stokeontrent before and hed never said a word about anything but the factory and she thought that surely she would have noticed something about a woman before this especially a woman like this one oh she was beautiful no question about that lean and elegant as a greyhound sleek dark hair a redlipped face to rival anything eleanor had seen in the newspapers and magazines and the grace of a cat the daughters lauralee and carolyn were like her in every regard lacking only the depth of experience in alisons eyes and her ability to keep their facade of graciousness intact in private eleanor only noticed that later at first they were all bright smiles and simpers alison and her daughters turned the house upside down within a week they wore gownsno simple dresses for themlike nothing anyone in broom had seen except in glimpses of the country weekends held up at longacre they changed two and three times a day for no other occasion than a meal or a walk they made incessant demands on the maids that those poor countrybred girls didnt understand and had them in tears at least once a day they made equally incredible demands on cook who threw up her hands and gave notice after being ordered to produce a dinner full of things she couldnt even pronounce much less make a new cook one mrs bennet and maids including a ladys maid just for alison called howse came from london at length brought in a charabanc with all their boxes and trunks money poured out of the house and returned in the form of teagowns from london and enormous hats with elegantly scrolled names on the boxes delicate shoes from italy and gloves from france and amid all of this upheaval and confusion papa beamed and beamed on his elegant fillies and seemed to have forgotten eleanor even existed there were no teagowns from london for eleanor not that she made any great show against them she looked like a maid herself in her plain dresses and sensible walking shoes they didnt have to bully her not then when they could simply overawe her and bewilder her and drown her out with their incessant chattering and tinkling laughter and when she tried to get papa alone to voice a timid protest he would just pat her cheek ask if she wasnt being a jealous little wench and advise her that she would get on better if she was more like them she might have been able to rally herself after the first shock might have been able to fight back except that all those faroff things in the newspapers about assassinations and balkan uprisings that could never possibly have anything to do with the british empire and england and broomsuddenly did in august the world suddenly went mad in some incomprehensible way austria declared war on serbia and prussia joined in and so did germany which apparently declared war on everybody there were austrian and prussian and german troops overrunning france and england was at war too rushing to send men to stop the flood and though among the countryfolk in broom there was a certain level of skepticism about all this foreign nonsense according to the papers there was a sudden patriotic rush of volunteers signing up to go to france to fight and papa who was certainly old enough to know better and never mind that he already had been in the army as a young man volunteered to go with his regiment and the next thing she knew he was a sergeant again and was gone somehow oxford never materialized your dear father didnt make any arrangements child stepmother said sounding surprised her eyes glittering but never mind this will all be over by christmas and surely you would rather be here to greet him when he comes home wouldnt you you can go to oxford in the hilary term but it wasnt over by christmas and somehow papa didnt manage to make arrangements for the hilary term either and now here she was feeling and being treated as a stranger an interloper in her own house subtly bullied by glamour and not understanding how it had happened sent around on errands like a servant scarcely an hour she could call her own and at the end of the day retreating to this cold cheerless closet that scarcely had room for her bed and her wardrobe and desk and papa never wrote and every day the papers were full of horrible things covered over with patriotic bombast and everything was wrong with the world and she couldnt see an end to it two more tears burned their way down her cheeks her head pounded she felt ill and feverish she was exhausted but somehow too tired to sleep today had been the day of the red cross bazaar and tea dance organized by stepmother of courseyou have such a genius for such things alisonat the behest of the colonels wife though what that meant was that eleanor and the maids got the dubious privilege of doing all of the actual work while stepmother and her girls stood about in their pretty teagowns and accepted congratulations eleanor had been on her feet from dawn until well past teatime serving cup after cup of tea tending any booth whose owner decided she required a rest watching with raw envy as her stepsisters and other girls her age flirted with the handsome young officers as they danced to the band stepmother had hired for the occasion dances she didnt know dances to jaunty melodies that caused raised but indulgent eyebrows among the village ladies ragtimethats what they called it and perhaps it was more than a little fast but this was wartime and beneath the frenetic music was an unspoken undercurrent that some of these handsome young men wouldnt be coming back so let them have their fun eleanor had cherished some small hope that at last someone who knew her would see what alison was doing and the tide of public opinion would rise up to save her alison after all was the interloper here and with her ostentatious ways and extravagance she had surely been providing more than a little fodder for the village cats but just when she was handing the vicars wife theresa hinshaw a cup of tea the woman abruptly shook her head a little and finally looked at her and frowned and started to say something in a concerned tone of voice out of the corner of her eye she saw alison raise her head like a ferret sniffing a mouse on the wind and suddenly there she was at the womans elbow mrs hinshaw how are you she purred and steered eleanors hope away into a little knot of other women i was wondering why we havent seen eleanor about the vicars wife began yes she used to run wild all about the village didnt she poor thing replied alison in a sweetly reasonable tone of voice a firm hand was certainly wanted there to be sure youd never guess to look at them both that shes the same age as my carolyn would you eleanor saw mrs hinshaw make a startled glance from the elegant carolyn revolving in the arms of a young subaltern to eleanor in her plain frock and apron and ribbontied hair and with a sinking heart saw herself come off second best no indeed murmured mrs sutherland the doctors wife alison sighed heavily one does ones poor best at establishing discipline but no child is going to care for a tight rein when shes been accustomed to no curb at all keep her busy seems to be the best answer and of course with dear charles gone the vicars wife cast a look with more sympathy in it at eleanor but her attention was swiftly recaptured by lauralee who simpered and poor mama not even a proper honeymoon which remark utterly turned the tide in alisons favor from there it was all downhill with little hints about eleanors supposed jealousy and sullenness and refusal to act her ageall uttered in a tone of weary bravery with soft sighs by the time alison was finished there wasnt a woman there who would have read her exhaustion and despair as anything other than sulks and pouting the music jangled in her ears and made her head ache and by the time the car came for alison and her daughters dear little eleanor so practical to wear things that wont be hurt by a little wet and eleanor was finished with the cleaning up and could trudge home again she felt utterly beaten down her aching legs and feet were an agony by the time she reached an unwelcoming home and unfriendly servants alison and the girls held high celebration in the parlor their shrill laughter ringing through the house as they made fun of the very people they had just been socializing with she got plain breadandbutter and cooling tea for supper in the kitchennot even a single bite of the dainty sandwiches that she had served the ladies had she eaten and of the glorious high tea that the cook had prepared for alison and her daughters there was not a scrap to be seen and by the time she went up all those stairs to her freezingcold room shed had no strength for anything except hopeless weeping what does she want from me the question echoed dully in eleanors mind and there seemed no logical answer she had no doubt that alison had married papa for the moneyfor her all her airs at the tea there was nothing in the way that alison behaved in private that made eleanor think that her stepmother found papas absence anything other than a relief but why did she seem to take such pleasure in tormenting eleanor there didnt seem to be an answer unless she was hoping that eleanor would be driven to run away from home oh i would but how far would i get if that was what alison was hoping the very nature of this areaand ironically the very picture that alison had painted of her stepdaughter todaywould conspire to thwart her eleanor wouldnt get more than a mile before someone would recognize her and after that carefully constructed fiction of a sullen and rebellious child that alison had created that same someone would assume she was running away and make sure she was caught and brought back and if alison had wanted to be rid of her by sending her away surely she would have done so by now shell never let me go she thought bitterly not when she can make up lies about me to get more sympathy and who believes in wicked stepmothers anyway she must have dozed off a little because the faint faroff sound of the door knocker made her start at the sound of voices below she glanced out the window to see the automobile belonging to alisons solicitor warrick locke standing at the gate gleaming wetly in the lamplight he looked like something out of a dickens novel all wirerimmed glasses sleek black suits and sleek black hair and tooknowing face oh him again he seemed to call at least once a week since papa had gone not that she cared why he came it was odd for him to come so late but not unheardof someone uttered an exclamation of anger it sounded like alison eleanor leaned her forehead against the cold glass again she felt feverish now and the glass felt good against her aching head and anyway the windowseat was more comfortable than the lumpy mattress of her bed her door was thrust open and banged into the foot of the bed she jerked herself up and stared at the door lauralee stood in the doorway with the light behind her mother wants you eleanor she said in an expressionless voice now eleanor cringed trying to think of what she could have done wrong i was just going to bed she began now lauralee repeated this time with force and then she did something she had never done before she took two steps into the room seized eleanors wrist and dragged her to her feet then without another word she continued to pull eleanor out the door down the hall and down the narrow servants stair the stair came out in the kitchen which at this hour was empty of servantsbut not of people alison was there and carolyn and warrick locke the only light in the kitchen was from the fire on the hearth and in it the solicitor looked positively satanic his dark eyes glittered cold and hard behind the lenses of his spectacles his dark hair was slicked back showing the pointed widows peak in the center of his forehead and his long thin face with its high cheekbones betrayed no more emotion than lauralees or carolyns he regarded eleanor as he might have looked at a black beetle he was about to step on but alison gave her a look full of such hatred that eleanor quailed before it i she faltered alison thrust a piece of yellow paper at her she took it dumbly she read the words but they didnt seem to make any sense regret to inform you sergeant charles robinson perished of wounds received in combat papa what was this about papa but he was safe in headquarters tending paperwork she shook her head violently half in denial half in bewilderment papa she began but alison had already turned her attention away towards her solicitor i still say but locke shook his head shes protected he said you cant make her deathly illyouve tried today havent you and as i warned you shes got nothing worse than a bit of a headache that proves that you cant touch her directly with magic and if she had anaccident so soon there would be talk it isnt the sort of thing that could be covered up but i can bind her when i am finished she will never be able to leave the house and grounds alison snarled her beautiful face contorted with rage and before eleanor could make any sense of the words you cant touch her directly with magic her stepmother had crossed the room and grabbed her by one wrist hold her she barked and in an instant the solicitor was beside her pinioning eleanors arms eleanor screamed that is she opened her mouth to scream but quick as a ferret and with an expression of great glee on her face carolyn darted across the room to stuff a rag in eleanors open mouth and bind it in place with another terror flooded through her and she struggled against lockes grip as he pulled her over to the hearth then kicked her feet out from underneath her so that she fell to the floor beside the fire beside a gap where one of the hearthstones had been rooted up and laid to one side locke shoved her flat facedown on the flagstone floor and held her there with one hand between her shoulder blades the other holding her right arm while alison made a grab for the left and caught it by the wrist eleanors head was twisted to the left so it was alison she sawalison with a butchers cleaver and a terrible expression on her face alison who held her left hand flat on the floor and raised the cleaver over her head eleanor began screaming again through the gag she was literally petrified with fear and the blade came down severing the smallest finger of her left hand completely for a moment she felt nothingthen the pain struck it was like nothing she had ever felt before she thrashed in agony but locke was kneeling on her other arm with all his weight on her back and she couldnt move blood was everywhere black in the firelight and through a red haze of pain she wondered if alison was going to let her bleed to death alison seized the severed finger and stood up lauralee took her place holding a redhot poker in hands incongruously swallowed up in ovenmitts and a moment later she shoved that poker against the wound and the pain that eleanor had felt up until that moment was as nothing and mercifully she fainted she woke again in the empty kitchen her hand a throbbing sun of pain like a dumb animal she followed her instincts which forced her to crawl to the kitchen door open it on the darkness outside on rain that had turned to snow and plunge her hand into the barrel of rainwater that stood there a thin skin of ice forming atop it she gasped at the cold then wept for the pain and kept weeping as the icycold water cooled the hurt and numbed it how long she stood there she could not have said only that at some point her hand was numb enough to take out of the water that she found the strength to look for the medicine chest in the pantry and bandage it then she found the laudanum and drank down a recklessly large dose and finally took the bottle of laudanum with her stumbling back up the stairs to her room in the eerily silent house there she stayed wracked with pain and fever tormented by nightmare and unable to muster a single coherent thought except for one which had more force for grief than all her own pain papa was dead and she was alone march broom warwickshire the scrubbrush rasped back and forth against the cold flagstones eleanors knees ached from kneeling on the hard flagstones her shoulders ached too and the muscles of her neck and lower back you would think that after three years of nothing but working like a charwoman i would have gotten used to it the kitchen door and window stood open to the breeze airing the empty kitchen out outside it was a rare warm march day and the air full of tantalizing hints of spring tomorrow it might turn nasty again but today had been lovely not that eleanor could get any further than the kitchen garden but if she could leave her scrubbing at least she could go outside in the sun but alison had ordered her to scrub and scrub she must until alison came to give her a different order or rang the servants bell and if alison forgot as on occasion she did then eleanor would be scrubbing until she fainted from exhaustion and when she woke she would scrub again the nightmare that her life was now had begun on the eighteenth of december three years two months and a handful of days ago when alison robinson hacked off the little finger of her left hand and buried it with spells and incantations beneath the third hearthstone from the left here in the kitchen thus alison robinson nee danbridge had bound eleanor into what amounted to slavery with her black magic magic who would believe in such a thing eleanor had wondered how alison could have bewitched her fatherand it had turned out that bewitched was the right word for what had happened that night and the nights and days that followed had given her the answer which only posed more questions and if she told anyonenot that she ever saw anyone to tell themtheyd think her mad for it was madness to believe in magic in these days of zepps and gasworks and machine guns nevertheless alison was a witch or something like one and warrick locke was a manwitch and lauralee and carolyn were little witchs apprentices although they werent very good at anything except what alison called sex magic and eleanor would have called vamping alisons secret was safe enough and eleanor was bound to the kitchen hearth of her own home and the orders of her stepmother by the severed finger of her left hand buried under a piece of flagstone she dipped the brush in the soapy water and moved over to the next stone early fruitless trials had proved that she could not go past the walls of the kitchen garden nor the step of the front door she could get that far and no farther for her feet would stick to the ground as if nailed there and her voice turn mute in her throat so that she could not call for help and when alison gave her an order reinforced by a little twiddle of fingers and a burst of sickly yellow light she might as well be an automaton because her body followed that order until alison came to set her free when her hand had healed but while she was still a bit lightheaded and weak alison had made her one and only appearance in eleanors room before eleanor had been able to say anything she had made that gesture and eleanor had found herself frozen and mute alison smirking with pleasure explained the new situation to her her stepdaughter had not been in the least inclined to take that explanation at face value eleanor sighed and brushed limp strands of hair out of her eyes sitting back on her heels to rest for a moment under the circumstances you would have thought that the moment would have been branded into her memory but all she could really remember was her rage and fear warring with each other and alison lording it over her and then a word and her body no longer her own marching down to the kitchen to become mrs bennetts scullery maid and tweenie perhaps the eeriest and most frightening part of that was that mrs bennett and all the help acted from that moment on as if that was the way things had always been they seemed to have forgotten her last name forgotten who she really was she became ellie to them lowest in the household hierarchy the one to whom all the most disagreeable jobs were given the next days and weeks and months were swallowed up in anger and despair in fruitless attempts to break free until her spirit was worn down to nothing the anger a dull ache and the despair something she rose up with in the morning and lay down with at night she even knew why alison had done thisnot that the knowledge helped her any she and not alison was the true owner of the arrows the business and fourteen manufactories that were making a great deal of profit now turning out sacks for sandbags to make trenchwalls and barricades and ramparts along the beaches for in all of her plotting and planning alison had made one tiny mistake she had bewitched charles robinson into marrying her she had bespelled him into running off to be killed at ypres but she had forgotten to get him to change his will and not even warrick locke could do anything about that for the will had been locked up in the safe at the robinsons solicitors office and it was the solicitor not alison who was the executor of the will there was no changing it and only because eleanor was underage was alison permitted to act as her guardian and enjoy all the benefits of the estate that was why she had been so angry the night that the death notice came and after warrick locke investigated further that was why she was forced to keep eleanor alive and enslaved because if eleanor died the property went to some impoverished cousin in the north country and not alison at all periodically eleanor was called into the parlor and given paper and pen and wrote a letter under alisons sorcerous dictation to the solicitor directing him to give alison money for this or that luxury beyond the household allowance alison fumed the entire time she was dictating these letters but eleanor was far far angrier there were times when eleanor wished she could die just out of spite she had eavesdropped on as many conversations as she could which wasnt as difficult as it sounded because alison and locke discussed such matters as if she wasnt present even when she was in the same room she knew that her stepmother was something called an elemental master and that her power was over earth what that meant she had no real notion but that was probably why alison had buried eleanors severed finger she knew that warrick locke was an elemental mage and that his power was also over earth and that he was nothing near as powerful as alison was lauralee and carolyn were one rank below warrick evidently that alison had far more power even than she had demonstrated against eleanor was not in doubt eleanor had overheard plenty in the last three years more than enough to be sure that the two of them were up to a great deal of no good but of course they wouldnt care what she heard even if she could get out of the house who would believe her wild tales about magicians for that matter she hardly knew anything of what was going on in the world outside this housejust what she could glean from the occasional newspaper she saw in the early part of the war she had been able to get more information by listening to the servants butwell that was one way in which the war had affected her there had been nine servants in the robinson householdthree more than the six that eleanor and her father had thought sufficientat the time when her father was killed a manofallwork a gardener a parlormaid three house maids the cook mrs bennett and two ladies maids one howse for alison herself one shared by carolyn and lauralee now there were two eric whitcomb from the village who had returned from the war with a scar across the front of his head from some unspecified wound and rather less than half his wits and who did the gardening the rough work and heavy hauling and alisons maid howse all the rest of the work was done by eleanor no one outside the house knew this of course alisons status would have dropped considerably the manofall work had gone first not so much out of patriotism for after march of as the true nature of the slaughter in the trenches became known it became more and more difficult to find volunteers than because he had caught wind of conscription in the offing and at the same time was given the opportunity to join up with a regiment that was going somewhere other than france im off to the suez lovey hed told the downstairs house maid miranda reed ill bring you back a camel ill still be fbi but at least my feetll be dry miranda had wept steadily for two months then turned in her notice to go and train as a vad nurse it cant be more work than this and ill surely get more thanks shed said tartly on departing the next to go had been the parlormaid patricia sheller after her brothers were conscripted leaving no one to help at her aged parents london shop and it wasnt long before katy feely the stepsisters maid followed when the work of the upstairs maid was added to her own loadshe claimed she too was going to be a vad nurse but it wasnt true ive had enough of those cats mrs bennett katy had whispered to the cook in eleanors hearing and enough of this grubby little village im off theres heaps of better positions in london going begging now by then even married men were being conscripted and mrs bennetts son had been killed leaving a wife and two tiny children with a third baby on the way mrs bennett turned in her notice to go and help care for them the result had been a sea change in how meals were dealt with in this household alison could compel eleanor to cookbut she couldnt compel eleanor to cook well and it appeared that no matter how great alisons powers were they werent enough to put the knowledge of an expert cook into eleanors mind nor the skill of that cook into her hands eleanor hadnt done more than boil an egg and make toast in her life and cooking was an undisclosed mystery to her so for one week eleanor labored her way through the instructions in the cookery books but the resulting meals were anything but edible after that week alison gave up the white swan had supplied most of the components of luncheon and dinner to the household from that time on while browns bakery provided bread crumpets scones muffins cake and pie for afternoon tea the rest of the help had followed when alison proved disinclined to pay for their meals from the pub as well as hers kent adkins the gardener and mary chance the other maid vanished without bothering to give notice eleanor still wasnt more than an adequate plain cook and she took a certain amount of grim satisfaction in the fact that no more dishes with fancy french names graced alisons table unless they came readymade out of a tin she could not bake much of anythingher bread never seemed to rise and her pie crust was always sodden she could make ordinary soup most eggy things toast tea and boil veg she could make pancakes and fry most things that required frying anything that took a lot of practice and preparation came from the swan or out of hampers from harrods and fortnum and mason things that only required heating up before they were presented at table there was rationing nowsugar according to complaints eleanor overheard or saw in the newspaper was impossible to get and the authorities were urging meatless days there were rumors in the newspapers that other things would soon be rationedbut none of that touched this household as privation however it happened and eleanor strongly suspected blackmarketeering there were plenty of good things stocked away in the pantry and the cellar including enough sugar to see them through another two or three years and plenty of tinned and potted meats jams and jellies honey tinned cream white flour and other scarce commodities enough to feed a much larger household than this one not that eleanor ever saw any of that on her plate rye and barleybread was her lot a great many potatoes roasted in the ashes or boiled and served with nothing but salt and perhaps a bit of dripping and whatever was left over from the night before put into the evercooking souppot sugarless tea made with yesterdays leaves and a great deal of sugarless porridge in fact the only time she tasted sweets now was when an empty jam jar came her way and she made a little syrup from the nearinvisible leavings to pour over her porridge or into her tea she glanced at the light coming in through the door almost teatime this of course was howses purview not hers there was a spiritkettle in the parlor howse would make the tea lay out the fancy tinned biscuits bread scones crumpets teacakes butter and jam if toast was wanted howse would make it over the fire in the parlor and then howse would share in the bounty sitting down with her employers as if she were their equal thus had the war affected even alison who eleanor suspected had learned at least one lesson and would have done more than merely sharing meals in order to avoid losing this last servant a ladys maid was a necessity to someone like alison who would have no more idea of how to put up her own hair or tend to her wardrobe than how to fly an aeroplane the laundry could be sent out prepared foodstuffs brought in and eleanors strength was adequate to the rest of the needs of the household but if alison and her daughters were to keep up their appearances and to have a chance at ascending to the social rank they aspired to howse must be kept satisfied and silent where the true state of the household was concerned eleanor sighed and stared into the flames on the kitchen hearth there was a patent range here too on which most of the actual cooking was done with a boiler and geyser in back of it that supplied hot water for baths and washing both upstairs and down but eleanor liked having an open fire and wood was the one thing that alison didnt keep her from using since the spell that bound her was somehow tied to the kitchen hearth it would have seemed more natural for eleanor to hate that fireplace but when she was all alone in the kitchen at night that little fire was her only friend in the winter she often slept down here now when her room was too cold for slumber drifting off beside the warmth of that fire watching the glowing coals now and again it seemed to her she saw things in the flameslittle dancing creatures or solemn eyes that stared back at her unblinking the truth also was that no matter what she did around the fires she never got burned leaping embers leapt away from her smoke always went up the chimney properly even when the north wind drove smoke down into the parlor or alisons room no fire ever burned out for her and even that evercooking souppot never scorched her fare might be scant and poor but it was never burned which could not always be said of alisons food particularly not when she or howse undertook to prepare or warm it themselves at the parlor hearth and though eleanor kept her thoughts to herself she could not help but be glad when hard dry inedible food and burned crusts came back on the plates to the kitchen sometimes eleanor wondered why her stepmother hadnt simply done to howse what she had done to eleanor and turn her into a slave but even after three years she didnt know a great deal more about magic than shed learned on that december night alison clearly used it but she had never again performed a spell or rite where eleanor could see her perhaps the reason was no more complicated than that while crude unskilled work could be compelled skilled work required cooperation and even as she thought that eleanor realized with a start that she had been sitting on her heels idle staring into the flames on the hearth for at least fifteen minutes the thought hit her with the force of a hammer blow could alisons magic be losing its strength with a mingling of hope and fear and quietly so as not to draw any attention to herself eleanor climbed carefully to her feet and tiptoed to the kitchen door the high stone wall around the garden prevented her from seeing anything but the roofs of the other buildings around her and the tops of the trees there was a woodpigeon in the big oak on the other side of the east wall and the cooing mingled with the sharp metallic cries of the jackdaws she stood quietly in the late afternoon sunshine closing her eyes and letting it bathe her face then she stepped right outside onto the path between the raised herb beds and had to bite her lower lip and clasp her hands tightly together to avoid shouting in glee she was outside she was not scrubbing the floor but as she made a trial of approaching the garden gate she found with a surge of disappointment that she could not get nearer than five feet to true freedom the closer she got to the big blue wooden gate the harder it was to walk as if the air itself had turned solid and she could not push her way through it this phenomena was not new unless alison was there and permitted her to approach the gate the same thing had always happened before still to be able to break free from the spell at all was a triumph and eleanor was not going to allow disappointment to ruin her small victory and after a quick breathless skipping run around the dormant garden she was not going to allow discovery to take that victory from her either she went back to her scrubbing except that she wasnt scrubbing at all she was sitting on her heels where she could quickly resume the task when she heard footsteps and simply enjoying the breathing space the sound of highpitched voices in the parlor told her that the ladies were having their tea just outside the door starlings had returned to the garden and were singing with all their might the kitchen was very quiet now only the fire on the hearth crackling while the stove heated for dinner alisons mania for forcing her to clean meant that the kitchen was spotless from the shining copper pots hanging on the spotless white plaster walls to the flagstone floor to the heavy black beams of the ceiling overhead it looked very pretty like a model kitchen on show but of course no one looking at a model kitchen ever thought about the amount of work it took to make a kitchen look like that she stared into the fire and thought carefully if this glimpse of limited freedom wasnt some fluke if incomprehensible fate had at last elected to smile on herwell her life was about to undergo a profound change for the better her stomach growled and she smiled grimly yes there would be changes starting with her diet because one of the things that the spell on her did was that it prevented her from going into the pantry late at night to steal food in many households the food was kept under lock and key but eleanors father had never seen the need for that he felt that if the servants needed to eat they should feel free to help themselves alison hadnt felt that way but the pantry still had no lock on it and while mrs bennett had lived her it hadnt needed one the cook had kept a strict accounting of foodstuffs but that wasnt why there was no pilferage mrs bennett had kept everyone so well fed that none of the other servants had seen the need to raid the stores with mrs bennett gone however alison had changed the spell that bound eleanor to keep her from the stores howse of course never appeared in the kitchen and wasnt going short either since she shared alisons meals but eleanor had heard all the servants gossip before theyd given notice and she knew all the tricks for stealing food now that she hadnt known back before alison came so if she had even one chance at the pantrywell she knew how and what to purloin so that even if alison inspected it would not be apparent that anyone had been into the stores what a thought no more going to bed hungryor feeling sick from eating food that had gone off and been rejected by alison because that was all that there was for her to eat or at least there would be none of that if she could bend the spell enough to get into the pantry at least once and suddenly with a great leap of her heart she realized that within a few days or a week at most she would have the house to herself as she always did in spring and fall the annual pilgrimage to london was coming when alison and her daughters went to obtain their spring and summer wardrobes always before this she had found herself restricted to the kitchen and her own room entirely for those few days but perhaps this spring the sound of fashionable shoes with high heels clicking on hard stone broke into her reverie and she quickly bent to her scrubbing when alison appeared in the doorway striking a languid pose eleanor looked up stonyfaced but did not stop her scrubbing but she was much more conscious of the fire on the hearth than usual and to keep her face still she concentrated on it the warmth feltsupportive as if there was a friend here in the room with her she concentrated on that alison wore a lovely purple velvet teagown with ornaments of a cobwebby gray lace with sleeves caught into cuffs at the wrist as usual her every dark hair was in placeand there was a tiny smile on her ageless face she made a tiny gesture towards her stepdaughter and eleanor fought to keep her expression unchanging as she saw more clearly than she ever had before a lance of muddy yellow light shoot from the tip of that finger towards her and briefly illuminate her but she also saw with a sense of shock something entirely new as that light struck her there appeared a kind of cage of twisted and tangled darkly glowing cords that pent her in the cords absorbed the light writhed into a new configuration then faded away and eleanor sat up straighter just as she would have if she had felt the compulsion to scrub ebbing thats enough ellie alison said the laundrys been left at the tradesmans entrance go get it and put the linens away then leave the rest for howse yes maam eleanor said casting her eyes down and thinking wishing with all her might tell me youre going to london go to london stay for a long time a fortnight or morel go to london and she bit her lip again to stifle the impulse to giggle when alison added thoughtfully i believe well be going on our london trip in two days if the weather hold fine youll be a good girl while were gone and do all your work wont you ellie yes maam she replied getting to her feet slowly and brushing off her apron using both actions as an excuse to keep her head down go tend the laundry and once again out of the corner of her eye she saw a lance of grayish yellow light strike that tangle of cords and make it visible for a moment saw the cords writhe into a new configuration but this time she felt something the faint ghost of the sort of compulsion she usually experienced driving her towards the hall and the tradesmens entrance she allowed it to direct her because the last thing she wanted was for alison to guess that her magic was no longer controlling her stepdaughter completely as she folded and put away the linens though she wondered what had happened and why now id better take advantage of it while i have the chance she decided finally who knows how long this respite will last the usual chores occupied her until dinner more floorscrubbing bathdrawing tidying and dusting and dishwashing while howse tended to her own duties and alison and her daughters went out to pay calls or do their work it wasnt what eleanor would have called worksitting in meetings debating over what sort of parcels should be sent to our boys in the trenches or paying visits to the recovering wounded officers in the hospital to help them by writing letters for them or reading to them alison and her daughters did not deign to help mere unranked soldiers eleanor heard them return and go upstairs to change for dinner that was when she prepared what she was able to cook then laid the table and waited in the kitchen until summoned by the bell then she served the four courses to the four diners in the candlelit dining room with a fresh white apron over her plain dress it was ham tonight from the swan preceded by a delicate consomme from a tin a beetroot salad and ending with a fine tart from the browns bakery though this was one of the more difficult times of the day as she served food she was not allowed to touch and watched the girls deliberately spoil what they left on their plates with slatherings of salt and pepper so that she could not even salvage it for herself tonight she comforted herself with the knowledge that her dinner was not going to be as meager as it had been for far too long while alison and the girls were lingering over their tart she went upstairs and turned down the beds picked up the scattered garments that they had left on the floor and laid them ready for howse to put away she swept out the rooms for the last time today then went back down to the kitchen to wait for them to leave the table when she heard them going back up to their rooms for the evening she went into the dining room again to clear the table and return the ham and a few other items to the pantry but she smiled as she did so because once she had closed the pantry door she made a little test of opening the door againand found that she could ha it was her turn to linger now and she did so over the dishes over cleaning the kitchen until she heard all four sets of heels going up the stairs to their rooms then she waited staring into the fire until the house quieted oddly tonight there seemed to be more than a suggestion of creatures dancing in the flamesonce or twice she blinked and shook her head sure she had also seen eyes where no eyes could be and then she stole to the pantry and opened it again there was a faint feeling of resistance but nothing more and the culinary aladdins cave was open to her plundering now she knew this house as no one else did and she knew where all of the hiding places in it were one in particular was secure to herself alone there was a hidden hatch under the servants stair that for some reason her father had never shown alison perhaps it was because eleanor had been the one to discover it and as a child had used it to store her secret treasures and sometimes even hid in it when she had been frightened by storms the hatch disclosed a set of narrow stone stairs that led down into a tiny stone cellar that he thought was a priests hole perhaps because of the little wooden crucifix about the size to fit on the end of a rosary they had found on the floor of the place eleanor had always thought it was a place where royalist spies had hidden perhaps it had served both functions here eleanor kept those few things she didnt want to fall into alisons hands such as most of the books that she had been using to study for the oxford entrance examinations other volumes she managed to purloin in the course of cleaning and her mothers jewelry alison and her daughters didnt know about the jewelry and never missed the books which didnt much surprise eleanor as they seemed singularly uninterested in reading now the place was going to serve another purpose as the repository for her stolen bounty of food in case alison managed to strengthen her magic and there was not another chance for a while for the next hour or so she went back and forth between the pantry and the closet never carrying much at a time so that if she heard alison or the girls coming she could hide what she had jam jelly and marmalade two bags of castersugar some tinned meats and bacon tinned cream and condensed milk and many more imperishable things went into that cellar that night she was very careful not to take the last of anything and in fact to take nothing that was not present in abundance removing items from the back of the shelf rather than the front by the time she was finished she had a small wealth of foodstuffs hidden away that made her giddy with pleasure then she cut herself a generous slice of ham and a piece of buttered white bread to go with her soup cut a little slice of the tart and added milk and sugar to tea made with fresh leaves and she had the first filling meal she had gotten since mrs bennett left she felt so good and so sleepy with content in fact that she didnt bother to go up to her own room instead she cleaned up every last trace of her illicit meal and pulled the pallet she used in cold weather out of its cupboard spreading it out in front of the fire and as she fell asleep she smiled to think she saw sleepy eyes blinking with contented satisfaction back at her from the coals march first london general hospital at this time of day the ward was full of people relatives hovering over their boysthough some of the boys were almost old enough to be reggies father had devlin fenyx still been alive reggie was in the officers wards which meant that he had the luxury of being in the hospital building and not outside in a tent as the enlisted men were he usually didnt have any visitors since his mother was afraid to travel alone and to her with a servant qualified as alone today however was different two of the men from squadron were on leave and had come to visit dashed handsome young fillies theyve got hovering about you reg said lt steven stewart enviously one of the handsome young filliesa vad called ivy groveclearly overheard him she blushed bit her lip and hurried off small wonder almost any pilot got the herotreatment from the women and steven was an infernally handsome fellow who still hadnt shaken the oxford manner reginald fenyx could not have cared what the vad nursesor any otherslooked like all he cared about was that they were there they talked to him kept his mind on other things during the daythat they noticed when he was about to go off and came over on any pretext to keep the shakes away because when they were gone tommy arnolds reggies flight mechanic and a wizard with the bristol aircraft wasnt nearly as subtle as steven was he stared after ivys trim figure with raw longing he was a short bandylegged bloke but what he could do with a plane was enough to make the pilot lucky enough to get him weep with joy when he took a bird that had been in tommys hands up blimey tommy said contemplatively wish theyd send a trim bit like that over stead of those old orses they do send the trim bits over tommy steven said fingering his trim moustache with a laugh but the old horses keep them out of your way your reputation precedes you old man reggie managed a real smile as tommy preened a little but his heart wasnt in it theyd generously spent five hours of leave time here with him but there was a limit to their generosity and speaking of trim bits steven tweaked the hem of his already perfect tunic steven like reggie did not have to rely on the fiftypound uniform allowance for his outfitting and like reggie had been before the crash he was never less than impeccably turned out if tommy and i are going to find ourselves a bit of company on this leave wed better push off cant have the pbis showing up the flying corps what thanks for turning up fellows reggie said fervently give my best to the rest of the lads but not too soon you can bet on that steven laughed and he and tommy sketched salutes and sauntered out of the ward winking at ivy the vad girl as they passed her making her blush furiously reggie lay back against his pillows feeling exhausted by the effort to keep up the charade that he was perfectly all right aside from being knocked about a bit it was grand seeing the fellows butit was easier when people he knew werent here and he didnt have to pretend he had more in common with the lad in the next bed over a mere second lieutenant by the name of william west for all that west was fbi and reggie washad beena pilot a captain and an ace at that all the shellshock victims were in this end of the ward together sometimes reggie thought cynically it was so that their screaming in nightmares and their shaking fits by day wouldnt bother anyone else there werent many shellshock cases in the royal flying corps anyway the pilots and their support crew were well behind the lines out of reach of the guns and the gas that was the lot of the fbithe poor bloody infantry upon whose lines in the trenches the pilots looked down in remote pity chattering and clattering through the sky or we do just before archie gets us or the huns shoot us down reggie amended and then the first sight of that azurewinged fokker interposed itself between him and the ward and the shaking began he clawed at his bedside table for a glass of water the paper the lads had brought him anything to distract himself but then before he could go into a fullblown attack something altogether out of the ordinary distracted him because coming towards him down the aisle between the beds accompanied by his usual medico dr walter boyes was another doctor but this time it was someone he recognized captain fenyx boyes began quietly so as not to disturb west who had subsided into a morphineassisted sleepi believe you already know my colleague i should say so he exclaimed sitting up straight he had never been so pathetically glad to see anyone in his life doctor scott maya i had no idea you were on the military wards im not the handsome darkhaired darkeyed woman said with a smile her exotic beauty was more than enough to make even the stark white hospital coat and severe black skirt look outoftheordinary good heavens reggie can you see the war department unbending enough for that now if i were unmarried and prepared to volunteer for malta they would take me and they might even allow me to practice in belgium or france but here oh they would accept me as a vad aide of course but because im married they wont take me any other way heaven forfend that peter might have to supervise the household once in a while wellwhen you put it that way he shrugged the war department was full of idiots everyone knew that unfortunately they were the idiots in charge maya scott and her fellow female doctors few though they were would have made a big difference to the wounded and if they were worried about the morals of the patients being corrupted or even those of the other military doctors wouldnt a married doctor be safer rather than more dangerous but why are you here then surely not just for me entirely just for you ive been sent by a higher power a little smile curved her lips suggesting that this was a joke walter is a friend of mine he worked in our charity clinics before the war she continued i didnt know you were here until lady virginia got hold of me two days ago she gave me your doctors name and that was when i went hunting for him and you ah that explained higher power his godmother was a force of nature i would have been here sooner but until i got hold of walter i wouldnt have been allowed near you it was her turn to shrug im a female not your relative your fiancee nor a nurse you see never mind that im a doctor evidently it is expected that you would immediately corrupt my morals or i yours fortunately walter has made all smooth he is allowed to bring in anyone he likes as a consulting physician so long as i dont expect to be paid in the course of that exchange reggie and maya communicated something more wordlessly a lift of an eyebrow on reggies part towards dr boyesdoes he know the tiniest shake of the head from maya confirming his initial impressionno so doctor walter was neither an elemental mage himself nor was he among the few who were not mages that nevertheless knew of the existence of mages and magic doctor maya however was an elemental mage in fact she was an earth master walter can the patient leave his bed she asked in the next moment id like to talk to him privately i dont want him to put weight on that leg yet but yes doctor walter replied and sent the vad girl for a wheelchair then he added in a hushed voice reggie was sure he was not meant to overhear if you can get something out of him about his experience thats what im here for maya said soothingly i havent seen a great many shellshock cases myself but ive gotten some nurses are coming back to us in sad condition particularly the ones whove been on transports that were torpedoed or shelled while working near the lines or riding with the ambulances his grandmother and lady virginia demarce his godmother thought he might be more willing to unburden himself to someone he knows reggie almost laughed with pentup hysteria someone he knew good god if that was all it was if they only knew all those medicos if they only knew but the chair arrived and he levered himself into it wanting nothing more than to be out of this ward quickly where he could finally talk to someone who would at least understand because he was not just a victim of shellshock oh no that was only the smallest of his problems it was an unseasonably warm day he discovered as maya wheeled him briskly and efficiently out into the hospital garden that was a relief for she was able to find a little alcove where they could be quite private and park him with his back to a wall he blessed her exquisite sensitivity but she was an earth master after all and a healer to boot and sensitivity came with that description well reggie she said the moment she settled down across from him with their knees practically touching she took out a bit of paper from her pocket and consulted it im going to make this easier and more difficult for you i have been studying doctors freud and jungs works and as you heard i have already seen several normal cases of shellshock i did my studying of your case before i arrived so let me tell you quickly what i know then well get to what i dont know i know you were shot down your observer was killed she looked at the paper in her hand erik kittlesen wasnt it he nodded numbly both desperately grateful that he wasnt actually having to tell all this himself and appallingly afraid of what he was going to have to say when she started asking questions you came down close to the hun side in nomans land some of the huns came to get you out of the wreckage and a barrage hit killing everyone but you then one of our parties got you out dragged you to a bunker and another barrage hit burying you in the bunker for two days until another rescue party dug you out is that the long and the short of it he nodded his mouth felt horrible dry and when he licked his lips he fancied he could still taste that horrible substance that passed for air in the trenches and the bunkersa fetid murk tainted with the smell of past gas attacks and thick with the stench of death of blood and rotting flesh rats and foul water now comes the hard part she said and reached over to take his unresisting hand now i ask you questions and reggie you must answer them i cant help you if you dont or wont once again he nodded feeling his throat closing up with panic and the sting of helpless tears behind his eyelids why did you get shot down she asked implacably you are an air master one of the most skilled i know we both know it wasnt luck that was keeping you in the sky particularly not given the horrid old rattletraps you were often given so what happened i went up he croaked andmaya this is a damned wretched thing to say butlook the only way i was ever able to face what i was doing was to never ever think about the hun as anything other than a target he made a sound like a laugh actually i was eriks only chance to go up at all which was why i was in a twoseater instead of flying solo as usual everyone knew that even though erik crashed more birds than he flew anything he aimed at he hithe even took down a hun with a halfbrick once hed crashed his plane as usual the only things available were my usual bird which was having a wonky engine anyway and the twoseater they knew if he was in the observers seat i could concentrate on flying the bird and he could concentrate on what he was good at but if it hadnt been for me he wouldnt even have been up there that day maya nodded i see why you feel doubly responsible pilots were not in such plentiful supply that erik would not have been up on his own he knew that hed been told that too many times she didnt say it because she must have known that hed been told it and didnt believe it and he was grateful that she didnt say it aloud again because she understood it wouldnt help there were a great many things in this war that people understood but didnt say aloud it was probably the only way most people kept from going mad but of course im already mad or getting there but why were you shot down she persisted as if she knew that this was where the first crack had appeared in his armor maybe she did because he swallowed because this time when i went up there was someone id never seen before up there to stop me bright blue fokker maya he was one of us he was an air master too and he shook his head and i felt something from him not his thoughts more like what he was feeling he washe was in mourning he closed his eyes for a moment to fight down his own tears words were totally inadequate to what he had felt in that single moment mourning it was deeper than mourning it had been selfrevulsion hatred for what the man had been doing and a terrible terrible sense of loss the hun hadnt only been mourning what he had to dohe was in mourning for the loss of everything he cared for he was reggie groped for words flying with sorrow the deepest blackest sorrow i ever felt in my life and it was because by doing his duty which was the honorable thing to do he was being forced to kill us who should have been his comrades because his beautiful blue heavens were filled with a rain of blood and his beautiful blue wings belonged to the angel of death he knew he would never for however long he lived fly in skies free of blood his world was shattered and hed never really feel happiness again mayas fingers tightened on his vishnu preserve us she replied her voice full of the shocked understanding he had hoped to hear icouldnt shoot him he couldnt help but shoot me i he shook his head i didnt evade he got erik first then my tank and then my engine he got erik and i felt him die and it was my fault my fault once again her fingers tightened on his but she did not say as so many fools had that it wasnt his fault you made a mistake she said instead at some point reggie you have to stop paying for it and forgive yourself but only you can decide how much payment is enough then her voice strengthened you were shot down your collarbone and your knee were both shattered your ribs were cracked and i think only your mastery saved you from worse then the huns came to get you out before your plane went up in flames something happened then too didnt it a hun came to get me out reggie corrected a young fellow came pelting out regardlessi suppose our boys must have seen what he was doing because they held their fire he came pelting out into nomans land over the wire and hauled me out while the bird was burning and he went back for erik and he swallowed that was when the shell hit young fellow he couldnt have been sixteen maybe less he felt his throat closing again at the thought of that earnest young face at the young voice that told him stille stille bitte ja das ist gut stille the boys that came after me found some bits of his things a letter from home a picture of his mother his name was wilhelm thats hun for william like west in the next bed over from me in the ward fbi like young willie too wilhelm katzel thats two fellows that died because of me in less than five minutes she nodded but said nothing for a moment i think she finally said when this is overyou should tell his mother how brave he was that was not what he was expecting to hear how will that help he asked angrily i dont know she replied not reacting to his anger at all but i do know that it wont hurt it will let her know he hadnt lost his decency or his honor in this vile slaughter and thats something for her to hold onto this war has made beasts of so manyperhaps it will comfort her to know that her wilhelm was still a man it was not the answer he had been expecting and he flushed a little but she was right she was very right but of course the worst was yet to come that isnt where the real trouble lies though is it she continued oh its horrible and you are burdened terribly with guilt but that isnt the worst she tugged a little on his hand forcing him to look up into her eyes the worst came when you were safe didnt it in the bunker buried alive he almost jerked his hand out of hers and began to shake uncontrollably how did you reggie im an earth master the ground in france and belgium is saturated with blood she said with a thin veneer of calm over her words i know what that attracts there are monsters in the earth of france reggie and they are fattening and thriving on that slaughterand when that shell hit that bunker they had a tidbit of the sort they could only crave and dream about in their power air and earth are natural enemies and they had you in their territory in their grasp to do with what they wanted his vision began to film over as panic rose in his chest he clutched her hands as though clutching a lifeline as she put into words what he could not they had you reggie their greatest enemy a master of air and a master of the light helpless on their ground he couldnt see now as all the memories came flooding back he heard his breath rasping in his throat his heart pounding and could not move for the fear dimly through the roaring in his ears he heard her ask the question he did not want to answer what did they do to you reggie what did they do maya scott sat with her husband in a place in the exeter club wherebefore her marriage to peter scottno woman had ever been before it was a lovely day outside still the windows stood wide open to the warm air and the sun streamed down onto old persian rugs caressed brown leather upholstery and touched the contents of brandy bottles with gold so said the lord alderscroft often called the old lionolder now than when she had first met him and aged by more than years youve seen the boy she nodded lord alderscroft sat like the king on his throne in his wingback chair in his own sitting room in his private suite on the top floor of the exeter club and raised a heavy eyebrow at maya your report please doctor scott maya never sat here without feeling a distant sense of triumph it had been her doing that had broken down the last three barriers of the white lodge housed here in the exeter clubof gender lineage and race she would have failed the edwardian tests on all three counts female common and of mixed indian and british blood but king edward was gone and king george was on the throne and after the defeat of her aunt there was not a man on the council who felt capable of objecting to her presence and truth to tell they needed her they had needed her before the war she was one of a handful of earth masters who could bear to live and work in the heart of a great city now they needed herand the other women they had admitted to the white lodgemore than ever the war had been no easier on the ranks of the elemental masters than it was on the common man today however triumph was not even in the agenda hes in wretched shape my lord she said slowly it is not helping that so many physicians and most officers all of whom should know better are convinced that shellshock is just another name for malingering even as he himself acknowledges that he is not well there is the subconscious conviction that if he only had an ounce more willpower he would get over it and back to the fight i can tell him differently until i turn as blue as rama until he believes it in his heart he will continue to berate himself even as he suffers lord alderscroftwho not that long ago would have agreed with those physicians and officerssighed heavily he knew better now all elemental masters knew better the war was hellish but it was worse on the minds and nerves of elemental masters the truth was most of the masters that had gone into the trenches if they survived the senseless mindless way in which the war department threw away their lives were there for less than six months before their minds broke so he is in no fit state as doctor boyes reports with a ripe case of shellshock as well as physical injuries and as if that were not enough then there is what he faced in the earth she shook her head and swallowed as her husband closed his hand over hers she had closed herself off as much as she had dared but as a healer and a physician she had needed to know something of what he had experienced she had been ready for it and of course it had come at second hand but it had been too horrific for anyone to really understand without sharing it she gave peter a faint smile of thanks you do not wish to know the details my lord horrors that is enough i think the inimical forces of all four elements can terrify but i think that those of earth are most particularly apt at destroying the mind with fear they swarmed him and tormented him from the moment the earth was shattered around him to the moment that the rescue party broke through and got him out the records say he was more dead than alive i am not at all surprised what i am surprised at is that he has a mind left at all much less a rational one well alderscroft rumbled his face creased and recreased with lines of care we humans have taught them about torment and horror all too well have we not he sighed again do not lay too much upon the shoulders of mere mortals my lord maya replied grimly recall that it is healing that is in the gift of the earth mages and elementals the converse is harm and it is naturally true of the dark side of that element she thought with pity of the poor fellow who she last recalled seeing as a bright young oxford scholar utterly shattered and weeping his heart out bent over her knees it was a state she had wanted to bring him tofor without that initial purging he could not even begin to healbut it had been painful for her to do so and only the fact that she had done it before to others even made it possible for her to carry it through but she was a surgeon and surgeons became hardened to necessity after a time you could not cleanse a wound without releasing the infection you could not heal the mind without letting some of the pressure off the larger consequence for us my lord is that he has cut himself off from any use of his powers lord alderscroft closed his eyes i feared as much and we cannot afford that too many of us are gone nevertheless he has closed off his mind to his power she replied and it is of no use trying to get him to open it now he tells me that the things that attacked him destroyed his gifts and he believes it with every iota of his being and that isnt true a second figure stepped away from the shadows beside the fireplace another nobleman peter almsley lean and blond nervously highbred and the scotts best friend he was in a uniform but he was on some sort of special duty with the war department that kept him off the front she suspected that special duty was coordinating the magical defense of the realm certainly alderscroft wasnt young enough anymore to do so she closed her eyes for a moment even if fenyx never flew again he could be put to doing what almsley was doingwith more effectiveness the air elementals actually controlled winds and weather to some extent and if an air master could see to the physical defenses of the country she did not shudder she had endured worse than bombardment by zepps and hun aeroplanes butit was hard hard to hear the drone of those motors in the sky in the dark and look up helplessly at the ceiling and wait for the first explosions and wonder if you were sitting on the target or if you would be able to scramble away to somewhere safer when you knew where the bombs were falling and if the latterwho of your friends was sitting on the target if reggie could be persuaded she shook her head there is nothing wrong at all with his gifts she said decidedly but i think that in those dreadful two days underground he understood instinctively that his very power was what attracted the earth creatures to him and that if he closed that power off they would cease to torment him at some level deeper than thoughtdoctor freud would have called it the idin the most basic of his instincts he walled that part of himself away and now he truly does not believe it exists anymore so you can get him back alderscroft began eagerly looking optimistic for the first time this interview began but she shook her head emphatically not i this is too complicated a case for me doctor andrew pike in devon is the man you need but almsley groaned not a chance of a lookin there maya not now not ever its one thing to unburden his weary soul to you my heartbut if you call in the good doctor pike or worse send the boy to him our reggie will have to admit that hes gone balmy and that he can never do maya looked from almsley to alderscroft and back again and felt like stamping her feet with frustration at what she read there men why did they have to be so stubborn about such things maya think her husband said quietly if hes sick with guilt over the idea that hes malingering what do you think the mere sight of andrew pike at his bedside do to his feelings about himself defeated she could only shake her head going round the bend is just not the done thing my heart almsley said sadly its what your dotty uncle algernon does not an officer and a gentleman andrew could probably have him right and tight in months but that doesnt matter if he saw andrew hed be certain that we all think hes mad and if hes mad hes broken and useless and worse hes a disgrace to the old strawberry leaves and escutcheon if hes gone mad he might just as well die and avoid embarrassing the family she leveled her gaze at alderscroft then you had better hope he can get well and work his way through his troubles on his own she said doing her best to keep accusation out of her tone but i dont think that he will not without a powerful incentive to break through that wall of fear that keeps him away from his power and i can tell you right now that duty honor and pride are not powerful enough duty honor and pride arent enough to get him through the shellshock much less break through to his gifts again furthermore should she tell them she was a physician she had to furthermore i consider that without doctor pikes help there is a real possibility that he may do away with himself if he cant manage to get himself through because i am not sure he can live with the pain the fear and the conflicts inside himself as he is now there shed said it she expected them to look shocked to protest they didnt they only looked saddened and resigned it wont be the first one weve lost that way almsley said softly revealing the reason for their reaction he turned to alderscroft what do you think send him home on recovery leave almsley hadnt asked her but she answered anyway at least if he is at home he will be in familiar surroundings and far away from anything military it might help alderscroft nodded his massive head slowly get his grandmother to keep an eye on him i think its the best we can do ill talk to some people and get him leave to recover at home he turned back to maya thank you doctor you have been of immense help more than you know i only wish it were possible to take more of your advice i promise we will see to it that everything that can be done will be and it will not be for lack offlexibilityon our part that was a dismissal if ever she had heard one and reluctantly she allowed her husband to assist her to her feet and took her leave but it did nothing to end her angerwhich was the only way she could keep her own profound depression at bay i hate this bloody senseless useless stupid war march london the robinsons had taken the first train to london set themselves up at the savoy hotel and gone straight out to take care of the most urgent need for all three of themnew wardrobes but their visits to the first three fashion housestheir usual hauntswere less than a success have you ever seen such ugly colors carolyn complained rather too loudly to her mother as she and her sister followed hard on their mothers heels out to the pavement in front of the third drab brown drab olive drab navy and drab cream khaki khaki khaki and nothing but tweeds and linens and for spring and summer what about silk what about muslin do they think were all land girls her mother shrugged well try another atelier dear she said with a glance up the street looking for a taxi someone who isnt trying so hard to be patriotic and dress us all in uniforms i dont see why one has to be plain to be patriotic lauralee pouted her sister sniffed plain made up like a guy more like carolyn exclaimed i dont want to look like im in uniform and i dont want to look like aa suffragette i want leave it to me girls i have some notions alison replied and spied a free taxi in the same moment taxis were thin on the ground in london now but alison had no intention of subjecting herself to the underground or the buses it didnt take much more than a lifted finger and a spark of magic to summon it as it passed by five other people trying to hail it including one disgruntled cavalry officer she leaned over and gave the drivera very old man indeedan address that made him look at her in surprise but he said nothing and she took her place beside her daughters it was pleasantly warm unpleasantly enough they were all three wearing last years spring gowns this would never do to the surprise of her daughters the establishment that the taxi left them at was not any of the usual fashion houses alison patronized she ignored their surprise for it was painfully clear to her that the usual establishments would not do this year there was probably a good reason why all the houses that she could afford to patronize were using domestically produced fabrics this spring and it was a reason she should have anticipated given the start of rationing she would have to resort to another ploythough the rather grubby theater district was not a place one would normally go to find ones wardrobe she opened a door with the cryptic words keplans haberdashery painted on the frosted glass the girls followed her up a narrow rather dirty wooden staircase with no small trepidation she smiled to herself knowing what awaited them at the top she and the girls emerged from this place feeling a glow of triumph here at least fashion was not being subjected to patriotism but then again the ladies who frequented this dressmaker absolutely required every aid to seduction that fine clothing could provide for most of them had arrangements with the gentlemen of whitehall the city and both houses of parliamentarrangements that did not include wedding rings as a consequence they were unlikely to sacrifice beauty for the appearance of respectability alison knew of this place from her early days as one of the demimondainebut of course unlike the rest of her sistersinsin shed had the means at her disposal to ensure she got a wedding ring before too long into her arrangement this particular dressmaker spent half the time creating costumes for the theater and half dressing the kept ladies of the town but because she did the former she had a huge storehouse of fabric to pull from after the third house had disappointed alison had come to the reluctant conclusion that it was possible the war and the hun submarine blockade had begun to affect even those with money to spend on london dressmakers this dressmaker had only confirmed that as she had pulled out roll after roll of silk and muslin with the comment you wont see that thanks to the kaiser silks came from china by way of paris muslin from india or the united states both had to come by way of the ocean and between ships being sunk and ships being commandeered to bring over military goodsluxury goods probably still were coming but now their prices had gone beyond the reach of a minor industrialists widow of course even in broom one didnt go to a theatrical costumier for ones wardrobebut alison had a way around that when the dresses arrived in their plain packaging she would have ellie cut the labels out of last years gowns and sew them into the unlabeled new ones perhaps it was a bit foolish to do so but after all the laundry was sent outand the laundress would take note if this years gowns had no labels anymoreor worse had labels from keplans haberdashery rather than a fashion house that was cited in the london society pages half of keeping up appearances was in attending to details alison smiled as the girls chattered happily on the way back to the savoy there was a slight drawback to patronizing miss keplan they would have to stay in london for nearly a week to accomplish all the fittings whereas the establishments they usually used had mannequins and fittingdummies made to all three womens measure still the results would be worth the extra days the girls would look like butterflies among the caterpillars at every garden party and fete this spring and summer men responded to these things they would outshine much prettier girls just because their frocks were prettier with any luck one of them at least would catch someone with a title money or better still both to his name robinsons fortune was reasonable and since by magically enhanced maneuvering alison had secured the monopoly of supplying sacks for sandbags to the army it was not likely to run out any time soonbut alison was weary of being reasonable weary of broom weary of being the leading light in a claustrophobically tiny and insignificant social sphere she had wearied of it very soon after ascending to the throne of unofficial queen of broom she had much larger ambitions alison aspired to longacre park it was not a new desire as a scrawny adolescent hardeyed with ambition she had aspired to the circles of those who feted royalty she would gather with other spectators on the pavement whenever a grand party or ball was being held and vow that one day she would be among such invitees when she had been taken up by an aging courtesan with enough of the gift of earth magery to recognize it in another she had seen it as a first step to those circles and deserted her dreary workingclass family even though all such a relic of victorias time could hope for was the company of prosperous shopkeepers and minor industrialists but alison had bided her time and ensnared the first of the unmarried gentlemen moderate means to cross her path sacrificing wealth temporarily for respectability she had slipped up a trifle allowing him to get her with child twicewell he was more virile than she had thought she had rid herself of him soon enough which left her a comfortably off widow and had laid the foundations for better conquests by learning the lessons that would fit her for the circles of the exalted while at the same time mastering her magery etiquette elocutionespecially elocution for bernard shaw was right the wrong accent guaranteed failure at this gameshe had instructors for everything a good nanny for the children and the proper boarding schools gave her the time she needed to attain full command of earth magic at the same time that had been at the hands of a male earth master of course and a suitably old one who flattered himself that the attentiveness of this attractive widow was genuine and not inspired by the desire to have all of his secrets strange how male mages never seemed to learn from the lesson of merlin and nimue a female would not have been so easy to manipulate nor so hopelessly naive she had learned all he had to teach and thenwell he got his reward and had not survived die experience he had however died with a look of incredulous pleasure on his face she had owed him that much she wondered what the coroner and undertaker had made of it and had made of the fact that he might have been sixty but when he died he had looked ninety mama were here carolyn called out shaking her out of her reverie she followed the girls out of the taxi paid and tipped the driver and entered the hotel no one took any note of themwell no one except a couple of young officers in the lobby who gazed at the girls appreciatively she repressed a grimace had the family been of note there would be concierges and porters swarming about them eager to know their slightest whim even with the hotel staff so seriously depleted by the war well if she had anything to say about it they would be swarmed one day they entered the elevator and with a nod and a shilling to the operator ascended to their floor which was not the best floor respectable and the denizens of broom would have been overwhelmed by the elegance but it was by no means the best the savoy had to offer and that rankled but she would not show that before the girls they required ambition and they had it but it must be unclouded by envy envy would put disagreeable lines in their faces they must be like athletes or perhaps warriors with their eyes and minds firmly fixed on the prize they must be ruthless of course but they should never waste time on so unprofitable an emotion as envy the girls fluttered into the salon still chattering about the gowns they understood completely that they must not say where the gowns were coming from of course but they were bewitched properly bewitched by the pastel silks and delicately printed muslins that had been spread out for their approval and the elegant copies of the gowns that the other fashion houses were showing as alison had well remembered the dressmaker was a very clever little woman within days of new gowns being shown for the season she had sketches of every one of them and was making copies and the gowns that she copied were not those of the houses that alison could afford to patronize oh no these were the gowns that would make their appearance on the lawns of stately homes like longacre park for the truly fabulously wealthy and the extremely wellconnected were no more affected by the blockade than the theatrical dressmaker was in the case of the latter it was because she had an entire warehouse of fabrics stockpiled and besides that access to dozens perhaps hundreds of old gowns and costumes that could be remade in the case of the formerwell where the habitues of the royal enclosure were concerned a bolt or two of fabric could be brought over somehow well perhaps this would be the year and if the faintly frivolous gowns caused a stirring of dismay at the broom cricket games or the country club tennis matches well perhaps the owners of the gowns could move into territory this summer where their appearance would harmonize with the surroundings rather than stand out from them she shook off her reverie there was of course more to this biannual visit than just the replenishing of a wardrobe she had other calls to make while she was here im going out girls she called out to them have your dinner sent up and you are not on any account to stir from these rooms they replied in chorus and ended with a giggle practice your charms she said with a lifted brow oh mama lauralee objected theyre so much more difficult here all the more important that you learn how to set them here she replied severely you have no more magic than the old woman who taught mebut if i have anything to say about it youll learn how to make much better use of it than she did a thought occurred to her that would give them malicious amusement and would set their minds on the proper task our windows overlook the street why dont you exercise your skills and your minds by making unsuitable persons conceive of a passion for one another oh mama carolyn exclaimed delight sparking in her eyes may we i would not have told you to do so if i did not mean it she replied with a little smile of her own make me a thorough report when i return she telephoned the exeter club as they set themselves and the small bits of apparatus they would need at the window there would be no need to find taxis for this visit lord alderscroft would send a car this was after all the business of the war office maya narrowed her eyes suspiciously as she watched lord alderscrofts visitor he had not invited her into his own rooms instead they were meeting in the same aesthetic public dining room that she had been taken to the first time she entered the doors of the exeter club what she had not known then was that one of the mirrors was oneway and hid a tiny spyhole she didnt think that anyone had been watching her that time but even if they had been they hadnt learned anything they couldnt have learned by watching her openly alderscroft wanted her assessment of someone he wanted to keep an eye on reggie fenyx it was another earth master and already maya disliked her really the elegant woman said her eyes widening slightly young fenyx is so badly off as all that no maya did not like alison robinson she did not trust mrs robinson one tiny little bit she had no reason for these feelings other than her instinct though which was not enough to give as a reason to lord alderscroft who distrusted feminine intuition were the rumors true that far too many people that alison robinson was intended to keep watch on died instead and was that enough of a reason for suspicion of course they had all been spies for the hun and there was never any reason to point to alison robinson as the cause of their deaths but but maya toyed with her tea on the other side of the oneway mirror listened as alderscroft assigned alison robinson to keep an eye on reginald fenyx and reflected with some relief that this was a perfectly absurd assignment after all someone like mrs robinson the widow of a mere small manufacturer was not going to have entree into but lord alderscroft alison said smiling this is really quite impossible i have no entree into such exalted social circles why i should not be able to do more than glimpse the young man at a distance the closest approach i could manage would be in the autumn as the hunt goes by if he even participates in the hunt at all you know i have no objection to doing anything you and the war office might ask of me but really dropping me behind enemy lines and asking me to pass myself off as a kleine hausfrau would be simpler ah erm alderscroft coughed well perhaps i should if i am to carry out this assignment you shall have to manufacture an appropriate background for me the wretched woman went on to mayas dismay youll have to find an impoverished line in burkes with a daughter called alison of the proper age one that might well have decided that ungenteel comfort was preferable to leaking roofs and no proper plumbing and then youll have to arrange a proper introduction to his mother by letter if nothing else that will take time im afraid said alderscroft sounding apologetic i can wait she replied gaily with a delicate little laugh after all a job worth doing is worth doing properly thank you my lord this is much preferable to investigating the occasional foreigner on a walking tour through shakespeare country that sweet little laugh grated on mayas nerves one earth master to anotherthat woman was altogether too well shielded but then london was unbearable for an earth master without being shielded and although it would have been much more polite to forego her shields within the exeter club she wasnt a member of the lodge so she couldnt know that it was safe to do so so that was no good reason to mistrust her or at least it was not a reason that alderscroft would accept the creature was back to harping on that introduction maya had seen more than her share of social climbers in india and she knew another one the moment she saw her though she might not be able to read mrs robinson she didnt have to in order to recognize those signs doesnt she have daughters oh yes planning on marrying into the family are you my dear if you can manage it that is well there was the one saving grace of reggies condition he was so heavily blocked that the robinson woman could run him down with a locomotivesized love spell and hed be impervious to it he was in fact the mirror opposite to an elemental master now he was powerfully unmagical she could throw spells at him for a week and all that would happen would be that they would be swallowed up without a trace and as for simple vamping our reggies had every sort of woman there is fling themselves at his head by now hes not going to think much of a couple of provincial belles hanging out for a title and a fortune and if you cant recognize that dear lady you are an utter fool and sure enough she was back on that soprecious introduction again it probably should be a letter lord alderscroft she was saying with a melting smile or better still twoone to lady devlin directly and one i can handcarry say thatoh i am too diffident to push myself on her but would she please look me up as im too terribly alone down there in the village maya gritted her teeth oh please rescue me from these wretched peasants she means and she knew that alderscrofts subconscious would recognize her tone and the cadence of her speech as well as her words and respond to it in spite of the fact that he knew she was as common as a dustbin that was because she had the proper accent and the proper manner and everything in his upbringing and training was screaming out to his subconscious that here was gentry for one moment she hated alderscroft his automatic response to the proper turn of phrase his automatic assumption that anyone born to the strawberry leaves was one of us and deserving of special treatment and protection for one moment she hated them all and felt a powerful sympathy for the socialists and the bolsheviks and it was very tempting to think about throwing a bomb or two into the royal enclosure at ascot just to shake them up a bit certainly you could fire a cannon off through there and never hit anyone who would be missed by society but then good sense overcame her and she sighed and acknowledged that there were aristocrats who were good stewards and useful and as for the rest she forgave alderscroft and his set for being idiots and went back to paying attention to the conversation well there was one thing that being born a halfcaste in india was good for and that was in knowing what wouldnt work with the british aristocracy though she might very much like to point out to the old lion that the robinson woman had played him like salmon on her line it would do no good at all no she would simply tell alderscroft that the woman was heavily shielded and couldnt be readthat she certainly had ulterior motives for wanting that introduction and remind him of the two daughters looking for husbandsand that fenyxs own grandmother would do a much better job of keeping an eye on him than any stranger ever could and then she would go confide her real feelings to her husband peterwho would certainly at that point take them to his twin and there was no one that peter almsley did not know among the elemental mages inside the peerage almsleys grandmother who was herself a powerful elemental master almost certainly knew reggies aunt who was another and when those two heard what she had to say now maya smiled for the first time since she began listening to the conversation struck by the mental image of a herd of waterbuffalo surrounding an injured calf to protect it from a tigress the tigress had no notion of what she was about to face alison was pleased with herself despite some setbacks this trip to london had been unexpectedly productive she sat down at the little desk in the sitting room of their suite to catch up on her correspondence while the girls unpacked the days purchases mama said carolyn idly tracing the line of the fringe on the new shawl she had purchased that morning what do you know about the americans getting into the war alison looked up from the letter she was writing to warrick locke the americans have no intention of entering the war child president wilson is a pacifist if the sinking of the lusitania did not accomplish it nothing will why well carolyn persisted with a small sly smile playing about her lips its just thatyou had rather they didnt wouldnt you it would interfere greatly with my plans yes she said sharply and it would probably interfere with our income as well why do you ask she asks because shes been meeting with that american boy from the embassy in the tea room lauralee interrupted frowning with jealousy at her sister and she doesnt want to get in trouble over it so she wants to make you think shes been doing it for lauralee alison held up a warning hand first do not frown frowns do not improve your looks and cause wrinkles secondly let your sister answer for herself carolyn he is the ambassadors son carolyn protested pouting prettily in a way that alison approved and you know mama has been busy and you know weve been hearing rumors in the hotel i thought i ought to find out at first hand and it has nothing to do with the fact that hes tall and blueeyed and looks like lauralee muttered sullenly and dont allow jealousy to show lauralee alison reproved absently it gives one jowls what did the young man tell you carolyn that the president will certainly enter the war next month carolyn said in triumph hes going home to enlist so are most of the young men on the embassy staff alisons lips tightened this was no part of her plans at the moment the war was at a stalemateboth sides were worn out and weary and the conflict might well drag on for years which was very good news for the earth elementals that she favored and for her plans concerning reggie fenyx for the latter she planned more fearher elemental creatures making his life a neverending round of attacks of terroruntil the one girl who could drive them away appeared in his life at which point he would probably marry her on the spot or at least be willing to but to complete the plan she would need time time for the boy to heal physically enough to be sent home on recovery leave time for lord alderscrofts introduction to bear fruit time for her spells to work time for carolynor lauraleeto be the answer to his prayers time for him to propose and for a proper society wedding and then more time for she did not intend for him to survive the war and he would have to recover from his shellshock and go back to the air corps and if the yanks entered the war america was full of brash young men who were perfectly willing to fling themselves into combat america was wealthy within months she could turn her factories from making frying pans into making cannon and machineguns and america had immense untapped resources on her own soil she did not depend on ships to bring those resources to the factories if america entered the war it could be over within a year unless she couldnt stop them but she could add a new enemy to the equation one that should add to the attrition in the trenches and slow the number of troops coming over carolyn dear i believe that we ought to hold a little farewell dinner for all those fine young men at the embassy she said in a tone that made carolyns eyes narrow we ought to thank them for being so willing to serve invite them to a little supper tomorrow night lauralee also caught the scent of something in the air mama she began then shook her head come along carolyn lets go write invitations i think there are six or seven of them including the ambassadors son mama when you are finished writing the invitations make the supper arrangements with the savoy chef alison replied already unpacking what she needed from her trunk you should know what to do already yes mama her daughters chorused and alison smiled with content welltrained and obedient everything a mother could ask for by the time that all the arrangements were complete and the invitations sent to the embassy by messenger alison was ready her implementsdeceptively simple oneswere set out on the thick silk cloth that she used as her portable working table it already had the runes and circles of containment embroidered into it dyed with bloodhers and others she spread it out over the table they used when they dined ensuite summoned the girls doused the electric lights and lit the candles she had unpacked this may be one of the most underrated incantations in our arsenal girls she said as the two of them moved closer to stand on either side of her and yet it requires surprisingly little power especially here in the city we are going to call an earth elemental the trick to this is that you have to remember to be very specific about what you want from this entity you already know that one of the great gifts of the earth mage is to healbut the converse is also true watch with the precision of a surgeon alison placed a deceptively plain bowl made of clay dug from a graveyard and fired in the same fire as a cremation in the center of her working cloth into it she dropped a tiny bit of rotting meat she always kept some sealed in a small jar with her when she traveled and several more equally distasteful ingredients burying them all beneath a layer of dirt dug from the piles of tinwaste near a mine then she closed her eyes held her hands over the bowl and let the power flow from her into it chanting her specific invocation under her breath and concentrating with all of her might and the sullen ochercolored energies flowed out of her fingertips and into the bowl pooling there in the candlelight carolyn gasped and at that sign she opened her eyes the earth elemental standing in the nowempty bowl might not look like muchit was a squat little puttycolored nothing with the barest suggestions of limbs and a head the sort of crude and primitive object that might be found in an ancient ruin it looked utterly harmlessbut properly used it was one of the most powerful of all of the inimical earth elementals because it was one of the most insidious it was called a maledero and it brought and spread disease i need an illness she told it one that spreads in the air it should seem harmless but kill i dont want it to fell everything that catches it no more than one in four but no less than one in ten it should bring death quickly when it does kill it should lay out those it does not kill and it should be hardest not on the very young nor the very old but those in the prime of life it should spread rapidly and be impossible to stop because by the time victims are dying it should have passed on to others the puttycolored thing smiled showing a mouth full of jagged and rotting teeth while above the mouth a pair of bottomless black eyes looked at her how if it spreads through a sneeze it suggested if it be spread by any other means this might be countered she nodded ideal there will be six young men here tomorrow night for dinner before they journey homewards you will infect them and only them and you will lie dormant within them until they have ended their journey in a place where there will be thousands of young men like them then you will release yourself and be free to spread as far as you please across the whole world if you likeexcept to myself and my daughters easily done the thing croaked and itdivided right before their eyes into six identical creatures each onesixth the size of the original we pledge by the bond they chorused alison nodded and tapped the side of the bowl with her willowwand then i release from the bowl when you have infested the young men you will be released from the room she inscribed the appropriate sigils in the air where they glowed for a moment then settled over the six creatures and were absorbed when you have come to the place across the sea where thousands of young men have gathered to train as warriors she continued still inscribing the sigils of containment in the air you will be free to infect and spread as far as you please save only myself and my daughters she wrote her own glyph and those of carolyn and lauralee and the sigil of prohibition on top of those three names all this sank down to rest briefly on the little elementals before being absorbed into them the flow of power was minimalone of the reasons why this was such a useful conjuration and now you may conceal yourself within this room until the vessels have come she concluded breaking the containment with a flourish of her wand the entities gave her a mocking little bow and faded away the girls looked at her wideeyed did you justcreate a disease lauralee gaped she shrugged it is better to say that i altered one to suit our purposes it will probably be a pneumonia or influenza but when it is released it will be something quite different from any other of its kind it will certainly be bad enough to decimate the ranks of the americans long enough to keep them from winning the war in a few months and that is all that we will need she smiled at her girls who stared at her wideeyed i doubt it will kill one in four of those that are really healthy the elemental i conjured is not strong enough for that but it will cause a great deal of havoc that is something else to remember sometimes you do not need to confront your enemy directly you only need to interfere with him she began putting her supplies away neither girl offered to help as was proper she would not have allowed them they were never to touch her working materials that after all was how she had managed to get control over her teachers and now she added brightly putting the last of her equipment away and locking the little trunk in which it was kept i believe it is time we went downstairs to dine march broom warwickshire when eleanor was certain that alison and the girls were on the train to london the first thing she did was to go straight to the kitchen throw open the pantry doors and plan herself a feast brushing aside alisons magically laid prohibitions like so many cobwebs eleanor could not help but gloat she felt the barriers certainly but she was able to push right through them and the irony of it was there had never been any good reason to make the pantry offlimits while the robinsons were gone nor to restrict eleanor to the foodstuffs that alison allowed her to keep in the kitchen when they returned there were things in here that would have had to be thrown in the bin because they were spoiled that eleanor could perfectly well have eaten while the others were gone it made no sense no sense at all it was all just spite just pure meanness she surveyed the shelves and decided that she would clean out her eversimmering souppot and give it a good scrubbing before starting a new batch while she ate those things that would go bad before long and she could include the end of that ham in the soup it wasnt all cream for her though most of alisons magics still worked before she had done much more than empty out the souppot into a smaller vessel to leave on the hearth and fill the pot with soapy water the compulsions to clean struck her up the stairs she went discovering that she still had to sweep and dust air the rooms out and close them up again mop and scrub down the bathroom true she didnt have to spend as much time at it nor work quite as hard but she couldnt fight the compulsion off altogether and although she tried she discovered that she couldnt leave the house and garden either even with alison gone but after some experimentation she had the measure of the compulsions she finished everything she needed to do in the upstairs rooms by luncheon which meant that she would have the rest of the day free for herself the first thing that she did was to make herself a proper luncheon and to read while she ate it she chose a book from the library a room which had been mostly unused since her father died she ate in the library too in defiance of crumbsafter all she was the one who was going to be doing the cleaningupcurled up in her fathers favorite old chesterfield chair with her feet to the fire she built in the fireplace after she had finished eating the compulsions urged her into work briefly but she discovered that she could satisfy them merely by making a few swipes with a dustmop and the broom in each room so long as they were visibly clean by this time her souppot had soaked enough so she gave it a good scrubbing inside and out and put beans to soak in it she returned again to the library with a tray laden with teapot and the cakes that would have gone stale there to lose herself in a book until the fading light and growing hunger called her back to the kitchen and that feast she had promised herself thenluxury of luxuriesshe drew herself a hot bath and had a good long soak and a proper hairwashing baths were what she got at the kitchen sink these days and often as not in cold water she used lauralees rosewater soap knowing from experience that it was something lauralee wouldnt miss whereas if she purloined alisons spanish sandalwood or carolyns eau de nil bars they would be missed after a blissful hour immersed to the neck in hot water and an equally blissful interlude spent giving her hair the good wash she had longed for she emerged clean and scented faintly with roses her hair wasnt very long though it was unlike the girls ultrafashionable bobsalison hacked it off just below her shoulders on a regular basisso it didnt take long to dry in front of the kitchen fire she slipped a bedwarmer into her own bed to heat it while she dried her hair and after banking the fires in the kitchen and the library and making sure the stove had enough fuel to last through the night and keep the hotwater boiler at the back of it warm she went to bed at last feeling more like her old self than she had since before her father had left on that fateful trip she fell asleep at once relaxed warm and contented she hadnt expected to dream but she did and her dreams wererather odd full of fireimages of leaping flames themselves of odd halffairy creatures whose flesh glowed with fire and who had wings of flame of the medieval salamanders that were supposed to live in fires of dragons and of the phoenyx and the firebird they werent nightmares nothing like even though she found herself engulfed by fires that caressed her like sunwarmed silk in fact she found herself wearing the flames like an everchanging gown in her dreams she found these mythical beings welcoming her as a friend and in her dreams that seemed perfectly natural and right they were lovely dreams the best shed had since before alison cameand she didnt want to wake up from them the compulsions broke into those dreams jarring her awake her at dawn full of resentment she resisted them for a moment pondering those dreams while they were still fresh in her mind what on earth could they mean that they meant something she was sure and once or twice hadnt she felt a sense of familiarity about them as if the things she did and saw were calling up an echo faint and far in her memory finally she could resist the compulsions no longer for her legs began to twitch and a nasty headache started just between her eyebrows she knew those signs of old and got reluctantly out of bed to start her round of morning chores at least she was going to get more to eat this morning than a lot of tasteless porridge the sun was just coming up over the horizon and distant roosters were crowing as she began the day this was the day of the week when eleanor usually did the heavy laundry the sheets and the towels and her own clothing and there was no real reason to change her schedule usually she looked forward to the day as she often got a chance to wash up in the laundrywater though the lyesoap was harsh enough to burn if she wasnt careful she went out to the washhouse in the little shed at the back of the garden to fire up the washboiler out there a huge kettle built right into a kind of oven pump it full of cold water and add the soap she returned to the house and collected all of the linen before breakfast a glance up at the sky told her that the day was going to be fair againa good thing since it meant she could hang things out in the sunlight and wouldnt have to iron them dry with even howse gonealison wouldnt have traveled a step without her maidthere was less of the wash than usual but eleanor was feeling unusually energetic perhaps it was simply that she wasnt forced to do her work on a couple of spoonfuls of unflavored oatporridge and a cup of weak tea she actually enjoyed herself the winter had been horribly dreadfully cold and doing the household laundry had been nothing short of torture todaywell it was cold but briskly so and it was grand to have the sun on her back as she pinned up the sheets and towels by midmorning it was all washed and wrung dry and hanging up in the garden and eleanor was scrubbing the kitchen floor exactly as she usually did on washday though it wasnt often that she was done this early and that was when a knocking at the kitchen door startled her so much that she yelped and dropped the brush into her bucket of water with a splash she stared at the closed door sure that what she had heard must have been some accident of an echosomeone out in the street perhaps or knocking at one of the neighbors gates but the rapping came again brisk and insistent who could be knocking at this door surely no one knew that she was here it must be a tradesman or someone about a bill it couldnt be a delivery alison was punctilious about canceling all deliveries when she expected to be gone the old cook had been quite incensed about thatas if were of no account and can live on bacon and tinned peas while she swans about londonbut she had even done so back when the house was full of servants not that i would mind if there had been a mistake a delivery of baked goods would be jam on top of the cream the knocking came again whoever was there wasnt going away she got to her feet and slowly opened the door there was a woman thereperhaps alisons age or a little older but she was nothing like alison her graying brown hair was done up in a knot at the back of her head from which little wisps were straying friendly amberbrown eyes gazed warmly at eleanor though the focus suggested that the gaze was a trifle shortsighted her round face had both plenty of little lines and very pink cheeks she was dressed quite plainly in a heavy woolen skirt and smock with an apron rather like a local farmers wife complete with woolen shawl wrapped around herself she smiled at eleanor who found herself smiling back hello my dear the woman said in a soothing low voice that tickled the back of eleanors mind with a sensation of familiarity im sarah chase sarah chase eleanor knew that name though she had never actually met the woman sarah chase was supposedat least by the children of broomto be a witch not a bad witch thoughshe didnt live in a cobwebby old hut at the edge of the forest she lived right in the middle of broom itself in a tidy little tudor cottage literally sandwiched in between two larger buildings on the right was the swan pub and on the left the village shop any children bold enough to stand on the threshold of the door and try to peer into the heavily curtained windows never were able to see anything and the extremely public situation meant that their mothers usually heard about the adventure and they got a tonguelashing about rude behavior and nosyparkers no one in eleanors circle of friends had ever seen sarah chase in fact but here she was standing on the threshold a covered basket in one hand the other outstretched a little towards eleanor well dear the woman prompted gently arent you going to ask your godmother inside godmother her mind was still taking that in as her mouth said without any thought on her part come in godmother and the village witch stepped across the threshold and entered the kitchen like a beam of sunshine for the third time in her life eleanors life turned upside down she sat in something of a daze on a stool beside the kitchen fire where her prosaic souppot full of beans and the end of the ham simmered and listened to impossible things things which she never would have believedif her finger wasnt buried beneath the hearthstone sarah looked perfectly comfortable in the sunny kitchen with its blackened beams and whitewashed walls eleanor never even thought to invite her into the parlor but then these were not particularly discussions for the parlor eleanor was hearing for the first time that the woman her father had thought he had married was no more than a fraction of what she actually was so your father never knew of course sarah concluded never knew that your mother was a fire master or that we were such friends she and i never even knew such a thing as magic existed at all her cheeks went pinker and she gave eleanor an apologetic little shrug thats the way of it usually when one of us marries one of them them as has no magic we generally keep it to ourselves for more often than not it does no good and a great deal of harm to try and make them understand the ones with minds stuck in the world they can see are usually made very unhappy by such things either they think they have gone mad or they think their spouse has and in either case it only ends in tears and tragedy she nodded wisely like the fenyxes him and his father they have the magicor lord devlin did before he died but lady devlin shes got no more idea than a bird eleanor gaped at her this was somehow harder to believe than that her own mother had magic the fenyx family were what sarah called elemental masters sarah went right on not noticing eleanors state of shockor else determined to get out everything she needed to say without interruption so we met here of a night or of an afternoon over cups of tea as two old friends from such a small place often do and your father would look in on us and laugh and ask us if we were setting the world aright and of course we never told him that we werein small ways of course but small ways have the habit of adding up you weresetting the world aright eleanor repeated and shook her head but how a little magic here a little magic there hers more than mine you understand since im but a mere witch and she was a master but oh she would speak to the salamanders of a night and find out whose chimneys were getting overchoked with soot and id have a word with the owner of the house byandby and neil frandsen would come along and clean it and thered be no chimney fire do you see eleanor blinked again is that the plumber mr frandsen the man that cleans chimneys with a shotgun sarah threw back her head and laughed oh aye but less often then than he does now im afraidhe was nimbler when he was young now he dont like to go atop the houses much but you see what we did and there was other thingsnever a housefire have we had hereabouts once she came into her powers nor a barnfire and no accidents with fire either if a cottagers baby tumbled into a fire it tumbled right back out again with just enough scorching on his smock to make his mama take better heed no fires from a coal hopping out no curtains blowing into candles nor gasflames sometimes it isnt so much doing things thats important as it is keeping them from happening she sighed i remember how she used to put you in your cradle next to the fire or once you were old enough just on a blanket no worries youd be burned of coursethe salamanders used to frisk and play around you and youd laugh and try to catch them with your little hands clear enough it was youd taken after her and thenshe died she drowned eleanor whispered and shuddered all her life the one thing shed been afraid of was water sarah nodded the enemy element sarah said sadly the element that hates hers the river flooded you see and to this day i dont know if it was accident or an enemy she could have told me butwell the river flooded and washed out the bridge as she was trying to get across to get home to you her allies had no power to save her and your father well he couldnt bear to look upon me who was her close friend so i stayed away and you seemed to be flourishing and i heard about you going up to university and all and i thought well well enough ill leave her be and when she starts to come into her power ill send to the fire masters whove people at oxford and theyll take on the teaching of you so much more clever than i those dons and scholars but she came eleanors voice cracked then she came sarahs voice hardened my element but a master more powerful than me and better connected by far in magic as in everything else its who you know that gets you places and what youve got sarah grimaced shes trusted by them as should know better but dont theres no help thereyet i could no more stand against her than your mother could stand against the flood but you are coming into your powers and i can set your feet on the right path and you can break her if you grow strong enough and this is where i can make a start she got up out of the chair where she was sitting and walked over to the hearth she stared down at the hearthstones for a moment then bent and traced a symbol with her index finger on one it glowed for a moment a warm lovely goldenamber before sinking into the stone blast her sarah muttered under her breath shes stronger than i thought what eleanor asked its a spell that will answer to fire as well as earth its what she did to bind you here i know a counter that will work within her spell to free you from this house and hearth for a few hours at a time though you wont be able to go farther than say longacre the witch said youll have to learn how to work magic of your own to make her spell answer to you how to bend it to your will for a littlewell start you learning fire magic now if youre ready but definitely before she comes back isarah i dont know this all seems so she was going to say impossible to believe but at exactly that moment something looked at her out of the hearthfire she looked back feeling her eyes widen as she recognized the fieryeyed lizard of her dreams well and there you are sarah said with triumph following her startled glance salamander sure sign of you coming into your powers no matter what shes done you can see it too she asked incredulously well of course i can see the elementals and if they feel like it they might help me out but i cant command them not even earth im not a master sarah said wistfully eleanor thought but you can command the ones of fire because youre a fire master youll have their respect and because of your mother you already have their loyalty and the only way youd lose that would be to do something they didnt like what do you mean ihave their loyalty eleanor asked incredulously hold out your hand sarah replied to the fire i mean youll see dubiously eleanor did so and before she could pull away with surprise that same something leapt out of the flames and began twining around her hands like a friendly ferret it looked like a lizard made of flame and it felt like sunwarmed silk slithering through her fingers and around her wrists its not burning me she gasped staring at the creature in fascination and ill wager youve never been burned in your life sarah replied triumphantly have you only eleanor began then stopped she had been going to say only when carolyn cauterized my finger but then she realized that she had not actually been burned not even then the bleeding had been stopped and the wound sealed but no more and it hadnt been a burn that had caused her so much pain it had been the wound itself and the fever that followed ah i havent she admitted watching the salamander weave around her outstretched fingers whatwhat does all this mean she asked at last that i need to begin teaching you what i can and there is no time like the present unless you had something planned sarah tilted her head to the side a garden party perhaps that brought a smile to eleanors face and a rueful shrug so long as my stepmother isnt here we must take advantage of that let your friend go back to his fire and well begin by nightfall eleanor knew a hundred times more about magic than she had before sarah knocked on the door she knew about casting circles of protection and containment a little about summoning and something about the elementals of her own element although the only one she had seen as yet was the little salamander the weakest of the lot and she was far more tired than she would have thought likely it wasnt as if shed been working after all just sitting and walking about the kitchen nothing more it takes it out of you sarah said solemnly as the two of them worked on a little supper in the evening gloom and youre lucky that woman is of another element or shed know when you were working as shed be able to cut you off from your power as it is shes strong enough to bind you and command you by this point eleanor had gotten well past the suspension of disbelief and was at the point where she would have accepted the presence of an invisible second moon in the sky if sarah had insisted it was there part of this was due to fatigue but most of it was simply that she had taken in so many strange things that her mind was simply fogging over why am i so tired she asked setting down plates on the kitchen table while sarah ladled soup into bowls and cut slices of bread for both of them because the power youve been using to cast circles and all has to come from you yourself lovey sarah replied eleanor frowned and rubbed her temple with the back of her wrist but i thought magic just wasmagic something out of nothing you mean sarah laughed not likely my girl the only time you get power at no cost to you is when your elementals grant it to you or you take it from someone else and ill give you a guess where your stepmother gets much of hers from eleanor sat down in her chair shell be back in a day or twoand what will i do then she asked how am i going to see you or keep learning it was a good question what would she do she was kept busy from dawn to dark and then some how could she ever get time to continue learning and practicing does she lock the doors sarah asked youll wait until the house is asleep and then youll draw the glyph and bend her spell and come to me for an hour or two she smiled slyly you do the cooking dont you well one advantage of being a mere witch is that i dont rely on power to do everything ill give you some things to put in their food that will send them to bed early on the nights youre to come and keep them there asnoring and theyll be nothing the wiser eleanor blinked is that safe she asked dubiously i mean what if theytaste it or something they wont and ill have a charm on it to make sure they eat enough of it to do what i want sarah seemed quite confident that she could do exactly what she claimed eleanor wasnt nearly as confidentbut then she didnt have anything to lose by trying either now you eat sarah continued so you get your energy back and well practice those shields and wards again eleanor sighed and applied herself to her food she wanted to protest she hadnt had a moment to herself all day when she hadnt been learning the shields and wards that sarah thought were so important and which didnt seem very much like magic to her shed been taking in the laundry putting it away and tidying up she had been so looking forward to another afternoon in the librarybut the promise that she might be able to break herself free of alisons magic was so tempting that she hadnt so much as whispered a complaint as if she had heard all those thoughts sarah looked up from her dinner and smiled at her i know its hard my dear she said in a kindly voice cruel hard on you it is but im having to teach you the hard way to bring up the protections and take them down without leaving a trace for your wretched stepmother to find until you can do that you darent even try to work magic here for she will know and that will be no good thing at all eleanor shuddered at the idea of her stepmother discovering such a thing and you should shiver sarah said noting it do believe me in that it would be very very bad for you she would bind you in so many spells that you would scarcely be able to walk without being under compulsion and i should not be able to do a thing about them never forget that she is a master and until you have mastery of your own she can bind you by that finger beneath the hearthstone to whatever she wills eleanor glanced over at the hearth and shuddered again i wont forget she said quietly then eat the witch replied and well work tonight until youre too tired to carry on and so they did though to her credit sarah chase helped with the washing up before they did over and over again eleanor spun out the cinnamontasting warmred power of the element of fire from the crackling blaze on the hearth and built it into an arching dome around herself then sent the power back into the hearth and erased all traces of the energy from the very air around her she wondered now why she had never noticed the power before this though although it was easier to see amid the flames of the real fire there were wisps of it everywhere like the last breath of fog above the grass on a spring morning or the trailing bits of smoke above a chimney there were other colors of power there too now that she knew what to look for a warm amber glow that was somehow as sweet as honey that seemed to surround sarah chase like sunlight a hint here or there of a thread of blue or a flicker of greenbut none of them called to her as that scarlet flame did there were several salamanders in the hearthfire by now and she felt their presence as a friendly and encouraging warmth that helped her when she faltered right up to the point at which she ran out of energy altogether and simply sat right down on the hearth and looked up at the witch with pleading in her eyes i cant she said plaintively i ah then were finished for now sarah exclaimed the one thing your mother always told me is that fire is the most dangerous of the elements handle it carelessly at your peril is what she said she did eleanor glanced at the hearth three little salamanders coiled quietly amid the flames and blinked slow and sleepy eyes at her they didnt look dangerous but then neither did a bull until you got into the field and it charged you she did sarah offered her hand eleanor took it and the witch pulled her to her feet with surprising strength you sit at the table for a moment until youre feeling livelier then get yourself to your bed ill be back tomorrow at the same time unless shes come back by then and in that casewell ill leave you a note in the washhouse oh and any time yon salamanders want to frisk about you let them theyll do a bit of slow healing on you when they do give them a month maybe two and theyll heal those scullerymaids hands of yours eleanor nodded of all the places in and around the arrows that sarah could get to the washhouse was the safest to leave any such thing alison hadnt so much as set foot in it in all the time shed lived here now ill let myself out dont get up sarah concluded cheerfully maybe have yourself a cup of tea and a bit of toast before you go to bed she picked up her basket wrapped her shawl around her shoulders and suited her actions to her words slipping out into the nightshrouded garden and closing the door after herself eleanor simply sat and looked back at the hearthfire again the salamanders were still there still watching her reminding her of nothing so much as a tangle of kittens if kittens could be made of flames why didnt i ever see you before she wondered aloud she was shocked to her bones when the one in the middle raised its head looked straight at her and answered her because she was there and you had not fought her power just a touch of scorn came into the creatures tone why should we show ourselves to one who would not fight for her own freedom it was a good question but i thought that i had she replied slowly all three of them shook their heads negatively hating someone is not fighting them the middle one pointed out you pushed but pushing is not fighting and you gave up too soon yesterday you fought that was good if you fight we will help but remember that if earth can smother fire fire also can consume earth before she could say or ask anything else the salamanders faded into the flames and were gone march london the one disadvantage of being in london was that even the meals at the savoy were subject to rationing and shortages however if one was forced to pay lipservice to rationing and shortages at least the savoy had excellent chefs who could make a great deal out of very little while breakfast was something of a disappointment when compared to the same meal served three years ago it was still superior to virtually anything being served anywhere else in the city still as alison regarded her plate with mild disapproval and wishedfor just this moment of the day anywaythat she were back in broom the thought of her wellstocked pantry brought something else to mind this was the first time that alison and the girls had stayed in london so long since the cook had left eleanor was certainly breakfasting on crusts by now the thought made her smile a little the wretched girl was such a source of unnecessary complication that not even her usefulness as a servant outweighed it after breakfast as howse put the finishing touches on her hair alison wondered briefly if she ought to do something about the girl back in broom it wouldnt do for her to starve and all alone for so long was it possible she might be able to get into mischief would anyone think to check the house and find her then she dismissed the thought the girl had plenty of food in the way of potatoes turnips dried beans and black bread and she couldnt get out of the house and garden no one knew she was there alone so no one would come looking for her in fact alison was not entirely sure anyone in broom still remembered her except vaguely other concerns occupied broom now as they occupied most of britain there wasnt a family in broom that didnt have at least one member fighting wounded maimed or dead most had several fully half the jobs in broom that had once been taken by men were now being filled by women on consideration alison doubted very much that anyone in the village ever thought about eleanor even to wonder what had happened to her besides there were a great many things that could be done here that could not be done in broom warrick locke was very useful with his blackmarket connections enabling her to get hold of all manner of goods that were otherwise unobtainable having them shipped home in discreet parcels marked as hessian beans or oats or other things that were not in short supply and it was not only convenient to meet her solicitor here it was safer there were no prying eyes noting how often the man came to see her and how long he stayed meetings that happened too often made tongues wag in broom and she had the image of a respectable widow to maintain if she was to remain the top of the social pyramid not that the thought of taking locke as a lover ever crossed her mind if she ever took a lover and that was not likely it would be someone who she could not buy with other coin and the situation would have to have a great deal of advantage in it for her mindonce she got access to the social circles of longacre park and the hallwell that was for the future and warrick was still very useful in fact she had a meeting scheduled with him this morning at a workingclass pub where no one knew either of them so long as no zepps or aeroplanes appeared to drop bombs on southwark things should go smoothly she frowned into her mirror again as howse handed her the neat mauve velvet hat she wanted and she pinned it on one true disadvantage of being in londonit was within range of the huns zeppelins and planes that was an annoyance though alison was sure enough of her power that she was not concerned that she would fall victim to a hun bomb but bombing raids threw such terror into the populace that getting around in the vicinity of one afterwards was a great trial and one not compensated for by the abundance of energies released by death and fear afterwards she took herself downstairs after warning the girls to remain in the hotel since the american boys had left and her girls didnt find walking or taking the bus or underground amusing even carolyn was inclined to obey without an argument there were plenty of officers frequenting the tearoom and bar of the savoy if they wished to flirt all they had to do was go downstairs since alison had arranged last night with the concierge to procure a taxi there actually was one waiting for her without the need for magic though the ancient cabby looked at her a bit oddly when she gave the address he made no comment the taxi deposited her on the doorstep of the pub without incident although the arrival of the taxi itself caused a little stir among the local loungers these days it was not the usual thing to see a taxi in southwark locke was waiting for her however and escorted her into the pub and a private parlor he had arranged for as per her request and the shortlived moment of interest faded once they were inside the private parlor was quite small scarcely larger than the booth whose highbacked seats framed a window that didnt appear to have been washed for a decade and looked as if it dated back at least two hundred years the wood of the walls and the booth itself was nearly black with age but the place was comfortable enough they placed an order for luncheon fish and chips seemed to be the only thing that was available as the girl said apologetically over and over sorry miss rationing robbies got my motor car locke announced as she settled herself in the ancient leather of the seat ill have him drop you either back at the hotel or somewhere across the river where you can get another taxi as you prefer she nodded now what was it you wanted to see me about personally she asked with some suspicion if its about those american boys at the embassy theyve gone locke shook his head his thick glasses glinted in the dim light his poor eyesight was what had saved him from the front he was the next thing to blind without his spectacles and though he might have been accepted at this point had he volunteered he was hardly inclined to do so no one even gave him so much as a sour look with his disability so clear for anyone to see and he saw no reason to throw his life away in the trenches for which alison was grateful it would have been impossible to find another solicitor she could have let in on her secrets much less one as wellconnected in fact if he was ever called up in despite of his eyesight she had a little plan in mind to take out his foot or his knee thus rendering him completely useless as a soldier it would be easy enough to find someone who would shatter a kneecap for a few pounds she hadnt given up all of her old contacts when shed married robinson she hadnt told locke about her plan of course he wouldnt have been pleased even if it allowed him to escape conscription that is she didnt think hed take such a plan well but you never knew he might have had a plan of his own like shooting himself in the foot that one not only got you out of being conscripted it got many a man out of the trenches and home robbie christopher his hired man had gotten off by virtue of the fact that he could dislocate both shoulders at will the trick had not only come in handy for escaping conscription but for escaping police custody in the past robbie was extremely useful to locke and not just as a driver and lifter of heavy objects robbie liked fires locke sometimes arranged them robbie liked hearing other peoples bones break locke went places where his slight frame would attract unwelcome attention without someone like robbie around and it would not have surprised alison at all to learn that locke also arranged for robbie to break other peoples bones for a consideration locke was clever enough to fix things so that robbie could enjoy his favorite pastimes without being caught it was a profitable partnership no doubt no i wanted to tell you in person that ive found a loophole in the law regarding your inheritance problem and i cannot believe that i didnt think of it sooner locke told her with an air of triumph all we have to do is to arrange for the girl to be rendered incapable of taking care of herself in some permanent way and when shes twentyone the entire estate will be assigned to whoever is her guardian and caretaker since you have been her guardian all this time that will be you and that wretched solicitor who is the trustee of her fortune will have no more to say about it alison smiled slowly what would you suggest she asked locke laughed and leaned back one arm cast carelessly along the back of his side of the booth they shared my first thought was to drive her mad of course he replied since we wouldnt want the unwelcome inquiries that an accident might cause and you certainly wouldnt want to leave her still capable of speaking for herself so that lets out breaking her back youre an earth master you ought to have enough nasty beasties at your beck and call to do that the fact that shes got powers herself means shell see them doesnt it alison frowned slightly there are a great many hobgoblins and wraiths that would do she admitted but i dont like to use them theyre expensive in terms of power perhaps some other way he shrugged we have a year to plan it out we should be able to think of something arent there poisons that make one mad i seem to recall something about hatters hmm mercury i think alison tapped her cheek with one perfectly manicured nail finding a dose that wouldnt kill her could be a problem a very nasty smile crept over lockes face you know he said leaning over the table and lowering his voice to almost a whisper there arethe illnesses that one doesnt talk about in polite societythat do the same thing he raised an eyebrow i could arrange for thatif you could arrange for the disease to act rather more swiftly than it usually does alison stared at him for a moment then suppressed smile of her own now that is an interesting thought especially if i were to lodge a complaint with the police that she had run away perhaps with a soldier and she was to be brought back home by you very publicly and in aless than pristine state locke spread his hands wide sad thing but an old story these days he said sheltered little countrygirl handsome fellow and til marry you when i come home but why should we wait men are such cads and she neednt even actually leave the house alison said thoughtfully carolyn bundled in a cloak could stand in for her when you return her no one would think twice about her not wanting to show her face after such a disgrace the only thing i can think of that would cause a problem isshe still is showing signs of coming into her power as a fire mage isnt she locke asked and the nearer she gets to twentyone the harder it will be to keep her suppressed distressingly true mind you ive seen no signs no signs at all that shes coming into any significant power only that she isnt ever burned no matter what she does around fire alison replied and pursed her lips still all the more reason not to use magic to drive her mad much better to use something purely physical locke shrugged its all one to me one will be expensive in magical coin the other in real money ill have to find the proper man and it will have to be someone who wouldnt be missed because when the job is over if we want to keep things quiet robbie will have to take care of him well robbie would enjoy that wouldnt he she smiled silkily and we always like to give robbie his little pleasures locke returned her smile he is such a loyal employee and he asks so little in return for so much deciding to proceed with caution alison elected to have robbie drop her at victoria station and took a taxi back to the savoy she was glad that she had there was a messenger waiting for her in the lobby and the packet he handed to her in return for her signature was sealed with lord alderscrofts signet although she was impatient to see what was inside she gave no outward sign she tucked it under her arm and took it upstairs this was not just simple caution the moment she touched the seal she had known it was not just a physical protection against prying so whatever lay within would be rendered unreadable if the seal was broken without the magical component being properly released not the wisest thing to do in a public place the girls were at the window of the sittingroom putting charms on passersby in the street below they had moved on from simple lustcharms she noted with approval that they were also distributing anger depression and quarrelsomeness with an even hand not all the charms took of course but every failure was a lesson in what not to door who not to do it to there were those who had mere touches of magic about them who were never touched by such things it was best to learn to recognize such people so that if one had to curse them one would know to use a stronger spell seeing that they were gainfully occupied alison moved to the little writingdesk and opened the envelope first tracing the countersigil on the seal so that the contents would remain intact she never failed to feel amused at how those foolish men with their silly white lodge refused to let her past the public rooms of their little club because she was female they were like schoolboys with their no girls allowed signsor cavemen superstitiously afraid of the unclean woman as she had hoped the letter contained the dossier of the woman she was to impersonate alison stanley of the northumberland branch of the stanleys had died when the hospital ship britannia on which she was a nurse had been torpedoed but because no one had printed a new edition of burkes since the war began she would still be listed as living early in the war the casualty lists had been suppressed so only alison stanleys immediate circle would be aware she was dead alison nodded with satisfaction the northern stanleys were as poor as church mice for all their pedigree what little income they got went straight into trying to keep the roof on their ancient barn of a manor house patched and no one from longacre would ever have met any of them lord alderscroft gave her the particulars of her family it was numerous and she was going to have to memorize it all later and he enclosed a letter of introduction to reggies mother that made her smile widen i have written her ladyship myself he said in his covernote telling her about my cousin who was supposed to have married a fellow called robinson down there in or around broom and asking if shed heard of you and if she had would she look you up to see that you were all right the rest is up to you reginald isnt likely to be discharged until may at the earliest so you should have time to establish yourself before hes brought to longacre she laughed silently if alderscroft only knew how he was setting a fox to guard the hens however she rested her chin on her hand for a moment as a complication occurred to her whatever she did to eleanor it would have to wait she could not afford a scandal before she got one of the girls safely married to reggie afterwardswell these things happened to the best of families these days and at any rate eleanor was not strictly speaking related in any way to her or her girls the fenyx family would move heaven and earth to keep things hushed up it was the way these things worked after all soplans for wretched ellie must go to simmer it wouldnt matter alison would get what she wanted in the end she always had no matter who was in her way at night once all the visitors were gone but before most of the men fell asleep was the easiest time of reggies day that was when freed perhaps by the dim light and the first fuzziness of opiates freed by being just one more whisper in the dark the men talked openly among themselves of what they would not tell anyone else there was a new patient in the bed to reggies right a cavalry officer with an empty sleeve pinned against the breast of his pajamas he had stared at the ceiling all day saying nothing not even whimpering when his dressings were changed now suddenly he spoke dont you think its a relief he said with surprising clarity still staring at the ceiling reggie thought do i think what is a relief but the man continued before he could ask the question finallyno more ruddy show for the folks back home no pretending its all beer and skittles and no one ever gets hurt not that they dont know of course because they do but you have to pretend anyway no reckoning how much life youre going to pack into a ninetysix hour leave cause it might be the last one you get while pretending its nothing much no more careful letters that dont let on no more wondering if youre going to do a funk its over the worst has happened he did sound relieved reggie swallowed his mouth gone dry maybe for his neighbor the worst had happened that parts a relief someone else agreed out there in the dimness no more guns someone else moaned all day and all nightpounding pounding pounding ah said reggies neighbor in an undertone fbi idve done a funk six weeks ago if id been fbi reggie turned his head took in the neat moustache and what he could see of the other mans remaining hand and made a guess cavalry he suggested the other finally turned his head and looked at reggie most useless waste of man and horseflesh on gods own earth the other agreed and though the voice was cheerful the bleak expression on the mans face gave it the lie should have put my horse on a guncarriage and me in a trench all we existed for was to be shot to pieces all they could think to do with us was send us across the wire again and again and let the machine guns have us reggie winced the cavalry had not fared well in the war and the face on the pillow of the bed next to his was behind its brave moustache disturbingly young my brothers fbi told me enough about it before he caught it that i knew i wouldnt last a day the youngster continued thought since i was a neckandnothing rider id try the cavalry i he concluded bitterly was an idiot all a man on a horse is out there is a grand target but the worst is over reggie suggested echoing the young mans own words oh yes the worst is over the young man sighed with a suggestion of a groan in it if i keep telling myself that i should start believing it soon he blinked owlishly at reggie then looked back up at the ceiling another moment and his eyelids drooped and he fell asleep out in the ward the whispering went on watched that gas coming closer and closer couldnt move didnt dare had a machine gun above us to get anybody that bolted that took out two of my men that tried one minute passing me a smoke the next head gone arm sticking out of the trench wall men used to give it a handshake as they went past sweet jesus the smell if i can just get it out of my nose for a minute the smell reggie repeated with complete understanding no one who had not been in the trenches understood what that meant he hadnt not really until hed been buried in a bunker one part the stink of aged mustard gas one part stagnant water one part rat urine for the rats were everywhere and only a gas attack got rid of them one part unwashed human body for what was the point of washing when you were standing kneedeep in stagnant water and one part dead and rotting human flesh when somebody died you gathered up as much as you could of him to burybut sometimes your trenches were dug across an old burialfield or sometimes when a bomb or a barrage had hit the trench directly there were so many bits scattered about that you just cleaned up what you could and dumped what might remain after the stretcherbearers left into a hole it wasnt the first time that reggie had heard a story like the hand and arm sticking out of a trenchwall soon enough you got numb to seeing things like that especially if you were in the fbi but that stink never left you it got in your nose in your hair lodged in your memory until you couldnt draw a free breath anymore yet his exposure it had been so briefmany of the officers in this ward had lived with it for weeks months maybe they got used to it maybe they just got numb to it know what the real relief is not having to bloody lie to the boys anymore that was another new voice a tired tired voice from the other side of his new neighbor reggie got himself up on his elbow and peered through the gloom it was indeed a new manolder than reggie old enough to have been reggies father in fact oh god he thought in sudden recollection theyve raised the conscription age to fifty havent they one eye was bandaged in fact half his head was bandaged on that side and his shoulder as well i mean the man continued doggedly theyre just kids and they believe you when you tell them that bunk about one more push over the top and on to berlin they tell you to tell it to these kids and you do and you know youre lying to them that youre all going over the top and nothing is going to change except that half of them arent going to be in the trench when you scramble back cod how i hate the lying there were uncomfortable murmurs but no one disagreed with him what was treason to say on the front was of little matter in the ward what was the war department going to do anyway line up a lot of men with empty sleeves and empty pantlegs and shoot them especially when they were only telling the truth insanity pure insanitythe generals at the rear giving the same orders over and over and over again regardless of the fact that all those orders did was to kill a few thousand men and maim a few thousand more without winning back an inch of ground reggie lay back down and stared at the ceiling himself seeing the future stretching on bleak and full of death he had the sudden notion that this was never going to end not until the generals found there was no one to put in the trenches but toddlers and senile old men or until one side or another found some weapon so vile so destructive that it would sweep from the western front to the eastern front in a path of lunatic carnage leaving nothing alive on the entire continent and he no longer had the illusion that such a weapon if found would not be used give a man who saw his fellow men as markers on a board such a weapon and he would use it and damn the consequences and there were plenty such men on both sides of this conflict im tired said the man who had said he hated lying i want but neither reggie nor anyone else was ever to find out what he wanted for he suddenly shivered all over so that the bed rattled and then lay terribly still a deathly quiet settled over the ward a quiet in which reggie heard a steady thumping as of distant thunder the sound of the guns across the channel carried on the wind someone cleared his throat poor bastard said someone else in a voice of detached pity hes out of it now maybe reggie began then kept the rest of what he would have said behind his teeth and listened to the barrage falling somewhere somewhereout in the darkness eventually the nurse made her rounds discovered the death and an orderly brought screens to put up around the bed that had never made sense to reggie what difference did screens make everyone knew the poor blighter was dead the presence of the screens only confirmed that a metal frame and a bit of cloth was not going to create the illusion that he was still alive a vad girl put out all of the lamps but the one at her dutystation and reggie steeled himself for the night night was the worst night when the ward closed in around him when the men drifted off into drugged slumber and there was no one conscious to talk he wasnt supposed to get morphia to sleep but it was the only way he could sleep because those horrible things that had tormented him had come in the dark and even though he didnt have magic to attract them anymore he lay in fear that they would come for him anyway that they would know him without magic and come for him theyd come out of the shadows and surround him and take him back under the ground under the stifling ground and the torture would begin again the long thin fingers dry and rustling that had clutched at his throatthe heavy leaden weight pressing down on his chestthe lidless glowing eyes in the darknessthe fetid ooze that had dripped into his face from mouths with swollen tongues protruding from between stained brown teeth he clutched the blanket with both hands and stared at the ceiling willing his eyes to stay open unable to move as he had been unable to move then completely paralyzed his heart pounded like the distant guns shaking him the vad girl passed and looked at him he tried to open his mouth to ask for help for water for anything to keep her there for a precious few moments but his body no longer answered to him he couldnt scream couldnt speak couldnt even whisper fear flooded him there was nothing in his world but fear and the darkness the darkness that was slowly eroding that last circle of light at the end of the ward and when it was gone they would come and they would take him as they had always wanted to do or worse the nurse would think he was dead she would tell the orderlies and they would come and take him away and put him still living and unable to show it in the ground and then then with a sudden spasm he could breathe again and move the fear recedednot much but enough for relief with an effort he threw the memories off and stared fixedly at a wavering spot on the ceiling cast by the dim lamp they werent here the wights the wraiths the goblins of the earth they werent here they could never find him he had nothing about himself to tell them where he was he wasnt an elemental mage anymore they couldnt touch him they couldnt see him they couldnt find him it was magic that called them and he had given his up burned it out walled it away he had no magic nothing for them to find and without that to call them they wouldnt find him no matter what those lipless mouths had whispered into his ear in the dark of that buried bunker so he kept telling himself shivering under his blanket long past the time when the orderlies came and took away the body on a stretcher and carried off the screens long past the time when a new groaning body was placed in the newly changed bed right into the moment when gray dawn began to creep across the windows and then only then could he let go his hold and fall senseless into exhausted slumber march broom warwickshire eyes narrowed in concentration eleanor knelt in front of the kitchen fire and stared at the hearthstone directly before her willing the symbol that she knew was magically embedded there to appear as she did so she felt a thin trickle of power flowing from her to it a sensation that was unsettlingly like blood flowing from a wound this was the first time she had dared try anything with the spell binding her to the house every time she meddled with one of alisons spells in order to bend it even a little and change the conditions by which it held she got this sensation sarah said it was because she wasnt yet able to get power from outside herself the spells guarding the pantry were weak easy to bend enough that she could walk through them just by sheer willpower because alison had not troubled herself about them very much because this particular piece of magic had been laid using her flesh blood and bone it was one of the strongest spells in the house and if she actually broke it no matter how far away her stepmother was alison would feel the backlash and know what had happened she had asked sarah why they couldnt simply dig up the stone and destroy the finger or what was left of it but sarah had blanched dont even think of trying that the witch had said earnestly it would kill both of us the layers of protection she has on that stone would fell a charging elephant its not like in a fairy tale child where all you need do is find the thing and be rid of it no magician worth his salt would put his major spells in place without protections that left the difficult task of insinuating around the protections and the spell itself of twisting and distorting the original spell to give eleanor more freedom until the spell snapped back to its original form sarah could show eleanor how to work the magic that would lengthen eleanors invisible chain for a few hours but eleanor was going to have to learn how to actually perform the magic for herself her shielding circle of protection was small just big enough to hold her and the stone it was a good thing she wasnt claustrophobic she could actually feel the boundaries of the circle pressing in on her there must be something missing here why cant i finish this thing she stared down at the stone and tried to remember what had let her get into the pantry iwas angry would that help she let some of her anger and impatience trickle down into it along with the power and that turned the trick the first hints of a sullen glow appeared on the dull grainy surface of the rock then the glyph came slowly to life as if painted in lines that burned with malevolence she knew now it would make her ill merely to touch it with a finger fortunately she wouldnt have to with twigs of oak ash and thorn bound together into a wand she traced the lines of the glyphand the closer she got to the end of her tracing the harder it was physically to move the wand the more the nasty thing faded back into the stone blurring it was as if the air had become thick and gluey and the stone itself was trying to take hold of the end of the wand and keep it from moving any further the last few fractions of an inch took all her strength the moment she finished the tracing all resistance to her movement vanished the glowing glyph evaporated and she bent over her own knees panting with exertion her arms trembled and ached and she felt as if she had been trying to push sisyphuss stone up the hill in hell but it was worth the effortfor a few hours at least she would be free to leave the house now she took the sprig of rosemary that she had plucked from the garden broke it in half and laid half of it on the stone putting the other half inside her bodice where she could smell it for as long as the rosemary was unwithered she would be free of the spell the withering of the two sprigs of herb would be her signal that she had about a quarterhour to get back inside the boundaries set about the house sarah had not been able to tell her what would happen if she didnt get back in time i know youll be pulled back and all i can say she had opined is that youll regret it for fair thinking about her stepmothers temper and her pleasure in the pain of others eleanor decided that she didnt want to chance it tucking the wand into a pocket along the seam of her skirt where it would be hidden she dispelled her protective circle and stood up well done said sarah sounding quite pleased now since youve done this for the first time youll be fair useless for magic todayso what would you like to be doing but how am i going to learn anything she began feeling alarm sarah shushed her shaking her head dont get yourself in a pother after this twill be much easier each time you free yourself youve made the spell answer to your will now youve put your bit of a brick in the door it cant entirely close now dye see she nodded she did see thensarah can we get help somehow she swallowed hard if only someone would believe her in the village but sarah shook her head theres no magicians in the village at all but me and no one else is going to see past the spells shes got in place about you to keep people from recognizing you or believing you she bit her lower lip well someone who was completely shielded would but my dearsomeone with that sort of shielding would be a master those spells were set with your blood too and i dont know where or how eleanor closed her eyes for a moment to swallow down her bitter disappointment i dont remember anything she admitted you wouldnt she probably set them outside the house with the rags she used to clean up the kitchen after she took off your finger sarah said otherwise people wouldnt be thinking that youre up at oxford alisons set the spell to make anyone as sees you think youre some daft little servant girl she got through some charity place thats what the servants we used to have thought she said slowly so even if i could make people understand what im saying to them they are still going to think im mad if she hadnt spent the last three years in complete misery she might have been thrown into despair by this crushing of her hopes well look at me she laughed bitterly because no one would ever have recognized the old eleanor robinson pampered and petted in the workworn shabby creature she was now even without a spell no one would know me people dont look past clothing much do they sarah shook her head im sorry love no they dont she doesnt need a spell to make you look like a scullery maid does she eleanor felt the sting of tears in her eyes and rubbed at them angrily with the back of her hand this was a lesson in humility she hadnt thought she needed and yetwhen she thought of all the times she had looked right past anyone who was dressed as a low servant expecting only to hear at most a lowvoiced and humble morning miss paying no attention whatsoever to anything else that might come out of that persons mouth oh she had plenty of excuses for herself that she couldnt help how shed been brought up that even the old vicar had on occasion preached sermons about knowing ones place yes but just because you were taught something didnt make it right she looked down at her workworn hands they were a bit better now knuckles not quite so swollen cracks healing but she would never lose the muscle and the callus and have dainty ladys hands again she might as well be one of them now because that was what she looked like and that was what everyone who saw her would think she was servants the lower classes inconsequential to be silent until spoken to never to venture an opinion much less disagree with what their betters said of course they were too ignorant to know what was good for them that was why god had placed others in authority over them wasnt it and the hierarchy of master over servant didnt end there of course because the servants themselves had their own hierarchy of greater and lesser each class lording it over the one beneath and on what justification because you were born into a particular family gad sarah why dont they all rise up in the night and slit our throats she cried looking up sarah didnt seem at all confused by the outburst im told she said dryly thats what theyre doing in roosha so the papers say so mad ross says she was distracted for a moment ross ashley is still here in the village trying to make us all socialists even before the war ross had been notorious in broom with his membership in the clarion cycling club his socialist pamphlets and lectures going about the country on his bicycle and standing up on soapboxes at church fetes and country fairs and singing the red flag at the top of his lungs at every opportunity sarah nodded half wryly half in sympathy oh aye got conscripted like everyone else discharged last year lost half his left hand when his rifle exploded and lucky it didnt take all of it and his face too got a quarter interest in a bicycle shop now with alan vocksmith alans rifle blew up too he lost an eye the distraction served its purpose she lost that first hot rush of anger she looked up at sarah setting her jaw if i can ever break this magic maybe ill help him she said but first i have to break free that you do sarah stood up and brushed off her apron lets make the first start her first feeling when she walked out of the garden gate was of disbelief combined with a rush of such elation that she felt giddy she had not been outside of those walls for so long that the commonplace street seemed as exotic as timbuktu she was free at long last she was free free to stand on the street free to wander where she wanted free to but as she looked up and down the streetand just across the street from the garden gate where the largest of the village pubs stoodshe got the feeling that something was not right but what was it wait she said to sarah standing beside the garden wall staring around her trying to identify what it was that made the familiar street seem so unfamiliar there were no children playing but that was scarcely it first of all it was cold again overcast and raw and second it was a school day little ones wouldnt be outside on a nasty day like this no it wasnt the absence of children then suddenly as the postman came around the corner and she saw not trousers but a skirt a postwoman she understood with a hideous feeling of shock what it was that was bothering her there were no men there were no men anywhere to be seen not opening up the pub not making deliveries not making repairs not carrying the post and suddenly all those notices in the papers that she read without really understanding them became solid and real in her mind conscription age dropped to seventeen conscription age raised to fifty no deferments for only sons for fathers of young children for students no deferment for religious objections no deferments except for what the war department considered to be vital work in the national interest and severe physical impairment go to war or go to prison that was your choice england was a nation of women now sprinkled with old men boys and those whose wounds were too serious too incapacitating to allow them back into the army she followed sarah numb feeling a kind of cold chill creeping over her as she passed the small street of the shops and saw women behind the counters women making the deliveries and in the shopsthe butcher shop had hardly anything on display most of the bread in the bakery was the same heavy rye and oat bread that she ate and there were more bare places in the tiny grocery than there were goods when she contrasted those shelves with the ones in alisons cellar and pantry she was appalled where was alison getting her treats not in broom everywhere there was a kind of emotional pall that had nothing to do with the weather it was as if there was no hope anymore in broom but for all of that the little talk that she overheard was not about the war not about the lost loved ones that bleak december when her father had died that was all that anyone could talk about who had gone where they were that the war would surely soon be over hushed whispers about the slaughter at mons and other places with glances over the shoulder as if to talk of such things would bring disaster down upon ones own loved ones or as if it were treasonous to even suggest that things were not going well teas and entertainments were being planned for boys in training at nearby camps there was talk of volunteer work of parties to knit scarves and roll bandages there was none of that now just sharpvoiced complaints about the price of butter and the impossibility of getting sugarof having to make do on thin rations and the talk of further privations of the impossibility of getting servants of the only help at the farm being land girls of longing for spring when at least well have our veg garden and wont feel the pinch so ordinary talk unless you heard the barely repressed hysteria or depression under the words the attempt to cover up hopelessness with chatter about nothing she ghosted along in sarahs wake and now saw the signs of actual physical privation in some places of sunken cheek and waistbands too large and realized she wasnt just seeing the effect of lack of luxuries she was seeing real hunger and if that were so in the country where people were likely enough skirting the rationing by hiding pigs in the forest geese and ducks on the farmponds chickens pigeons and rabbits in the garden reporting less milk than their cows actually gavewhat was it like in the city she felt battered actually battered by revelation after cruel revelation she couldnt have managed to speak to any of these familiar strangers even if she hadnt been walled off from them by appearance and spell she didnt know them these were not her people they were some odd breed of changeling that looked superficially like her old neighbors but who were mere shells filled with despair over which a cracking veneer of commonplace was held in place by a fading will to pretend that everything was all right sarah glanced soberly at her from time to time but said nothing she only led the way to her little cottage propped up on either side by larger tudor buildings and opened the door to let them both inside hanging up her plain brown wool shawl on the peg beside the door once inside eleanor put her back to the wall and stared at sarah incredulously why didnt you tell me she blurted wanting nothing more than to bolt back to the safety of her kitchen where the privations of the years had not penetrated and where she could pretend that nothing outside the walls had changed would you have believed me sarah countered stirring up the fire in her tiny fireplace and putting another log on it could i have told you in any way that you would have believed youve been seeing some of the papers now and again im sure eleanor collapsed into the old wooden chair that sarah indicated hands limply in her lap but she said helplessly but that doesnt tell you because no one wants the truth to be printed in the papers sarah said cruelly if they did itd be like roosha all over again or so them fellows in the government think how many eleanor asked feeling numb how many what sarah responded i didnt see any men she began sarah nodded most of themwell we think theyre still alive though some havent been heard from in a fair while she said sadly but then again its one thing to come home on leave when you live in london or youve ready in your pocket tis quite another when all your pay comes home and you havent the money for a train ticket when they give you leave she sighed i dont know but what youll not recognize the names matt brennan lost a leg ross ashley you know lost his hand and alan vocksmith his eye michael kabonthats the butcher that came in after you were bespelled finding we hadnt onehes all scarred up outside and in from gas jack samburs lost an arm eric whitcomb his wits then the ones as wont be home at all she took a deep breath theyre on the monument that got put up at the church bruce gulken thomas golding john mcgregor daniel heistand jock williamson william williamson daniel linden harry brown the baker and sean newton seans the latest his mum just heard last week each name fell like a stone into the silence soit was pamela brown at the bakery now not her husband eleanor really hadnt known most of them but willie williamson had been one year older and one of the boys who had heroworshipped reggie fenyx and sean newton had used to ask her to dance at village fetes daniel heistand had been another of reggies devoted followers and had always frowned at her so fiercely when she was the one who got to pull the wheelchocks away not coming home or maimed so badly no one would put them back out again horrible horrible what was that a third of the men between the ages of eighteen and twentyfive in this village sean sean had been his widowed mothers only child she shook her head it hurt even to think about its never going to end is it she asked faintly its just going to go on and on and on until there are no men left in england sarah only sighed and closed her eyes her shoulders hunched as if she found the weight of it all too much to bear i dont pretend to see the future she replied sadly but the present is nasty enough to worry about even mad ross come home all grim and quiet no more riding about hardly ever makes a speech unless its in the pub and hes had some courage in him the ones as came home well they dont talk to their wives and they dont talk to their sweethearts they just sit in pub and stare at wall shellshocked they call it i call it that theyve seen too much to bear and stay entirely sane they dont talk about tomorrows either and a man what wont plan for tomorrow is a man who believes he wont see it thats what you feel on the village thats what come home from the war with the ones that did come home nobody thinks about tomorrow if they can help it nobody church and chapel theyre both alike stopped praying for victory they have now they just pray for it to be over and have no faith it ever will i spose its easier to whinge about not having beef and the cost of butter than it is to have hope eleanor shuddered what is going on over there she whispered what is it i dont know sarah said staring deeply into the fire on her hearth as if searching there for answers but ill tell you this much whatever it is it eats a mans soul they talk to each other them as came home but never to the rest of us she had thought to walk about the village now she couldnt bear the idea im going to see if i can get as far as the aeroplane field at longacre she said standing up ill do it now while the spells still fresh sarah just nodded mind the wind was all she said you can borrow that shawl by the door if youd like eleanor hadnt thought to bring a shawl when they left the kitchen and for a moment she looked at the plain shabby garment with the disfavor the old eleanor might have oh who and what am i to be so picky she asked herself thank you sarah if its no inconvenience i wont be going out before youre back sarah said with certainty eleanor paused with one hand on the door sarahwhat is it you do she asked bewildered for a living she couldnt bear it if sarah was teetering on the edge of poverty sarah laughed what no one ever told you im the district nurse and licensed midwife never a doctor between here and stratford almost especially now so i do for all of those that need simple tending she nodded at eleanors silent oh of understanding its what my sort does now hide in plain sight people call me witch theyre joking and ive license to cure as much of their ills as im able i do well enough better than somemost of my patients are farm folk and barter is better for them than money so i get some of that butter and beef no one else can find and its a help to have enough of the magic that i have a good sense of when ill be needed and often as not where so shoooff with you find out how far you can go nobodyll call me out until after dark when you had best be back in your kitchen thank you eleanor told her then wrapped the heavy shawl around herself pulling it up over her head and went back out onto the street it smelled pleasantly of lavender and was softer than it looked no one gave her a second look she had the feeling this was part of the magic her stepmother had put on her people wouldnt look at her probably unless they actually bumped into her well that was one thing working like a slavey all these years had done for hera walk she would have quailed at four years ago was nothing she set off up the road heading for longacre to see how far she could get before she was stopped the village was tiny five minutes and she was off cobbles and onto hardpacked earth rutted by farm carts and marked by hooves passing between farm fields she had known all her life hedgerows showed a lack of tending that would have been shocking three years ago it was too early for planting but the meadows were full of cattle and sheep the only creatures that looked to be prospering at prewar levels as she passed the gulkens dairyfarmtheresas now alone she heard louis blues shrill whistle and saw the cattle raise their heads and begin to amble in the direction of the milkingbarn so louis probably around about sixty now was old enough to escape conscription though she didnt know theresa except as the supplier of butter and milk she still felt an absent sort of relief hard enough to find yourself a widow but how could one woman keep up a busy dairy farm by herself louis however she knew from her rambles about as a child always with a kitten in his pocket for cats and dairy farms went together like clotted cream and jam he could never bear to drown the kittens and was always looking for homes for them the thought of him going off to the horror that this war must be was an obscenity he who couldnt bear to kill a kitten at least hed been spared that beyond the dairyfarm was the scroggins orchard and again with relief she saw another bit of normality brian scroggins was out checking the apple trees with his wife tracy in the next row and brianna and zach picking up every twig of fallen applewood they could carry everyone liked a bit of applewood on their fire and applewoodsmoked bacon and ham were a treat no wasting in brian scroggins orchard but he couldnt be fifty how had he escaped being called up oh as brian plodded like a donkey along the row of trees head down she remembered he was so shortsighted as to be almost blind tracy did anything that required reading and writing just as well if anyone dared to call up the maker of the best scrumpy in the county she didnt doubt thered be an uprising she trudged along the road pulling the shawl out of the grip of the wind the lovely weather a few days ago had been a lie it had there might even be snow tonight or if rain it would be iceedged across from the scroggins was the farm of joanne and michael van and here it was painfully clear that all was not as normal there was no sign of michael who surely must be in france now and all of the figures picking stones in the field were female one was probably joanne but no broom native had red hair of the sort that flamed under one of the scarves nor the midnightblack bob of another of the girls were these land girls young women who volunteered to work on farms and take the place of the absent farmers if so they were eleanors first sight of the breed and for all the complaints of how they were lazy or vamps out to tease the country boys they seemed to know their job well enough and they were sensibly clothed in heavy coats boots and long warm skirts finally the last farm before the fields belonging to longacre began was the samburs sheep farm and as she trudged up the road she saw sarah hurrying after a male figure with one sleeve pinned up to his chest supporting himself with a stick following two sheepdogs with more determination than steadiness but she didnt call after him did sarah nor did she take over the direction of the sheepdogs she seemed more like one of the dogs herself waiting to see what her husband wanted then doing it without a word just as silent just as faithful you do for yourself she seemed to say until you cant do no more i know you have to it made tears spring into eleanors eyes and she had to turn away and hide her face in the shawl the last thing she wanted to do was let either of them catch this sign of her pity they likely got more than enough of it as it was but neither of them looked in her direction as she hurried past the cold raw wind plastering her skirts to her legs all of his attention was on the dogs and the sheep and all of hers was on him eleanor passed their farmhouse and more of their fields dotted with sheep who raised their heads and looked at her with their foolish faces when she passed and thenthe hedgerows became fences marking the beginning of the fields of longacre she paused for a moment at the side of the road these were grazing fields too but for horses not cattle or sheep the hunters of longacre park the grass was thick and rank here for the horses were gone gone to the war to pull guncarriages not leap fences in the hunt only off in the distance were three old graynosed fellows too old to be of use across the channel she had gotten this far could she possibly get so far as the field where reggie had kept his aeroplane she trudged on past the horse field past one of the woods kept stocked with pheasant for the shooting season was there still a shooting season did anyone come out to hunt or were they all hunting men now in the trenches and then the second field she climbed over the stile and down into it the grass was up to her knees but this was it this was reggies field she could walk here just trembling a little and feeling the pull start she paused beside the old shed empty and falling to pieces where the aeroplane had lived no sign of it now beyond a discarded and broken propeller some bits and bobs of wingstruts and a halfrotten roll of canvas inside she lingered as long as she could but the pull homewards became more insistent with each passing minute and when she pulled out the rosemary sprig it was clearly beginning to wither but she turned her back on the place and headed back in the growing gloom with no real sense of disappointment she had gotten this farand this place held nothing but melancholy as sad and abandoned as the places in the village where the men used to gather and socialize enough despair for one day time to go back to sarah and try to scrape up enough hope to carry on her own fight april broom warwickshire now we must play these cards slowly and carefully girls alison said as the three of them sat over a light luncheon of pottedshrimp sandwiches and teacakes the girls had taken up smoking while in london and were indulging in malicious enjoyment as they ruined their leftovers with ash and stubs so much for the stepsister grazing on what was left oatbread and bean soup was more than good enough for her alison reflected for a moment on the quiet occupant of the kitchen that wretched girl eleanor didnt seem any the worse for having been left on her own for longer than usual and in fact the absence seemed to have made her more subdued this was a pleasant development more than that it now seemed more likely that alison would find a way to render her into a helpless object without having to resort to any of lockes complicated schemes while she had initially been in favor of the idea alison dislike complication intensely the simpler the plan the better for the less there was that was likely to go wrong she didnt like the idea of bringing in a stranger who certainly would be a criminal and thus unreliable criminals often thought they would be clever and turn on the one who had hired them the more she thought about it the more she began to believe that in dealing with the girl eleanor it was probably better not to bring locke or any of his friends into it at all after all she was an earth master there ought to be some way for an earth master to damage someones mind irreparably and much as she would enjoy eleanors pain there were other ways to extract the same pleasure she took a reflective sip of her tea and returned her attention to the subject at hand by now the first letter will have been received up at longacre park she continued but we must not give an appearance of being too eager to make this connection the opposite in fact the last thing we wish is to make it seem as if we are pursuing the fenyx family remember i allegedly married far below me and i might find that fact uncomfortable in fact we must appear to be diffident suggested carolyn shamefaced was lauralees choice diffident alison replied decidedly which made carolyn smirk and lauralee pout a trifle these days there is nothing shameful about repairing a great lines fortunes by marrying into trade the only shame comes about when one tries to push in before one is invited or to use ones name and connections as a kind of commodity she pursed her lips frowning only made the brow wrinkle you see lauralee we must appear to be modest above all we must appear to be reticent about taking advantage of this tentative connection you two should look hopeful and eager but say nothing until we are actually established and accepting invitations and when the invitations arrive you must be retiring and modest carolyn supplied with a glance at lauralee no flirtations friendly wallflowers so to speak exactly right alison bestowed a smile of favor on her elderborn you must appear to be grateful without fawning and without any hint that you intend to take advantage of the new situation new situation lauralee laughed and flicked her cigarette ash into the remains of her buttered toast any parties were invited to will be rather thin on male company unless you want us to cozy up to grandfathers and schoolboys alison stared at her in astonishment cozy up where did you get that expression youve been going to too many american cinema shows young lady well lauralee flushed and looked at her in defiance alison quelled the defiance with another look no well about it alison sketched a sign in the air and lauralee squealed in pained surprise as her mother administered a mild correction let that be a lesson to you no slang no impudence you will maintain impeccable manners from this point on no you will not be courting old men or schoolboys you will be comforting reginald fenyx who is returning to longacre in extremely fragile condition on medical leave you will be compassionate understanding and willing to listen to or do anything he asks which likely wont be much you will become indispensible to him and i dont care which of you does it either so long as one of you gets him to the point where he cannot do without you at which point we will ensure he asks for your hand i will be assisting considerably of course she added lets just say hell be plagued by things he would rather not see and the only time he will be free of them will be in your presence lauralee understood immediately carolyn took a moment or two of thought and the hint from her older sister of hes shellshocked it was alisons considered opinion at that point that regardless of carolyns superior looks and predilection for flirtation lauralee was probably going to win this particular contest that will be up to the two of you she said serenly i will supply the structure which is all any good daughter could ask mama said carolyn sweetly lauralee leveled a withering glance at her but said nothing alison was pleased with a contest of rivalry set up between the two things should proceed apace as soon as reggie made his appearance back home now i have something important that i must tend to she said and got to her feet a small matter on behalf of the lodge and the department combined i will take the auto and i should be back by dark has that odd butcher sent anything of my order or the tavern carolyn shook her head just notes that there is no meat to be had today so no roast and no ham have the girl do something with potted pheasant then alison said absently get it out of the pantry for her certainly mama carolyn always enjoyed the opportunity to humiliate eleanor even when it meant having to set foot in the kitchen eleanor still wasnt much of a cook fortunately there wasnt much that the girl could do to ruin a potted pheasant i will see you at dinner then she repeated and went out jingling her keys it was a distinct inconvenience to be required to drive herself but there wasnt a man to chauffeur to be had and alison had learned to cope the auto was less than comfortable on the country roads around broom but a carriage would have been just as bad and at least the weather hadnt left the roads nothing but muck or kicking up choking clouds of dust she needed her duster and her hat and goggles though this time it was going to be a considerable driveinto stratford even now three years into the war stratfordonavon was an attraction for visitors who came to see anne hathaways cottage and other shakespearian landmarks that most of them were elderly or female was of no matter strangers even strangers with accents occasioned no undue attention there was an industryno longer thriving but still in placeof people renting out their cottages to visitors the lodge had been good enough to give alison not only a name but directions to the quarry who had established himself in a cottage on the outskirts of stratford one that had once been a farm cottage for a tenant until the land was given over to grazing rose cottage was exceptionally remote tucked off by itself down a little bylane the owners had probably been pathetically grateful that anyone was willing to take it these days grateful enough to look the other way when the man claiming to be a refugee from belgium had turned up wanting to take it alison stopped the car at the head of the lane in the partial concealment of some overgrown hedges and cautiously cast a shield of protection about herself she had no intention of going into this unprotected then without taking off the enveloping duster and goggles that hid her identity she walked cautiously down the lane that few people came this way was given mute testimony to by the grass growing rank over the road that fit with what alison had been told as she approached the cottage it was clear that it was several hundred years old and improvements to it had been minimal no gas probably no water pipes certainly no electricity or telephone and what heat there was would be supplied by one or two fireplaces there was a single chimney and the roof was of thatch the aura of magic was muted and subdued probably no one would have noticed if not for the telltale traces of elementals that were strangers to this part of the world what was it about germans that so attracted them to tibetan magic that was something that had always puzzled alison werent their native creatures powerful enough for them well the little airdemons of the everest were not going to be able to deal with the earth elementals of england on their own ground particularly not as alison had surprise on her side she stopped just long enough at the gate to invoke a gnome a twisted and ugly little manikin the color of old stone where is the master of this place she asked quietly as it emerged out of the rock of the garden wall and stood there rocksilent itself looking at her gone the gnome croaked and waved in the direction of meadows good she dismissed the creature which melted back into the stone she entered the garden gate and sauntered up the path to the cottageit had been gravel once but was now as overgrown as the road and as she took in the rather picturesque little dwelling she could not help but smile broadly a vinecovered cottageand beneath the vines was stone good cotswold stone thatched roof earth and earth and earth what had he been thinking probably not that an earth master would come hunting him she laid one hand on wall beside the thick oaken door and allowed the stone to speak to her her duster blended nicely with the gray of the stone and even if anyone came along here and saw her she could claim to be looking for the tenant not that anyone would the spell of avoidance she had laid across the lane would keep even cattle from wandering down this way needless to say the german agent did not work his spells within the confines of the cottage the spells he had laid here were all of protection a dome of mixed shielding that melded with the walls of the cottage his purpose here was twofold to gather information by means of his air elementals and whenever possible to disrupt the training of the royal flying corps now from the little that alison had learned about the rfc it took very little to disrupt that training fog rain contrary windsthings that were all easy to direct and create would render it difficult and dangerous to go up and they were all things that occurred frequently and naturally impossible to say how many casualties if any were due to his interference possibly none whatsoever the flying corps was quite efficient at killing off its young recruits all by itself one recruit a day died at each of the two training fields so alison had been told and there could be upwards of two dozen crashes a day and that was without any magical interference whatsoever insane but no more insane presumably than the generals whose only strategy seemed to be that of amassing men in trenches then sending them in charges against machinegun nests across open land littered with shellholes razorwire and bits of the last lot to make the charge absolutely insane if alison had been in charge of the war the slaughter would certainly have been as great but it would have been to more purpose there were other ways of killing men than flinging them straight to their deaths and she would not have pursued a policy that spent so much to gain nothing she didnt know this mans real name and she didnt care to learn it she didnt want to know precisely what he was doing outside of what he was doing magically she did not care to know who he was reporting to or how the war office of course did want to know these things the war office would have to go on wanting if the war office was interested discovering these things the war office could send its own men of course they had tried doing just that they had sent conventional agents against elemental masters before but like the generals it seemed that they never learned what not to do they had gotten less than satisfactory results in their investigations of this man for instance those two agents that had been sent to find out what this man was up to at least according to what the lodge had told alison had been found wandering around the countryside scorched and witless lightning of course well known as the weapon of choice for far eastern air elementals especially the ones associated with tibetan shamanism alison might have started life as an ignorant workingclass girl but knowledge was power and she intended to be as powerful as knowledge could make her it was astonishing the amount of information that she had accumulated about traditions other than her own thus far the magic of choice for germans seemed equally split between nordic and tibetan agents of the irish in league with the germans stuck to their dark celtic ways the walls of this cottage spoke to her of foreign creatures with multiple limbs and eyes and boarlike tushes definitely tibetan so her quarry was out in a field somewhere communing with his slanteyed demons interfering with the lives of the young bucks at the two schools of military aeronautics one at reading one at oxford and all without going more than a half mile from this house so why choose stratford as a base that alison couldnt guess and didnt really care perhaps it was simply that there was nothing much of military significance around her and so there was less chance of his being found out it didnt matter where an air master was in relation to what he wanted to investigate the only question was how long he was willing to wait to find out the information and how sure his control over his elementals was he could operate at a distance of a couple hundred miles if he had firm control of his creatures it was certainly less than that from stratford to oxford or reading he would have no difficulty at all in controlling weather from here and depending on how fast his elementals flew he could have his information within an hour or two of all of the elemental masters it was the air masters who made the best spies for precisely that reason earth and water masters tended to have more control over their creatures but needed to be in close proximity to what they were investigating because their elementals could not travel nearly so fast and fire masters could work at a distance but their control tended to be problematical if fire elementals did not like you they didnt have a great deal of difficulty in slipping their bonds and when they did even the friendliest ones could prove deadly so fire masters in general were very poor intelligence agents well the one thing that this air master had neglected to do was to leave one of his little servants here to guard his dwelling in person that had certainly been a mistake even an elemental with no power could have run to alert his master that there was another elemental mage in his territory and she probably would not have been able to catch or stop it well perhaps he had made the mistake that so many in the past had he had looked for a male master assuming that a female would be inconsequential the germans seemed to have that habit of dismissing female masters out of hand or like many masters of a superior element he could have assumed that an earth master was in control of an inferior power if that was the case he should have known better there was a reason why opposite pairings were considered inimical to each other it might be a bit more difficult for an earth master to get an air master in a position where he was under her control but when it happened the results were unfortunate for the air master or it might be because he had never seen an earth master who had dominion over the hostile creatures of the element earth masters tended to be healing nurturing types alison curled her lip in contempt if that was the case if he hadnt bothered to do his research he deserved what he was about to get she placed both hands on the wall and summoned her own creatures they would bypass the protections on this placeone great fault air masters often had was that they forgot that things could come up from below as well as down from above their protections tended to be domes rather than spheres water masters and fire masters rarely made that mistake up they came slow and cold investing the walls and the floor with their presence swimming through the stone as an undine would swim through water kobolds and tommyknockers mostly those creatures that invested rock rather than earth and who hated mankind with an enduring passion as the invader and despoiler of their secret underground fastnesses they had the power to bring down mines when angered and the only reason that they werent more dangerous than trolls and giants was that they were slow to work on their own and solitary and found it difficult to work with one another she bound them with spell and command it wasnt difficult given what she intended them to do they hated mankind in general and air magicians worst of all ah the benefit of working against a master of the inimical elemental it was seldom that she commanded any of her creatures under these circumstances that was not pleased to do her will the spell was set the trap laid and there was no point in remaining the air master would be returning soon he would check his boundaries and find them untouched because her invaders had not forced had not even crossed them only when the clock crossed into the dark side of the night at just past midnight would her minionsstrike was not the correct word for they would approach by stealth envelop was more accurate as he slept they would creep upon him imprison him paralyze him and then they would slowly so slowly squeeze the breath out of him sitting on his chest while he struggled for air until the lungs collapsed and the laboring heart gave out there would be no sign that he had died of anything other than natural causes this was far superior to invoking a werecreature and tearing her victim apart which is what she had been forced to do the last time stealth was always preferable to direct conflict whenever she could avoid a magebattle she felt that she had won two victories in one she sauntered back to the waiting automobile feeling altogether pleased with herself the amount of terror and pain that this particular murder would produce would be remarkable and that in turn would enrich the power given up at the death the victim might well last most of the night the kobolds would absorb that powerretain some for themselvesbut deliver the lions share to her which would in turn give her more power for the conquest of reginald fenyx she would need extra power earth elementals had already feasted on his fear and pain and would hunger for more if she had meant to destroy him that would have been fine but she would need all her magic and cunning to keep them restrained and held in check she drove back home in the sunset the auto was constructed of enough of the materials of earththough it was powered by fire and airthat it did not dare misbehave under her hand which was more than could be said of horses or for that matter any other living beast that she hadnt specifically bred altered and trained that was the drawback to being a dark master animals didnt much care for you well the antipathy was mutual she brought it to a halt inside what had been the stable and turned it off as the last light of the day slowly faded through the garden door she came walking briskly up the path as light shown warmly through the kitchen windows of course she did not have to go through the kitchen for there were two doors into the gardenthe kitchen door and this one it would never do for her to take a servants entrance not even when there was no one there to see the passage from the garden led directly to the sitting and dining rooms however the savory aroma coming from the kitchen told her that the girl had concocted something tasty with the potted pheasant she went upstairs to clean herself from the drive and smiled at herself in the mirror it had been a most satisfactory day orders to use potted pheasant for dinner had made eleanor seethe with repressed anger and this time it was not only on her own behalf outside these walls people were getting by on a few ounces of meat in a day stretching it by stewing putting it in soup concocting pie using parts of the cow pig sheep and chicken that no one would have dreamed of using before this here within the walls of the arrows the announcement that there would be no ham or roast had been met with an order to make a meal with a potted pheasant as if this was a great hardship while the trio had been gone eleanor had learned a great deal about life in the village in this third year of the war and she knew that the steady submarine attacks on convoys coming from the united states were taking a significant toll on what was getting to the island it wasnt only munitions far more than she had ever dreamed came into britain from across the oceans taking a greater toll on peoples everyday lives was the rationing and simple scarcity for there was no need to formally ration what simply was not available the greater share of meat white flour fat dairy and sugar was simply taken to go to those who were fighting or who like the medical services overseas were serving those fighting the result had an impact everywhere she wasnt sure if people were actually hungry but it wouldnt surprise her there were no sweets in the village store for children for instance and when sugar was available everyone rushed to get what they could the butcher michael kabonto eleanors initial shock he was a black man from somewhere in africamade the most of every bit of meat and bone that fell beneath his cleaver mr kabon was wellregarded in normally insular broom but then when his personal sacrifice was so visible in his own flesh broom would have found it difficult to turn away from him even had he not been as goodnatured as he was whatever had moved him to volunteer she could not say but he was never going to go back to the lines againnot the way he fought for each breath after the dose of mustard gas that had also scarred his face and body and he had proved to be very useful for the village of course here in the country no one ever complained about eating organmeat so he had no trouble finding buyers for kidneys and livers lungs and brains but he knew of other options people were poor where he came from he had some interesting suggestions about how unlikely things could be cooked and by this time the women of broom were getting desperate enough to try them chicken feet it turned out did make a tasty soup when cooked long enough and cow hooves were not all that far from pigtrotters and could be used to make more than jelly so long as housewives disguised the origin of their culinary adventures no one seemed to mind where the taste of meat came from any bone could be used to make a stock and stock meant soup it was amazing how much meat could be gotten when you scraped bones too so outside these four walls families were dining tonight on chickenfoot soup and oatbread while within the ladies of the arrows thought it hard that they were reduced to a casserole of potted pheasant if there was a sweet course on the tables of the village it would probably be a jam tartwith the jam spread as thin as might be alison and her daughters feasted on sugarfrosted cake eleanor wondered just what the reaction would be in the village if anyone knew this or knew that the innocuous parcels that came on a regular basis to the arrows contained foodstuffs no one in broom had seen for days or weeks or even months certainly alisons reputation in the village would suffer the loss of some of its shine eleanor had planned to go to visit sarah tonight but as she had gotten ready to add sarahs herbs to the tea something had hissed out of the fire she had turned to see a salamander writhing on the hearth watching her with agitation when it knew it had caught her eye it beckoned her nearer not tonight it had hissed she walks and wakes tonight tomorrow for a moment she had hesitated but then had put the herbs away the salamanders didnt often speak to her or even appear in the fire during the hours in which they might be seen by someone else if this one felt it needful to deliver a warning why take chances so she resigned herself to a night of hard work alone if alison was going to be awake there was no point in fighting the compulsions and arousing her suspicion she stared at her own reflection in the window as she washed up the dinner dishes in some ways none of this made any sense at all at this point there were days when if alison had simply come to her and said if you sign over your inheritance i will let you go that she would have agreed in a flash it wasnt as if given all she had learned perforce she couldnt earn a living as a servant of course that would have meant giving up a great deal of what made life tolerable servants didnt have a lot of time nor leisure to read and once she did that the life of an oxford scholar would have been quite out of reach but why should she give up what was hers especially when alison had essentially stolen it in the first place because freedom was worth more than things if she had learned one lesson in all of this it was that freedom was worth far more than things she finished the dishes and sighed alison would never let her go not even for that she knew too much ordinary people might not believe in magic but there were more like alison out there and if she was ever able to leave these four walls she would be in a position to tell them herself what alison was up to how she had bewitched eleanors father and all the rest those people might not pay attention but then again they might alison would never let her go as long as there was a chance that her scheme would be exposed because even if those people did nothing about what had happened to eleanor and her father they would be warned for the future and any new scheme alison had in mind could be thwarted she reached for a towel to dry off her hands and made a face as she looked at the left well there was another reason for alison not to let her go she wouldnt even have to say anything about magic just that her stepmother had kept her prisoner and abused her all these years and here was her little finger buried beneath the hearthstone to prove it she certainly wouldnt have chopped her own finger off and buried it now would she with the dishes finished she took some mending and sat beside the hearth to do it the salamander was still there coiling restlessly around the flames sometimes flickering out and around her ankles before diving back in again she had expected the house to settle and indeed she heard the two girls going to their rooms but alison kept walking back and forth restlessly or was she walking back and forth eleanor cocked her head and listened intently no this wasnt a simple toandfro alison was walking in a circle the house was too wellbuilt for her to hear if her stepmother was saying anything but the salamander looked up it is near midnight it observed she walks you mean shes doing magic eleanor whispered the salamander nodded so that was what the creature had meant eleanor looked up and shivered whatever was going on it couldnt mean anything good who or what else did alison have in her power now and what was she doing to them april longacre park warwickshire reggie got out of the car stiffly gazing up at the imposing front of longacre feeling not that he was coming home but that he was a stranger in a foreign land he wasnt comfortable standing on the steps of a place like this anymore he kept wondering when the next barrage would come in and knock it all to pieces this was not reality this quiet peaceful country this grand house with its velvety lawns this was not where he lived his home was a tent or a hastilythrownup wood hut the earth churned by bombs with the echoing thud of cannon that never stopped this was no longer his world beautiful yes it was with its stone columns rising to support a grecianinspired portico it looked more like a government monument than a place where people lived the georgians built to impress rather than to house he took the first few steps knee crying agony at him and looked up at the portico again what am i doing here he thought the uniformed staff was lined up beside the door to greet him uniformed staff neat suits proper little gowns and aprons his world contained slovenly orderlies that stole your whiskey and tobacco piles of dirty uniforms pitched in the corner of the tent clutter that was never cleaned only rearranged he took another three steps upwards feeling as if he was a supplicant climbing to the throne of god the scene had that same feeling of unreality pristine white steps going up to a colonnaded portico cloudless blue sky larks overhead a line of solemn priestlike people waiting to greet him he realized as he was halfway up the stairs that once he had thought he loved longacre but he was not the same person who had given that love to this place in fact he was only just coming to the realization that what he loved was not this great stone pile this display in marble it was the land around it what had he remembered after all in those days when he waited to be sent up in those nights when he listened to the guns as he climbed all those stairs what occurred to him was that it had not been the memories set in those rooms with their twentyfoot ceilings but the ones spent in woods and fields in the stables and the sheds that had kept him alive and sane there were acres of field and farm meadow and woods belonging to this place he felt more at home in any of them than in the building itself if it had not been too much effort to go back down all those steps he might just have gone down to the car and ordered it away far away anywhere but here this strange place that should have been home and wasnt his mother had the entire staff lined up out front to greet him as if he was some sort of medieval monarch returning bloody hell he thought with weary resignation dont they have things to do of course they did but this was traditional this was where the staff of longacre got their largesse so why dont i just pay them decently instead and we can do without this mummery but no no he must follow the tradition noblesse oblige cant disappoint the staff so he hobbled forward as one of the men detached himself from the line and moved to his elbow and pressed several coins into his hand surely they would prefer this in their proper paypacket first and foremost in line were mrs dick the housekeeper and james boatwright the butler they had held those positions on the estate for as long as reggie could recall and in all that time they had not apparently changed no one knew if mrs dick had ever actually had a mister dick one just referred to the housekeeper by the title of mrs because that was how things were done he vividly recalled the day he had learned her given name of catrionaall his life until then he had thought mrs was her first name they at least seemed genuinely moved to see him boatwright he said shaking the upright old mans hand mrs dick they didnt even acknowledge the largesse simply slipped it into a pocket and went on shaking his hand and somewhat to his shock there were tears in their eyes why what should they care even if they remembered him as a child they could not have done so all that vividly the people he had spent the most amount of time with had been his nurse his governess and then his tutors and his father all of them were gone and of all of them only the nurse remained anywhere nearbyin the pensioners cottages if she hadnt died of old age yet and he felt so unmoved as if it wasnt he who was standing here greeting old family retainers who with so many going off and being slaughtered hadnt expected to see him alive as if he actually was dead a ghost come back to observe but not feel next in the hierarchy he greeted with somber gravity the cook mrs murphy was not quite as intimidating as mrs dick being all irish and beaming mrs murphy he said shaking her handevery time he did this of course he left that money in their hands gold sovereigns for the upper servants smaller coins for the lesser the tips that servants in great houses were accustomed to get from visitors and on occasions like this from the family or at least the head of the family which he now was his father had simply dropped where he stood on the first of june after reggie was already in the rfc it should have been his father standing here for gods sake why couldnt this have been done with less fanfare it was humiliating surely for them and no great joy for him and his knee hurt abominably he could remember his father doing this on occasions like the kings birthday or boxing day or the day he reggie had taken his oxford degree just before the war began devlin fenyx had never seemed to find this the ordeal that his son was now experiencing beside him was michael turner his valet unobtrusively handing him the gold sovereigns turner had been his fathers valet and knew the secret that father and son kept from his mother that both of them were elemental masters only with turner did he feel something like normal and he wished that if this had to be done it could have been turner who attended to it idont belong here i dont belong to this world anymore these piles of showy stone these devoted family retainers my world is not this place my world is a world of blood and ruin of bombs and cannon and the stink ofgas still he moved on smiling pleasant while pain lanced through his knee and more and more he wanted only to go lie down somewhere next to mrs murphy was thelma hawkins thelma cooked for the servants quiet word shake hand slip in the coin move on what were these folk to him or him to them just milord or something more and was that something nothing more than a chimera a fata morgana an illusion he was a ghost a ghost of the past and no more real than the dreams of a poet then there were the cooks helpers four of them cheryl case maria bracken amanda hart and mary holman the tweenie he wasnt supposed to know them but he did all but mary holman turner murmured their names as they curtsied and this time it was turner who gave them their largesse not reggie because these were underservants the bottom of the hierarchy and little matthew case who ran errands was hardly even in the hierarchy at all and just why should that be reggie knew the helpers better than he knew many blood relations reggie had spent many hours in the kitchens as a boy running away from lessons the little holman girl looked up at him in awe as if he had been the king it was embarrassing in the end he was no better than she she might one day come to produce something good and usefulall he had produced was death next the housekeeping staff women first upstairs maids in their crisp black dresses with white collars and cuffs and starched white aprons with lace capsall of which must have been wretched to keep clean when your job was to clean downstairs maids in graystriped gowns of the same cut one of them mary had been the one who had taught him how to slide down the banister turner gave them their little gift they didnt say a word other than a murmur of thanks directed to him and not to turner they curtseyed too like stiff little puppets their faces without expression even mary didnt she remember or was this one of the things she wasnt supposed to remember lest she embarrass the master men next the footmen george woodward james jennings reggie remembered this old fellow was a talented hobbyist cabinetmaker and steven druce all three of them were from his fathers staff and definitely too old to be conscripted poor old men they should have gone to a pensioners cottage long ago he couldnt help but think of the prewar descriptions in the newspaper for those seeking footmentall of particular haircolor and with a handsome leg well george and james probably looked like that when his father was a youngster but they were very much past their prime now in contrast to their years was the hall boy jason long who couldnt have been more than fifteen the hall boy had that name because his position required that he sleep in the hall to answer the door after hours but lord devlin had found that distasteful that might do for some medieval blockhead he had said with a grimace but i am neither and we do have some modern conveniences these days so instead of sleeping in the hall on a cot behind a screen the hall boy had a room just off the kitchen with a bell connected up to the door and if anyone was foolish enough to come calling after everyone had gone to bed lord devlin had felt that they deserved to have to wait in the cold and dark until the hall boy made his way to the door reggie was glad the change had been made the head stableman was in the same agebracket as the two footmen and the stable boys were both boys perhaps fourteen or fifteen and looking stricken and anxious as he greeted them there was a pattern building here no men between the ages of seventeen and fifty he had known that in the abstract but seeing it on the staffbabies and grandfathers how many hundreds of thousands of men were dead in the killing fields of flanders and france no way of telling not when a barrage came in and blew everyone to bits and you just estimated who had been there but it was badbadif you could look at people here at home and see a gap where there just were no men of a certain age of course it cut across all nations and surely the french had suffered the worst of all butbut this was home he moved on looked down at a face and got a shock that almost made him stagger the head gardenerwho was responsible for longacres famous rose gardenwas not the man he recalled but a woman mrs green was murmured into his ear and he recalled with a start that her husband had been killed in the first year of the war a sad loss he said with as much sincerity as he could the next face was another shock for another mere boy was the second gardener now the staff that did not get largesse the business staff gray old paul mcmahon the estate accountant and the estate manager which should have been owen mcgregor but reggie found another female face looking at him where a mans should have been lee mcgregor sir she said to him without waiting for michael owen was conscripted in june of and we heard wed lost him in january good lord he said feeling knocked akilter he took her hand and shook it im so sorry she managed a wan smile im hoping youll keep me on in his place sir he glanced over at mcmahon who lifted his brow and gave a slight nod of approval if paul thinks youre handling the job then certainly he replied still feeling offbalance so now women were taking mens jobs because there were no men to fill them what else when he went down into broom what would he find there female shopkeepers surelyfemale postmen female constables female farmershow many of the tenant farmers are gone are their wives managing do we need land girls to help them he hadnt been home a half an hour he was supposed to be here to recover but already he felt burdens settling onto his shoulders until he looked down at lee mcgregor again and realized that his concerns were misplaced old paul approved she probably already had everything in hand he would just be meddling but then he moved to old friends he was so happy to see peter budd despite his new chauffeurs hookhand that he nearly shook the hook off budd had been the one responsible for helping to dig him out of that wretched bunkerbudd had heard him screaming his lungs hoarse insisted there was someone still alive in there and had begun the digging with only a bit of board to help him and that ironically had led to the loss of his hand hed gotten a splinter of all damned things the wound had gone septic immediately as happened all too often in the trenches and before anyone could do anything about it it had gotten so black it had to come off when reggie had gotten wind of that he had sent to his fellowsufferer to offer him a job peter had been a chauffeur before the war reggie assumed that anyone with the gumption to dig a man out with a board had the gumption to learn to drive again with a hook how are you doing old man he asked budd grinned ready to race milord he said saluting with his hook took the liberty milord of lookin up me mate bruce kenny and turned out he was already working here he jerked his head to the side at another new face good mechanic milord and made bold to conscript im wasted on horses it was obvious why kenny was working at longacre given reggies standing order to replace staff that were not going to return with unemployed veterans of the war kenny had a wooden leg a wooden leg was unlikely to impede his abilities as a mechanic excellent reggie replied feeling much more heartened than he had been a few moments ago and feeling relieved that the review of the staff was apparently over there might be some groundskeeping staff and eventually gaffer norman the gameskeeper would present himself probably with his pretty daughter eva in tow gaffer had read too many romantic novels in which the gameskeepers daughter marries the lord of the manor he would be expected to make the rounds and meet all of the tenant farmers and he should inspect the woodlands not that he intended to hunt but there was a sawmill on the property and it might not be such a bad idea to think about producing lumber for fine cabinetry the woodlands were old and properly managed could remain woodlands and provide timber no he wouldnt hunt he had had enough of hunting he never wanted to shoot anything again not ever but he should also look over the accounts of all the rental properties in stratford and elsewhere reliable sources of income needed to be cared for the welcome being over the staff filing away to their various duties he could now enter his house how can anyone call this monster a house the first room was the great hall and it was guaranteed to make virtually anyone feel utterly insignificant here the ceiling was thirty feet above the floor and the magnificence of the room matched the size it might be beautiful but it had never been built for humans but that was the moment of epiphany when reggie realized that it had been built for air masters he stepped inside and between the height of the ceiling and the windows up high as well as low he realized that he feltcomfortable he could draw a breath as easy as if he had been outside for the first time since he had come back he was in a room that didnt feel as if it was pressing in on him of course this wasnt just a monument to display it was the retreat and stronghold of someone who needed the sky above him to feel truly happy the public rooms on the ground floor all with twentyfoot ceilings with the exception of the great hall virtually guaranteed that no air master would ever feel claustrophobic and the private rooms on the next floor were nearly as spacious he mentally apologized to his ancestor what he had thought had been built to intimidate had actually been constructed to comfort hed suffered from gnawing claustrophobia he suddenly realized ever since his return from france the proportions made sense when you thought of it as a house built for those most comfortable under the open sky even the ceiling murals with their clouds and birds made sense his mother was waiting for him posed in the exact center of the great hall with her hands outstretched he limped toward her and took both her hands in his she studied his face anxiously and he produced a surface smile for her his poor mother she was not very clever being one of those fluttery helpless creatures but she had loved her husband dearly and he her she just hadnt known what to do with the two fenyx males in her life who had bonded more closely than mother and child right from the first oh my dear boy she said you look so pale im tired mother he replied with partial honesty it was a brutal trip down not good on the knee that was nothing less than the truth every little bump had sent a lance of pain through it and he hadnt had a decent night of sleep without being drugged for months well go along to your old room then dear and have a liedown you dont mind that youre still in your old room do you her voice sharpened with anxiety as if id want fathers room not a chance it will suit me just fine he told her and followed one of the footmen up the stairs and down the corridor though he hardly needed to be shown the way his room had not been touched since he left except to clean and tidy it he paused just over the threshold feeling with another sense of shock that it had been preserved as a sort of shrine perhaps to his safetyperhaps to his memory and because of that it was now a shrine to something that didnt exist anymore hed known this when he had come home on leave in a vague way but nownow the contrast between what he had been and what he had become could not have been greater here was his roomit was thank goodness not the room of the cricketplaying boyinamansbody that had gone off to oxford he had made some changes since that time but it was the room of an enthusiast for everywhere you looked were items having to do with flight books models pictures of planes a stack of the blueprints for his own bus framed pictures of himself in her bits of a carburetor were still lovingly arranged on the desk from the last time hed taken it to bits whoever had been doing the arrangement had lined up the parts by order of size and had polished them until they gleamed how long had that taken he could not help but contrast this room with the aerodrome on the western front hed last been posted to more of a cubbyhole in a tent really his sleepingquarters had been cluttered with binoculars maps bits of aeroplanessome souvenirs some just picked up out of idle curiosity he generally shared his quarters with at least two cats on account of the rats and mice being everywhere but in general an aerodrome was overrun with dogs it was mad really there were always dogs everywhere puppies peeking their heads out from under cots adult dogs fighting or fornicating in the runways dogs in the club dogs in the enlisted mens tent barracks dogs of every shape and size but with no pedigree whatsoever why all the dogs it had finally occurred to him that the aerodromes were probably where every pet in belgium and france that had been bombed out of its home had comein the cities that were still intact they had their own pets and there was no safety nor comfort in the trenches for any animal so the aerodromes were where the homeless hounds of france had come following their noses to where there might be food and friends he hadnt much cared for the fleas that the dogs brought and liked the quiet company of cats so there were usually a couple lounging about his bunk he like so many others decorated the canvas of his tent or hut with enemy insignia cut from downed planes and illustrations cut from magazines then there had been the photos every flier had them layered onto the wall hed never indulged in the gruesome hobby of snapping dead enemies and posting them on the walls of his quarters though plenty of the others did but in a way his collection was quite as bad for so many of those in the snaps were dead ghost arms circled the shoulders of the living dead eyes shone at the camera with the same enthusiasm as those who had survived usually there wasnt room for more in his sleeping quarters than bed kitbag a little table and a chairwith perhaps an ammunition crate serving as a bedside stand the bed would be covered in cats and clothing the stand would have something to give light the chair would be draped with two or three jackets or waistcoats and on his table more bits of motors bills brandy bottles halffull whiskey bottles either full or empty letters tobacco for his friends light novels borrowed from those who had finished them boxes of stomach pills for every flyer he knew ate them like candy himself not excepted how not when every time you went up you stood a good chance of coming down in pieces the rfc pitied the fbi but the fbi called the rfc the suicide corps or the sixtyminute men because a total of sixty minutes in the air was allegedly the average lifespan of a pilot dirty clothes on the floor a floor of rough wood full of splinters the sound of a gramophone bawling somewhere down the row harry tate or sentimental musichall songs in the last bivouac it had been the rose of tralee over and over the chap with the gramophone never shut it off the smellas distinct as in the trenches but thank god not sounbearable oil hot metal glue paraffin the french cook conjuring up somethingtobaccobrandy his unit had a french cook and kept hold of him grimly having a frenchie to do for you meant you could actually eat the foodthe sad substitutes for cooks supplied by the british army took whatever they got boiled it for three hours then served it with a white sauce with the look and taste of flourpaste the frenchies did you right a good soup a little salad and making the most of whatever they could get from the quartermaster and by scrounging he suspected horse many times but that was preferable to the slimy bullybeef which he also suspected to be horse hed always been in places where the commanding officer took as firm a hand as one could over such a collection of misfits as pilots tended to be so there had always been some semblance of order at least on the surface the monkeys were kept on leads the goats in pens the trash policed the meals on time but even in the english aerodromes no two pilots were alike take an inventory and you could come up with anything hed served with fellows whod left the seminary to fly and fellows who he suspected had been and might still be whoremongers with country lads and cockneys with fellow oxford and cambridge men and men who could barely read with canadians and americans raised on wild west shows and inclined to die rather quickly from an overabundance of enthusiasm combined with a lack of skill and an absolute certainty that instinct was better than training he propped his cane on the bureau and laid himself down on the bed staring up at the ceiling another mural of sky and clouds and im up above the ground floor too far up for them to find me they wont come up here relief washed over him he had thought that coming home to convalesce was the worst thing he could have done now he was prepared to admit he might have been wrong and for the first time in far too long he felt his eyelids grow heavy and he let them close and drifted into sleep not a true sleep it was too light for that a kind of halfconscious doze for he heard the servants moving about in this wing going about their duties mrs dick was very strict with her girls unless some task was so heavy it needed two they were to keep to the schedule and stay strictly apart to avoid wasting time on gossip but evidently she wasnt so hard on them that they were unhappy as a counterpart to his dozing he could hear the one working across the hall humming to herself heavier footsteps in the hall the girl said right there please and there was a thud of logs the rattle of a scuttle one of the boys must have brought up coal and wood for the fire more humming it was so unlike the sounds in the hospitals or the camps that it felt as if he was in another world entirely well he was really though it wasnt the world he had left behind mind he hadnt been home on leave for more than a year instead he had come over to london roughly ever other time meeting his mother there instead of coming down to longacre it was easier that way making a round of theater prevented any need to talk she didnt want to hear about the war and he didnt want to hear about the nice young ladies she wanted him to meet when hed come over on his own there had been other entertainment than theater and his mother no doubt would have been shocked to learn that some of those same nice young ladies were dispensing their favors with freedom and enthusiasm at the parties given by william waldorf viscount astor lady anson always it was the war the war the war giving a feverish cast to these parties with everyone grimly determined to haveif not enjoyment then pure physical pleasure here it seemed as if his mother had dedicated her life and all of her strength to trying to preserve life here at longacre as it had been before the war he had noted the last time he was on leave that she assiduously avoided any mention of the war and anything connected to it and there had been a kind of brittleness about her he wondered what would have happened to her if he had died would she have dedicated the rest of her life to keeping things absolutely the same frozen in time like an edwardian iteration of miss havisham he could easily see that poor mother it was a lost cause of course the juggernaut that this war had become had its own momentum it was devouring everything in its path and everything it could possibly touch she didnt have a chance against it in the end nothing and no one did he came down to dinner to discover to his horror that he and his mother were not alone in the house his grandfather on his mothers side was in residence unfortunately the old man considered himself a military expert having served in a tame regiment in india that saw no more exciting action than polo games he kept a civil tongue in his head all through the rather strained dinner while the old man held forth on the wisdom of the war office the grand strategies of kitchener and the superiority of real army tactics to the new weaponry of tanks and machine guns and especially aeroplanes damned useless said it before and ill say it again the old man fulminated as reggie shoved bits of rabbit cassoulet around on his plate damned cowards are whats holdin the victory up too damned cowardly to make the charges one good push over the top thatd be all itd take reggie closed his eyes counted to ten feeling a vein throbbing in his temple he thought of all the times hed looked down on the fbi in their big pushes how often he had watched them slaughtered by the machine guns thought of the men who had become his friends back on the ward men who had been thrown into a meatchopper by old fools who could not and would not understand that war had changed changed in unrecognizable ways and that the old tactics that had worked once did not work anymore he held his temper and his words all through dinner and after when what should have been a nice quiet moment for a smoke in the sunset turned into another occasion for a rant from the old man who seemed determined to confront him for some reason finally it was only when his mother retired that her father came to the real point now that were alone boy grandfather said with a particularly vicious look out of the corner of his eye at reggie i want you to know i dont hold with this shellshock nonsense a bustup leg thats fair but the other thats just malingering the old man gave him a particularly malicious glance ive got my eye on you suddenly a fury that reggie had not realized he possessed welled up in him and he actually began to shake he clenched his fist around the handle of his cane to stop it from trembling a bitter bile rose up in his throat to keep from giving the old man the answer he deserved he bit down hard and clenched his teeth together life was difficult enough for his mother he was not going to make it harder by having a row with her evilminded old father you can believe what you like sir he got out between his clenched teeth staring at the old bastard who stood a silhouette black against the fire in the study i cannot hope to change your mind huh grandfather snorted and turned away reggie still full of fury limped off out of the study not really knowing where to go but only knowing that if he didnt get away from that house and that horrible old man he was going to say or do something that would make his mother unhappy he forced himself into a walk around the garden it might be night but the layout of the rose garden hadnt changed in two hundred years and he didnt need light to know his way around but after limping around the turfed paths for a half an hour his temper still hadnt cooled and he knew he wanted something he could not get in that house he limped down to the stables where horses were sharing their accommodations with his motor cars there were three of them now an enclosed model for his mother his own fast allard and a bentley that he could either drive himself or be chauffeured in or rather he could when the knee healed up the condition of the knee made shifting problematic for a while but down there in the stable were two men with whom he had something in common a million times more than he shared with that vicious old man who had driven him out of his own house though they were neither officers nor gentlemen the stables had been neatly divided into horse and auto sides with the autos being housed in the part that had once held the carriages there was one farm cart there now one pony trap perhaps his mother liked to drive herself around and one small open carriage the rest of the space was made into a proper garage and the glow of a cigarette in the shadows told him that someone was out for a smoke care for a gasper milord asked peter budd thanks reggie replied taking the metaphorical strides that crossed all the boundaries of rank class wealth and education to arrive at the side of someone who deserved a hundred times more respect than that horrible old man i would april broom warwickshire the broom hall inn was where the autumn hunts began the hounds and horses assembling in the courtyard for the traditional stirrup cup marking it as a distinctly upperclass establishment it was certainly of the proper standard for lady devlin to meet alison robinson and her daughters for tea it was a safe way for lady devlin to examine these curious women for herself without incurring any obligations beyond a single meeting tea in an inn didnt require a response other than a thank you i enjoyed your company and it didnt imply that invitations to ones house should or could be forthcoming alison knew all of this and also knew that she had passed the first test by agreeing to this meeting it was a public place and while that was an initial advantage socially it could prove to be a disaster if the single meeting was all that there was and the rest of broom could read the snub for themselves this was all part of the social game that the gentry played among themselves to ferret out the unworthy the unmannered the illbred alison knew all of the moves of the game by heart and there was only one question in her mind as she listened to her girls snap waspishly at each other while howse attended to their hair to drive or not to drive the big crosley auto could fit four which the hispanosuiza would not and the inn was just far enough away that driving would not be terribly gauche on the other hand it was within easy walking distance and these were times in which some selfsacrifice was expected decisions decisions it was the shoes that finally decided her the frocks she had picked out for all three of them required town shoes not country shoes and in their highheeled town shoes the girls were at risk of spraining an ankle so off they went rattling and chugging up the street and when she arrived at the inn alison was glad she had made that decision lady devlins auto a magnificent rollsroyce silver ghost and her chauffeur were already there and lady devlin waited in a private parlor it was not by any means the first time that alison had dined here and this place and the broom pub with the white swan alternated in supplying some of their meals but this was not the usual private parlor she took it was clear from the outset that this room was not available for just anyone lady devlin had already ordered tea it was waiting when they arrived and she served as the hostess pouring for all four of them she was of the kind that alison thought of as wispysoft blond hair going to gray styled in a fashionable chignon soft grayblue linen walking suit slight figure dollpretty face with soft blue eyes mrs robinson she said as she poured the tea as a good hostess did i understand that you have lived in broom since just before the war began that is quite true lady devlin alison replied taking the cup and saucer from her hostess and making sure that their fingers touched as she did so because while alderscroft would never have dreamed she would use magic to ensure that she became lady devlins bosom friend alison had no scruples whatsoever on the subject but it would have to be subtle and work with more mundane methods of influencing reggies mother so what passed between them in that moment was a spell as wispy as fragile as lady devlin herself and unless you were very very good it was exceedingly difficult to detect affinitywe are the same you and i then i wonder why i heard nothing of you until now lady devlin continued pouring tea now for carolyn who accepted her cup with a diffident murmur of thanks oh lady devlin i would never have dreamed of pushing myself into your notice alison replied putting down her teacup and looking at lady devlin in consternation truth to tell i do not know why my cousin alderscroft elected to do so for me but alderscroft is a kind man and perhaps she looked away and let the words trail off the letter to lady devlin had stressed how lonely how hungry for refined company alison was but that was not what one would say for ones own self one wishes for compatible company now and again one does ones best she murmured dropping her eyes but sometimes i worry about my daughters i should think that broom would feel very confining for a young person oh no mama not at all carolyn looking very pretty in soft lilac exclaimed why our days are very full here we have the parish work the red cross the ladies friendly societynow that spring is come there will be tennis at the country clubwe scarcely have time to ourselves some days now alison exchanged a significant look with lady devlin these are all productive things no doubt but hardly entertaining for a pretty young girl and they do not put her into company appropriate to her breeding and of coursethe war lauralees hands fluttered over her cup the sleeves of her pink gown fluttering gently as well there are so many things one can do for the war well when we were your age lady devlin said with a friendly glance at alison im sure we didnt think half as much about parish work and the like it seems a pity this war has reached so far into our lives alison let the corners of her mouth droop all of england seems so sad she agreed and yet one feels guilty if one does anything the least frivolous when so many are suffering a slight movement of her hands drew subtle attention to her lapel where she wore her widows ribbon and your dear husband was one of the first of our sacrifices said lady devlin with an air of sympathy mr robinson and i were only just married too she replied now putting on a faint look of patient suffering one she had practiced long in the mirror my first husbandthe father of my girlswas a fine fine man but robinson was my true love late though he came to my life and brief though his stay in it was calculated slyly calculated to appeal to the romantic in her and it worked sublimely well lady devlin passed her the plate of pottedsalmon sandwiches with a sigh of commiseration you poor dear she said with an air of having made up her mind after careful consideration which alison did not in the least doubt you must come up to tea at longacre next week you and your charming daughters will tuesday be reasonable for you my lady any day you choose to honor us will be convenient alison replied with eager humility we would never wish to be a burden on you no matter what our cousin has told you oh pishtush lady devlin said waving her hand how could three more ladies be a burden at tea the vicar and his wife will be there and roberta cygnet and her daughter leva and gina towner miss elizabeth tansythe devon tansys you know shes visiting with leva and mr hartwell alison placed her fingers over her lips and allowed a smile to appear you dont mean william hartwell surely the one who keeps exploding his sheds with his inventions lady devlin laughed he does seem convinced that he will win the war does he not well hes a dear and the worst that will come along with him is a faint aroma of gunpowder there was a light tap at the doorframe the stocky form of the innkeeper hunched diffidently there is all to your liking my lady is there anything else i can serve you with no mr caffrey thank you lady devlin sighed youve done a remarkable job under the trying circumstances that surround us thank you very well my lady the innkeeper bowed himself out leaving them alone once more will your son come to tea lady devlin carolyn asked ingenuously i had heard that he was home at last i have always wanted to meet an aeroplane pilot it must be so thrilling to be able to fly but to both girls vast disappointment she shook her head im afraid not dear she said in a kindly tone company is a trial for him right now but thats all right sometime soon youll be sure to meet him i hope to hell i dont meet mother or any of her kittenish friends reggie thought as he drove the auto at a snails pace down into the village every bounce and rut made his knee sing with pain this was not a bad thing in some ways when he was in physical pain he could ignore the emotional turmoil within him grandfather had been up to his old tricks this morning hovering just on the edge of his vision and glowering every so often mouthing the word malingerer hed taken refuge in the garage to overhaul the vauxhall prince henry hed bought just before the war that was when budd had made the current suggestion and he couldnt have leapt upon it faster if hed had both good legs back he had budd along with him just in case his knee gave out and he couldnt wrestle the old bus any further along but he was looking forward to the day when he could go out on his own on his ownbecause then he could open her up and let tear and if he went smash hed hurt no one but himself and if i go smash no ones to know how much of an accident it is or isnt once he had fought death off like a tiger that had been before every day was a battle and every night a little war and he could feel his sanity slipping through his fingers like water maybe death was just the door into another life at the moment he didnt believe it he didnt believe in a higher power either what higher power would ever let the slaughter across the channel go on and on and on as it had unless that higher power were stark raving mad so the big thing would be to do yourself in a way that was fast and hopefully painless a good smash into a solid oak tree at the prince henrys top end would do that but that wouldnt be today today budd had tendered that rather awkward and shy invitation toa pub not just any pub milord hed hastily said used to be the workingmans pub afore the war so they say now hed shrugged not many workingmen in broom them of us got mustered out took it over more or less hed captured reggies dull attention with that the only men that were mustered out these days were those who were too maimed to go back into the lines really hed said looking up at budd over the prince henrys bonnet tell me more not much to tell budd had replied justwe didnt feel none too comfortable aroundpeople who werent there dye see i do see believe me i do he had tried to give budd that look so no one else ever comes in mostly not and they mostly goes back out again pretty quick budd had sighed and stared glumly down at the carburetor not a cheery lot are we dont go in for darts much skittles right out tend to swap stories as make th old reglars get the colliewobbles and look for the door now were a rough lot and old mad ross the socialist is one of us but i wondered milord if you might find a pint there go down a bit easier than a brandy and he had jerked his head up at the house i have no doubt of that hed said savagely giving his wrench a hard crank and id be obliged if youd be my introduction so that was how he found himself now on dusty high street holding his fast auto to a chugging crawl she did not in the least like while curious urchins came out to watch him pass now he had not as a rule held himself aloof from broom in the old days he wasnt at all averse to a pint or a meal at broom hall inn he tried to make some sort of a point of knowing a bit about his villagers and hed had a good memory for names and faces and it was a shock a real shock to see what was going on now there was a woman delivering the mail he thought it might be aurora cook the postman had been howard sydneysonthe postmaster had been thomas price who were both something like thirty gone of course by now conscripted neither job came under the heading of vital to the needs of the nation david toback had been the constableanother shock came when reggie saw poor old sixtyyearold thomas lament making the rounds in his stead what would he do to a miscreant talk them to death it was a good thing that most of the troublemakers were gone tooalso conscripted or else told by the judge it was the infantry or jail carlton mckenneys blacksmith shop was closed there were no sons to take his place at the forge and blacksmithing was no job for a daughter thank heaven for a moment of normalitystephen kirbys apothecary shop was still open with kirby in itbut then the poor man was the next thing to blind and his wife morgan had to read out all of the doctors prescriptions to him not good on the front line the saddlery was closed reggie bit his lip remembering that one of the last things he had done before going off to the rfc flying college at oxford was to take his hunting saddle down there for repairs he finally stopped glancing to the side there always seemed to be more bad news than there was good finally budd directed him to park next to a whitewashed twostory building he wouldnt have known was a pub except for the sign the broom over the door here we are milord budd said getting out now dont you mind mad ross hell probably be on you the minute youre inside reggie raised an eyebrow if i cant manage ross ashley im in worse condition than i thought he said wryly budd held open the door for him and the two of them entered reggie going first his cane thudding on the dark wooden floor like a third foot it was dark inside with a low beamed ceiling and plastered walls that hadnt been painted in some time and had turned the color of perfect toast the usual pub furniture big inglenook fireplace at one end nothing roasting on it though whole pigs were hard to come by these days just a little bit of a fire to keep the chill off all eyes were on them as they stepped up to the bar thisll be budd began reggie fenyx reggie said gently he held out his hand to the barman who took it gingerly thomas brennan sir the man said whatll it be gents bitter said reggie and stout said budd they took their drinks both in good pint glasses solid and substantial thatll be my round then said reggie loud enough for the rest of the pub to hear and cast a look around to make sure that everyone did hear him then he left a pound note casually on the bar and one for yourself he added to brennan let me know when that runs out thenkee sir the barman made the pound note vanish there wasnt a rush for the bar more of an orderly shuffle everyone seemed to know his place in the pecking order and no one was in such a tearing hurry as to care to dare to jump the queue budd and reggie took a little table at the back of the place to wait for people to come to them and predictably the first was ross ashley stumping over to them with determination on his face and a pint in one hand and before he could say a word reggie beat him to it take a chair ross he said mildly dont stand there and sing the red flag at me you couldnt carry a tune to save your soul and i already know all the words budd kicked a chair over to ashley who all the wind knocked out of his sails took it now old man if youre more of the share the wealth sort of socialist and not the murder the oppressors in their beds sort i think we can talk said reggie as the rest of the pub denizens pretended to be very interested in their beers while their ears were stretched to the furthest extent if you persuade me of a few things youre a good enough speaker and you arent too mad i might be persuaded to help you stand for parliament but youd better be able to make a good speech and prepared to live up to what you promise in it now rosss mouth was opening and closing like a stranded fishs reggie was quite enjoying himself at this pointa sardonic sort of enjoyment but more amusement than hed had since the day emily welsh his nurse in the hospital had tipped a matchbox with a live spider in it into a particularly abusive doctors pocket and when the man had gone to light his cigar served him right too acting as if the vads were his personal slaveys now he wasnt going to do anything malicious to ross who he recalled as being passionate but not particularly obnoxious the man probably resented having one of the gentry the oppressive ruling class invading his pub and reggie didnt blame him but he was tired of class separation he was tired of officer and enlisted he was tired of rfc and fbi and he was tired to death of the boundaries between men that the war should have broken down and smashed to bits by now he would have to take his fathers seat in the house of lords eventuallyif he didnt do himself firstbut he damned well would like to see a man in commons for this district that had some ideas that werent spawned in the seventeenth century finally ross managed to say something youll not be bribing me reginald fenyx he growled youll not be paying me off with the promise of a seat of course i wont i dont intend to reggie took a pull on his pint and sighed he was very glad that budd had brought him here if nothing else brennan could brew and its not a promise of a seat its a promise of support youll have to win the seat yourself if you cant persuade people to vote for you too bad i want a fellow from here wholl argue for the people even if its against me better butting heads in parliament than storming the walls of longacre ashley regarded him with a remnant of suspicion for a moment and i can say what i like i wouldnt begin to try to stop you reggie said sincerely just remember you arent recruiting for the socialists if you do go out there for a seat youll be stumping for votes thats two different things about as different as fbi and the sixtyminute men once again ross sat there opening and closing his mouth a few times before stopping it by taking a pull of his pint you are the damndest fellow i ever did see he said coming up out of the glass at last reggie looked around at the scarred faces the missing limbs the haunted looks i think were all damned ross he said quietly i think this is hells own waitingroom and i think we might as well make good company for each other while were still here with alison and the girls out of the house for a little eleanor hastily painted the glyph on the hearthstone with her sprig of rosemary which worked better than the wand actually cracked it in half and slipped out the back door and the back gate what she wanted was a newspaper and gossip in that order it never failed to amaze her every time that she slipped out how no one ever recognized her not even the people she knew well their eyes just slipped past her almost as if they actually could not see her if something happened such as physically bumping into someone the person in question would look down at her in puzzlement or irritation as if they could not imagine where she had sprung from and depending on their natures pass on with a vague smile or an annoyed frown without saying a word then again as a scullery maid she didnt warrant a second glance much less an apology iswear if this is ever over i will hunt down ross ashley and become a socialist the newspaper could be found on the top of morgan kirbys dustbin neatly folded an old one of course but old was better than none the gossip could be heard by creeping under the window of nancy barbers hairdressing establishment and listening there her husband had been the eponymous barber of the village but he was gone and nancy had children to feed so the barbershop became a ladies hairdressing salon where esoteric creations like marcel waves were produced the very daring or very young had their hair bobbed and the gossip flowed eleanor crept into place beneath the window just in time to catch the tail end of a sentence oh definitely back colonel davies the stationmaster saw him when he got off the train and his people sent a car down for him from longacre longacre well either they were talking about a guest or reggie fenyx was back from the war well how did he look someone asked the colonel said none too healthy replied the first speaker sounding uncertain though what he meant by that i cant say it could be anything a third woman said with resignation men have no notion well he was wounded i should think he has every right to look unhealthy said the first whats more interesting to me is that his mother lady devlin is having tea right this minute with alison robinson and her two girls no what really the replies came quickly too quickly for the speaker to answer and now i understand why she was in such a pother over going to tea its not just that its lady devlin and nobby society its reggie unmarried reggie and her with two pretty daughters too hmm said the owner of the third voice thoughtfully well we know where the wind blows there social climber said the second with contempt so broom society isnt good enough for milady robinson be fair she never said anything about being gentry said the first some nob relative of hers sent lady devlin a letter about her at least now shell stop her girls angling for every lad with a bit in his pocket here said the second not that theyre so many on the ground anymore but still with your tamara about giggled the third those chits didnt have a chance oh i wish youd seen them at the christmas party swanning about in their fashionable london frocks and in comes tamara in her twoyearold velvet from glennis white and there go all the officers oh their faces were a sight fine feathers arent everything the mother of the village beauty tamara budd said complacently nor when it comes to it is a pretty face if theres a mean nasty heart behind it eleanor didnt have to hide a smirk since there was no one to see her if there was a single soul in all of the village that her stepsisters hated truly hated it was tamara budd she had been pretty when eleanor had been locked within the walls of the house now evidently she had blossomed into true beauty for any time some entertainment was on offer be it a teadance for soldiers or a gathering at some house or at the broom hall inn according to the girls it was tamara who was the center of male attention there was no doubt that the stepsisters would have killed or disfigured her if they could eleanor could tell that from the vicious things they said the way they stabbed their cigarettes in the air the mere tone that their voices took when they spoke about her for her part she might have been alarmed that they would succeed in doing tamara harm except that she also heard them complaining that something protected their rival from any charms or cantrips they attempted to cast she had a good idea that it might be sarah who was responsible but you never knew she listened a while longer but it was clear enough that there was nothing more to hear and it would not be long before alison and girls returned from their tea with lady devlin she crept out of hiding and hurried back to the kitchen with her purloined newspaper hidden in the folds of her skirt from there it went underneath the pile of logs for the stove and the kitchen fire there wasnt a chance that either of the girls nor alison would move a single one of those logs now that she had gotten outsideand discovered what shocking changes had happened to the world that she had knownshe was afire to find out how much more had been happening not that any of it had been good she had read with horror of ships being torpedoed by german submarines and sent to the bottom with most of their human cargoeven hospital ships bombs had actually been dropped on parts of london and the eastern coast by both zeppelins and huge aeroplanes and several hundred perfectly innocent people had been blown to bits as for the war itself her head reeled to think about it and she knew she was getting no more than the barest most sanitized idea of what was going on from the papers how could something be a glorious victory when all it got you was possession of a long trench a hundred yards east of where you had been when an assault starteda trench you had occupied several times already only to have been driven out of it by the germanswho doubtless also crowed about their glorious victory she couldnt help but wonder was this how her father had died no one had ever told her the details all that she had ever known was that he was dead she had nightmares about it sometimes that he was blown to pieces by a shell that he was killed in a charge that he was shot by a sniper that he died instantly or that he had lain in agony for hours while his fellow soldiers watched unable to help him it was horrible she woke from those dreams sobbing and only seeking solace from the little salamanders in her fire helped she sighed and went to work on dinner preparations the girls were going to get chicken stew and dumplings and like it for it was the only way to stretch the poor thin chicken that had come by way of the butcher shop today so reggie fenyx was home againand looking ill and had been wounded she could not imagine the energetic young man boiling over with enthusiasm that she had known as being ill or hurt such a thing never seemed possible but she couldnt imagine him in a uniform either she couldnt think of him as shooting people and killing them he had always seemed so gentle in his way as she chopped vegetables she reflected that now she knew why alison was so afire over the invitation to tea with lady devlinso much so that the girls had left frocks spread all over their rooms for her to pick up trying on this one and that one until alison was satisfied with their appearance it all made perfect sense alison wanted to get invitations up to longacre park so that the girls would have an unrestricted chance to snare reggie she chopped savagely at the old withered carrots miserable creatures they would do nothing other than make poor reggie unhappy here he was coming home in a weakened state and they were going to descend on him like vultures to nibble on the carcass but wait a moment hadnt sarah said that the fenyx family were elemental masters she had eleanor felt her shoulders unknot of course reggie was an air master alisons girls would have no more chance of bewitching him than of taking one of his aeroplanes up by themselves but that opened up another thought if reggie was an air master wouldnt he be able to see the magic spells on her and even if he couldnt do anything about them himself couldnt he tell someone who could her heart fluttered in her throat at the very idea dont get your hopes up she scolded herself severely first you have to get out of here then you have to be somewhere that he is and last he has to be willing to help you still the mere chance of a hope was more than shed had in a long time i can at least make plans april broom warwickshire so the bloody yanks finally decided to give us a hand then that was matt brennan the barmans brother poor matt had lost a leg and his arm had been terribly mangled and half the time seemed to have lost his speech as well brother thomas kept him on as potman collecting the glasses doing a bit of sweeping up and let him sleep somewhere on the premises once the place was closed it wasnt much but it was work the news had finally percolated to broom that the united states had actually joined the war that the rest of the world had been fighting for the past three years and it was likely to be the sole topic of conversation here in this pub for the rest of the week everyone who came in started it over again what dye think of them yanks captain ross ashley asked never caught sight of one myself well reggie said measuring his words carefully we got quite a few yanks in the rfc boys that wouldnt sit still and watch while someone else was having a fight i heard the french picked up a few especially in the foreign legion so they got the gumption to stick it ye think asked will stevens who had been a good yeoman farmer before the war began and was again just without three fingers on his right hand reggie shrugged hard to tell really the ones i saw all seemed to think of themselves as being in some sort of wild west show talked about flying by the seat of the pants didnt pay a lot of attention to instruction and tended to be thirtyminute men if that though when they were good enough to survive they were quite good i dont know what their infantry will be like young albert norman chest wound lost a lung coughed and cleared his throat mind he coughed a great deal but this was the sort of cough he used when about to say something there are a great many of them he said carefully its a bigger country than canada and i shouldnt think it would be too terribly difficult for them to turn all those factories to making armaments reggie nodded albeit was well read reggie didnt doubt in the least that he had the right of it so doug baird shrapnel to the legs said bitterly well have fought the kaiser to a standstill for three bloody years and the yanks will just come in with convoys of fresh troops and all the damned supplies you could ask for roll over the trenches and take credit for the whole thing then reggie sighed to be brutally honest he didnt see it turning out any other way but he decided not to say anything these men were bitter enough without his adding to their discontentor despair at least it will be over richard bowen said with resignation thats all i care about just let it be over thomas brennan cleared his throat last call gentlemen my round again reggie said decisively he did a lot of roundbuyingnot so much as to make it seem as if he was patronizing them but because he knew very well that there was not a lot of money to spare in their households and it seemed a hard thing to him to have a man leave bits of himself in france in the service of his country only to find he couldnt afford his pint when he came home again a hard thing and a wicked cruel thing there wasnt a lot of pleasure left in the world for these men those that had gone back to their workfarmers mostlywere finding it difficult those who hadnt lost limbs outright still had injuries bad enough to muster them out legs didnt work right anymore arms didnt have the same strength they found themselves depending on their wives or children to help them with difficult physical jobs and that was humiliating often the young horses theyd depended on to help with plowing had been taken for the war leaving only the old fellows who should have been taking up pasturespace they found themselves with a house full of land girls who might or might not be of any use nothing was the same everything was more difficult and what had they gotten out of it all nothing to speak of the best the very best that they could say was that because they were at the production end of the food supply it was easier for them to hide a bit from the government and circumvent some of the shortages if you were a farmer you could still have your sweets if you made do with honey instead of sugar and though sugar was rationed for tea it was oddly enough not rationed for jammakingyou could hide a pig in your woodlot or raise rabbits openly since rabbitmeat wasnt in short supply when you brought your wheat to david miller hed generally forget about a few of the bags of white flour he loaded back on your cart and if you had a cow of your own your kiddies werent forced to drink that thin blue skimmed milk that made the city children so thin and palelooking but that was the best you could say for the rest between rationing and scarcity the prices were up and what you got for your produce was the same as it had been before the war just about someone was making a profit but it wasnt you and if you didnt own or lease a farmwell things were very hard indeed sometimes you couldnt do your old job and it was hard to find a new one especially around here so if reggie could help out a little by buying more than his share of rounds it seemed a small thing mater wouldnt like it by half if she knew where i was going of a night hanging about with socialists but what she doesnt know she cant object to im more welcome here than there her father had gotten so poisonously aggressive in his accusations of malingering of late that even she had started to protest weakly never mind that there were days reggie couldnt leave his room days when he locked the door and spent half the day crouched in a corner like a terrified mouse too afraid to so much as move acting was what grandfather sutton would have called it oh yes acting as if he enjoyed spending his time huddled behind the furniture too afraid to make a sound and completely unable to say what it was he was afraid of only knowing that the bottom was out of the universe and doom was upon him but there was a letter in reggies pocket right now that might well prove to be the old mans undoing the address on the envelope said it all brigadier eric mann ret the elms dorcester the brigadier had been a great friend of reggies fatherhe had more experience in a single month with actual combat than grandfather sutton had in his entire career his letter had been phrased with great delicacy but reggie had no difficulty whatsoever in interpreting it the brigadier had heard about reggies injuries he actually knew what life was like on the front and he wanted to come visit and offer whatever support he could and although in general the very last thing that reggie wanted at the moment was a parade of visitors through longacre this was one letter he had answered as soon as he had read it in the affirmative the brigadier did know what life was like on the front he had been there how reggie had no idea how he had managed to get out therebut the little hed read in the letter told him that eric mann knew what conditions were really like the brigadier would not tolerate any nonsense from grandfather sutton with any luck once they butted heads a time or two sutton would elect to clear out and go back to his club in london and leave reggie in peace at the very least he would keep his mouth shut as long as the brigadier was there reggie could hardly wait time gentlemen thomas called recalling him to his present surroundings there was little more than a half inch of bitter in his glass he swallowed it down with appreciation left a little something under the glass for matt to find stood up and pulled on his driving coat that was one good thing about having an auto over a horse he didnt have to worry about leaving a horse standing tied up for hours on the other hand the auto wont get you home by itself if youre drunk he made his farewells and went out into the night he really couldnt bear watching the others make their way home it was just too heartbreaking if a man staggered away from his favorite pub of an evening it should be because hed had just a wee bit too much not because his legs were too painful to hold him nor because one leg was gone and he wasnt used to walking on the wooden one instead he paid excruciatingly careful attention to getting the auto started by the time hed done they were all gone he climbed stiffly into the drivers seat and chugged away well there goes that reggie fenyx again sarah said as the unfamiliar sound of an automobile engine chugged past the front of her cottage eleanor looked up from the runes of warding that she had been learning how do you know sarah snorted and who else is it that would be leaving thomas brennans pub after last call in a motorcar she asked rhetorically doctor sutherlands choice is the public bar at the broom hall inn when he goes anywhere steven zachary hasnt got a motor of his own yet the vicar doesnt drink in public so there you are besides i happen to know the lads that have all been mustered out have taken the place over since matt came home and i expect he feels more at ease there among them than anywhere else eleanor looked down at the little firepot she was using its horrible isnt it it was a statement not a question its horrible and they cant talk to anyone else about it well they could sarah replied somewhat to eleanors surprise they could talk to their wives their sweethearts their mothers were stronger than they think they keep thinking they have to protect us from whatever it is that they went through so there they are suffering behind closed mouths building walls to protect us they say but its all so we wont see theyre weak she shook her head as if we dont but there it is silly isnt it that they darent let us see them as less than strong eleanor looked up and lifted an eyebrow i think i see why you never married sarah she replied with irony sarah laughed well and i reckoned if i wanted something thatd come and go as he pleased take me for granted and ignore me when he chose id get a cat and if i wanted something id always have to be picking up after getting into trouble but slavishly devoted id get a dog eleanor shook her head and went back to her firepot which was a little castiron pot on three legs full of coals over which flames danced bluely she was learning to write runes in the fire which was the first step to making it answer her a salamander was coiled in the bottom of the pot just above the coals it watched her with interest and hissed a warning when she was just starting to go wrong her moment of inattention made it hiss again and sarah paused to look down at it theyre not supposed to do that you know she said in surprise warn you that is its almost like its trying to help you i think it is eleanor said canceling the rune with a wave of her wand and holding out her hand to the pot the salamander uncoiled itself and leapt out of the pot circled her wrists like ferret three or four times then leapt back into the pot sarah shook her head theyre not supposed to do that id not have believed it if id been told theres summat about you they like i hope so she replied aye well theyre not so changeable as air and water though be wary you dont go angering them sarah warned theyre quick to anger and they neer forget nor forgive eleanor nodded and bent back to her work but part of her mind was on reggie wondering if carolyn and lauralee had been introduced to him yet if theyd started trying to charm him yet it made her angry that thought andyesjealous which made no sense at all he probably didnt even remember her and if he did it was as nothing more than a hoydenish tomboy a silly little girl with a wild notion of becoming a scholar he probably wouldnt remember her even if someone reminded him of her and as for now he wouldnt look at her twice she certainly was so far beneath his notice that if they passed on the same side of the street he wouldnt even see her not really stop thinking about reggie she scolded herself get your mind on your work because if you cant learn this soon alison and her girls will have him and then where will you be dont bother fixing anything for tea ellie alison called through the open kitchen door were having it at longacre in fact eleanor could not help but hear the gloating sound in her voice well be having our tea at longacre for the foreseeable future yes maam eleanor said dutifully but her heard leapt tea at longacre park and for the foreseeable future that would mean she would be able to get away for the whole afternoon of course alison would see it as another privationif she wasnt permitted to get out teathings for her stepmother and the girls she wouldnt be able to make any tea for herself which meant that she would have to wait until suppertime for a meal or so alison thought well thats what i want her to think so eleanor contrived to look disappointed and hungry though she was neither she could hardly contain her excitement as alison and her girls bundled up into the motor and chugged off in the direction of longacre park and the moment she was sure they werent going to return she wrote her runes on the hearthstone and was off like a shot the sky was bright and blue the wind high and she only had a few hoursbut she knew where she wanted to be down at the opposite end of the six thousand or so acres of longacre in the round meadow in a little copse of trees at the end of what she still thought of as the aeroplane field no one would see her there no one ever went there she was half mad to get out of the house for some sun and air and this was the farthest alisons spell would let her go she wrapped up a couple of slices of bread and jam for her own tea broke her sprig of rosemary and left half on the hearthstone flung on a coat and ran out the door she wasnt even entirely sure what she was running from maybe it waswelleverything her own imprisonment the war news alisons glee and the girls gloating and fear fear so much fearnow she knew she had a chance to set herself free and she was afraid afraid she would never learn all she needed to afraid that she would never be able to command her element as skillfully as alison could and would lose and her imprisonment would be even harsher than it was now afraid that ever if she did escape no one would believe what she had to tell them and she would accomplish nothing or worse than nothingthat shed be locked up as mad or given back over to alison or else would have to turn drudge for someone else in order to put food in her stomach and a roof over her head in a way things were worse than before before shed had no hope and so nothing to lose nownow she had hope and all to lose so she ran hoping to outrun her own fear and uncertainty hoping to outrun the bleak air of depression that hung over the entire town hoping to get to one place where none of this mattered where she could just be for a few hours and pretend that there was no war there was no alison that the days of peace and plenty were still upon them all and that when she came back to the house her father would still be alive and waiting to share supper with her she pushed herself so hard trying to outrun her very thoughts that she arrived at the meadow winded and out of breath and flung herself down in the middle of the clear space among the trees to lie on her back in the old dry grass and look up at the clouds and pant and it was glorious because she could just empty her mind and not think not about anything or anyone and just stare up into the blue and watch nothing she could in fact have lain there forever with the warm sun shining down on her at that moment cutting free of alison and just going finding someone else to work for didnt seem so bad an idea except if she did this to me and to papa what would she do to reggie the question struck her like a thunderbolt out of the blue sky but at that moment she knew that if either carolyn or lauralee married reggie fenyx no matter how strong his air magic was he would remain alive no longer than her father had she sat bolt upright at the thought and a yelp of strangled fear met her sudden appearance out of the grass she twisted around onto her knees to face the sound and found herself staring into the white face of reggie fenyx he was sitting on a fallen treetrunk at the edge of the tiny meadow quite alone and clearly her sudden appearance had frightened the wits out of him as he stared at her with wild wide eyes all she could think of to do was to hold out her hand and say soothingly im sorryi beg your pardonim really very sorry he trembled as he stared at her as if he didnt quite recognize her for what she was and then quite suddenly she saw sense come into his gaze and of course he did recognize her and passed a hand over his pale face nono he said finally no its quite all right its just my nerves i wasnt expecting anyonethat is i thought i was alone no one ever used to come down to this part of longacre but me well she said slowly getting to her feet brushing down her threadbare skirt with one hand and wondering hesitantly if she should leave that isnt quite true but most of the people who used to come here are gone gone that would bethe boys wouldnt it his hand was still over his eyes and still trembling yes not boys any longer though and they would be gone wouldnt they even the youngest with an effort he took his hand away from his eyes and looked at her again she was horribly ashamed of how shabby she was but he didnt notice or at least if he did he wasnt letting on he squinted at her and then managed a tremulous smile youre that little tomboy eleanor robinson from the village arent you only not such a little tomboy anymore the smile faded i heard about your father im dreadfully sorry she looked down at her hands clasped together in front of her thank you she said quietly then she looked back up again she kept her frown to herself but but wasnt he supposed to be an air master yet there were none of the energies none of the elementals of air anywhere about him why he showed no more of magic thanthan the schoolmaster michael stone less surely that wasnt right so do you come and invade my private property often he was asking trying to sound normal trying to make an ordinary conversation of the sort he could so easily back before the war began and now she found herself fighting against the prohibitions of alisons other spells she would have liked to say when i can escape my stepmothers spell or when no one is going to catch me and make my life a purgatory but all she could say was when i can then she sighed its so peaceful here and sometimes i cant bear how things are now here nothings changed its all the way it wasbefore the meadow probably hasnt changed in a hundred years thats a good answer eleanor robinson he replied thats a very good answer and i give you leave to come here whenever you want its the reason i came down herewell i tell a lie its one of the reasons he smiled wanly my teatime has been unconscionably invaded and i came to escape the enemy she furrowed her brow in puzzlement and stepped forward a pace or two enemy she asked uncertainly women he elaborated a gaggle of women invited by my mother with malice and intent those that werent there on their own to simper and flirt at me were mothers eyeing the goods before they set their own daughters on the scent he shuddered i felt like the only fox in the county with three hunts in the field at once she couldnt help it she had to laugh at that especially considering that alison and the girls must have been in that group he so openly despised and they thought they were the only ones with an invitation to tea that was more than enough to make her smile oh they would be so angry when they came home they hadnt reckoned on there being competition they should have though reggie would have been quite a prize before the war and now with so many young men dead in france and flanders he was an even greater prize and the best part was that they would be blaming one another alison would be blaming the girls for not being sufficiently charming to keep reggie there and the girls would be blaming their mother for not knowing this was going to be a competition staged by reggies mother inadvertently or on purpose there was not a single thing that any of them could blame on her so they would make poisonous jibes at each other or stare sullenly all through dinner and meanwhile here he was the object of their hunt hiding from them ill go if you want to be alone she offered it only seemed fair hed come here to be alone hadnt he i justi just wanted to go somewhere today where i could pretend thatall thathadnt happened at least for a while i wanted the same thing he said and somehow the wistful yet completely hopeless way in which he said it made her heart ache for him andno miss robison eleanor she said instantly he smiled a little then if i am to call you eleanor you must promise to call me reggie no please dont go im not much company but i dont want to think ive driven you away from the only peaceful place you can find he patted the treetrunk beside him in a kind of halfhearted invitation to sit instead she sat down in the grass at his feet he looked a great deal different from the last time she had seen him and it wasnt just the little moustache or the closecropped military haircut he was very pale and every movement had a nervous quality to it like one of those highbred miniature greyhounds that never seems entirely sure something isnt going to step on it or snatch it up and bite it in two he was also very thin much thinner than she remembered him being and his eyes his grayblue eyes were the saddest things about him haunted was the very expression she would have used had anyone asked her these were eyes that had seen too much too much loss too much horror she felt tonguetied at a loss for anything to say to him and it was clear that he felt the same finally she said in desperation knowing that the topic of an automobile was at least safe i heard your motorcar go past the other night is it a very fast one with relief he seized the neutral subject as a drowning man seizes a plank and went into exacting excruciating detail about the auto she had to admit although she didnt care a jot about the insides of the thing the other things he could tell her about the auto itself were fascinating evidently its type had won many races and there was no doubt that he was as proud of it as he had been of his aeroplane and something instinctively warned her about not talking about flying though she couldnt have told what perhaps it was the vague recollection of hearing his wounds had come when he had crashed perhaps it was because he himself didnt bring the subject up and before he had gone off to the war that had been the one thing in his life he had been the most passionate about when he ran out of things to tell her about his motorcar she asked about what he had read for at oxford and what his friends had been like he relaxed more and more as he spoke of these things and she thought she just might be doing him some good finally when he looked as if he was searching a little too hard for another good story she smiled and asked i have some bread and jam would you like to share my tea and at that he laughed weakly and quoted better a dinner of herbs where love is yes thank you i should very much like to share your tea and he reached down behind the trunk of the tree and brought up an old rucksack rummaging around in it for a moment well yes good my old instincts have not failed me as i fled the harpies i carried off provender i can provide drink i have two bottles of gingerbeer with great solemnity he opened the bottles and handed her one she passed over half of her slightly squashed jam sandwiches i think it was very rude of your mother not to have warned you that guests were coming she said bluntly after they clinked bottles especially so many that was not at all fair yes well if shed told me id have done the bunk beforehand now wouldnt i he replied logically i suppose now ill have to find some excuse to avoid teatime every day from now on oh dont do thatshell just invite them to supper or something equally inconvenient eleanor exclaimed no the thing to do she screwed up her face as she thought hard the thing to do is to sit through it once in a while every other day or every third day or the like only have something some appointment or task later in the afternoon that you have to do so you can excuse yourself after an hour or two that way your mother wont ever know when exactly youre going to take tea with her and you will have a good escape ready by jove eleanor i think that will work and i know my estate manager will be only too ruddy pleased to have me in the office as often as possible so i can make that my excuse he actually looked happy wanly happy but definitely for one moment happy you should be a tactician old girl and just at that most pleasant moment she felt the first faint tugging of alisons hearthspell and looked down to see the sprig of rosemary pinned to the breast of her shirtwaist starting to wilt she could have cursed i have to go she exclaimed jumping to her feet im really sorry but i must whats the hurry he asked in bewilderment as she shoved the empty gingerbeer bottle into his hands i say i havent said anything to offend you have i no no no i just have to get back i dont have a choice she shook her head and felt the sting of disappointed tears in her eyes its nothing to do with you i enjoyed talking with you i have to oror or ill be in trouble she shook her head and turned away well at least say youll be here tomorrow he called after her as she began to run across the grass i cant she called back over her shoulder then at the sight of his stricken face she made a reckless promise ill comeill come whenever i can at teatime whenever i can and with that she had to turn to race back to the house back to captivity an imprisonment that was now more onerous than it ever had seemed before april broom warwickshire dinner was not pleasant tonight animosity and suspicion hung over the table like the cloud of cigarette smoke rising above the heads of all three of the robinsons at the table i dont understand it alison said glaring at her daughters he hasnt shown the least bit of interest in either of you that is justunnatural it wasnt my spells mama carolyn said petulantly tossing her head you checked them yourself you watched me work them she looked sideways at her sister unless you interfered but alison wasnt accepting that excuse she didnt interfere dont you think i would be able to tell alison snarled no its not that ive never seen anyone who was so unaffected by spells and thats not natural even men with no magic at all respond to sexcharms eleanor was unashamedly eavesdropping and by a means that her stepmother would never guess if alison came to look she would find eleanor stoically peeling potatoes at the hearth staring into the fire little did she guess that what eleanor was staring at was not the flames she had learned a new spell or to be more precise she had improvised it out of a scrying spell in sarahs grimoire that was supposed to use mirrors linking the mirrors together like a transmitter and a wireless radio so that whatever was reflected in the target mirror was reflected in the one that the scryer held only instead of mirrors eleanor was using the flames on the hearth in the kitchen and the one in the diningroom it had been very odd actuallysarah had been struck dumb when she first tried it and she could not imagine where she had gotten the idea that such a thing would work either it justcame to her as she was reading the grimoire as if someone had told it to her now it was as if she was looking out from the fireplace there and what was more she was able to hear everything that went on as clearly as if she was sitting right there it isnt only sexcharms he doesnt respond to lauralee said stabbing her cigarette down into the center of her plate i tried to make him loathe that leva cygnet girl and instead he sat next to her at teal and i thought you said he was an air master mama interrupted carolyn but i havent seen a single sylph anywhere about him nor any hint of magic are you sure hes an air master and when carolyn said that eleanor watched alison go through the most curious pantomime she had ever seen in her life alison opened her mouth to say somethingthen a puzzled look came over herthen she closed her mouth opened it again closed it and frowned the girls stared at her as if they had never seen their mother so nonplussed either eleanor wondered what it meant no sylphs about alison said consideringly as if the sylphs do not recognize him as having air mastery either no zephyrs they cant see himim sure thats what that means and yet no shields either as if as if he is a magical cipher a null actually mama lauralee said reflectively its more as if the spells we cast on him are just swallowed up drained away carolyn echoed or reflected but not back at us how odd then i believe we are going to have to rethink our strategy alison brooded i wanted him to be attracted to you before i went to work more directly i am going to need to make new plans what new plans mama lauralee asked leaning forward over the table eagerly are you going to teach us new magic eleanor watched as alison rubbed her hands along her arms uneasily well the magic that you two can cast is clearly not going to work in fact i would say he is probably resistant to all but the most powerful magic both of them gazed at their mother with hunger now eleanor had wondered ever since sarah had come to the door if alison had been purposefully holding back teaching her daughters or if her daughters were just not capable of greater magic it was hard to tellthough it was true that none of the earth elementals were attracted to the girls now she heard the answer or at least the answer that alison was going to give them im afraid my dears you have no more inborn ability with magic than warrick locke and i dont think at this point it would be wise to use my greater magics for more than i already have planned so instead of using magic use your wiles show no jealousy of the other girls but be the most pleasant and charming creatures in the room pay attention to everything he does and says work out what pleases him and what he would prefer not to deal with be sympathetic and find things to get his mind off the war that will do for now meanwhile i will need to do some research of my own eleanor had wondered about that her own feeling once she had begun learning about magic herself had been that neither girl would ever be a masterbecause if that were possible for them they would have surely shown some sign of it by now yes mama the two chorused as one they left the table to go up to their rooms as alison rang for eleanor to clean up is that why reggie recognized me when no one else in the village does she wondered as she carried plates back to the kitchen because alisons spells just dont work on him it hadnt been until she had gotten back to the kitchen after first meeting him that she had realized reggie had recognized her had known who she was almost from the first moment he had seen her other than sarah he was apparently the only other person who did and she hadnt been able to get away to ask sarah why that could be since the meeting events in the household had conspired against her first despite alisons assertion that she and the girls would be having tea up at longacre for the foreseeable future that hadnt exactly come to pass the next day had been alisons at home and although alison certainly wanted to claw her way into the social circles of longacre she knew better than to abandon her post as leading light of broom for one thing there were quite a number of things that the ladies of broom could do to undermine alisons progress if they chose and for another as she explained to her daughters there was no point in prematurely burning bridges the social set of broom was still usefulparticularly that centered around the vicarage for the vicar donald hinshaw and his wife theresa were the one couple who traveled socially freely between village and the big house then the next day had been a meeting of the ladies friendly society and it had been held at the arrows though under the auspices of its president amy hammer it had been yet another bandagerolling meeting and as a consequence the house had been filled with women all of whom required tea and refreshments now those meetings were ones at which eleanor had to be particularly careful of what was served it wouldnt do at all to make it look as if this household was immune from the current privationsbut at the same time alison was adamant that the tea be something that would elevate her status as a hostess it all came down on eleanors shoulders of course it meant a great deal of cutting up heavy brown bread into thin thin slices toasting it delicately and removing the crusts spreading it with layers of jam and potted shrimp it meant cutting more waferthin slices of brown bread and adding waferthin slices of smoked scottish salmon atop it meant baking whatever sort of cake could be managed with what was available in the village shops so that pretty well put paid to getting away that day and the next warrick locke had come for the afternoon it had been all about business and legal papers there was a good clue now to which sort of business was going on when locke showed up if it was mundane business he brought with him his personal secretary a curiously opaque lady named jennifer summers as well as his man robbie christopher eleanor was not around miss summers enough to make a judgment of her but robbie made her flesh crawl there was just something not right about him as a consequence she kept well out of their way locke spent the entire afternoon closeted with alison going over any number of matters concerning the manufactories he might be a horrible man but he did know his business so that meant no leaving the house on that day finally though today had sent alison and the girls out into the village on a series of meetings and whatnot concerning the annual may day fete for the church which brought them home exhausted and made them perfect targets for sarahs herbspell they were in bed by nine and fast asleep by ten all three of them and eleanor was free to cast her spell and run to sarahs cottage sarah wasnt aloneannette monstead the village midwifeintraining and sister to eric the village sexton was with her discussing a possibly difficult case rather than intrude eleanor didnt even knock she just waited outside until annette left it was scarcely a hardship it was a beautiful evening the kind on whichbefore the warcourting couples would go out walking though that walking sometimes resulted in cases for annette proper young ladies werent supposed to know about that sort of thing but eleanor had never been proper as suchand since the war there was if not actually condoning of such matters certainly more understanding of them and of the acts of desperation that led to an unexpected pregnancy a fellow could get emergency leave at least to get as far as london for a day or two to put things right there was not so much counting of months between the weddingday and the day of the babys arrival eric turned up to escort his sister homehe too was above the conscription age though his sister was at least twenty years younger he was the eldest and she the youngest of a truly enormous family not so much a family as a tribe in fact small wonder annette had turned out to have a talent for midwifery only after they were gone out of sight did eleanor knock on sarahs door and let herself in ive met reggie she burst out unable to hold herself back and sarahhe recognized me well and he would wouldnt he being an air master she began but this time eleanor interrupted her yes but theres no sylphs around him and no air energy she continued and went on to describe what she had learned watching the fire night after night when she was finished sarah stood next to her own hearth arms folded over her chest tapping her foot hmm thats a different kettle of fish altogether it almost sounds like but then she frowned and shook her head no i dont know and its not right to speculate i dont know nearly as much as your mother did and sending you off in the wrong direction wouldnt do either of you any good sarah eleanor cried indignantly at least give me a hint sarah pursed her lips and ran her hand through her hair well if i were to guess and not being a master i have no business in guessing i would say that something happened to him to make him afraid of using any magic now when a master decides not to use any magic none at all sometimes they stop thinking straight and their heartnot their heads the thinking parts put the heart the feeling partis so frightened that the heart decides that means no magic by anyone else is going to get used around them either so magic around them gets kind ofswallowed up things that the heart decides usually happen unless the head is well in charge sarah shrugged but thats just a guess people like me dont have enough magic to do that sort of thing but if thats the case then why couldnt i tell him about alison she asked feeling desperate now why didnt that spell stop working sarah grimaced but with an air as if it should have been obvious to eleanor that she had no idea why these things had happened or not dont know maybe because that spell is stronger maybe because the spell to keep people from recognizing you is set to work on them and the one to keep you from telling people the truth is set to work on you she shook her head i dont know im just guessing im not the master alison is nor the master your mother was i know ive had my own countercharms set that let me see you and talk to you freely but then i already knew what and who you were and i had a bit of your babyhair i could use to work them i dont know the complicated spells i never bothered to learn them im only strong enough to work cantrips and charms in the case of countering whats on you i can make them work for me but not other people unless i were to set the charm on each one of them and maybe all of this guessing is going wide of the mark ive no way to know it was terribly frustrating to know that she had someone within reach who probably could help her break the spells that were on her if only he knew what was going on was agonizing what do i do she wailed sarah gazed at her sternly you stop whingeing for one the witch replied it isnt going to help for another if you can find out what it is hes so afraid of maybe you can do somewhat about it do that and he may come out of that shell hes built around himself if you can crack that he should see youre set about with spells yourself and wonder why and try untangling them himself but you cant do any of that if youre wasting your time feeling sorry for yourself eleanor felt herself flush with anger but kept a curb on her tongue sarah was rightbut the witchs tongue got oversharp when shed had a long day and it wasnt as if eleanors day had been any shorter now in the meantime sarah was already continuing while youre here you might as well learn something if alison ever decides to challenge you master to master in a sorcerers duel your little salamanders arent going to be causing her more than a minute of amusement so you might as well start learning how to call the greater fire elementals and the best time is now well start with the phoenyx eleanor was quite ready to fall asleep on sarahs floor when the wilting of her rosemary sprig told her it was time to go when she got back she made up her bed on the kitchen floor again rather than take the chance of stumbling on the stairs and waking the household she thought she saw eyes in the embers as she drowsed offnot the golden eyes of the salamanders but a hot burning blue reggie showed up faithfully in the meadow at teatime every day though after the second day that the girl failed to materialize he had brought the bus with him so he could go on down to the pub if she didnt show up after the third day as he sat in the sun and listened to the wind in the grass watched the branches overhead with their haze of new green buds he wondered why he kept coming herethere was nothing very special about her well other than her quick wit and agile mind it wasnt as if she were especially pretty certainly not compared with all the elegant doelike creatures his mother kept trotting past him she was as raw as a young filly and just as awkward she seemed to be as poor as a churchmouse too from the state of her clothing that was odd as he recalled old robinson had been something in the way of a manufacturing fellow and when hed known her last the girl had certainly dressed well enough but maybe the money was all gone thanks to the war there were a lot of places that had failed couldnt get the raw goods they needed to keep making whatever it was they were making she looked as if she worked for a living maybe she was a maid now or a kitchengirl or maybe she worked in one of the other pubs or something maybe that was what she meant when she said shed be there if she could what was it about her that made him desert his mothers carefully gathered bouquet of wellbred beauties and come down here to sit on a log for an hour on the chance that she might appear she can talk for one thing she knows how to listen for another and when she talks she doesnt talk nonsense that was half of the reason why he hated those afternoon teas the inane chatter what was wrong with those girls anyway half of them acted as if the war didnt exist and the other half as if it existed only to inconvenience them she didnt talk about the warbut it wasnt because she was trying to play as if it wasnt going on it was as if she was avoiding the subject so as not to trouble me it occurred to him that if she was working working hard somewhere nowwell she wasnt going to be all that sheltered anymore maybe he could talk to her about some of the things you just didnt talk about among men all right to be bitter angry depressed all right even to admit to being whiteknuckle terrified in the night and ready to do a bunk all right even to admitting to want to take your faithful old wembley and stick the barrel in your mouth and but you didnt talk to another man about losing your sense of wonder and beauty you didnt tell him how your ideals were lying dead beside your comrades oh maybe you could with the rare fellow like one or two of his former oxford chums the ones that had written damn good poetry for instance not steven stewart for instance someone whod call you reg and talk about how he was going to start an air mail service when it was all over not walter boyes either plain as toast and solid as a rock but who was reading history and liked facts plain and simple maybe william howehe was sensitive enough just think about the stuff he pulled up for the regimental band to play not just marches and bombast but bach and handel but howe was still at the front daniel heistand one of the ghosts the men in the photos probably still on the canvas wall of his quarters a dead man with his arms around the shoulders of the living he was someone reggie could have talked to about this he hadnt written poetry he was a musician and not one of your ukulele players nor your accordion men he was a violinist and composed as well as played reggie remembered listening to him play during the pauses in the shelling on the long long nights when nobody could sleep playing some wistful haunting thing too melancholy to be a lullaby well he hadnt lasted six months a sixtyminute manthat was about how much time hed had in the seat before a hun in a fokker shot him down chris whitmore maybe hard to tell that mania hed had for photography might have been the stirrings of an artists nature or just that of a tinkerer he was supposed to be taking recon photos now last reggied heard in the sudan no bloody mud in the sudan not geoffrey cockburn that was certain the boy who put his motorcar into the ornamental pond next to the cricketgrounds because he was roaring drunk the night before vivas was not the sort to have a sensitive soul and no lyman evans either whod been pouring the bubbly in the first place maybe rene comeau he was one of the bettereducated french infantrymen attached to the air wing as local guards and the french well they were french they understood that sort of thing but rene was still over there toounless he was dead melancholy was certainly on him this afternoon and he desperately wanted someone to talk to about it oh not allan mcbain either that hardheaded scots engineer who cursed them all whenever one of his runways got a shellcrater or a bombcrater in it as if it was their fault though in a sense it wasif there hadnt been planes and pilots there no one would bother to shell or bomb mcbains runways vincent mills another sensitive ghost out of the past but this time a ghost that hadnt even made it to the front hed trained with reggie at the oxfordbased branch of the flying schooland hed been one of toofrequent fatalities theyd found him upsidedown in a tree neck broken a strange and puzzled look on his face as if he couldnt quite fathom what had gone wrong his demise had been a shock he was a good flyer perhaps the machine had done him wrong reggie still had one of his poems or at least it was folded into one of his books of sonnets back at the front an articulate yearning for higher skies no there wasnt anyone here and now and the girl was perhaps it was no bad thing that she wasnt pretty wasnt his class was in fact poor from all appearances she didnt look like the sort to read trashy romantic novels and dream of marrying the duke she looked like the sort who could be sensible shed certainly been more sensible than some of those boys whod flocked around him he nodded to himself as the goldengreen light flooded around him maybe that was why he kept coming here someone sensitive and sensible at the same time someone he could talk to that wouldnt go carrying tales whod believe a kitchengirl who told tales about meeting up with reggie fenyx in a meadow on odd afternoons to talk anyway no one without witnessesand really no one ever did come hereshed never be believed so content with his reasoning he dozed a little in the sun until his watch told him the pub would be open who would ever have thought that a workingmans pub would become his refuge the brigadier would be arriving in a few days though perhaps then he wouldnt need a refuge as much reggie came in through the garden entrance it was just as easy to get to from the stable and a great deal quieter he took the entrance beneath the grand marble staircase rather than the one on the terrace this passage was generally used more by the staff but as a child he had scampered in and out of all possible entrances the place was dark as it should be his mother and grandfather retired early when there was no entertaining going on and she hadnt entertained since his father had died none of the staff was down here now at this time of night and it felt almost as if he was alone in the huge old house he walked carefully his path brightened only by a few gaslights turned low he remembered how his father had brought in the gas it hadnt been that long ago it seemed and now electricity we need to bring in electricity and the telephone he shook his head and made his way up to the first floor it was easier to get to the family staircase from this part of the house stone floors below polished wood above and all of it too noisy for all he was walking as quietly as he could tonight he was feeling more than a bit tipsy it had been one of those nights something had set off matt brennan and hed gone down on a chair in the corner and just sat and rocked and wouldnt talk to anyone shell shock they all knew the signs of it and brennanwell brennan had more than a few reasons to suffer from it it was the first time hed gone into a fit of it in public though and reggie could only be grateful that he himself had managed to keep his own fits behind the closed doors of his rooms well they werent doctors but the only doctor that reggie knew that had any success with shellshock was doctor maya and she wasnt there they had their own roughandready remedy maybe not the best but a damn sight better than doing nothing or telling a fellow he was malingering they physically hauled him out to the middle table put a glass in his hand and poured drink into him until he came out of itand of course in order to keep him drinking they had to match him drink for drink theyd all gotten bawling sentimental even kevin eaches one of reggies tenant farmers whod wandered in by accident and somehow never made it out again when brennan was well in hand reggie took his leave it wasnt quite closing time but this might be one of those nights when tom locked the doors on a few of the oldest friends and moved the cure into the private part of the building he wasnt in that select group yet and he was not inclined to intrude so out he went into the springscented night it had taken some careful navigating to get the bus up to the house without incident fortunately thered been a moon unfortunately there had been cows hed had to stop and shoo them off the road not the easiest thing to do when you were staggering a bit cows didnt seem to be impressed with a man who wasnt able to stand without weaving back and forth he left the auto in the middle of the round stableyard the men would park it in the carriage house he knew that tonight he was in no condition to try and put her away himself with the hour so late and the house so dark and still he assumed that everyone including all of the staff had gone to bed he expected to get quietly up to his rooms without anyone the wiser the last thing he anticipated was to find his mother waiting for him in the settle at the top of the family staircase she had an oillamp burning on the table beside her and was pretending to work on some of that infernal knitting every woman seemed to be doing these days making stockings for soldiers he staggered back a pace or two on seeing her ah evening mater he said carefully ive been out so i see she put the knitting down in her lap she was still dressed for dinner in a navyblue gown her tone could have frozen the flowers in the vase beside her i presume it was the same place you have been going to every night the workingmans pub the broom she acted as if she had never heard the name before as if she had been completely unaware that there was a workingmans pub he drew himself up yes i have ive been to the broom i went last night i went tonight and i intend to go tomorrow night in fact i will continue to go to the broom for as long as i am on medical leave her face crumpled reggiehow could you everyone in the village certainly knowsit wont be long before the whole county knows youre down there every night consorting with socialists and riffraff who give me a better and warmer welcome than i have in my own home reggie retorted anger burning out some of the whiskey fumes and clearing his head where im not called coward to my face and told im malingering why id rather spend four hours in mad rosss company than five minutes in your fathers even as he said the words he was glad they were out that it was all out in the open at last he didnt need the brigadier for this not to lay the truth plain to his mother he should have stood on his own two feet a long time ago his mother cried out and her hands flew to her mouth tears started up in his eyes he felt coldly curiously unmoved if you want to know why i go there why dont you watch how your father drives me out of my own home every night he asked angrily and you had better get used to my new friends mater because they are my friends and i have far more in common with them than you could ever understand were he could find no words to tell her were soldiers he said at last real soldiers not tintoys like your father who strutted his way around cowing poor little hindu heathen until he was old enough to claim a pension and now wants to lord it over me the same way he stared at her stared her down stared at her until she shrank back in her seat and dropped her eyes he took a deep breath and walked past her all the stagger gone from his step he walked straight to his rooms feeling full of a cold dignity he hadnt known he possessed and then once the door was shut he sat down abruptly on the side of the bed and blinked what did i just do he asked aloud but of course there was no one there to answer him april broom warwickshirte the arrows was empty alison was gone so were carolyn and lauralee and it wasnt off to tea at longacre again it was a twoday excursion somewhere that they did not talk about even amongst themselves but it was going to involve warrick locke and it was going to involve the contents of three brassbound cases that alison had taken with her magic that was eleanors guess anyway they were going somewhere to work magic somewhere that was special there were a lot of special places of power around or so sarah said stonehenge was only the most obvious there had been enough blood spilled on english soil to make plenty of spots where alison and her nasty earth elementals would feel right at home eleanor only hoped that they hadnt gotten hold of anything personal of reggies with luck this wouldnt have anything at all to do with reggie or this new magic would just break itself on the walls of his unbelief but that meant that at long last she was going to be able to run down to the meadow at teatimeand hope against hope that reggie fenyx was the sort of fellow who kept his word the lot of them were finally packed up and gone by luncheon a meal that stretched on interminably so far as she was concerned she had to keep her mouth shut and her eyes cast down meekly the whole time as the foursome pretended she didnt even exist while she waited on them finally they packed up the big motorcar and all four of them drove away with no more clue as to where they were going than alisons careless keep the house neat and clean ellie and dont expect us back before saturday when she was utterly certain they were gone she could scarcely believe her luck and the first place she wentsince of course she had not had time or opportunity to snatch more than a bite of bread for luncheonwas the pantry this time she packed a basket with a real tea recklessly plundering the stores she wasnt supposed to be able to get into for the making of a meal that even reggie fenyx would find appealing sarah walked in on her in the midst of her preparations well whats all this then she asked hands on hips surveying the state of the kitchen i thought we might do some work with alison gone i eleanor found herself flushing i was going to take a picnic to round meadow sarah blinked her deceptively mild eyes once or twice then a slight smile curved her lips so thats the way the wind blows no wonder young reggies been there every afternoon he has she gasped buthow do you know he leaves his auto parked below it sarah said dismissively its his meadow after all and its part of the field his aeroplane used to be in i doubt anyone thinks anything at all about it i just wondered why does he always come at teatime because thats when i met him there the first time she looked around distractedly for something to take with her to drink does wine go with tea she asked rather desperately no wine does not and moreover youre not used to it youll be tipsy in no time sarah scolded theres the stream running through there drink water but go go now before he gets tired of waiting and goes off to his cronies at the broom she caught up the basket and ran the few people on the street did not seem to notice her as she ran that was something that seemed to happen a great deal unless she was actually in the way no one in broom paid the least bit of attention to her no matter what she did today that was all to the good her heart lifted as she saw in the distance that there was an automobilepresumably reggiestucked off the road down near round meadow her feet felt lighter at that moment too but she was struck with a sudden feeling of shyness and instead of speeding up she slowed down to a walk and then the doubts began after all why should reggie care if she turned up he was probably just down here to enjoy the solitude of his own meadow shed be an invader as she had been the first day oh hed be polite but he wouldnt want her there surely she almost turned back at the stile almost didnt climb it to get into the wooded end of the field but shed come this farand she had a lovely tea with her hed surely appreciate that and she wouldnt chatter like the girls his mother was inviting for tea i dont have to stay very long she told herself as she clambered over the stile the minute it seems as if he wants to be alone i can go after all what did they have in common she hadnt been to university she didnt drive a motorcar or fly she knew nothing about the war except what she read in the papers and besides he wouldnt want to talk about that she was years his junior she couldnt even talk to him about magic which was probably the only thing they had in common he probably was only being polite the last time and what happened last time a voice like cool flame in the back of her mind said in a reasoned town you didnt talk about anything you listened he did the talking just go see what happens by that point she was among the trees with the meadow just beyond her golden sunlight pouring down before her at the end of the corridor of trees i might as well go as not she thought and tossed her head he did ask me to come back and if he didnt mean it he shouldnt have asked me when she came through the trees at first she didnt see him he wasnt sitting on the tree trunk where he had been the last time she had seen him then she saw he had spread a blanket out on the new grass and was lying on his backshe thought he was looking up at the sky but as she got closer she saw that he was asleep she sat down carefully just on the edge of the blanket to avoid waking him there were dark circles under his eyes and it seemed to her that he looked more tired and worn than the last time she had seen him isnt he getting enough sleep that seemed strange to her wasnt that why he was here in the first place to rest and recover from his injuries why shouldnt he be sleeping enough he looked so sad there were so many lines in his brow that only unhappiness and pain could have put there in fact he looked so very vulnerable that she began to feel uncomfortable about watching him like this it seemed a violation of his privacy she began to look around feeling more and more uncomfortable and that was when she sawthem horrible ugly deformed little gnomes she could tell just by the sickly yellowbrown shimmer around them that they were not something that most people would see so they must be elementals they ignored her completely concentrating avidly on reggie as if he was something tasty and they were ravenous they had mouths full of nasty yellowed pointed teeth tiny eyes like black beads and they drooled no two of them were alike but they all looked misshapen and all were colors that just seemed unhealthy they stood on the edge of the meadow just under the trees skulking in the underbrush and as she stood up slowly she saw that they had formed into a rough circle completely surrounding the place where reggie was sleeping the sight of them absolutely infuriated her for no reason that she could name except perhaps that these evil little creatures were clearly ganging up on a sleeping helpless man she stood up and quick as a thought cast a fire shield around both of them that certainly got their attention the expressions on their faces changed abruptly from the sort you might see on the face of a schoolyard bully to startled alarm and shock now they looked at herand she glared back can i call a salamander here now without a physical fire around she didnt think she dared try anything larger and more powerful but she didnt know if the salamanders would answer her here either nothing ventured nothing gained she sketched the proper signs in the air and concentrated not commanding but entreating the last thing she wanted to do now was to anger an elemental by commanding it not when she was so new to this sort of thing to her amazement and delight she was answered immediately and not by one but by a bevy of the fiery little creatures who appeared within the shield as she had specified and swarmed all over her twining around her ankles her arms around her head and neck like so many fiery ferrets and then suddenly they all stopped moving and their heads moved as one as they stared at the evil gnomes ringing the meadow they hissed it sounded like a hundred steamkettles and there was absolutely no doubt that whatever those things were the salamanders hated them on sight go she whispered get them and the salamanders flowed off her surging across the perimeter of the shield and heading for the gnomes at a speed that made her blink the gnomes apparently did not intend to wait around to see what the salamanders could do to them they made no sound or at least no sound that eleanor could hear but they turned with looks of frantic fear and began swimming into the turf it wasnt digging because the ground remained physically undisturbed without so much as a blade of grass being displaced and the motions they made reminded her far more of swimming than of digging but there was no doubt that they were trying to escape the salamanders and when one of her elementals caught up with one of the gnomes that was a little too slow she saw exactly why the salamander writhed around the gnome with blinding speed there was a pop like a champagne cork and a puff of muddy brown smoke and the gnome was gone no more than a couple of the gnomes were too tardy to escape however the rest were under the turf by the time the salamanders reached them the salamanders surged around the periphery of the meadow like terriers hunting for rats but the vast majority of the gnomes had escaped and the salamanders didnt seem able to follow them underground finally they gave up and flowed back to her winding around her again until she giggled under her breath clearly wanting to be told how clever and brave they had been she obliged them though keeping to whispers not wanting to awaken poor reggie finally they seemed content with the praise and she sensed they were ready to be dismissed with a wave of her hand and the proper glyph she obliged them and they dispersed fading into the sunlight leaving nothing of themselves behind but the faintest of warmth around her ankles and wrists which left her still with the unanswered question of what to do about reggie finally she dispersed the shield picked up her basket and walked to edge of the meadow once there she did the only thing she could think of she began to whistle and saunter along as if she had only just arrived as she had hoped his head popped up immediately eyes a little startled but she ignored that hullo she called waving her hand ive brought some nice things for tea if you want some and ive brought gingerbeer was his reply as he sat up shaking his head and rubbing at his eyes hang if i didnt doze offmustve been the sun makes a chap sleepy she paced up to him as he stood up and took the basket from her i say he said a little shyly im awfully glad you came ive been here nearly every day hoping you would it was her turn to blush and feel shy its hard for me toto get awayi have to work you see she managed around her stepmothers prohibitions perhaps you shouldnt waste your time its my time to waste isnt it he retorted and softened the words with a smile besides this is probably exactly what the medical johnnies have in mind for me dozing out in meadows and whatall theyd probably be perfectly happy about it in fact if it will make you feel any better ill write one of em and ask her to write out a prescription for just that before i came out here she was threatening to descend on longacre to make sure i rested im sure shed be pleased to find out i had a reason to want to her smile faltered a little she she replied a ladydoctor of course and a ladydoctor would be just the sort of woman hed be fascinated by able to stand up for herself and clever and able to talk to him about all manner of things oh yes the only one i really know personally doctor maya scott he said happily completely oblivious to the fact that she had gone quiet married to a friend of mine capital wench and does she know her business if there were any justice shed be head of surgery at least maybe head of an entire hospital he shook his head as she belatedly reacted to the words married to a friend of mine and brightened again well maybe she doesnt want that come to think of it cant say i would if she is a really good doctor she probably doesnt want to be made head of anything so long as shes left to do what she feels is right and that she needs to do eleanor replied thinking as she spoke it seems to me that taking a good doctor and making her into aa glorified clerkisnt the sort of thing that a good doctor would want you probably have something there reggie said with a nod he patted the blanket well youre here now and im glad you could get away come sit down and well have our tea what have you been doing with yourself all this time work she replied truthfully not at all glamorous servants work to tell the truth that last was pulled out of her almost unwillingly but she felt she owed it to him he reached into the basket and handed her a sandwich without faltering our good vicar would tell you that theres no shame in an honest days labor he replied and id second him we got all sorts in our airwing not just the mechanics and the orderlies eithertruth is i never saw where being a cockney guttersnipe or a yankee cowboy made a fellow a worse pilot or being a dukes son made him a better one opposite more often than not in fact he bit hungrily into his sandwich cutting anything else he was going to say short and she nibbled on hers to keep from having to respond it was a rather astonishing thing for him to have said he certainly wouldnt have felt that way before he went off to war yes and hes been spending all his time down at the broom and not at the broom hall inn hasnt he she answered herself did you meet a lot of americans she asked seizing on his last statement as a way to draw him out a little more more canadians which arent quite the same thing he ate the last few bites of his sandwich neatly then uncorked a bottle of ginger beer and handed it to her before taking one from his rucksack for himself the canadians werequieter didnt seem so intent on making a rowdy reputation for themselves mind you the australians are at least as loud as the yanks only ever met a few of the yanks and they were all cut of the same clothright out of a wild west show tall loud rough good lads but seemed determined that they were going to show all of us that they were larger than life she laughed a little at his quizzical expression maybe they only thought they had to live up to whats written in their novels she suggested and the only novels ive ever heard of that had canadians in them were all about the mounted police not about cowboys and outlaws which came first the novel or the stereotype he grinned and shook his head well if i could answer that id be a wiser man than i am all i can tell you is that the yanks fly like theyre trying to ride a wild horse all seat and no science it makes them either brilliant or cracks them up and nothing in between the huns are all science and no seat and the french she prompted ah the french science with style and a great deal of attitude he nodded wisely they fly like their women dress they take a little bit of nothing and make everything out of it throw themselves at impossible targets and often as not pull the trick off on the basis of sheer savoir faire then when you try and congratulate or commiserate with them you get the same answer cest la vie cest la guerre and then they beg a cigarette off you and make off with the whole pack and you end up feeling privileged they took your last fagend he shook his head again chuckling she smiled he seemed easier talking about the war and flying today than he had been the last time shed seen him but she didnt want to press things too hard so she asked him what he had been doing since theyd last met he sighed oh being horribly lordofthemanor meeting my tenant farmers looking at alternatives to some of what weve been raisingthings that wont need as much labor going over the books with my estate manager mater didnt bother mention the accounts to her and she flaps her hands and looks a bit faint poor thing eleanor said feelingly i hate accounting i keep thinking ive put numbers in all the wrong columns even when i havent well she would do just that and never know it and thats a fact he set his empty gingerbeer bottle down and rummaged in the basket inquisitively i say teacakes theyre from a tin she warned thats the only kind we could get over there he replied wouldnt remember what a proper one tasted like we were always starved for sweets on account of it being so plaguey cold and never really able to get properly warm except during summer all tents do is keep off the rainand sometimes not even that well have my share she told him generously the rest of the afternoon went by much as the first had in inconsequential chatter any time he started to run dry of inconsequentials she prompted him with something else light somehow she knew that this was what he needed when he talked about the war he shouldnt be talking about the war itself but about things on the periphery and above all she was not going to ask him about fighting books thoughthat was a safe enough topic and he had read an astonishing variety it seemed that once someone was done with whatever volume had been sent him by friends lover or relatives if it didnt have sentimental value it became common property a surprising amount of poetry ended up making the rounds of the barrackssomehow he had ended up memorizing a great deal of it and without too much coaxing she got him to recite quite a bit of it it wasnt too much of a surprise that he found kipling to his taste when he recited the bridgeguard at karoo she could almost see the scene played out in front of her the sound and lights of the train coming out of the hot dark silence of the desert night the men on their solitary isolated duty grasping desperately for the few moments of civilization they were allowed and then the train moving on again leaving themfew forgotten and lonelyto their thankless post she thought that he could see it too perhaps that was why he recited it so feelingly then he had her in stitches as he related the rather improbable tales found in some of the american dime novels that had been left with his airwing how can anyone take any of that seriously she gasped after a particularly funny confrontation between the hero and an entire tribe of red indians complicated by a buffalo stampede and a raid by the james gang it probably hadnt been intended to be funny at least not by the original author but it was so utterly impossible that it ended up being a parody of itself i have had men swear solemnly to me that such things if they hadnt happened to them personally had certainly happened to a friend of a friend or a distant cousin or some such connection reggie replied as she held her aching side great tellers of tall tales are the yanks even the ones who never got farther west than new york city in their lives seemed to think they should be cowboys she looked down at her rosemary sprig and saw with disappointment that it was starting to wilt oh bother she said aloud reggie i would so like to stay here until suppertime no noi quite understand stolen hours and all that he said it with surface lightness but she saw the quickly veiled disappointment and it gave her a little thrill to realize that he had enjoyed being with her and he wanted her to stay i have to go she said honestly i dont have a choice i can be here tomorrow but after thati cant tell you when the next time ill be able to get away will be she was packing up the basket as she spoke they both reached for the same item as she finished the sentence she flushed and pulled back her hand he placed the saucer in the basket and said if i had my way youd be a lady of leisurebut i havent been getting my way very often lately i dont think any of us have been she replied again truthfully so we muddle through however we can tomorrow tomorrow he pledged she couldnt help herself she looked back twice as she trudged away and each time he was watching her and when he saw her looking he lifted his hand to wave she carried that image with her all the way home reggie decided not to go down to the pub tonight he returned to longacre feeling more alive than he had in a long time even though his nap on the cold ground had made his knee ache abominably he left the motor at the stables and limped his way up to the main house entering by the terracedoor as the sun began to set only to find his mother waiting for him in the sittingroom with a letter in her hand and her father beside her with a scowl on his face reggie did you invite brigadier mann here to visit she asked abruptly before he could even so much as greet her ah thats what this is all about i did not ask the king her father for permission to bring a guest here as a matter of fact yes i did he replied i am the head of this household he wrote to ask if he could come for a visit and see how i am doing and i of course was delighted to invite him his grandfather bristled all over at that now you see here you young pup no grandfather you see here he interrupted throttling down an irrational fury that was all the worse because his good mood of the afternoon had been spoiled entirely it was all very well for you to play at being the head of this house while i was away but im back now and im perfectly entitled to invite one of fathers oldest friends for a visit if i choose and put more work on your mother the old man snarled well that was the feeblest of feeble excuses oh please he snorted there is a house full of servants here for the three of us and what is more i can distinctly recall mother entertaining forty guests for the better part of three weeks during the hunting season with hardly more staff are you suggesting she has suddenly become such a ninnyhammer that she cant arrange for an extra plate at meals or bear the conversation of one more old man please his mother said in distress putting the letter down as if it had burned her dont argue im not arguing mater im standing up for you your father seems to be under the mistaken impression that youve regressed to the mental capabilities of a child im correcting that impression he looked down his nose at the old man who was going red in the face besides it isnt as if the brigadier needs entertaining hell probably want to use the library for his researches hell be looking forward to the odd game of billiards and i might persuade him to go riding i think we can manage that thatsocalled friend of your fathers cant even be bothered to speak a civil word to me his grandfather got out from between clenched teeth yes and that is the real reason you object isnt it because he doesnt treat you like royalty he outranks you old man in or out of the service perhaps that was because you sneered at him and his military record the moment he walked in the door reggie said with dangerous calm but if you find his company so intolerable why dont you go back to your own home we are perfectly capable of managing without your advice you know the old man lurched to his feet i ought to horsewhip you for that he roared dont try it unless you want the favor returned reggie replied contemptuously even though his stomach was turning at the confrontation and he wanted badly to retreat to his room this time he was by heaven going to stand his ground and his grandfather might as well hear the unvarnished truth for once in his life im weary of your muttered insults of your accusations of malingering and your insufferable arrogance im tired of you turning mother into a spineless shrinking violet with no will of her own go home grandfather go and learn some manners come back when youre fit to be company for good men like the brigadier until then go roar at your poor valet and threaten your housekeeper like the petty tyrant you are he turned to his mother mater youve always liked the brigadiers company in the past and i see no reason why that should have changed you might see your way clear to inviting a few more people down as well it would do you good to have some company here my aunt april perhaps that would give us enough for a good round of bridge of an evening his grandfather was still spluttering his mother was distracted by the thought of inviting someone whose company she enjoyed lady williams his mother faltered but i thought her chattering i should welcome her chattering mater he replied gently it is goodnatured and goodhearted it would be very pleasant to hear goodnatured conversation around here perhaps if there were more of such pleasant conversation i would find the pub less congenial by now his grandfather was nearly purple with rage and driven into incoherence if you were to choose to stay grandfather ill thank you to remember that he continued and dont bother trying to think of a retort im going to dress for dinner you of course are free to stay or go as you choosebut if you choose to stay you know what you can expect the gloves are off grandfather and they are remaining off and with that he turned on his heel and stalked all the way to his rooms once there however he turned the key in the lock and locked himself into his darkened bedroom and sank nervelessly down onto the neatly made bed shaking in every limb i cannot believe i just did that all his life his mothers father had been the one person that no one dared to defy even reggies own father had never openly flouted the old mans edicts but tonight reggie had challenged him whether or not hed won remained to be seen but the challenge had been uttered and had not been answered it should have felt like a triumph but all that reggie felt was a kind of sick fear that made him curl up on the counterpane and shake maybe precisely because he had overturned the old orderit had to be done but it was one more bit of stability gone and he hadnt even done a good job of defying the old man there had been nothing measured or politic about the way hed laid into his grandfather in fact hed probably made an enemy of the old man he hadnt planned any of it hadnt chosen his subject time or grounds and just might have made things worse it was only that he had been pushed once too often and now he felt he had to push back or die he felt too sick to go down to dinner now stomach a wreck head pounding and aching like someone had taken a poker to it well after what hed just done the old man probably wouldnt be down to dinner either still he couldnt leave his mother to sit at that long empty table alone so after he got his shaking under control he dressed and waited for the gong and went down down to a mostlyempty table the silently rebuking presence of his mother and food he scarcely tasted and ate very little of it should have been a triumph but it tasted of ashes and gall and in the end it led to yet another sleepless night during which he stared at the ceiling rigid with fear and was completely unable to muster a single coherent thought until dawn april chipping norton oxfordshire i wish that these places were somewhere more convenient or at least had decent hotels nearby lauralee sighed dramatically and pouted at the old fourposter bed she was going to have to share with her sister carolyn was already sprawled across the expanse of it and had voiced complaints about the quality of the mattress and the size of the room there really was no reason to complain the room was big enough by coachinginn standards it was certainly solid and wellkept the furnishings might date back to the previous century but they too were solid and wellkept their early dinner had been palatable and neither under norovercooked the real cause for discontent probably lay in the fact that it was not a posh hotel and not in london nor bath nor any other metropolis alison frowned at her offspring it was occurring to her just now that they were mightily spoilt the crown and cushion in chipping norton was the nearest inn to her goal just outside the village of enstone and as such things went was superior to a great many places where shed been forced to stay in the course of her occult career you ought to be grateful you have a bed much less a room much less a decent room in a good solid inn she told them tartly ive stayed in hovels or camped on the ground with gypsies before this youre just fortunate that there actually is an inn within walking distance of the hoar stones and thats another thing mother carolyn began shut your mouth warrick locke said unexpectedly were not here for your amusement were here to work and if that requires a little walking on your part so be it you are the ones ultimately benefiting from this after all you ought to be pleased not whingeing about it carolyn caught in midcomplaint by lockes surprising display gaped at him for a moment before closing her mouth she still looked sullen but at least she had shut up not that alison was particularly happy to be a mile and a half from the hoar stones but at least it was walking distance and the stones were secluded in an ancient grove of trees which would give them privacy and security over the course of the next three days to her mind that privacy was worth any amount of moderate discomfort fortunately the hoar stones were not associated with any may eve celebrations on the part of the locals if anything they were shunned another indication that this site was exactly what alison needed you had better have packed for the walk as i instructed you alison said with a hint of threat in her voice or youll find yourself tottering down the road on whatever shoes you did bring i have need of you four is the minimum of participants for these ceremonies we arent trifling with beltane rituals of fertility or lovemaking you know the things i plan to awaken need coercing and confining and to that end thank you warrick i appreciate you being willing to participate her solicitor looked both surprised and gratified well she didnt often thank him or anyone for that matter not that she intended to start handing out thanks any more frequently being sparing with them made them that much more valuable i dont often get to see a master performing a major ritual he replied with a nod of thanks ill certainly learn a lot he might at that not that it would be anything he could actually use he wasnt strong enough for that she had set the first batch of minor earth elementals on reginalds trail some time agobut they had been consistently thwarted by the protections devlin fenyx had set about the manor house itself powerful protections that had kept them completely out alison had intended them to attack him only when he was asleep or in that twilight state between waking and sleeping when they would be best able to terrify him and they had been unable to catch him sleeping outside the walls of longacre until today apparently he had drowsed off in the sun somewhere outside this afternoon her minor goblins had caught wind of this and had surrounded him then something went wrong they werent even as bright as pigeons and she could get nothing out of them of any real substance only that reggie had a protector that had destroyed several of them and sent the rest fleeing for their lives she thought it might be the village witch the old woman wasnt really powerful but she was strong enough to destroy a few minor goblins and reggie had been spending a lot of time down at the broom pub and while it wasnt likely that the witch would concern herself with something happening up at longacre even alison could not entirely blame her for interfering with something that happened in her own personal sphere but that only meant that stronger measures were called for here as it happened the timing could not have been much better beltane was an ancient night of magic it would be much easier for her to pull through what she needed on may eve there was no light without shadow and though the traditional magics of beltane were those of growth and life it would be no great strain to bend some of the solstice power to other paths and in fact the tradition though not a british or celtic one was already in place in other parts of the world for every joyous beltane there was a terrifying walpurgisnacht samhain would have been better of coursethe time of waning light and of death rather than rebirthbut any of the greater pagan festivals would do for her purposes for every one that celebrated light had the counterpart that celebrated the shadow the sun was going down now soon enough it would be time to slip out of the innprobably the best time would be while people were coming and going from the barand begin the walk to the hoar stones time to change and gather our things she declared leveling a look at the girls that warned them that tonight she would tolerate no nonsense she and warrick left the two to follow her orders while they went to their own rooms any other time she would not have allowed herself to be caught dead in trousers this however was an occasion for the deliberate perversion of societys norms and she clothed herself in sturdy walking shoes mens pants and a warm jumper with a long coat to go over it all she stuffed her hair up into a workingmans cap and picked up the rucksack that she had already packed besides being warm and practical the outfit had another purpose anyone who saw them on the road would see two men and two women and assume he was seeing two courting pairs he would also think twice about accosting them the girls were not wearing trousers but they were clothed all in black with sturdy walkingshoes plain woolen skirts equally plain shirtwaists and their oldest coats warrick locke followed their example in being clothed plainly and in black he had the other rucksack they slipped out of the inn to discover that night had already fallen well that was all to the good they were able to move at a brisk walk to the south and east heading for their goal a mile and a half away the moon gave enough light to walk by and though there were one or two may eve bonfires in the distance these were a fraction of the number that used to blossom before the war another thing the war was good forwith most if not all of the young men across the channel the kind of may eve celebrations that ended in couples and unattached young girls scattered across the landscape to see the sun rise on may day were probably not taking place this year at all why bother to wash your face in may dew to make yourself beautiful for whom the septuagenarian shepherd the land girls the boy youd once giggled over whod come home without arms or legs or wits if your lover was still alive and whole he was probably in the trenches tonight and would not be home for months if he ever came home at all and if he did it might have been better for him if he had died alison could taste some of that anguish in the air this night but it did not come from the area of the few bonfires it came from the cottages where lights were going out may eve was just another night and may day would bring nothing good except perhaps a few early strawberries a few flowers alison kept her ears open for the sounds of other footsteps in the fields but heard nothing but owls and sleepy sheep and the unhappy mutterings of her own footsore offspring and as for the few couples left the men either home on leave or spared having to go to the war by infirmity like brooms own scott kelsey with his collapsed lungwell they were already coupling in conjugal beds without needing to find may eve bowers for clandestine trysts marriages had been and were being made that would never have been countenanced before the war some with babies already in the offing though by no means most shed been the avid eavesdropper on the end of one of those little cottage dramas sitting behind the parents of the prospective groom as pretty tamara budd and her handsome young officerfiance stood to have the banns read in church last sunday the grooms mother was snivelingoverdressed for a village churchservice and in lamentable taste the couple was clearly prosperous enough to have assumed their boy would marry above his class not below it quiet woman the husband had hissed shes not what you want but shes what he wants and do you want a grandchild to have his name before hes killed or dont you oh those words and that delicious delicious despair people were saying now what they had not even dreamed of thinking beforenot if hes killed but when women sent off their men with that despair in their hearts open and acknowledged and if any of their men came home at all no matter how damaged they thanked god and thought themselves lucky every time the telegraphgirl came riding into broom on her bicycle that despair followed her like the wake of a boat spreading through all the village until she brought her anticipated but dreaded burden of bad news to her destined door there was no other reason for a telegraph to be sent to anyone in broom except for the most dreaded of reasons killed in action missing in action which was the other way of saying blown to bits and we cant find enough of him to identify wounded and dying and every time the telegraphgirl entered broom alison knew it and reveled in that wash of fear and anguish shed even sent a telegraph or two to herself when deaths were few just to trigger it and the power it unleashed for all the inconveniences that the war had brought this was worth it and if only it could go on for three four five more years she made a mental note to strengthen those demons of illness she had sent to america not tonight but soon the longer the war lasted the greater her power would be there was no traffic tonight none at all not even when they passed through enstone itself not a foottraveler not a cart certainly not an auto there was some small activity around the pub two men going in as they passed the first houses in the village but no one came out during the time they were on the enstone to ditchely road not that she had expected any fellow travelers but she was pleased that things were so quiet alison had an electric torch but she didnt use it she was navigating by the feel of things rather than looking for landmarks after a bit less than an hour of the four of them plodding down the uneven road between the high hedgerows she began to sense what she was watching for southwards off to the side of the road a sluggish stagnant pool of power that had not been tapped in a very long time watch for a gap in the hedge to the right she ordered it will probably be a stile going over but there might actually be a path but it was the crossing road that they saw first and only after looking closely for it found not only a stile but a path off to the right both hedge and stile were in poor repair as reported by warrick locke who went over first now alison used her torch the last thing any of them needed was to be lamed by a sprained ankle at this point the path lay along the line and under the shelter of another hedge but now it was clear to alison where their goal was and a tingle of anticipation made her want to hurry the others towards that wooded enclosure whose trees shielded imperfectly the glow of power that roused sullenly at her presence the enclosure was little more than a couple of wooden railings they went over and pushed through the holly and other undergrowth to arrive at her goal it stood upon a small mound an arrangement of six stones forming the remains of what had once been a large chambered structure a tomb perhaps at least that was what the old men she had questioned in enstone had said it was the tomb of an ancient tribal chieftain long dead before the romans came she didnt much care two powerful ley lines ran through it and it had been made other use of for some time after its former occupant had been looted away by romans searching for british gold the largest of the stones was a good nine feet tall she wedged her torch where it could best illuminate the interior of the tomb and set warrick and the girls to making the place ready while she slipped out of sight long enough to don her robe she usually didnt bother with ritual robes but this was too important and dangerous a ceremony to leave anything to chance besides the things she intended to call might not recognize her authority without her robes when she reentered the tomb warrick had already gotten the altarcloth laid out on the ground and had lit candles and stuck them wherever he could to save the batteries on the torch the others modern clothing would have looked very outofplace if they had not worn simple black instead of being glaring anachronisms they looked like minor acolytes of no particular order the candles stuck in places sheltered from the breeze flickered very little alison was struck by how timeless the scene seemed there was nothing to tell that this was or or even the first century anno domini take your places she said and took her shortsword from the rucksack it was a genuine celtic relic of bronze and had been the means that ended more than a dozen lives before it had been left in a tomb very like this one locke took a candle and stood in the east carolyn in the south and lauralee in the west alison reserved the north the most important in this ceremony for herself when the others were in place she took the bronze blade in her hands and cut a circle of protection and power around all of them moving widdershins as she did so it was a little crowded in the tomb for the space inside it could not have been more than eight feet across but when she was done the light from the candles faded into insignificance as the interior sprang to life the stones themselves glowing a dull ochre with pentup power she took her place in the north and nodded at locke to begin locke looked excited the girls wideeyed i guard the east in the name of loki the malicious the betrayer locke said raising his candle to the level of his eyes in his name do i call the power of air the candle flared its flame turning blue to confirm that locke had made all the right occult connections he grinned at alison but she was already turning and nodding to carolyn who was raising her candle i guard the south in the name of hecate the queen of witches the bringer of burning plague of drought and despair carolyn said carefully her voice sounding higher than usual and a bit strained her eyes glinting at her mother over the flame of the candle in her name do i call the power of fire as carolyns candleflame burned the crimson of blood alison was already turning to lauralee other than her own part this would be the trickiest i guard the west in the name of tezcatlipoca the smoking mirror mist on the lake the eater of hearts lauralee said very carefully without tripping even a little on the difficult name in his name do i call the power of water alisons triumph tasted sweet as the candleflame flared green it had been a risk using that foreign deitybut she had wanted something uniquely western and could think of no god more bloodthirsty than one of the ancient aztecs but now it was her turn i guard the north and close the circle in the name of the morrigan death and despair the stormcrow the bloodraven the goddess of battles and harvester of souls she said holding aloft her own candle in her name do i call the power earth the flame of her candle was already yellowbut it flared up like a pitchsoaked torch until for a moment it licked the stone above their heads before subsiding she didnt need that sign to know that she had tapped into the power sleeping uneasily here in the stones however to her senses the place practically hummed and as the stones increased their glow you could have read by the light that they shed the four of them bent as one to secure their candles in saucers at the four edges of the altarcloth then rose again and alison began her chant it predated christianity this chant the stones here recognized it as did the power within those stones the stones vibrated in sympathy with it and the power leapt to serve it was an old chant designed to serve protect and avenge those who were great in power but few in numbers with this magic they did not have to muster an army with this magic the army would come of its own an army of the dead not ghosts or spirits called from some afterlife but revenants the emotionally charged remnants of the unquiet dead still bound to earth by their own will the executed defeated in battle murdered any whose remains were interred in the earth whose deaths had not brought peace but anger and pain who were not at all ready to move on on this night when the doors to the spiritworld were cast open they came from every direction they came from hallowed and unhallowed ground from unmarked grave from crossroadburial from forgotten forest mound they came ancient merely old and new they came singly then by dozens they came on the wings of hate of anger and of despair they pressed in upon the shield of power as the air outside it grew thick with their restless spirits until the pressure outside the shield threatened to crack it there were so many that they merged into a circling miasma from which only an occasional glimpse of ghostlyglowing face emergedhere a hairy tribesman there a closecropped roman here an arrogant cavalier there an equally arrogant roundhead here a robed druid there a tonsured monkfaces old as this island and as new as yesterday and alisons chant bound them to the torment of her chosen target and painted that target with words that made him the enemy of each of them to the flintwielding tribesman he was the effete and sophisticated embodiment of the end of the old ways a man who no longer hunted his food with spear and knife but who spent his nights in housen and tilled the soil to the cavalier he was the upholder of the way of parliament to the monk he was that horror of horrors a protestantto the roundhead he was a man who paid no more than lipservice to god who blasphemed and gambled and sinned the sins of the flesh to the poor peasant he was the noble the oppressorto the noble he was a man who shunned his proper class for the company of the baseborn to the roman he was a saxon to the saxon he was a norman to the druid he was the servant of the white christ who put paid to pagans with fire and sword to the highwayman he was the embodiment of the law that had hung him and the hand that had done the deed and to the shattered wreck of the justburied warvictim he was the man who had escaped alive because he was wealthy privileged or just plain lucky when he had not to the betrayer to the betrayed to the killer and the victim to each of them reggie fenyx became that which he hated the most they swirled widdershins around the shield of protection faster and faster pulling in more and more of the power of this place the power that would enable them to go forth and torment so that in the end when she uttered the word that freed them and bound them at the same time all but those few spirits that still had the ability to think as well as feel and had slipped away before she could ensnare them no matter what hate had brought them here the focus for that hate became reginald fenyx she gave them the look the sense of him told them without words where to find him this was why she had chosen so carefully her gods of east south west and north each of them embodied in his or her own way the spirit of deception she bound the whirling circle of spirits with a word and set them free with that same word a single syllable that exploded outward sending them the deadly spiritual shrapnel flying the circle of mist burst apart the light of the stones went out like a snuffed candle and all of it in a strange and echoing silence in which nothing could be heard but four people breathing as one and with that word she dropped to her knees exhausted but the deed was complete the tomb was empty the power within it and beneath it drained the only glow now came from the guttering candles carolyn and lauralee stared at their mother mouths agape and shaking in spite of her weariness alison could not help smiling shed never done a great work in their presence now perhaps theyd think twice before challenging her warrick locke was clearly impressed but not nearly so cowed and it was he whofollowing her instructions truerecovered first and began the dismissal ceremony speaking his words and snuffing his candle blinking and uncertain the two girls followed his lead as alison got back to her feet again she snuffed her own candle then cut the circle rather than going through the tedious business of uncasting it with the circle cut the shield dispersed leaving them all standing in the rockwalled tomb lookinga little silly especially her in her black velvet hooded ritual robe she wished now that she had given in to the girls and driven here in the auto but but what if someone had seen it here on the other hand warrick was looking decidedly chipper warrick could please i prevail upon you to get the motor from the inn and come bring us back she asked and offered him a smile that promised a great deal more than she was prepared to give the morrigan the deceiver was still with her it seemed well she would let the morrigan continue to have her way if he demanded she would let him take her to his room then cast a spell of sleep and selfdeception on him and let him dream that he had what he wanted she had strength enough for that and even tired he was no match for her weakwilled man that he was locke saw the promise and leapt for it then again perhaps loki was still with him and thought to trick his way to what hed never gotten before of course he replied with a sly smile after all that im not surprised that youre tired before she could say anything else he was off leaving her to drag off her robe and change back into her masculine garb then join her daughters in waiting for him she looked up into the night sky at that waning moon and smiled well let him think he had the upper hand a contest between the morrigan and loki for craft and trickery was no contest no contest at all mother carolyn said timidly were those ghosts of a sort she replied they are properly called revenants and they fall under the power of the earth master since they are bound to earth forwell for whatever reason they are the unquiet dead who never took the step through the door of the afterlife some earth masters spend their entire lives going about freeing such things and sending them on their way through the door they have been avoiding why lauralee asked because some earth masters are idiots she said surprising a giggle out of both of the girls it makes about as much sense to me as going out to be a missionary both careers are fraught with hardship and difficulty and ultimately in both cases you are dealing with creatures who have little or no interest in what you are trying to tell them but youyou told them what they wanted to hear lauralee hazarded alison smiled well it looked as if at least one of the girls had inherited some of her intelligence that is how you bind them to your target instead of their own she explained after all most of the time the target of their hatred is as dead as they are and generally has more sense than to linger you tell them how your target represents everything they hate then you give them enough power to do what they want and turn them loose can they break through the protections on longacre carolyn wanted to know some might but even if they dont they are powerful enough to force reggie to see them awake or asleep she sighed with content this had truly been a job well done well let them torment him for a while and use up all that extra power i gave them then youll move in but how will we banish ghosts carolyn cried we cant even make a simple lovecharm work on him ahalison laid a finger aside her nose and nodded theres the beauty of it once they use up that extra power i gave them the geas i put on them will start to fade and theyll lose the ability to make him see them and as the geas fades theyll forget why theyre haunting reggie and start to drift back to their old homes you wont have to do anything yet reggie will think that its you they both stared at her looking awestruck they hadnt given her that particular look since they were tiny children and she had amused them by catching a faun and making it dance and as she heard the chattering of the motor in the far distance and chivvied the girls into cleaning up the site and heading back down the path to the road it occurred to her that this evening might represent a triumph in more ways than one not only had she gained supremacy over an army of the dead she had once more gained the upper hand most decisively over her own children they would be long in forgetting this and that wasa good thing april may longacre park warwickshire reggie had completely forgottenuntil his mother reminded him of it over dinnerthat the next day was may day the day of the school treat at longacre and the school prize day well why should he remember the day of the school treat and prize day had always been june first not may day when he had been growing up but the war had changed this as it had so many other things school ended early now so that children could help with the farm work their fathers and brothers were not here to attend to the country and more importantly the army needed to be fed farm work came before schoolwork and the traditional may day festivities were not nearly so festive as they had been there would be no church fair or at least not the sort that delighted childrenthe halfgypsy traveling fair folk with their swinging chairs and carousels their booths of cheap gimcrackery and games like coconut shy and pitchtoss were not traveling any more in fact most of them were off in the trenches themselves and the old men children and women that were left simply could not cope by themselves with sugar and other things being rationed now there would be no stalls featuring the forbidden foods that one was only allowed to eat at a fair the church fair would be a very sad and much diminished version of its former self someone would probably set up a hoopla game and a coconut shy but the prizes would not be the glittery fairy dolls and wildly colored crockery of the pastno they would be homemade ragbabies and whatever someone had found in the attic that hadnt made it onto the white elephant table there would not be a greasedpig race not with pigs being war resources there would be no eggandspoon race for the same reason oh there could have been a race using rocks or plaster eggs or potatoes but it wouldnt have been as much fun without the hazard of breaking the egg no one left in broom was nimble enough to climb the greased pole so that had been canceled as well there would be no morris dancers who by tradition were all men no procession through the town of the hobbyhorse green man robin and maid marian once again tradition decreed these may day heroes must be men there would be a maypole but only girls really took pleasure in the dance around it with all these childhood pleasures revoked it only made sense and of course reggie was in complete agreement on thisto combine the school treat with the may day fair and have it all on the lawn of longacre the children might not be able to have rides on the great swing but they could play in the maze be driven around the grounds in the ancient ponycart or reggies own auto and hunt for early strawberries among the fallen leaves of the woods through means reggie could not quite fathom his mother had managed to connive beg or blackmail the authorities into releasing enough sugar to bake cakes and make ice cream for the treat so if the children could not eat themselves sick they would at least have some sweeties and of course reggie himself would have to present the prizes to the winning scholars to put the final fillip of glory on the whole day no he quite agreed with the whole notion and the only thing that made him wish the school and the children to the steppes of mongolia was that because he had forgotten he had not been able to tell poor eleanor that he would not be at the meadow at teatime and he did not know how to find her to send her a message to that effect either the thought of her arriving at the meadow only to find it deserted made him feel sickshe would be so disappointed and he found the idea of disappointing her made him feel like a right cad well maybe someone would remind her what day it was yes hopefully wherever she was working shed be told and wouldnt turn up only to be disappointed meanwhile he listened with some surprise and growing pleasure to his mother go on about her preparations for the great day it was the liveliest hed seen her since he had arrived of course her father was still sulking taking his meals in his rooms so that particular pall was not being flung over the dinnertable and perhaps he will leave or at least go off to bully his own servants until no he would not think of going back to the front to the war not now he turned his mind resolutely to the plans for the morrow it seems like an awful lot of work for you mater he said doubtfully she laughedreally laughed dont you remember you did most of the planning work when the date was first changed last year it was all in your letters everything was a great success especially the prizes good gadi do remembertelling her that the vicar could give out bibles and prayer books all he liked but that we ought to be giving things the kiddies would enjoy reading picture books for the littlest good ripping yarns for the boys you told me to patronize the local shops so i did really all i had to do was to consult with pearl shapland at the bookstore about what was popularshes been a great help shes picked out truly delightful books this yearand for the older girls lovely writing paper and pen sets instead of books well i did make one little change she blushed when i found out that lisa satterfield the head girl had won the first prize for essay i thought a pretty girl like that and no money to spare in her familywell i went to annie hagan the milliner and i got her a hat i thought she would like it so much better than writing paper i think youre entirely right mater he said hiding his amusement school prizes were supposed to reward scholarshiptrust his mother to think of giving a hat instead then again hed seen perfectly sensible girls go all foolish with inchoate longing over a milliners window display that was a capital idea and terribly kind of you it really did seem as if he had been very clever in his suggestions it was just too bad he didnt remember them very clearly those letters seemed to have been written a century ago by someone he couldnt even recognize swings hung from the trees in the parka treasurehunt among the paths for tokens to be exchanged for little bags of nuts and other small prizescrackers at tea to ensure that every child went home with at least some trinketit amazed him how had he thought about such things in the middle of death and gunfire so you see i really had very little to doother than this year finding ways of getting the sugar for the cakes and ice creams she concluded the rest of it i just left orders for i dont believe you for a minute and you are an angel mater he said warmly she smiled at him then sighed its so little really when there isnt a family in the village that hasnt got someone at the frontor has lost someone she said pensively if i can just help those poor little ones to forget that for part of one day he went up to bed now feeling guilty that he had put his own pleasure ahead of those poor kiddies as if they had anything much to look forward to anymore they werent the only ones who were trying to forget for just one day what was going on outside the walls and fences of longacre park knowing he would have to look presentable for the children he took the precaution of using a strong sleeping draught to insure he got a decent night of slumber hed avoided them in hospitalpreferring to doze during the day when they were less inclined to try and attack himand since coming home hed generally found his drinks at the broom to be soporific enough but we dont want to frighten the little ones he told himself as he felt the narcotic take hold you dont want to look the way you feel he still felt a bit groggy when his valet woke him but a couple of cups of good strong gunpowder tea chased most of the mist from his brain he thought about wearing his uniform to make the presentations then decided against it the children saw too many uniforms as it was he didnt want to remind them of fathers and brothers who were gone fighting missing or dead by the time he finished breakfast his valet turner came to tell him that the old pony had been harnessed to the cart and it and the auto were waiting on the driveway what else is done he asked the gardener and her helpers have finished seeding the garden with the buttons that will serve as prizetokens sir turner said and the tent has been set up for the refreshments her ladyship is already out there overseeing everything he might have known he finished breakfast and strolled out to be as he expected made useful within the hour the vicar his wife and the entire contingents of the ladies friendly society and the womens institute had made the pilgrimage up the drive with farm carts full of tents and stalls and the bricabrac to fill them and by ten the fair was set up and waiting for the children there were already adults moving among the stalls in summer frocks or teagowns and tennisdresses and cricketflannels or summer suits suitable for a day at brighton pier or at the very least their sunday best it all looked so normal until you noticed that frocks outnumbered suits by a factor of four or five to one it was at that point that reggie elected to go and stand by his auto and wait for the children to arrive fortunately they did turn up very shortly after thatbeing hauled up from the village in two old haywains pulled by four ancient workhorses that were spared being sent to pull guns because they couldnt have gotten out of a plodding walk if their lives had depended on it having had the experience of last year lady devlin had very sensibly decided that the first thing to do was to allow the children to run off as much of the energy of excitement as possible to that end it was the buttonhunt that took place first well away from the flowerbeds with the buttons seeded all over the artificial wilderness and the follies that some georgian fenyx had erected he thought to improve the landscape by dotting it with completely manufactured ruins with happy disregard for the state of their best clothing the younger children swarmed the wilderness while the older ones sauntered along pretending that they were too sophisticated for such a childish pastime but just as excited as the little ones when they found a button it took a good hour before the last button was found and handed in for a prize by then the smaller ones were lining up for rides in the ponycart while the older boys were doing the same for a ride in reggies motor the swings in the trees were all fully occupied the maze had its own set of explorers and the games at the booths were doing a surprisingly brisk business at one there was a break for luncheon in the refreshment tent a break that reggie was pleased to see he had forgotten when he had volunteered to take children for rides up and down the long driveway that this would mean hours of driving his leg was telling him that it would be some time before it forgave him after luncheon to his relief came the official proceedings of the day beginning with the maypole dance reggies gramophone was pulled into service with jimmy grimsley the head boy dragooned into service to keep it cranked up it had to be the first time in the history of broom that maypole dances were held to the tune of melodies by bach instead of the pennywhistle and fiddle the adults dutifully gathered around to watch first the little ones blunder through an attempt at a simple inandout weave then progressively more complicated weaves as the teams of dancers increased in age the girls with enthusiasm the boys with reluctance the eldestall girls since not even the headmaster could convince teenaged boys to dance around a maypoledid a quite credible job leaving the pole with its crown of flowers covered in a tightly woven patterned set of ribbons then it was time for everyone to assemble for the academic prizes a low platform had been erected for the purpose and the audience sat on blankets and tablecloths usually used for picnics reggie and the teachers all stood on the platform while the children waited squirming on the blankets in the very front rows first miss kathleen davis the teacher for the youngest children who were not segregated by sex at their age announced the winners of best penmanship most books read best speller and best recitation the children solemnly and shyly and with maternal encouragement paraded up to the platform and reggie gave them their picturebooks wrapped in beautiful paper and ribbons with just as much solemnity as if he had been distributing medals they all sat through a repetition of the prizewinning recitation predictably how doth the little busy beewhich at least the child in question managed to get through without needing to be prompted without mumbling or without bursting into tears all of which reggie could recall happening on previous prize days then it was miss judith laskers turn to announce the prizewinners for the older girls best penmanship best recitation spelling prize literature prize and best essay on the subject of reggie tried not to groan my country the winner of the best essay looked very surprised when reggie presented her with a hatbox instead of a stationery set or a book and when she and her friends gathered around to discover what could be in the intriguing box the winner was so delighted to discover that it really was a hat she almost forgot to return to the platform to read her winning essay aloud next time itll be two hats reggie thought ungraciously that ought to keep them busy enough theyll completely forget to read the blasted thing the literature prize winner maria holmes did not get a stationery set that seemed wrong to reggie who had instead culled several unread volumes from his own storesthings given to him in the hospital that he had not had the heart to read poems of a vad seemed appropriate enough and the complete kipling verse as well as kim and the light that failed and a book of shaws plays they werent the sort of thing that a girl would ordinarily be given but he had the feeling that a bookish girl was more than ready for something stronger the best recitation was from a girl improbably called marina landman and was to reggies complete shock the last meeting written only the year before by siegfried sassoon she recited it beautifully clearlyhe had to wonder if she really understood what the words she was speaking from memory actually meant or to her was it all romeoandjuliet doomed romantic young love certainly the poem was written that way where had she found it dear god if she had seen any of his other poems she surely would have tossed the book away weeping sassoon might have begun writing his poetry about the nobility of sacrifice in war and the glory of a grand death but he was not writing of that now well it might make him uncomfortable but evidently no one else was bothered or else they had no idea who had written this piece well truly there was nothing in it to mark it as the work of a man in the trenches probably someone saw it in the strand or some other magazine or newspaper and thought it appropriate for a young girl to recite he decided she cant possibly have seen any of sassoons other poetry he presented her with her prize of stationery and a silver penset she seemed pleased i want to be a teacher she told him when hed asked her the usual question of what she wanted to do like miss lasker miss lasker colored up and looked pleased im sure youll be a fine teacher reggie told her and signaled the headmaster with his eyes that it was time for the boys to receive their prizes one more lot and then i can sit down michael stone stepped forward and announced the winners mathematics prize history prize geography prizewhy werent the girls given challenges like thatlatin prize best recitation and best essay on the subject of patriotism the recitation unmercifully was the charge of the light brigade reggie tried not to listen it called up too many memories of similar idiotic charges he had seen from the relative safety of his aeroplaneyet another suicidal dash over the top straight into the machine guns he kept his face fixed in whathe hopedwas a vaguely pleasant expression and wondered what idiot had encouraged the boy to memorize this particular piece at this particular time he expected much the same out of the grimsley boys essay but got a shock it read like the poetry of wilfrid owens or at least a very very young wilfred owens one who hadnt yet seen the slaughtering grounds with his own eyes but knew very well they were there and knew that their leaders were idiots and while questioning the sanity of it all did not question that doing ones duty was the right and proper thing to do oh it wasnt laid out so skillfully as all that and there was still more than a veneer of the youthful idealism that sent those first boys to their deaths in thinking it was a glorious thing to fall in battle but still the bones of intelligent questioning were thereand it astonished him so much so that the headmaster caught sight of his startled expression and leaned over to whisper jimmy is the only boy left in his family father both brothers three uncles and all his male cousins hed like to go to university in two years but stone shrugged whether he can get a place i dont know you just get him ready for the entrance examinations reggie said fiercely ill see that he gets there he hadnt even known that he was going to say such a thing until after the words were out of his mouth but he was glad that he had done so a moment later as he caught the look of astonishment followed by gratitude on michael stones face he nodded to confirm the pledge then returned his attention to the boy feeling a kind of proprietary determination too many of the bright intellectual lights of his generation had been put out already he would by heaven save this one at least after the prizes came the highlight of the daywhat one little fellow joyfully called a proper tea at last with jam buns currant scones and iced biscuits ice creams honey and more jam for the proper sandwiches all the sweet things that children craved and if they could not as they had in days gone by eat sweet things until they were sick well perhaps that wasnt so bad a thing there was just enough of the rationed sugar to make sure every child got enough to feel properly rewardedto fill them up they had to make do with slightly more wholesome fare the adults did have to make do with what they could purchase at the church fair stalls this was after all the school treat every child also got one of the finest crackers obtainable with little prizes inside like pennywhistles so that they all went home with at least a bag of nuts from the button hunt and a cracker prize in their pockets along with the memory of a day stuffed full of fun without the shadow of war on it after tea the wagons arrived to carry them back down to the village again the adults lingered until the church fair officially closed reggie kept himself mostly out of the way by this time his leg was a torment but the last thing he wanted was for anyone to notice between the longacre staff and the men from the village who came up to help with the dismantling the tents came down and were stowed in the haywains the stalls and booths did not come down quite as quickly as they had gone up but by sunset the only vestiges of the may day festivities were the trampled grass a few bare places where little girls had been unable to resist picking flowers in the gardens and the swings still hanging in the trees reggie got up onto the terrace without drawing any attention to himself and paused there ostensibly to admire the setting sun but in reality to give his knee a rest lady devlin came up from the gardens when he had been standing there for a few moments to stand beside him she surveyed the empty lawn and sighed happily well well be scraping our jam a bit thin for the next several weeks and the gardens will look a little motheaten for a week or two but it was worth it she said with content did you see their little faces and their notsolittle faces reggie told her putting his arm around her shoulders to give her a squeeze well done mater you put on a ripping treat for them oh that grimsley boy if youre going to say were finding him a place at oxford good she interrupted that was an amazingly mature essay your father always meant to have a fund for the village and never got around to taking care of it she stopped for a moment closed her eyes then went on bravely since he never got the chance we should do it for him well make that boy the first to have it shall we he blinked at her then grinned mater you are trumps he exclaimed warmly ill get it set up with mrs macgregor and andrew dennis tomorrow ill have andrew set up a trust and lee can tell me what we should use to fund it with that would be the wisest i think she nodded decisively you know im glad you invited the brigadier you were right we need more people about i will invite your auntperhaps lady virginia too well have some small summer weekends so long as you dont plan to have em with the sole intention of trotting potential brides in front of me he thought though in truth he knew that any such hope was probably in vain what he said aloud was itll be good to have people around but at the momentif youll forgive me dearest i am going to go to my room put my leg up and have someone bring me a tray with the sad remains of the feasting my leg is not at all pleased with me truth to be told his leg was telling him that if he didnt get weight off it soon he might not like what it was going to do hed been able to ignore the pain for most of the day but it was coming on with a vengeance now you do look pale dear she said casting a worried glance at him and do you know that sounds like a capital idea to me too a hot bath a book and whatever the cook can throw together on a tray the staff have worked their hearts out for this too she smiled however i am very glad it is only once a year now ill go and let the housekeeper know well be making an early evening of it im sure the staff will be pleased she kissed his cheek and wandered back into the house he waited though his leg was really beginning to throb until she was unlikely to see the difficulty he was in only then did he limp towards the door and seize with wordless gratitude the cane that was in a stand beside it his valet had silently and without being asked installed stands with canes in them in practically every room he was likely to be in and at every outside door now he rested his weight on the handle and reminded himself to make sure turner was properly thanked as the dusk began to descend shrouding the rooms he passed through in shadow he wondered how difficult it would be to get electricity and the telephone up to the place mad rosss wife sarah ashley a yorkshire woman was the local telephone operator although there could not be more than three or four telephones in broom itselfso it would certainly be possible to at least get the telephone installed up here yes he would see to that no matter what it would be another way to get his mother connected back to the wider world with the telephone would come invitations to go and do things from her old friends and he knew from personal experience that it was a great deal easier to refuse invitations that came by mail than it was to refuse the ones that came in person yes ill get the telephone in at the very least and electricity if i can manage it that should help the staff out a bit too electric lights took less tending or so he was told he paused at the foot of the stairs looking up to the next floor with a feeling as if he was about to try to scale the matterhorn he gritted his teeth braced himself and with the cane in one hand and a deathgrip on the balustrade he began the long climb his knee now felt as if someone was putting a bullet into it with every step he had to climb halfway up he had to stop ireally did overdo i should have had one of the lads take the kids out after the first hour hed thought the leg was in better shape than that clearly it wasnt he made it to the top of the stairs on will alone and stood there for a moment with sweat trickling down his back he wanted to sit down and knew he didnt dare hed never be able to get to his feet again at least now he wasnt going to have to climb any more stairs but its a long way to my room when he had just finished that thought his valet appeared as if summoned by magic and as he looked into turners concerned face he decided that pride was a great deal less important than pain milord may i turner began diffidently oh yes you certainly may reggie sighed and allowed turner to help him back to his rooms the valet was a lot more help than a mere cane milord if you dont mind my saying so youve overdone turner regarded him sternly now its not my place and im no doctor but please old man if you dont mind playing nurse ive no objection to behaving like a patient he replied then i believe that hot water is in order turner nodded briskly and took him straight into the bathroom almost carrying himwhich reggie was not at all averse to have you actually eaten anything today milord since breaking your fast i mean ah he blinked and thought a sausage and toast at luncheon a jambun and lots and lots of tea i thought so the pain takes the appetite doesnt it turner helped him out of his clothing and into the hot bath he sank into it with a hiss for the heat and a sigh of relief as the heat took the edge off the pain of his leg you stay there for a bit and let me deal with this milord reggie was only too happy to do just that once he was in the hot water he realized that it wasnt just his knee that hurtthe rest of his wounds and broken bones were aching the knee was just so bad it had overwhelmed the rest he remained in the steaming water until it had started to cool when turner appeared and helped him out again and then into bed with a hot compress wrapped around the knee there was already a tray with hot soup and some assorted sandwich quarters waiting and when he saw the familiar bottle on the tray along with his food he did not object instead he looked at turner with a raised eyebrow was it your idea or maters to get this refilled mine milord i thought you were likely to need it and i also thought you would not wish to worry your mother turners face was a study in the unreadable i dont pay you enough well have to attend to that in the morning he replied turner smiled faintly i believe milord you wont need me any more tonight goodnight milord good night turner he took his dose first then dutifully ate everything on the tray it meant that his reading was cut drastically short once the narcotic set in but considering how he had felt before he took the stuff that was a very small price to pay i hope someone warned eleanor was his last thought as he drifted off to sleep i dont want her to think she was abandoned may chipping norton oxfordshire alison woke late with the sun streaming in the window of her room in the crown and cushion feeling entirely contented with her life as it had happened she had not had to do anything about locke at all the old gods didnt like machinery by the time he had arrived at the hoar stones with the motor the last vestige of loki had long since departed his erstwhile host and warrick locke was back to being his old obsequious self nevertheless she felt as if he ought to be rewarded in some small way so on the drive back last night she had said quite casually warrick dont you think it would be useful for us to have something at our disposal that is a bit faster than this more powerful it probably isnt going to be the last time well have to traipse out into the countryside it might be a good thing to have something fast enough to take us to our destination and back to broom in the same night it would be useful he had replied doubtfully but really powerful autos take a great deal of practice to handle mrs robinson and to be honest i understand they need a certain amount of strength too are you certain you want to take something like that on she had laughed oh i dont mean to handle it a fine guy i would look got up like some demon racer no why dont you draw what you need out of the accounts and purchase something appropriate in your own name then if we need to make a fast run into the country i can ring you she didnt have to be able to see himnot that shed have been able to in the dark even if he wasnt wearing drivinggogglesto sense his rush of elation she had settled back into her seat feeling amused and content men were such simple creatures give them a new mechanical toy and suddenly they felt like gods as to whether a fast automobile would be useful or not she had no idea and didnt really care it provided an excuse to permit him to draw out a great deal of money and reward himself without actually giving him the money which would set a bad precedent and he would be ever so grateful although he was not doing badly by himself as her solicitor he would never be able on his own to afford the sort of fast powerful auto that she could purchase it was a bit of an extravagance but then once one of the girls was safely wedded to the fenyx boy such things would be mere bagatelles she had gone to bed feeling supremely satisfied with the nights work she woke feeling if anything even more contented too contented to go back to broom it was after all may day she particularly did not want to return today since may day meant she would have to attend that tedious church fair and school treat nonsense she had decided months ago that she was not going to help out with this function even though it was to be held at longacre park the only way she would be able to attract the attention of lady devlin would be to volunteer for literally everything and she would be only one person among the horde of common housewives from the womens institute and ladies friendly society doing the same thing and she really didnt want to attend either merely attending no matter how much she and the girls spent at the church stalls on things they didnt want and had no use for would still call up the question of why she wasnt participating on the other hand if business had called her unexpectedly out of town she would have the perfect excuse not to even go to the wretched thing the mere idea of being surrounded by a pack of sticky children forced to listen to recitations and to buy handmade garbage she would not even dare to throw away made her nauseated the only bright spot in the whole day would be in watching the virginal little maidens of broom trotting around the phallic maypole in the recreation of a fertility rite without anyone else having the least notion of what they were doing and that was not amusing enough to have to tolerate the rest of it london she thought with longing yes and why not she deserved it the girls had been very good they could do with a treat she could renew her assault on lady devlin once her ladyship had recovered from hosting all those wretched children a night or two in london would be just the thing some theater there were things she had forgotten in the spring shopping trip and above all it would give her a chance to recover her powers before she returned home when she went down to the dining room the girls were already there pensively eating toast and tea with warrick locke they brightened up considerably when she suggested the trip mother lauralee said her face alight with pleasure oh grand there are ever so many things i forgot last marchthat wretched laundress manages to ruin my stockings with appalling regularity we were a bit rushed alison admitted indulgently and warrick you can get that automobile i was talking about with me there i can simply write a cheque for it and there will be no tedious nonsense with drawing money on account or answering to the trust about it the usually dour expression on the solicitors face brightened to that of a boy on christmas morning that would be more convenient mrs robinson was all he said but she held back her own smile men were so transparent then lets gather up our traps and make for the railway station was all she said i suspect we can purchase a few more new things to eke out the clothing we have with us sufficiently you know she added thoughtfully the one thing we did not plan on is that we have no common clothing and if we are going to be making excursions to special sitesthis summer we really should not be wearing things that will draw attention to ourselves you can get some quite nice frocks readytowear mother carolyn observed nothing that i would wear to longacre park but good enough forexcursions then its settled away you go girls be so good as to pack up my things as well while i settle with the innkeeper the girls scrambled to obey leaving her to enjoy her own breakfast in peace and in the certainty that what had begun so well last night was only going to get better may broom warwickshire eleanor had had a restless and uncomfortable night and was mortally glad that alison and the girls were away she had been reduced eventually to sleeping on the kitchen floor near the fire inside a circle of protection before she could actually get to sleep only when her circle was around her and a couple of her salamanders were frisking about with her would the unsettled feeling that there was something horrible outside the walls of the arrows leave her then of course she oversleptalthough for her oversleeping meant rising around seven it didnt matter though since the compulsions that alison had put on her had weakened to the point that if she was merely in the kitchen at dawn she would be left alone so once she slept she slept long and deeply and only awoke at the insistent tugging of a salamander on her finger the moment she awoke she knew by the chill even here next to the hearth what it wanted the fire had burned down to the barest of coals and before she did anything else she rubbed the sleep out of her eyes and got it rekindled then she returned to the palletwhich now that she was able to take pretty much what she wanted or needed within the walls of the house was now as comfortable if not more comfortable than her bed in the attic room it looked as it always had but she had carefully handstitched a tattered rag of a coverlet over the top of a very nice woolen blanket had more blankets in hiding if she needed them and had made up a decent mattress out of one of the featherbeds left in the upstairs maids room anyone looking in on her as she slept would only see her wrapped in something that looked as if she had rescued it from the bin and once she was awake the sham was carefully hidden away in a cupboard that had once held enormous puddingbasins eleanor could not have boiled a pudding to save her soul so the basins now stowed in the cellar were not required in all the time she had been here alison had never once opened the cupboards and eleanor was fairly certain she wasnt going to begin now so when she lay back down to wake up properly it was with no sense of hardship she did however want to think very hard about the dreams shed had unlike the ones that had driven her downstairs these had been quite interesting not pleasant preciselyshe was left with the impression this morning that whatever else had been going on she had been working very hardbut certainly not disturbing am i supposed to remember them or not she asked aloud and that seemed to trigger somethinga memory ofvoices she closed her eyes and relaxed as sarah had taught her because she knew if she strained after those dreammemories they would vanish voices the first thing that came into her mind was the hollow ringing quality of them then words shes not ready i care not if she can wield the power she is not yet ready to do so that was a female voice more annoyed than angry but there was something notquitehuman about it as if it belonged to one of those fiery creatures that she had called fire fairies that had appeared to play with her in her dreams as a child there was a resonance to it that she had never heard in a human voice when are they ever but the knowledge must be there when she needs it that was a male gruff with the impression of immense age now if a volcano could have a personality this would have been it immense power was in this one held barely in check a slow power slower than that of the first voice but somehow the impression was that the speakers strength at need was exponentially greater than anything the first speaker could command and a third voicealso male and by contrast quite humansounding very well but see to it that she forgets when waking after thatnothing no matter how much she blanked her mind she could remember nothing else except that she had been working as if she were studying for the examinations to enter oxford ah now that was another clue whatever she had been doing it hadnt been physical labor it had been entirely mental assuming it was anything other than a dream which was a rather major assumption yes she knew very well that magic was real and very much a factor in her life but it didnt follow that things she dreamed about were also real whatever that was all she had of it with a sigh of frustration she stretched opened her eyes and started the day which once she was clean and dressed was interrupted again almost immediately by the sound of a great many people and wagons coming up the street this was hardly usual for broom and even less so this early in the morning what on earth could be happening out there she left by the kitchen door and went to the garden gate to peer out and saw to her puzzlement a veritable procession of wagons and carts carrying canvas and parcels and no few of the village women all of it heading up towards the road leading out of the village where on earth could they be going across the road watching with the greatest of interest as he leaned on his stick was one of the oldest men in broom gaffer clark under the thick thatch of white hair and the equally white beard it was hard to tell exactly how old he was and he himself wasnt entirely sure because there werent too many other people in broom old enough to say that they knew they were older than gaffer well if anyone would know what this was all about it would be gaffer butasking gaffer was like breaking down a dam holding back a lake of words the moment you asked him the simplest of questions a veritable torrent of words came outas gaffer would say words bein so cheap an all why not make a great tidy heap of em he was never one to keep his thoughts to himself and one of those was always that there was no reason to use one word when a dozen would do oh well she crossed the street and approached him he gave her that puzzled look that always came over the villagers because of her stepmothers spellsthe look that said i think i ought to know you and i cant imagine why i dont she just nodded to him in a friendly but subservient fashion alison wanted her to appear to be a very very lowranking servant who was not a native of broom and so she would try and fit in with that besides that very guise would give her the excuse to ask questions please sir could you tell me whats going on why are all those carts out here this morning she asked looking up at him with feigned timidity oh now well its may day and all do ye ken the gaffer said opening his bag of words and beginning to strew them about with a great smile on his face and when its may day its only right and proper that there be something to celebrate only thats being a bit hard these days seeing that the ninemanmorris is down to two mentwo and a half if you counted that poor lad i there he nodded his head at the broom pubwhats ony got half of what he left here with and theres none of the lads what does the hobbyhorse nor robin hood nor maid marian neither nor not even a decent fiddler so whats to do and none of the travelers nor the peddlermen that does the may church fair or at least not many and they aint men and school be closing short so as the little uns can be helping with the farming so says good milady devlin may god himself bless her kindly heart lets make the may day fair and the school treat all in one and have it all up at longacre well no sooner she says that than everyone thinks hoi a grand idea that and bein as shes her ladyship and all shes gotmeans dye ken he stopped just long enough to give eleanor a huge wink shes agot hold of stuff to make sweeties for the kiddies so itll be a real school treat and all and may god bless their innocent hearts they can be eating sweets till they be sick just as is proper for a school treat and master reggie whos lord fenyx now and all hell be ahanding out the prizes as its prize day along of being school treat none of your bibles and prayer books neither not that i hold with your prayer books being chapel and beggin your pardon if ive offended ye miss but thats the bare truth for a true man dont need a book to tell him what to pray and i reckon god himself gets tired of hearin the same words bein prattled every sunday with no more understanding than a babe still prizes a youngsterd be happy to have not that they shouldnt be happy to have a bible but tisnt as if they dont get bibles every time yon vicar has an excuse to hand em around no none of your bibles and prayer books for lord fenyx nohell be handin out picture books and grand stories with plenty of pirates and bandits and happy endings and what all so tis to be a grand day all around ill be hauling me old bones up there myself see if i dont gaffer hes old but not too old to know what a good time is gaffer paused for breath and eleanor took that opportunity to thank him and scuttle back across the road and in through the garden gatebecause she greatly feared that once gaffer got his breath back shed be given a detailed account of every good time that the gaffer had ever enjoyed once inside the safety of the yard she paused to consider what she had been told and now that she recalledthere had been the same sort of todo last may day but alison had not given her the leisure to think about it much less ask and of course reggie hadnt been up at longacre either reggie if he was to be handing out the school prizes then of course he wouldnt be able to get down to round meadow by teatime hed be lucky to get away before sunset if at all if she knew reggie at all she knew he wouldnt just be a figurehead hed be doing something to help and she wouldnt be seeing sarah either sarah herself had said as much well may day there was undoubtedly something witchy to be done on may day sarah had been quite reticent about her plans and eleanor knew better than to pry there was no way that she could get the bond to stretch all the way to longacre park she was lucky to get as far as round meadow which was far enough from the manor that reggie drove his automobile to get there it was hard not to feel disappointed and deserted as she walked back into the kitchen and stood staring at the fire on the hearth everyone it seemed was going to be having some sort of celebration but eleanor as the last of the carts rattled out of the village a strange quiet settled over the place it was quite literally as still out there as if it was two or three in the morning except for birdcalls and the occasional distant crow of a rooster she hadnt until that moment realized how much sound there was even in such a small village as broom until the moment when it was gone she was all alone there was no one to talk to no one to be with one of the few days she would be able to get away to see reggie and he wouldnt even be there because he was up there at that enormous manor playing his lordship tomorrow alison and the girls would probably be back and her imprisonment would begin again its not fair she sat down on the kitchen stool and stared out the window its not and she felt tears of selfpity start to well up and then she blinked and firmed her chin and sat straight up what had she to feel sorry about good heavens it was may day and alison and the girls were somewhere far far away and she could go out to round meadow or anywhere else she could reach and go and gather the first may day flowers shed have been able to pick since before the war and there were at least four old ladies on cottagers row that no one would be bringing may bouquets to and who were too old to get up the hill to the fair four poor old ladies who had given all their best years to the service of someone else and who were now sitting in their little cottages with no one for company except each other now there were people who had a right to feel sorry for themselves imight as well find out if i can manage two excursions outside the arrows in a day with resolution she got her sprig of rosemary broke it and made the proper incantation then got a basket and went amaying she wandered through pastures deserted by all but the sheep and cows finding flowers she hadnt seen in three years she visited little copses where she recalled the shyer flowers blooming and there they were untouched by anyone else of course that only made sense the children who would have picked this may day bounty had been too excited by the coming treat to go make may baskets for their mothers and little sweethearts and the older girls the older girls have no sweethearts to make may garlands for either suddenly she stopped feeling quite so sorry for herself in fact the last wedding in the village had been her old schoolmate cynthia kerns whod had one day with her husband before he went back to the front one day no it was no wonder that the flowers were still blooming here there was no one to pick them all the young men were gone and the young ladies didnt have much heart for picking flowers she returned long before the sprig had withered with a basket full of cowslips and primroses liliesofthevalley and other early flowers with a skill she had thought she had forgotten she wove grasses into little maybaskets then raided the teacakes for a couple of sweet treats laying them in the baskets with her own bouquets she surveyed her handiwork with pardonable pride there now thats right and proper she had made up four lovely little maybaskets of the sort she remembered from much happier days the baskets wouldnt last a day the flowers would linger only for two or three more but it was the thought that counted wasnt it she cast the spell a second time and with a larger basket laden with her offerings went down to cottagers row the proper may day protocol was to lay ones offering on the stoop knock at the door and run away the problem was eleanor very much doubted that any of these old ladies would be able to bend down to pick up her offerings and even if they could they might not be able to get back up again so she went to each in turn knocked on the door and presented very surprised and touched old women with her gift and a simple first of may maam with the little curtsey you would expect from a lower servant girl and then with eyes cast down before any of them could ask who she was or who had sent her she hurried away she went around the corner and waited until her recipient went back into her house before going on to the next one they would probably get together over tea and compare notes but there was no harm in that the point was that each should have a pleasant surprise from someone unknown not that any of these old women would know who she was even if she gave them her real name the likelihood that any of them would even be aware of a robinson family living at the arrows was pretty remote as servants up at the manor they knew less than a quarter of the very small population of broom only those with whom they had family ties servants at a great house had very little time to themselves no more than a half day or so off every couple of weeks and even less to spare to go visiting even their own families from the time they had entered service to the time when they were pensioned off their social circle had been among their fellow servants not down hereand any old friends theyd once had might well themselves be dead at this point and once again she realized that she had very little reason to feel sorry for herself even if her stepmothers spell kept people from recognizing her people still knew who she wasand at least one remembered her and recognized her as for those four old ladies at least they knew that someone had remembered them today and eleanor found a little smile of pleasure playing about her lips as she hurried back to the arrows she indulged herself with a slightly extravagant luncheon but as she finished it a spirit of restlessness overcame her and she felt far too unsettled to spend the day reading so instead she went all over the house flung open all of the windows to the spring breezes andafter a moment of thoughtbegan to clean oh not the spring cleaning that alison would without a doubt set her to the moment she and the girls got home no this time she would clean what she wanted to clean in the years since the war began shed not been able to air out her own bedding or clean her own room more than twice and only after she was exhausted from her daily work so it was her tiny room that got turned out and swept and dusted until there wasnt a speck of dirt anywhere in it the mattress put out in the garden to air the blankets and coverlet left to hang over the line the threadbare carpet beaten within an inch of its life it was every stitch of her own clothing that got washed and hung to dry then put away with rosemary sprigs to scent it it was the palletbed from the kitchen that got the same treatment as her bedding from her bedroom and with time still on her hands in the late afternoon she decided to go upstairs into the attic and see what was there she honestly didnt expect much after all she and her father werent the family that had owned the arrows for the last howevermany generations and she fully expected that the original family would have cleaned out every bit of their ancestral goods except that once she climbed the stairs and unlocked the door to the longignored roomshe discovered that they hadnt she had never been here before not even once alison had turned her into a servant perhaps everyone had assumed that the attic was empty and since the war there had been such a shortage of things that no one actually had anything to go up in an attic to stow things away not even clothing once alison or the girls deemed a frock too worn or too outofdate to wear it went to the church for distribution to the deserving poor in an ostentatious display of false piety so the piled up furnishings and dustcovered trunks came as a startling surprise as she blinked at them in the musty gloom the air was full of dust and light shone only dimly through the single grimy window but there must have been enough in the way of furnishings here to fill two or three rooms and a great deal more in the way of trunks boxes and crates to the windowless back of the attic she could dimly make out the shapes of exceedingly oldfashioned furniture piled up to the ceiling heavy stuff ornately carved at least one very oldfashioned fourpost bed with a wooden canopy straightback chairs a table so heavy she wondered how anyone had gotten it up here in front of the furniture were the trunks and boxes piled upon one another no books which seemed oddbut then perhaps most of the former owners hadnt been readers to speak of surely there isnt anything usable up here she thought doubtfully but something of the child who cannot help but see a trunk and think treasure must still have been in her for she went to the nearest and flung open the lid to look and then the nextand the nextand the next soon enough she had been half rightand half wrong the trunks were full of all manner of things childrens books battered and torn and broken toys trunk after trunk full of threadbare linens motheaten blankets and ancient curtains more trunks full of antique clothing all of the clothing dated to the last century at least from the era of the bustle and the hoopskirt and had been thriftily packed away with springs of lavender so old it crumbled when she touched it the silks were so old that they practically fell apart when she picked them up merely lifting them made them tear the furs had evidently been raising entire hoards of little mothlets and so had the woolens and yet not everything was a complete loss most of the trimmings the laces the beads and the embroideries were still sound and there were gowns that somehow had escaped the moth and the mildew and dryrot anything linen or cotton was perfectly good for instance and there were a couple of victorian ballgowns that were if terribly creased also wonderfully evocative of the bygone belles who must have worn them of course the ballgowns were absolutely useless to her but she gathered up the linen skirts well aware that each of the voluminous things made to wear over the huge hoops formerly fashionable would make two or three modern walking skirts for her she would have to be very careful and do all her sewing at night but she wouldnt have to look quite as shabby as she had been doing shirtwaists and blouses plain ones at least hadnt changed much in all that time either perhaps a little altering of collars would be needed but not much more than that then she came upon the trunk that had been tucked away under the dustcovered window well away from the rest it was a very small trunk hardly more than a box and as she brushed the dust from the top of it she froze for there carefully written on a paper label stuck to the top of it was her own name eleanor robinson may broom warwickshire eleanor stared at the faded words on the old paper label transfixed this wasnt a hand that she recognized certainly not her own writing and not her fathers whose then could it possibly be she hardly dared think of it she finally took a deep breath and opened the box her hands were trembling as she did so it contained two things an envelope and what looked like a copybook she lifted both out carefully as if they might disintegrate like the shattered silks of the ancient gowns in the other trunks she peered at them and tried to make out what was written on them only to realize that the light was too dim in here to read the fading words ineed proper light she bundled up her linen skirts and shirtwaists under one arm put the envelope with great care inside the front cover of the copybook and took everything downstairs trembling inside knees feeling weak both excited and afraid to discover what it was she had found she left the clothing in the washhouse where it was unlikely to be discovered then realizing that the sun was setting she took her two finds into the parlor and lit the oil lamps and then of course she realized just how grimy she was so she delayed the moment of discovery still further by going to wash her hands and face somehow she didnt want to touch her discoveries with filthy hands it didnt feel right and somehow she wanted to delay that moment of discovery she was not sure why but she both longed for and feared the moment when she would open that envelope and learn what lay inside only then with clean hands and face did she sit down at the table remove the envelope from inside the copybook with hands that shook with excitement and opened the flap there was a note inside a very short note in the same hand that had written her name on the box the paper had yellowed the ink had browned but the writing was clear enough the words hit her like blows burned into her mind as if they had been branded there my dear daughter it began and she bit back a cry to realize that the writer as she had not dared to hope was her own longdead mother my friend sarah would laugh at me if she knew i was doing this she would say that i am anticipating the worst i would only say that since neither of us have the gift of scrying into the future one cannot anticipate anything and i am taking precautions if you have found this you have found my most important legacy to you my daughter whom i knew would one day wield the power of a master of fire sarah is neither a master nor of your element and cannot teach you most of what you need to know it was hard for me to find a teacher it may be that by the time you find this you already have determined you too will not be able to find a fire master willing to teach a mere girl in this book you will find all that i know if you have not already done so go to sarah the midwife some call our village witch and ask her to help you since i am not there to do so myself be fearless and strong and seize your birthright with all the strength that is in you and that was all eleanor felt disappointed horribly dreadfully disappointed where were the tender sentiments the assurances that she had been loved and cherished and that wherever her mother was she still loved her daughter where were the gentle words of encouragement from beyond the grave this might just as well have been a note from one of the tutors at oxford for all the warmth that was in it she held the note in hands that shook and felt like a little girl on what she dreamed was christmas morning who awakens to find that it is not the glorious holiday but just another day she had always thought always assumed that if she ever ever found something for her from her longlost mother it would be full of messages of love and devotion thisthis was more like the old roman matrons cry to her son departing for the wars return with your shield or on it where was the love in that maybe she didnt care about me after all maybe all she thought of me was that i was someone to follow in her footsteps she felt bereft as if something had been taken from her and as she sat there the copybook still unopened two huge tears gathered in her stinging eyes overflowed and burned their way down her cheeks ah here you are sarah exclaimed from the parlor door what on earth are you doing in here she turned and sarah started a little and why on earth are you crying the witch exclaimed looking astonished whats happened eleanor sniffed back more tears and held out the note and the unopened book iwent up to the attic she said around the enormous and painful lump in her throat that threatened to choke her and i found these sarah made quick work of the note her eyes widening and her face taking on an expression of astonished pleasure good heavens girl dont you realize what this is its what i cant teach you this is wonderful why are you weeping like that she didntshe didnt eleanor began to sob she couldnt help it the tears just started and wouldnt stop she never says she loved me oh my dear suddenly sarah softened all over in a way that eleanor had never seen her do before she sat down on the chair next to eleanor and took eleanor into her arms unresisting eleanor sagged against her you silly little goose she said fondly holding eleanor against her shoulder and wiping away eleanors tears with the corner of her apron of course she didnt why should she she never expected you to read that note she always thought she would be there teaching you herself cant you read how selfconscious her words are how stiff yes but eleanor began well there you are she was just being what i would have called sillycautious and she knew i would have made fun of her if id known she was writing that sarah stroked her hair her voice full of such unshakeable conviction that eleanor could not disbelieve she told you every single day several times a day how much she loved you first thing on waking and last thing at night i heard her she showed you hundreds of times more in a day why should she tell you in a note when she thought she would always be here to keep telling and showing you eleanor managed to control her sobbing and sarahs words penetrated her grief somewhat butwhy didnt she think now silly child look at that note why dont you sarah said half fondly half scolding giving eleanors shoulders a little shake in her best copperplate handwriting and phrased as formally and stiff as an invitation to lady devlin to tea your mother was a simple village girl child she loved to read but writing things for her when you wrote something it was formal stiff and important well except when you were writing down recipes i dont think she ever wrote a letter in her life not even to me her best friend your father might have written her a loveletter or two but she certainly didnt write any back do you understand what im saying she could no more have written anything sentimental thanthan commanded an undine the words penetrated the fog of her distressand more than that they made sense perfect sense slowly the grief faded so she yes you greengoose she loved you more than her own life sarah scolded she loved you enough to spend hours writing down everything she knew about fire mastery and this from a woman who i know for a certain fact would rather have scrubbed out the washhouse on hands and knees than pick up a pen put like that eleanor freed herself from sarahs motherly embrace smiled wanly at her and wiped her eyes with her own aproncorner i suppose i am being silly sarah shook her head fondly no you were being perfectly natural if you go on weeping though you will be acting in a very silly and selfish manner have you looked at the book yet eleanor shook her head then it can wait until youve had some supper as practical as ever sarah drew her out into the kitchen where they put together mushrooms and eggs and wild herbs that sarah had brought with her along with careful gleanings from alisons stores only when both of them were finished the dishes and pans washed and put up and everything tidy again did sarah go out to the parlor and return with the book and the lamp lets have a good look at this shall we she said conversationally an hour later and sarah was sitting there shaking her head while eleanors head ached from trying to understand what was written in the pages of that copybook now i know i never want to be a master sarah said decisively i like things plain plain as plain i like earth to be earth and not she waved her hand helplessly not erda and epona and gnomes and fertility and not wrapped up in symbols and fables she frowned i like things to be one thing and not like one of those silly dolls you open up and find another and another and another eleanor blinked her eyes sore and rubbed both temples with the tips of her fingers its going to take me a long time she admitted i canits like reaching for something on the top shelf that i cant see i can barely touch it make out the edge of it but i know its there and if i can just reach a little further i know i can grasp it well if thats what your mother mastered all i can say is that i had no idea sarah looked forlorn she seemed soordinary it was all inside her eleanor mused shutting the book with a feeling that if she looked too much longer at those words they would start dancing about in her mind i wonder where she learned it all she doesnt say she must have found some great master to learn from but who sarah sat back in her chair and reached for her teacup now that is a good question i dont know who the masters are for the most part they like to keep it that way so people dont have a chance to let things slip other masters know of course but thats all within their own circle she frowned and another thing the masters in that circle are almost always men hmm you think she must have found a lady master of fire a secret one eleanor asked eagerly or one found her there is that old saying that when the student is ready a teacher will find her sarah nodded and theres no telling who it would have been she was from stratfordonavon so it wouldnt be anyone i could point a finger at stratfords always produced its share of odd ones and wizards and its not so much of a city that a master would feel uncomfortable there not like london or glasgow or manchester she licked her lips the more i think on it the more that makes sense i remember her telling me that the magic ran in her family but deep her grandsire was a master but not her father huh maybe twas her grandsire found her the fire master well whoever it was he or she was like a university don eleanor replied ruefully thisthis isoh an idea had suddenly occurred to her and she sat up straight what what sarah asked sharply i just realized that i recognize this she said from the medieval history i was studying for the examinations to get into oxford this is alchemyalchemy and medieval mysticism the how many angels can dance on the head of a pin sort of thing maybe it was some sort of don she was studying with well its like no way that i was taught or even heard of but if it works well enough for you that is what counts sarah stood up to go and hesitated do you think that book should stay here no eleanor told her instantly i want to take no chances that she might find it i was going to ask you to take it with you and keep it besides if what mother learned is based on alchemy and that sort of thing there are books in the library here that can help me that have been here all along if alison sees me studying one of those shell just assume im in desperate want of something to read sarah gathered up the old book and tucked it under her shawl i think thats wise very wise well my day began before dawn so if alison doesnt come back i will see you on the morrow thank you sarah eleanor said getting to her feet and letting her mentor out the kitchen door thank you very much she should have been tired but somehow she wasnt and she decided to go to the library with the lamp and see if she couldnt find the books she thought that she remembered there were a lot of odd books in this room things that certainly hadnt matched with any of her fathers interests and that up until now she hadnt associated with her mother either old things that didnt even have titles imprinted on the spines much less an authors name but sure enough when she took them down she found that there were several on natural philosophy and alchemie ye historic and practice of alchemie and that when she looked inside the front cover there was a name in crabbed and faded handwriting utterly unlike her mothers and a datethe earliest she found was and the oldest the first name was clear enoughvaleria which did sound like a womanbut the second was indecipherable so ill probably never know if these were mothers books given to her by her teacher or things picked up at a jumble sale still they might prove useful if her mothers teaching was based on creaky old mysticism and not the practical approach that sarah preferred she rearranged the rest of the books to keep it from looking as if she had taken anything no use in alerting alison or the girls to the fact that she was reading all of the books on alchemy if they found her reading one theyd assume it was a fluke you know in all of the time theyve been here and the things theyve let slip about their own magic i dont think theyve ever said anything that sounded like the things in mothers workbook i dont think they were taught the same son of way she was well that was all to the good she took the books up to her room and after some thought distributed them around the room in ways that made it look as if she was doing anything but reading them one went under the tooshort leg of a wobbly dresser one could be placed to hold open the shutterthe rest she placed here and there anywhere that looked as if she didnt care what happened to them as if a brick or a stone could have served the same function that way if anyone noticed that they were all about alchemy she could say that she had taken the books she thought no one would ever want to read she lit a bedside candle changed into her nightdress climbed into bed and settled in for a read within a few paragraphs she knew that her hunch was right her mothers workbook had paragraphs that were very like a condensed form of what she found here mind these books were altogether too wordy but she was used to that the great classic writers tended to be just about as wordy they were just better at it the study of alchemy according to this philosopher had never been about finding ways to change base metal into gold that particular transmutation itself was merely a philosophical expression for the evolution and maturation of a human spirit to change ones own self from the heavy leaden soul who could scarcely lift his eyes to the heavens much less soar among them to the winged pure and precious intellect that could neither tarnish nor be debased the philosophers stone was not a thing but a processas so the book said a spell was not really a thing but a process spells were the processes by which a magician imposed his or her will on the surrounding universe the philosophers stone was the process by which the magician transmuted his or herself into a state in which he or she could understand the universe maybe even become one with it and if her mothers workbook had been dense with symbolic meanings this book was overflowing with them nothing it seemed existed without having double and triple meanings not even the most commonplace items a broom was a broom and a means of cleansing the symbol for cleansing and a symbol of the cleansing power of air even the old gods were merely symbols for other things powers emotions stages on the lifejourney but here were the old familiar friendsearth air fire and water if you knew what to look for you quickly realized that the man who wrote this book understood mastery the book was written in such a way that those who were not magicians could take it as pure philosophybut for those who were this book and probably some of the others were a guide beyond the practical application of magic into the theory behind it and when you knew the theory and the philosophy you could create your own pathways and applications slowly with much reading and rereading of the same paragraphs things began to fit into place she had originally intended to concentrate only on her own element but it soon became clear that this was a bad idea not only were the powers and meanings of all four elements incestuously intertwined but after all alison was an earth master and reggie an air master to defeat the one and help the other she had to learn about their elements and at that point it made little sense to skip learning about the antagonistic element to her own water she finally felt her eyelids growing too heavy and set the book aside blowing out the candle phrases from the book still echoing in her mind as she drifted into sleep she didnt understand them yet but soonsoon the first step must be into the first sphere the sphere of imagination for intellect must be the servant of imagination and not the master eleanor woke slowly with the strangest feelingas if once she had put the book down last night she had gone into dreams only to find that in her dreams she was still trying to come to grips with what she had read except that in the dream there was something or someone helping her grasp it and the moment she woke she realized that she did grasp some of what shed been reading and had put it together with what had been in the workbook in fact that was exactly what she needed to dostart putting things together since all things were connected and each had aspects of the rest the only actual starting place was the intellect which led into the imagination after that the imagination led everywhere shed been trying to think of all of the planes of her mothers bookor spheres as the alchemy book called themas being separate and that things somehow passed from one to another but it wasnt like that at all everything was layered on top of everything else and everything coexisted at once the physical world that everyone saw and lived in was overlaid with all of the magic worlds the difference between a regular person and a magician was whether or not you could see each layer which was why those nasty little gnomish things in the meadow had seemed to dig their way into the ground without actually disturbing it they werent really digging into the ground they were moving themselves out of the plane of the real worldwhich the alchemy book called middle earth and into one of the lower planes probably the dark earth plane where she couldnt see them anymore and the salamanders couldnt follow both because they werent creatures of earth and because they werent creatures of the dark ways every sphere had a corresponding dark side and as a light path magician you didnt want to go there unless you absolutely had to not because you could get hurt but because you could get seduced and corrupted unless you were very very careful you couldnt go there if you were a light path elemental she could have if she had known how to get her imagination to move her awareness into the plane of earth because humans were uniquely able to move among all the planes but she wouldnt have been comfortable there because it wasnt her element either imagination that was the key whatever she could imagine if she could do it well enough and believe in it she could see intellect ruled the middle earth which lay between the spheres of the light path and the spheres of the dark it reflected both though the balance shifted as affairs in the middle earth itself shifted and as the balance of power between the light path spheres and the dark path spheres shifted those who subscribed only to intellect could never move beyond the middle earth but those who explored imagination and intuition found the way into the other spheres open to them and once you learned the symbolic logic of those other spheres you knew how to manipulate your magic and how to counter the magic of other elements than your own now that meant that eleanor would have a fighting chance of undoing what alison had done to her even if she wasnt as strong a magician as alison it didnt take a hammer to crack a nut a little pressure applied at the right place would split it open what was more eleanor had a shrewd hunch that alisons spells only worked against her on this plane once she learned how to move among the planes she could travel them relatively unhindered once i learn to move among the planes once i really understand the plane of earth magic i will find the key to break her spells she knew that it made perfect sense knowledge and understanding not force were going to be the keys to her shackles but to do that to be able to step beyond this middle earth and into the rest she would have to do a lot of work she had once thought that preparing for the examinations to get into oxford was hard work this would be ten times harder she was going to have to go completely beyond what she had always taken as the truth into a whole new set of truthsand then believe in them well no one said it was going to be easy she got up and ran through her usual chores in an absentminded fashion her hands and body did the work while her mind repeated some of what she thought she was beginning to understand from the books it might have seemed odd but amid all those philosophical musing she did not forget to wash all those cotton shirtwaists and linen skirts she had brought down from the attic nor to put them upwell out of sight of the bedroom windowson lines in the garden to dry it seemed very strange to be doing all these intensely common and practical things while her head was buzzing with alchemical esoterica and as she worked she kept remembering links to the symbology of even the most ordinary thingsas she scrubbed she was also thinking water is the sphere of emotion although there are emotions associated with all the elements they all have more strength here in water especially the nurturing onesthats the light path though the dark path is the emotions that destroy like a flood washing everything away in its path and water is mutablesolid to liquid to gas and back again so it represents change while unchanging water the dark path is stagnation and nothing can grow without it so it also has an aspect of growth but too much water can kill so theres death it can purify and pollute it can fill or drown the alchemical creature is the hippocampus showing the links among water air and earth water is hard to control because its hard to contain not as hard as air though and then that and a whiff of flowers sent her into air the sphere of mercury the sphere of memory the strongest memorytrigger there is is scent more of a sphere of intellect than emotion though mercury is changable and volatile more so than water the zephyr refreshes the tempest sweeps away too much air can intoxicate too little and you die it can cleanse too or destroy mostly its too thin to support emotion or at least intense emotion memories generally come at a distance you can forget how you felt when you went through those incidents originally pride though theres pride there and thats why mercury is the god of liars because people lie to bolster their pride and maintain their pride and thieves because thieves are proud of their skill thats the dark path theres no reason why you shouldnt take pride in your work and theres nothing wrong with change hardest of the elements to contain but not so hard to control since fire devours it water ignores it earth deflects itthe alchemical creature is the phoenyx even though the phoenyx is also a fire elemental showing the links among air water and fire scrubbing the floor led toearth alisons element the sphere of passionlove on the path of light lust on the dark path seduction which sits on the line between the two paths not changeable noit takes a lot to force the earth to change passion is a really useful thing you cant really create something that will live without it passion is an implacable force like an avalancheonce you start it it takes a long time to stop it maybe thats why she had to wait until i was in an emotional breakdown before she could bind me the dark path isnt stagnation thoughits rot or sterility creator and devourer earth is among others the goddesses erda and hera who are both prone to creation and destruction there may be a key to defeating alison in that but what is it the alchemical creature is the gryphon showing the links among earth air and water even though the gryphon is also an elemental of air she mused over that while she cooked then lingered over her breakfast having come around to her own element at last fire sphere of anger mars the alchemical creature is the dragon showing the links among air earth and fire the dragon of the light is wise and ancient the dragon of the dark is almost mindless and constantly in a rage fire cleanses and destroys the dark path is the fire that only devours i suppose since there is no fire that is not in a state of constant change the light path would be the fire that cleanses or maybe the fire that serves instead of the uncontrolled fire that eats everything in its path i suppose anger can be productive righteous anger but what a narrow divide between light and dark righteous anger should lead you to justice which is why justice is also here but but justice is blind and there is no mercy in the sphere of fire justice judgment is more like it and anger like fire is hard to control and the most apt to turn and destroy the person trying to control it hatechanneled anger how do i control my anger because if i dont it will control me intellect and imagination that was what it had to be that was what it seemed to come down to somehow she had to use both no wonder fire was supposed to be the most dangerous of the elements and the most seductive anger was intoxicating she knew that already and when anger ran out another branch on the dark pathdespair oh i know the taste of that despair because its self hate yes that belongs here in fire too like fire despair devours what sustains it and despair can coil you right back to anger again unthinking anger the kind that just lashes out she almost wished she had never picked up that book never read what was in those pages sarahs way had been so much simpler sarahs way would never have gotten me where i need to go she had to become a master if she was going to break alisons hold on her she was beginning to think that there were masters and there were mastersthose who used their magic and those who really truly understood it and maybe alison hadnt gotten to her mastery by following this course but but if she hasnt then that may be her weakness if shes gone the simpler most direct route to power it means shes left all those other paths that are still there unwatched unguarded its like having a fortress and leaving all the windows open while you carefully lock the only door eleanor finished her breakfast and tidied up her mind still turning over all the things she had studied fire is swords in the tarot deck theres mars again so thats my weakness the one shell try to exploit because if theres one thing she really does understand its how to use someones weaknesses against him and how to turn a strength into a weakness to exploit anger hate and despair she stopped dead in the middle of the kitchen and clapped her hand to her mouth as a sudden revelation hit she already has she already has the night we got the news about father being killed i was in despair and she pounced on it and the more she thought about it the more it seemed to her that alisons spells always got stronger the more depressed that eleanor was the question was did alison know about the alchemical philosophy or was this a case of something elsethe simple siphoning of dark power from someone who was generating a lot of it the sooner she knew the answer to that question the better off she would be andimagination and intellectthe answer just might be right under my nose may longacre park warwickshire reggie halfwoke several times during the night responding to a vague feeling of presences in his room with him most narcotics and soporifics actually had the effect of taking down the mental barriers between even ordinary folk and the unseen but doctor maya had seen to it that reggies prescriptions had added components to them that had the opposite effect or so he assumed anyway since after he had started taking the drugs that she had prescribed his sleep was no longer troubled by unwanted visitors so the feeling of presence was never enough to trouble his dreams or fully wake him out of slumber the painkillers did their job and he woke late in the morning of the second of may feeling stiff and sore but not halfcrippled he dressed without assistance and made his way down to breakfast with only the aid of a cane there was an odd addition to the usually spartan breakfast menu teacakes split and lightly toasted in place of actual toast scones or crumpets he eyed them with amusement it seemed that there were still leftovers from the school treat waste not want not he said aloud and treated them like toasted crumpets or scones his mother always an early riser had long since had her breakfast and was probably out with the gardener dealing with the inevitable damage done to the gardens by the children there were always accidents and little ones too small to know any better who would tear up flower beds making bouquets fortunately the famous roses were perfectly capable of defending themselves the herb garden was in a walled and hedged space of its own that was offlimits during the school treat and the current gardener was not likely to threaten suicide over some tornup plants after a quite satisfactory breakfast he went to the windows of the terrace and spotted her as he had expected pointing to places in the flower beds and presumably talking over repairs with the gardener it was too far for him to hear what they were saying but when he went outside to the balustrade she saw him watching and waved and shortly thereafter joined him upon the terrace the little terrors she said fondly the primroses are quite decimated and the tulips and daffodils as well luckily they did not actually tear up any bulbs this year and we planned for this at any rate there are more than enough plants coming along in the greenhouse to cover the damage in two days no one will know they were here hmm he replied giving her a sideways glance i seem to recall a certain little boy who presented his mother with a may day bouquet of all of the exceedingly rare doubleruffled tulips that the gardener had been cosseting over the winter in hopes of finally getting a good show out of them and very lovely they looked in a vase on my desk too she chuckled furthermore despite all predictions to the contrary they gave just as good a show the next spring and the times being what they are i would rather have happy children than a perfect garden youre a trump mater he said warmly bending down to kiss her cheek i have my moments she agreed oh your aunt is definitely coming and i must say i am glad of it the brigadier offered to bring her in his motorcar so theyll be arriving together good and we ought to start having small parties with some of our neighbors too he said even though that was really the last thing he wanted he was going to enjoy having the brigadier here and his aunt would be good company for his mother but but the truth was he would have been a great deal happier with no more than that aunt has an instinct for when i want to be left alone and the brigadier does a good job of keeping himself to himself but some of the neighbors nevertheless he could see for himself how much more animated his mother was she needed the company even if he didnt want it it was about time she started to live again well well see what your aunt suggests was all his mother said but he knew there would at least be some dinners and some cardparties and very probably things would start simmering and break out in tea dances and garden parties and tennis parties and possibly even he resolved not to think about it until it happened but he knew what his mother was thinking when she said altogether too casually i must say i was pleasantly surprised by the strength of your gramophone it quite takes the place of musicians doesnt it may broom warwickshire it was the second of may and eleanor was still alone in the house she could hardly believe her good fortune whatever was keeping her stepmother and stepsisters away eleanor hoped it was vastly entertaining the longer they stayed away the better now since the entire party had gone off by motorcar eleanor knew that she would not be seeing them until evening at the earliest if they even returned today at all alison preferred to rise as late as possible and travel in a leisurely manner so this meant that today at least she should have the whole of the day in freedom or at least relative freedom more freedom than shed had for three years in that moment she felt a shadow of depression fall over her freedom she wasnt free to use that word even to herself was to mock her own condition she could only leave the house for an hour or two at most she couldnt talk to anyone and be believed what food she ate that wasnt stolen was scant and poor her clothing was the rags of what shed owned three years ago she labored as a menial from dawn to dusk unpaid no better than a slave any tiny crumb of pleasure she got could be snatched away at any time such freedom when her stepmother was in the house she couldnt leave it only one person besides the village witch recognized who she really was and she couldnt tell him the truth because her very words were hedged about and compelled by spells freedom scullery maids had more freedom than she did she felt her eyes stinging and stifled a sob whats the use im a prisoner no matter what happens but she felt rebellion against that despair stirring inside her after a moment and she scrubbed the incipient tears away with the back of her hand fiercely all right she was a prisoner nowbut less of one than she had been a few months ago alison was no longer the only one with magic at her command her compulsions and spells were weakening under the steady pressure of what eleanor was learning to master and there was the promise of freedom in her mothers workbook one day eleanor would be a master of fire she would hold to that hope and that promise hopeso much could be endured so long as there was hope iwill work she pledged herself fiercely i will become a master of fire and then i will take back my freedom nothing else matters even if i have to make my way as a servant because no one will believe what happened i will have that and meanwhilemeanwhile life would go on she would steal what pleasure she could she would win whatever scraps she could she would learn by day and hide her growing power under the mask of the meek and frightened girl that alison expected to see and she might as well use alisons absence to remake some of those skirts and shirtwaists for instance or one set at any rate a simple unadorned skirt and an altered blouse should not be beyond her sewing ability in its way that was rebellion too maybe no one would notice but she would be less ragged less beggarly and have regained just a little more dignity if only in her own mind it was hard to feel anything but a victim when all you had was patched and threadbare clothing not even a street urchin would want she would gain back a little of her own pride in spite of alison the thought was the parent to the deed after as little cleaning of the house as she could get away with to satisfy alisons spells she attacked the now dry and clean skirts and blouses with scissors and needle she did all her cuttingout at once because she might not get another chance took the scraps and put them in the ragbag to hide them then laid the pieces away under her bedall but the makings for one new skirt and shirtwaist she had been an indifferent seamstress before alison arrived why should she be any good at it when shed never had to so much as turn up a hem in her life but shed been forced to learn mostly by observing the maids for alison had no intention of parting with a single penny to keep eleanor clothedand of course once all of the maids were gone eleanor added the task of mending her stepsisters clothing to the rest of her chores by then she had learned on her own garments as they grew shabbier with each day hems came down seams ripped and when one did all the rough work of the house sooner or later things got torn all of her current clothing dated from and before most of it was looking like something even a gypsy would be ashamed of and the best of it was shabby well theres one blessing she thought as she sat out in the garden sewing as quickly as she could theres not a lot of material in a modern skin compared to the ones i just cut up if id been living fifty years ago this would take days the old linen was soft and heavy like a damask tablecloth and if the color had faded from its original indigo to a softer blue at least it had faded evenly and the color was still pretty and she could use the time while her fingers worked to continue to puzzle out the cryptic things she had read in the alchemy books last night she began by trying to puzzle them out rationally and logically but as the needle wove through the heavy linen it became more of a meditation fire flame heat the heat of passion of love and anger righteous anger carefully controlled anger as a weapon could love be a weapon a weaponwell perhaps not but armor certainly armor and as a shield it was hard to get past her own education in a way young ladies werent supposed to think about anger or passion young ladies young ladies werent supposed to think about a great many things but she had never let that stop her before it was long past the time when what young ladies were supposed to think about was changed passion passion was dangerous passion overcame reason yes it could but only if you surrendered your own will to it that was in the alchemy books too if your will was strong and your heart listened to your head passion could be a great force for good passion could drive a person to do more far more than she thought she could passion became strength she thought about the book that had held drawings of some strange cards cards unlike the playing cards she was used to the card called strength was a picture of a beautiful maiden gently holding the jaws of a lion shut with a single hand that was passion in control of will the heart obeying the head fire yearned to blaze without control and yet under the gentle guidance of will it was a willing servant not tame but tempered the needle flashed in the sunlight the seams grew of themselves it was a pleasure to sew out here in the sun and by just luncheon she was finished as she surveyed her handiwork with pleasure and a little pride in her accomplishmentthree years ago she would havent even have been able to sew up the hemshe couldnt help but wonder that if she wore these up to the meadow would reggie notice ah what am i thinking why should he notice what i wear or dont wear she shook off those thoughts changed into her new outfit with a sense of making another little step back toward that world she had been evicted from and ate her luncheon with her nose firmly in her alchemy books one of the authors was very taken with a magical discipline called the kabala but the moment she tried to puzzle that out she felt her eyes practically watering if her mother had ever mastered that school there was no sign of it in the notes she had left and all of the numbers and letters and strange words just made eleanors head ache she went back to her medievalists the book with the drawings of the cards attracted her profoundly she couldnt have said why because she wasnt interested in the socalled fortunetelling abilities of the cards no it was more as if they could tell her something about the powers of the elements in a more understandable way than that kabala book it was not exactly pleasurereading she had to reread most paragraphs several times and then pause and think about what she had just read before she went on she didnt manage to get through more than a couple of pages at that speed so when teatime approached she packed up her basket with a sense of reprieve even if hes not there she thought as she walked bareheaded in the beautiful may sunshine im staying out for a while as long as i can who knows when ill get outside the garden again once alison returns no one paid any more attention to her today than they did any other day but as she made mental comparisons between her new clothing and that of the other girls she passed she was pleased to see that it held up in the comparison of course this was nothing like the nice frocks she used to haveand as for the wardrobes of alison and the girlsyou might as well compare a head of cabbage to a hothouse rose reggie would not be impressed she suspected not unless he was seeing her in anything like the kind of clothing the girls of his set wore and that was about as likely as being able to fly but at least she wouldnt be looking like a beggar or a gypsy more like a poor governess she thought as she reached the outskirts of the village and sighed but then it isnt as if i have any hope of she resolutely turned her thoughts away from hopes of any kind she was spending time in the company of someone who was intelligent and friendly and knew who she was that was enough it had to be enough it was all she was going to get and i might not get that today she reminded herself as she reached the border of the manor lands and made her way through the trees and through grass that seemed longer today than yesterday after all what am i to him nothing more than someone his mother isnt trying to get him to marry and maybe a friend iwant to be his friend she realized with an ache of longing surely that much isnt too much to ask for and how much of a friend could someone be who probably hadnt said more than a few hundred words to him over the course of a decade oh she could be his friend readily enough but why should he be hers no he probably wasnt there he had no reason to be she was someone pleasant and intelligent to talk to but he could find that in any of his old friends from the university if any of them are still alive but to her undisguised delight he was waiting for her at the usual spot reading something as she came up through the last of the trees he looked up with a start as a twig broke under her foot his head jerking wildly as he scanned the trees for the source of the sound he recovered quickly and waved at her but that first reaction made her furrow her brow as she approached him what on earth had caused that was he seeing some of those wretched goblins butno if there were any here to see she would be seeing them but his expression was affable enough as she approached and as she got near to him wading through the calfhigh grass he flung himself down on his knees and looked up at her in imploring mockery she bit her tongue oh dear now what is he about she was afraid he was making fun of her but on the other hand it made her smile to see him doing something silly how long had it been since hed felt easy enough to be silly oh gentle maid forgive forgive he cried out melodramatically holding out a bouquet of cowslips and primroses that he must have picked while waiting for her forgive what she demanded with a giggle taking the bouquet dont be so ridiculous youll get grassstains on the knees of your trousers he clambered to his feet forgive that i wasnt here yesterday he said in a more normal tone of voice i completely forgot that i had obligations to deal with yesterday i should have remembered and i should have told you she felt a thrill of delight at his wordshe had thought about herbut shrugged oh that i wasnt here either i heard you were giving the prizes at the school treat and i know how these things go it isnt just prizes its speeches and the maypole and all of that so i knew youd be busy all day and i didnt bother to come sensible girl he said relieved and so i was ive brought things to make it up real bottles of lemonade the fizzy kind and some only slightly squashed teacakes and jam and he paused significantly chicken sandwiches thats the great benefit of being the lord of the manor you see no pesky officials coming around to count how many chickens youve got and whether ones gone missing he shook his head and if you think i am going to feel guilty about depriving some poor fbi of a tin of chicken paste with my scandalous and unpatriotic behavior actually she said i doubt very much if youre depriving anyone of anything most of the villagers have rabbit hutches and unreported hens and i know for a fact there are unregulated pigs in the woods no one is feeding any of the contraband animals any rationed grain theyre living off what they can scavenge and i suspect thats true for what went into your sandwiches he regarded her thoughtfully i expect thats probably true my cook has an odd pen on wheels full of birds that she moves over the vegetable garden and ive never seen her throw any grain to them exactly she smiled at him the chickens are eating bugs seeds and weeds which is saving manpower in the garden too theyre probably roosters or at least capons which would have been culled anyway as chicks so no one is being deprived of anything you salve my conscience as well as my easing my mind he sat down on the old blanket he had brought and patted it come feast with me then perfectly happy to she sat down across from him truth to tell she was rather glad that he had brought most of the tea this time without alison around there wasnt much bread left and she had given the old women the last of the cakes yesterday her offerings were a bit scanty so how was the school treat she asked conversationally were the children absolute demons they were rather decent actually he replied that might have been because we thought of a few more things to keep them out of trouble this year swings in the trees rides in my motor that sort of thing that was rather kind of you she exclaimed a bit surprised that he had done any such thing with his fast motorcar he shrugged but looked pleased oh it was just to the gates and back but they seemed to like it played the very devil with my bad leg though i forgot how much work there would be what with all the gearing changes and braking by the end of the day he broke off a little flushed embarrassed it could be there were those who would think that because he wasnt lacking an arm or an eye he was malingering what she supplied trying to sound casual you could hardly walk he looked shamefaced something like then i suspect its a good thing you found that out driving the children up and down to the gates and not some other way she said trying not to be too specific it does seem to me at least that your doctors are right about taking a long time to heal well i think youll be happy about one thing anyway he said sounding as if he was changing the subject listening to the speeches one of them waswell rather better than i had any expectation so mater and i decided that were going to put up a scholarship for the village boys to go to oxford father always intended to so now we shall at first she was irrationally pleased how many clever boys had she known who could have done very well at university if only theyd been able to go but then she thought all very well for the boys certainly but felt a twinge of resentment thinking about the number of equally clever girls who ended up just like their mothers birthing lambs and babies at nearly equal intervals what about girls she asked aloud what he stared at her as if she had said something startling i said what about girls she repeated firming her chin stubbornly and daring him to look away why only boys dont you think girls from the village ought to be able to go if theyre clever enough butbut now he was really staring at her but what are they going to do with a university education a boy can teachbecome an engineer a scientist a doctor a scholar and a girl cant she retorted now feeling quite angry with him what about that lady doctor you were always talking about why cant a girl become an engineer or a scientist he looked at her as if she had suddenly begun speaking in urdu butbut i was going to go to oxford she reminded him whats more you told me i should and that i shouldnt let anyone dissuade me yes but these are just village girls farmers daughters with no expectations he said then continued to make his situation worse with every word its not as ifi mean youre not the same class as they arei mean his mouth snapped shut as she flushed as he realized he had just said something horribly rude she looked down for a moment at her handmade skirt then looked defiantly up into his eyes daring him to make the comparison between the class she was supposed to be in and the one she was apparently in now maybe they have no expectations because no one ever let them think that they could she said bitterly maybe if someone bothered to show them that they could have dreams they might be able to dream them mightnt they just because theyre shopkeepers girls and farmers daughters doesnt mean they dont have minds some of them have very good minds and i think its a shame and a sin that all theyre thought good for is tending babies and putting up jam his eyes looked miserable but she was very angry now and she wasnt going to let him off the hook besides she pointed out with coldly poisonously perfect logic someone had better start helping ordinary girls to do things like becoming doctors and teachers because thanks to that bloody war there arent going to be any doctors and teachers otherwise and i dont see the pretty young ladies of the proper class rushing off to university to fill the void do you of course not it wouldnt be ladylike it wouldnt be proper he made a strangled little sound in the back of his throat and looked away ishouldnt have said that she thought and then thought rebelliously but im right and im not going to apologize you are a truly horrible young woman you know he said very slowly as if he was weighing and measuring each word still looking away from her only the truly horrible and the young would dare to tell that much truth only someone who doesnt have any room for illusions anymore would dare to tell that much truth she corrected as the anger slowly faded and cooled to an emotion that was darker and bleaker than that flare of temper i cant afford illusions they are altogether too expensive to maintain there are a great many of us in that position now yes he replied turning back slowly there are they stared at one another and he finally heaved a great sigh that was a very stupid thing to say wasnt it its that whole game she said the bitterness back redoubled that whole game of class its not going to work you know if this wretched war is ever over its just not going to work anymore the whole construction is just going to go smash like it did in russia he replied and managed a wan smile youve been listening to mad ross ashley ive been reading she retorted she didnt say anything more but she was thinking a great deal idont know whats going to happen but well just look even fifty years ago you had rich american girls with piles of new money coming over to marry a lord with a name but no prospects and rich tradesmens boys getting themselves blueblooded wives out of the royal enclosure that were desperate to get themselves out of tumbledown tudor manors and into a nice london townhouse in the west end it cant go on cant you see that you cant go on playing that silly game of we and they and by now you should know it but she didnt say anything shed already said more than enough actually if he couldnt see this for himself but he passed his hand over his eyes as if his head hurt him its he shook his head i dont know i dont even know if were going to see an end to this not even with the americans coming in sometimes he took his hand away and looked past her into the distance his voice flat i dont know if anything matters anymore because all we are ever going to see is that juggernaut grinding on and on until there isnt anyone left to fight so whats the point of anything anymore why bother trying to change anything when there isnt going to be anything left to change she bit her lip she hadnt meant to throw him into this slough of despair and the worst of it was she couldnt disagree with him and there didnt seem to be anything she could say to make any difference or at least nothing that wasnt at least partly a lie im sorry reggie she said finally i didnt mean toto remind you he looked up and at least he didnt try to smile i dont know how any of us can get through the course of a day without being reminded he said quietly you have to be lying to yourself i suppose or purposefully blinding yourself like the people who cant seem to find anything to talk about except how hard it is to find a good servant or the impossibility of getting a good chop anything except about whats across the channel but there are good things left still she replied forcing herself to rally and trying harder now to give him some sense of hope i cant see that its wrong to remember that pretending the bleak things dont exist is wrong and not trying to do something about them is worse yet but it cant be wrong to also remember that there is still joy still a little peace still things to laugh about and still love she felt her voice faltering but forced herself to carry on hoping that she didnt sound too maudlin if we forget that well lose hope too ah hope he said his voice growing a little lighter and he did manage a smile hope the last spirit left in pandoras jar after she let all the troubles and plagues of the world out and she let hope fly free too eleanor said softly because when all is said and done hope is sometimes all that keeps us from surrendering to despair he heaved a great sigh and nodded that is as true a thing as i think you have ever said he told her youre quite right and right to remind me no we mustnt lose hope if we do that he looked off into the distance again but this time as if he was actually looking for something and not to avoid her gaze perhapshope if we do that he repeated quietly as if he was telling himself a great truth we really shall be utterly lost and there will be no turning back for any of us she shivered because that had sounded altogether less like an aphorism and far more like a prophecy may broom warwickshire little eleanor did her disappearing act not long after the quarrel had foundered and crashed leaving reggie alone in the meadow staring glumly after her the stupid words hed said the bitter ones she had responded with still hung in the air nothing was resolved except perhaps she seemed genuinely sorry she had thrown him into a mental funk and he was genuinely sorry he hadnt thought before hed spoken in fact in retrospect he hadnt been at all observant hed been so preoccupied with his own thoughtswell that was a kind way of saying hed been paying no attention to anything outside of himself it should have been obvious that her circumstances were changed drastically from the last time he had seen her before the warher clothing alone should have told him that he gulped as something else occurred to him oh hell ive put my foot in it well and truly she had every intention the last time he saw her of going to oxford and her father had clearly had the means to send her her clothing had been good she had mentioned tutors and special studies in order to pass the entrance qualifications so although all reggie knew about her father was that he was a welloff manufacturer there was certainly money to spare in their household but her father had been an early casualty of the war and where had that left her had his businesses gone to pieces so many businesses hadeither wrecked without a supervisory hand on the tiller or collapsed because the war effort siphoned off more and more in the way of manpower and resources until there was no way to keep going sonow she was poor having to work for a livingthat much was obvious from her clothing and her hands probably she was a maid somewhere in the village or the surrounding farmsthe servant of one of those shopkeepers or farmers daughters whose intelligence and expectations he had so maligned and he had babbled on about scholarships for the boys when she so quick so intelligent with all of her dreams and expectations blighted had sat there and let him blather fatuously about what he was going to do for boys he didnt even know and he had thought that he was being her friend she assuredly was hisand look how he had treated her oh very clever reg take a juicy chop and dangle it in front of someone whos been dining on crusts then tell her she cant have it he felt sick absolutely sick as a cat no wonder shed blown up at him he could not possibly have managed anything more cruel if hed set out to torture her on purpose and now of course he had set things up so that if he offered her a scholarship he would look as if he was humoring her patronizing her throwing her crumbs out of misplaced pity even though he didnt think she had any future other than as the wife of a menial laborer and that any education given her would be wasted or worse as if it didnt matter if he offered her a scholarship because he didnt expect her to last out the first term you really are a prize idiot she would probably never come back here again after this and he wouldnt blame her why would she care to continue to befriend someone who treated her so shabbily but then guilt turned to irritation hang it all this was at least her fault in parti why hadnt she simply said something about her current straitened circumstances she didnt have to ask for help but if she had just said something about not having the money to go to oxford well of course he would have jumped in with an offer to help her out why did females have to be so confounded complicated he was in hearty sympathy with bernard shaws henry higgins except that he was also in hearty sympathy with bernard shaws eliza doolittle actually more so than with higgins if it came down to cases guilt resurfaced why should she say anything about her current state it wasnt as if he had any right to knowand it must be profoundly shaming to her torn between guilt and exasperation he did the only thing a man of sense would do at such a time he went in search of his motorcar and a drink the first was easy enough to find as it was parked just off the road where he had left it the second lay no further away than broom and his haven of the broom pub by now he was one of the regulars he was well aware that three years ago he would never have been accepted as a regular in here if he had been coming for ten years straight the class differences between himself and the men who made this their refuge would have been too much of a chasm to bridge but the war made more than strange bedfellows it made comrades of strangers sharing the same suffering and moreover he had from the beginning tried to leave the lord of the manor at the door so he was welcomed for himself as well as for the fact he could be counted on to buy more than his share of rounds and in that haven of resolute masculinity he felt his spirit soothed and his guilt eased the moment he crossed the threshold good beer was balm for the soul and a good barman has by convivial nature and training in his trade as great a fund of wisdom as any counselor and often quite a bit more than most clerics tom brennan was such a barman and his gents felt completely at ease in unloading their woes within his walls it is as probable as the sun rising that when fellow sufferers meet together over drinks before the evening is out one of them will say women in that particular suffering tone that makes his fellow creatures shake their heads and murmur sympathetically until the particular grievance emerges reggie had every intention of being the sufferer that evening but one of the others beat him to it joseph athertons hour of discontent was made evident by his heavy footsteps as he pushed open the door he ordered his pint took a long draught of it and as the rest waited and listened in expectation the cause of his unhappiness was revealed women said farmer joe with unusual vehemence murmurs of sympathy all around intended to encourage more revelation i mean he continued aggrieved a fellows got enough to do in his day dont he and when she says that may day is all stuff and nonsense and that she dont hold with sech childish farradiddle a fellows got a right to take her at her word dont he i mean cows need milkin stock needs feedin and theres enough to do without muckin about gettin a lot of silly flowers and on the day of fair and school treat no less and all them tents and kiddies to be hauled up tmanor with those words it all came clear to every man in the pub clearly mrs tina had been expecting to get her may day tribute no matter what she had said to the contrary clearly what with young adam being the sort to volunteer his fathers servicesjoseph having one of the few farm horses old enough to have escaped being conscripted but young enough to do his workjoseph had found himself dragooned unwilling into helping out on top of an already heavy workload and clearly when the aforementioned may day tribute did not materialize mrs tina had made her displeasure known which was probably why joe was here and not sitting down to his dinner unfair thats what it is replied another farmer albert norman hows a man to guess when they say one thing and mean the opposite or when they dont say anything at all reggie put in with feeling and they expect you to somehow understand whats going on in their heads without any clue and then when you blunder into some hideous mistake they turn on you thats a fact joseph sighed albert nodded glumly dunno why they cant just say straight out what they want a new country heard from michael van off in the corner with mad ross i mean thas logical aint it do we go around sayin one thing and meanin the contrariwise reggie nodded along with the others and signaled for another pint you say to a girl said young albert to no one in particular you say a feller i know was wonderin if youre seein anyone in particaler an she says no not in particaler and you get all set toto see if shed like to be seein anyone in particaler and then you turns around and whup there she is at fair with another feller with all the parish tsee so if she aint with im then whys she actin like shes with im is what i want to know more shaking of heads cant account for it said michael van and youd think wouldnt you if youd offended some un theyd tell you wouldnt you he appealed to ross if i said something that made you mad youd say id say mad ross replied with a glint in his eye or id punch your nose either way youd know so theres no call to be mad at a body if hes said summat you didnt like and you didnt tell him is there michael continued sounded aggrieved and specially if it was months and months ago and you never said till its too late for him to remember what he did say much less why you should be mad about it thats a fact replied albert my round i think reggie said reggie would have liked to air his own grievancebut with his nerves rawly sensitive he didnt want to put his standing in jeopardy with the other broom regulars he ran it over in his mind no matter what i say its going to offend someone if i tell them what i told her surely theyll think i was being patronizing too its that lord of the manor businessand it wouldnt matter that not one of them has ever given thought to his daughter doing anything other than marrying another farmer or laborerthe moment i say anything about it theyre going to think the worse of me so instead he just shook his head and murmured women theres no pleasing them the others nodded sagely the barmaid jessamine heggins glanced sideways at young albert with compressed lips as she passed him collecting glasses delivering fresh pints reggie wondered if she was the one that albert was referring to and felt a distinct touch of annoyance at her that was a cruel thing stringing the poor fellow along well he said looking into his glass seems to me pretty unfair of them to expect us to know things without being told them seems to me its pretty unfair to expect us to figure things out from a couple of hints not even king solomon could guess at aye michael grumbled tossing back his pint that was about as close as he dared come to his own grievance and eventually someone ventured an oblique guess as to the likelihood of rabbitting come fall now reggie felt a bit more comfortable you know he said thoughtfully and with an artfully casual manner my manager says that the rabbits are multiplying something awful this year three years now no ones been thinning them out with shooting i think a few snares wouldnt come amiss he looked around the pub as if he didnt know very well that every one of these men had been poaching his rabbits for generations any of you fellows know someone that might be willing to put out some snares in the longacre woods proper rabbit snares now not something to catch a pheasant by accident slight smiles might ross offered after all everyone poached especially now but no one wanted to admit he knew how to now mind reggie went on carefully not meeting anyones eye hed have to be careful of the season we wouldnt want any orphaned bunnies not unless there were youngsters who knew how to catch them and raise them on goats milk or something of the sort orphaned beasties is a sad thing michael van agreed but the kiddies do like to make pets of em wouldnt hurt for em to go looking now and again just to make sure no oned set a snare this early or at least i misdoubt but theres other things that make orphan bunnies dogs cats put in albert stoats offered ross who reggie knew for a fact kept ferrets even badgers can they catch em reggie had a long pull on his beer hiding his smile that was settled then they knew that he would tell his gamekeeper not to pull up proper rabbit snares and he knew that anyone that caught a doe outofseason would send his children or a neighbors to look for the nest and hed probably lose a pheasant or two some temptations were too strong to resist but hed have lost a pheasant or two anyway probably more than one or two when you worked vigilantly to keep someone from doing something he felt he had a right to do he often felt justified in taking a little revenge giving tacit permission on the other hand was likely to make them more honest hed never felt very comfortable about telling people they couldnt snare rabbits on longacre property anyway after all what did he ever do with them except in that they kept foxes fed for the autumn hunts and smart foxes would steal the caught rabbits from the snares anyway oh there was some rabbit shooting in the fall or there had been before the war but most gentlemen felt that rabbits were poor sport compared to birds when meat was getting hard to come by and hideously expensive even with the illicit pigs in the woods a rabbit was a welcome addition to the table besides you have to wonder how many of my generation are going to be particularly interested in shooting things for span when all this is over he sighed and signalled another round while the talk drifted amiably to other shifts for keeping food on the table pigeons were being considered though with some doubt as ross said once you get the feathers off hardly seems worth the time with the river so near and plenty of free grazing at the roads edge geese were popular but the problem was sorting out whose belonged to whom goats were not highly regarded having eaten goat on occasion in france reggie fully understood why tonight there had been no bad news from across the channel to stir up melancholy good spring weather here and summer coming and the school treat and fair so fresh in everyones mind the conversation stayed relatively light relatively since no one really had the heart for games of darts or shovehapenny in this pub when reggie left it was in an even temper and not the same unsettled state hed arrived in so when just past the last house in the village a black mood descended on himit made no sense it came down on him like a palpable weight and it wasnt grief it was bleak despairing anger it made him shift gears with a harsh disregard for the complaining clatter his motorcar made in protest it made him want to strangle his grandfatheror hang himself just to show the old man or both it made him want to find that baggage of a girl and and that was where his good sense finally overpowered his mood because the images that began to form in his mind at the thought of eleanor were so vicious that they shook him shook him right out of his mood he looked sharply around having even lost track of where he was only to find that he was on the driveway of the manor and didnt recall actually turning in through the gates what is wrong with me he thought aghast and now with a frisson of fear am i going mad because he could not imagine a sane man thinking those things that had just come into his head now feeling both depressed and afraid he parked the motor and went straight up to his room not wanting to encounter either his mother or his grandfather his valet wasnt about and he didnt ring for him in this mood he wanted to be completely alonewas this some new phase to his shellshock or was this something else altogether the sign that he was truly coming to pieces in a way that would make him dangerous to those around him as well as himself if that were the case then he thought grimly as he got himself ready to sleep without the aid of his valet i had better keep away from eleanor for her sake at least until i know and that was his last thought as he drifted off into a fully drugged sleep at least until i know one way or another and if i amiam going to have to make sure that there is nothing i can do to harm her alison and the girls did not put in an appearance that evening and eleanor took herself to sarahs cottage in a mood of prickly determination as she had hoped sarah had anticipated her coming and had laid out her mothers workbook and the few bits of paraphernalia that a fire magician deemed necessary but her mind wouldnt settle and even the salamanders that now always appeared whenever she was around an open fire and either alone or with sarah could not be calmed reflecting her restlessness they wreathed around her like agitated ferrets never pausing long twining around wrists arms and neck they were a distraction and she welcomed it sarah was not in much better case she couldnt keep her mind on business either finally after the third attempt at scrying by flame she threw up her hands its not going to happen she said with a snort of disgust your mind isnt on it and neither is mine whats got you all of a pother anyway reggie eleanor said wrinkling her nose and described the quarrel even though they had made it up she was still annoyed with him it was difficult not to be ill try to settle my mind so i dont go to sleep on itbut how could he have been so obtuse men sarah said with a dismissive contempt a dogs more protective and a cat will catch mice but a man causes more problems than he cures i swear it id have been angry too in your place reluctantly eleanor felt moved to defend him he did apologize she admitted eventually and then he ran right back to his pack at the pub where they are all maligning the female race even as we speak said sarah with just a touch of a sneer i know i heard his motorcar go by and stop at the broom by the time he motors home hell be feeling perfectly justified in speaking every word he said eleanor felt her temper flare again and throttled it down well then i hope he has a hangover for his pains she replied why are you so outofsorts something nasty is out there tonight sarah said abruptly and uneasily casting a glance at the windows where the curtains were drawn tight against the dark it cant pass the bounds i put on the village but i can feel it pressing against them whatever it isor they are since i cant tell if its one thing or severaltheyre angry eleanor felt her annoyance with reggie melting away what is it she asked urgently more of those earthgoblins but sarah shook her head no id recognize those this is very different more of this world than the goblins are no its something else if i didnt know betterand come to think of it maybe i dontid say it was spirits ghosts eleanor blinked ghosts somehow it had never occurred to her that along with elemental magic and everything else ghosts might be real too but why would ghosts be trying to get into the village now thats where you have me sarah admitted candidly i dont know ghosts usually dont leave the spot where theyre rooted sometimes its a place they loved sometimes its one where they had something terrible or wonderful happen to them but mostly its where they died or their bodies are buried it takes a lot to uproot them and a great deal more to set them to some new task of haunting thats why i cant imagine why or how it could be spirits eleanor shivered and cast a glance towards the windows herself what else could it be i dont know sarah replied and shook her head whatever it is it wont disturb anyone inside the bounds and outside well youd have to be able to see them and most people cant she pulled on her lower lip with her teeth for a moment im inclined to think at the moment that its just a blowup left over from may eve thats one of the four great holy days when the boundaries between the spirit world and the real world are thinned witcheswell we tend those doorways on those dayslet the ones that want just to look in on their lovedones out and keep the doors open so they can all go back at daybreak you know the old song where the ladys three sons come back to her she called them on may evei wish the wind would never cease nor flashes in the flood till my three sons return to me in earthly flesh and blood but eleanor began sarah shook her head cant tell you more than that its witchs business but like every other job witches have been lost to the war and if one of those doors wasnt tendedor if it was opened by someone inexperienced who let it slip closed too early she shrugged if thats all it is then they might be angry because they know a witch is in this village and they want me to let them through well why dont you eleanor asked reasonably because i dont know what door it is she sighed if things dont improve ill have to arrange something but otherwise were probably better off leaving well enough alone theres always the chance theyll find their own way over theres help on the other side if they truly want back eleanor wanted to ask more but the look on sarahs face told her that she wasnt going to get anything more so she changed the subject one of the books i found in the library talked about fortunetelling cards she said instead and the one they talked about seemedwell it seemed to make more sense than some of the other things i was reading sarahs tense expression eased ah the tarot i can see where thatd be useful and fit right in with your mums notes wait a moment she turned and went to a cupboard bringing out something rectangular wrapped in silk she set the package down on the table and unwrapped it it was an oversized deck of cards these are the tarot cards sarah said picking up the wellworn pasteboards and separating out one smaller stack from the rest the ones thatll be the most use to you right now for giving you things to think on are these she fanned out the cards in her hand eleanor could see that they didnt look anything like playing cards they were pictures like the one shed seen in the book called strength these are the cards called the major arcana the most powerful in that theres the most meaning packed into them and the most symbolism theres twentytwo of them and this she pulled one out of the deck is the first the last or the card that travels through the whole deck and in this case since youre the seeker right now this card represents you on your journey through the powers as you try to master them eleanor looked down at it the card showed her what looked like a young man dancing on the edge of a cliff there was a little dog at his feet the sun overhead and he held a rose in one hand and a stick with a bundle on the end like a traveler in the other the fool she read aloud and looked up why is that me well youve had all that study when you look at the stories about king arthur and the grail who do they call the perfect fool and why sarah countered percival she replied immediately because he was innocent unschooled he could ask questions no one else would because he didnt know he shouldnt and thats our fool sarah replied tapping the card with one finger the fire in his card is his intelligence he burns with curiosity and the need to know things hes perfectly innocent he breaks the rules because he doesnt know theyre there and doesnt know he should abide by them sometimes thats for good and sometimes it can bring disaster hes the seeker who moves from card to card looking for wisdom hes fearless because he doesnt know he should fear he isnt worried about being on the edge of the cliff because he isnt thinking about the next minute when he might fall off hes thinking about right now and besides for all he knows hell step out into the empty air and itll hold him eleanor studied the card closely so if hes concentrating on now he isnt looking forward sarah nodded thats the negative side of him hes not at all in the spirit and very much in the body he breaks rules that sometimes shouldnt be broken and will bring him grief when they are he can fall off that cliff he means change but change isnt always good she paused waiting eleanor sensed she was waiting for her pupil to come up with some answers of her own so this concentration on his physical bodythats his earth aspect it looks to me like hes mostly fire and earth not much water symbolism here of course though theres airthe air he could step off into sarah nodded change might be the water aspect but mostly the fool is intellect and passion and thats air and fire which makes him even more appropriate for you she turned over a second card this one showing a man in a white robe and a red cloak he stood among roses and lilies with a rosevine overhead he had a wand in his hand and was next to a table on which were a cup a knife another wand and a disk there was something like the number eight lying on its side hovering like a halo above his head eleanor read the cards name aloud the magician what else can you tell me sarah asked she studied it and was struck by the objects on the table which reminded her of something in one of the alchemy books thats all four elements there she said pointing to the table the cup is water the disk is earth the wand is air and the knife is fire so he has command of all of the elements or he hasnt yet chosen which one his element is sarah countered that wand hes holding is a symbol of his power not of a particular element hes the symbol of the mind too like the fool but in his case its creativity not intellect he knows what he wants out of heaven and earth and so long as he stays focused hell get it eleanor studied the card further but he can run right over the top of you to get what he wants she said slowly which is the negative side of him selfish and selfcentered so hes like the fool in that way in a way their negative side is being selfcentered good sarah applauded and what else well if his positive side is that he can get anything if he can stay focused then i guess his weakness is that hes likely to lose concentration and be scattered she pondered that for a moment so where this card is all elements id say that the magician himself is mostly air thats how ive always seen him but remember hes a channel for all of them more so than most other cards so he gets being charming and attractive from earth he gets a streak of passion and genius from fire he gets independence and the willingness to break rules from air and the ability to handle power and make changes from water sarah got up and went back to her cupboard taking out a similar wrapped bundle she pulled a second card out and laid it beside the magician this one too was labeled the magician but it wasnt a ceremonial magician this one looked like a circus trickster a charlatan who was juggling cups and balls this is an older version from a deck i dont use much it shows you the magicians darker side a cheat a stagemagician eleanor said at once i can seehis dark side is that charm used to gull people the intellect used to practice deception the willingness to break rules can make him a criminal and water can sweep away everything leaving you with nothing very good sarah replied and those two cards are enough to think about for one night so the lesson is over did you say you had a book that talked about the tarot in alchemical terms she nodded then go home and read what it has to say about the fool and the magician sarah folded her cards back up in their silk and put them away well look at another card tomorrow meanwhile you think about these tonight eleanor took her leave and made her way back to the arrows well before her sprig of rosemary withered she went to bed and followed sarahs orders reading about and thinking about those two cards until she fell asleep at which point she found herself in dreams dressed in clothing of a medieval italian page dancing on the edge of a cliff with the sun high overhead and not a cloud in the sky may broom warwickshire may third had dawned in rain and it kept raining all day long a steady pour that made eleanor reluctant even to venture to sarahs cottage much less to the meadow not that she ever thought that she would have met reggie there no if hed been kept away merely because he wanted to give rides to kiddies in his motorcar the prospect of a soaking would certainly keep him inside four walls so eleanor had stayed where she was took the opportunity to further increase her wardrobe and when she wasnt obeying alisons spells studied her books diligently the dream shed had the previous night of being the fool had given her impetus it had been vividly realistic too shed felt nothing but euphoria and a curiosity about absolutely everything no fear none at all when shed stopped dancing for a moment leaned over and stared into the abyss below her in the dream the thought that she might fall had not even flitted across her mind no fear when she stared up into the sky straight at the blazing sun wondering what it was fortunately it was the sun of the card and not of reality bright though it was and hot too it didnt blind her of course that had been in retrospect at the time all she had thought was what is that why is it so hot can i reach it she had halfawakened but no more than that fallen asleep again to find herself still the fool in a garden of roses and lilies though she had no idea of how she had gotten there she followed a paththen she was at the end of the path suddenly and there was an altar there on it were a cup a scepter a golden disk the size of a dinnerplate and a sword behind the altar was someone in a white robe and a red cloak with a broom in her hand a broom because it wasnt a man as in the card it was sarah so what do you see the magician asked eleanor said the first thing that came into her mindnot an answer but a question what cup is that and what does it hold sarah nodded good come and find out for yourself she leaned the broom against the altar picked up the cup and held it out to eleanor just like a priest offering the sacrament eleanor came and took it from her and drank from it and suddenly it was she who was in the white robes and red cloak and behind the altar and sarah and her broom were nowhere to be seen but even as when she had been the fool her mind was full of questions now it was full of knowledge she put the cup down dazzled by all of the things flooding through her thoughts when a voice interrupted her from the table well now that you have wisdom you ought to know what to do with the other three gifts the voice said and she looked down at the cup to see that it was much larger nearly the size of a washtub and there was a great salmon sticking its head out of the water and looking up at her well said the salmon with all that wisdom what are you going to do next she looked at the other three items her hand moved towards the sword then she stopped quite right said the salmon sounding like something out of alices adventures you arent nearly strong enough to wield the passion of fire what else is there her hand hovered between the coin of earth and the wand of air and she had just started to reach for the latter when she woke up it was dawn and time to get to work it was still raining and didnt look as if it was going to stop at any time soon so that day was a repeat of the previous one and at least she finished sewing all the rest of her new wardrobe because the weather cleared off in the night and by teatime of the fifth there was the sound of a motorcar and alison and the girls chugged into the old stable that now served as a garage there was nothing to make into what alison would have called a decent tea and dinner except tinned stuff of course and in any event it was too late for eleanor to start anything so as eleanor hauled their baggage up to their rooms they tidied themselves up then pulled the motor back out again to go to the broom hall inn for tea and order that a dinner be sent around and life went right back to normal neither alison nor the girls noticed eleanors new clothing nor did anyone note books missing from the library they were all very full of chatter about londonthere were americans moving through now and lauralee was very taken with them she kept exclaiming about how tall they were as for alison she acted like a cat that had gotten into cream whatever she had done while shed been gone she was very pleased with it and herself so things went back to the way they had been except that every two or three days eleanor would slip away after the household was in bed and get down to sarahs cottage which was where sarah would take out her cards and they would go over all of the ones that she had already seen as eleanor tried to glean a little more meaning out of them then sarah would lay out a new one there was no chance to get out to the meadow but as may became june she certainly heard enough about reggie the campaign to ingratiate themselves into the longacre circle was well underway and twiceweekly tennisparties were the artillery pounding away at the gates longacre had its own courts and lady devlin loved to both watch and play even though reggie couldnt play because of his knee he always came to watch his motherand alison and both girls were good enough to give her ladyship a good game of doubles this of course was according to what alison told her little coterie of the broom elite over tea eleanor knew the truth of course they were good enoughbecause of magic theyd shown no aptitude before this but one of the things that had come back from london had been a set of three tennis raquettes with a faint feeling of magic about them eleanor had no doubt no doubt at all that alison had somehow stolen someones tennisprowess and put it into those raquettes alison and her daughters were also up at the manor at least once a week for tea and eleanor expected that would change to two or even three times a week before long there was company due at longacre park in the first week of june toowhich would probably mean more entertaining teadances cardparties boating on the river riding on the grounds as well as tennis and croquet and more chances for lauralee and carolyn to use whatever they could to ensnare reggie well she thought more than once if hes stupid enough to let himself be ensnared then hes not worth wasting time on but she couldnt help contrasting herself with her stepsisters whenever they sailed out of the house in their modish tennisdresses or flirty teagowns once perhaps she had been the equal of her stepsisters and might have been able to pass herself off as belonging in reggies social set money was still not the equal of breeding in the eyes of some but it was certainly approaching that equivalencyand to reggies generation perhaps it had achieved equality at least so long as one had the right accent the right education the right manners and conversation the right outward appearance nowwell he might sit with her in a meadow and be amused by her conversation but her hands were callused and rough with manual labor her clothing was fit only for the lowest servants and with those two handicaps it didnt matter how fine her mind was if hed been penniless but blueblooded perhapsbut not while he was lord of longacre park with that insurmountable social gulf between them while he might amuse himself in private he would never acknowledge the friendship in public and a friend who wont treat me the same in public as in private isnt worth having she tried not to feel eaten up with envy as the girls chattered about dear reggie and tormented one another over which he had paid more attention to that day but it would have been difficult enough to watch them swanning about with their airs and their chatter about going up the hill it was very difficult indeed to hear them boasting about dear reggie this and dear reggie that she took what grim solace she could in her study of elemental magic the sooner she mastered that the sooner she could free herself and thenwell then she would worry about when she was freed shed had no trouble getting to sleep now that it was june the days were getting longer and longer days just meant that alison found more work for her to do and she was not at all surprised to find herself immediately in a dream the dream began now in a familiar pattern eleanor found herself as the fool resolutely turned away from the cliffedge and passed up the path to the magician the tarot cards were providing the framework for the quest for mastery there was no doubt in her mind about that but this time the magician was not sarah but a stranger still she asked the right question became the magician and prepared to pass on the salmon of wisdom did not appear in the cup now that she had the key to this card she was able at this point to actually pick up the blade the cup the wand and the coinand yet she sensed she was not able to use more than a fraction of the power in each not even of her own element and she would notshe knew that nowuntil she had journeyed through all of the major arcana but she needed to prove that she could handle the tools of the four elements so she picked each up in turn from the altar sensed and identified the magical energies in each then turned and walked up the path that appeared behind her it led between two severely manicured flowerbeds and she followed it until she came to a pavilion she had been here before and knew who awaited her the high priestess was an ageless woman seated on a throne holding a scroll in one hand crowned with all three phases of the moon cloaked in blue and poised between a black pillar and a white she also represented intelligence the blue robe gave her element away it had been no challenge to figure out that it was air but not only did she represent intelligencemore than that she stood for balance the priestess was all about balance calm emotional selfsufficiency nothing ever ruffled her feathers she represented the mystic side of the mind in harmony with the physical side as well and her negative aspect was to be without true emotion sterile rather than celibate to stagnate rather than be in balance to be emotionally empty rather than controlled eleanor had been here before it had taken some thinking to work out that she should ask what is the key to wisdom she asked that question now and she accepted the scroll from the priestess as she had become the magician so she now became the priestess and this had provided her first real temptation because she didnt really want to go on to the next card the fool was full of questions the magician full of knowledgebut the priestess was full of a calm balanced and ordered wisdom if she had ever dreamed of being like anything when she attained her mastery it would have been to be like this and yet that was a trap she had a long long way to go yet and that too was wisdom she rose and descended the three shallow steps that led to her throne and went back into the garden and though she should have left by the same path on which she had entered instead it was a path through wildly lush rose beds intermingled with peonies and lilies all three perfumes mingling in an intoxication of scent and when she came to the end of the path she found herself in another part of the garden facing another crowned seated woman this was her new card the empress where the high priestess was all austerity the empress was all abundance she was crowned with stars with her foot on the quartermoon that the high priestess wore as a crown she carried a heart in one hand a scepter in the other she was stunningly beautiful and was surrounded by roses and from the sensuality that infused even the slightest gesture it was clear that she was as warmly emotional as the high priestess was austere now this was a card that eleanor had not yet gotten past not that she didnt know all the meanings her element was earth she represented creativity fertility in all things grace and beauty she was very aware of herself and very sure of herself she had power but it was the power to direct rather than to lead or to order eleanor felt she had far more in common with the intellectual ascetic the high priestess than this lady of venus the negative aspect was of course unbridled sensuality but eleanor felt herself very uncomfortable with sensuality of any sort i dont see she said to the empress in a voice that sounded rather high and nervous rather than confident what you have to do with me the threemoon headdress she wore as the high priestess felt horribly heavy in that moment the empress smiled a slow languid smile full of promises you dont deny youre a woman she drawled eleanor tried not to squirm not that it does me any good she complainedthe words jumping out of her mouth before she could think no one pays the least attention to me thats your stepmothers doing the empress said in a purr she doesnt want anyone to think of you as a human being much less a woman but until you reconcile yourself to the fact that you are a woman and you can be bound by your womanhood or freed by it you wont get past me freed eleanor snorted nobody is freed by womanhood we arent even allowed to vote why that has not always been so and it will not be forever the empress replied bending to sniff her roses that is not to the pointthe point is you you must embrace all sides of yourself to pass any card body as well as mind what am i umm eleanor found herself blushing ah sensuality rejoicing in the physical if your head is strong and full of thoughts but your body is weak where are you the empress tilted her head to the side where is the balance in that high priestess or perhaps i should saypretty fool and in that moment eleanors robes vanished and she was back in the garb of the fool again weak me eleanor snorted again with all the work i have to do ah but do you take pleasure in that fine young body of yours or merely allow it to carry your head around the empress yawned and just what is there to take pleasure in eleanor demanded angrily why this card made her so angry she could not have said but it did and made her terribly uncomfortable as well please havent you two working eyes two fine ears the empress replied with scorn there are meadowlarks by day and the scent of flowersby night the moon and the cool soothing breeze your body is healthy and strong and work comes easily to it you are young and when the song of spring sings in your veins you feel the quickening of the earth all around you you have more much more than many of those that you know possess you are not dead or dying maimed or ill how can you not take pleasure in these things um well she had been doing just that i supposei suppose you must be right and young men the empress persisted looking both wise and sly havent you felt longing for no she exclaimed feeling her face flush hotly too soon too soon you protest too much and too soon the empress declared laughing holding up the heart she held for eleanors inspection you silly child do you think i do not know her face flamed so redly it was painful no she hadnt longed after reggie not really after all he didnt think anything of her so why should she think of him it wasnt even remotely possible anyway and who does it harm to admit that side of yourself the empress murmured hooding her eyes with heavy lids who is going to tell reggie not i certainly my dear my dear these things must be taken from your path i cannot give you the rose to let you pass until you examine and accept what is in your own heart who am i going to tell after all her face burning eleanor opened her mouth shut it opened it then turned and fled the little dog yapped at her heels sounding angry at her she ignored him as she ignored the roses whose thorns caught at her clothing and tried to stop her as she fled out of the garden out of the dream and and woke up with a start it was still dark it had felt as if she had been in the garden for hours but by the moon shining in her window she knew it couldnt have been more than an hour or two she was panting and winded as if she really had run through that garden and her heart pounded the loudest sound in the room what was i so frightened of not for the first time she wondered just whoor whatthe tarot creatures really were at first she had thought that they were images and archetypes out of her own mind but she had shortly realized that they knew things she didnt and they acted in ways that seemed entirely independent of her mind like the empress for instance why was i so upset with what she said she did not like the empress not even in her proper position she was too knowing too lush tootoo sensual too much of everything actually the magician had been a wealth of knowledge cool and aloof after that first time of being sarah the high priestess was someone that eleanor could admire wise controlled and ascetic but the empress she wasshe was shes like alison when alison is in one of her queenofeverything moods and as she lay there staring at the ceiling letting her thoughts settle into a pattern again she gradually understood what was going on the key to the empress that had eluded her for several nights now finally came into her grasp more than ever she wished she could stop with the high priestess and she knew that she couldnt that she would have to dream herself back not tomorrow or the next night but tonight she had to face this and face it now with the knowledge fresh in her mind she closed her eyes moved around on her lumpy mattress until she was completely comfortable then began taking slow even breaths she concentrated not on the dream she wanted to reenter nor her surroundings she concentrated on herself on relaxing every muscle in her body starting with her face she felt muscles let go that she didnt even know were tensed as she worked her way from her head to her shoulders to her arms felt herself starting to drift as the nightsounds faded away from around her and she felt as if she was floating and and she found herself back on the edge of the cliff in the person of the fool she stared down at the abyss below her for a moment the bottom was lost in haze and darkness shed never been able to see it oddly that made it seem less dangerous as if she could throw herself over the edge spread her arms and fly and the fool in her would have been willing to give that a try for the fool had no fear and not a great deal of good judgment resolutely she turned from the cliff and took the path into the garden the magician was not waiting at his altar but the accoutrements were still there but this time eleanor took the dagger with her when she went on the daggerthe representative of her own element she couldnt wield that power yet but now she knew she had to have a channel through which to use it when she did master it and this time she didnt change to the magician herself when she passed the altar that was new the high priestess smiled when she saw the dagger stuck into eleanors belt and wordlessly handed her the scroll this time for the first time eleanor unrolled it and saw painted in brilliant colors miniatures of the first three cards she had encountered there were empty lozenges outlined in gilt for the remainder of the major arcana that she had yet to pass through wisdom she said aloud looking up at the high priestess is knowing how much you dont know that is truly the greatest wisdom the priestess said you see you have a long way to travel now eleanor hesitated a moment with one foot on the path that would lead her to the empress despite her earlier resolution did she have to face the card now couldnt it wait but the scroll gave her no other options she clenched her teeth and marched into the perfume of hundreds of flowers that always surrounded the empress surrounded this time it seemed as if she was walking through a maze of rosehedges getting to the empress this time was no easy task and it wasnt helped by all of the inviting nooks the shaded seats the tempting bowers she had to pass on the way but eleanor set her chin and went on finally she turned a corner and there the empress was head tilted exquisitely to the side lush lips curved in a slight smile quite as if she left only a second ago well in this dreamworld perhaps she had eleanor marched straight up to the foot of her throne stood before the embodiment of the card hands on her hips and scowled i dont like you she announced her only answer for a moment was a slow lazy smile and why would that be child the empress purred because youre like her eleanor replied allowing her bitterness to show everything is a weapon or a tool to get what she wants with her things that should just be she has to twist and shape and use beauty wit she blushed thethe sensual things theyre all weapons to get power and thats what shes teaching her daughters theres never enough power over people for her ah now you see the empress replied with a knowing nod i am power little fool i am a ruler above and before all else i am a ruler and everything that comes into my hand is indeed to be used whether my aspect is reversed or proper and if you are to pass little fool you must acknowledge that you understand what power is and does not just to those around you but to you yourself inside gritting her teeth eleanor acknowledged that with a curt nod power can be open or hidden but that doesnt stop it from affecting you eleanor agreed angrily in fact the power that is probably the strongest is the power that no one sees or realizes is there and when you control that sort of power you can control anything else you wish to and that one day if you master your magic you too will be the empress the card persisted and you too will know that all that comes into your hand will be a tool but i can choose not to use the tools eleanor all but shouted i can choose not to manipulate and that too is manipulation life is manipulation the empress smiled her slow sweet smile think pretty fool you must manipulate or be manipulated and choosing not to choose is still a choice then i choose to do as little as i may she responded only enough to keep others from manipulating me the empress nodded what else am i remember that what is within me is within you when eleanor was not forthcoming she laughed oh come now that beautiful man you would have to be stone which i know you are not as the empresss words stung and dug at her eleanor had felt herself blushing more and more hotly and when the woman finished her sentence it was with fury and bitterness that she allowed her temper to burst out yes curse you she cried i do fancy him and i have as much chance of being more than a kind of pet or mascot to him as i have of flying his aeroplane she waited hot with embarrassment and anger daring the empress to say anything i am power the woman said with a secret little smile there are many sorts of power like liliths eleanor countered using your body to get what you want ah now you have your mythology mixed the empress laughed liliths offense was that she would not obey adam for she was created his equal from the same clay and on the same day as he for that she was banished and god created subservient eve from adams own flesh or so she finished with a chuckle the myth would tell us and yes there is power to be found in providing something that someone wants isnt there and if someone wants something very badly it becomes a weapon in your hand its a weapon id be ashamed to us eleanor replied and then wonderedashamed because its underhanded or because im afraid and if you could have the way of using the weapons of the senses as your stepmother does the empress persisted if you knew by using them you could have the young man for yourself taking him away from your stepsisters she lifted her chin and stared i wouldnt she said shortlybut then flushed again and dropped her chin and with a sick feeling admitted ormaybe i would but i wouldnt do it to make him my slave the way she would ahthe empress stood up a beatific smile on her face taking the place of the tooknowing expression there you are my dear that is what you needed to see that it is how we use the tools we are given not the tools themselves nor even the fact that we use them that makes all the difference passion reversed is manipulation that leads to slavery passion proper is freedom but both are passion she took one bloodred rose from the bouquet she held and extended it to eleanor i am as much passionfireas i am the fertility of earth the empress continued it does not do to forget that pass on little fool and seek the next stage of your growing eleanor took the rose and the moment she did so the landscape around her changed she was no longer in a garden instead she was on a vast and empty plain in the distance were mountains dividing the mountains from the plain was a powerful swiftlymoving river seated before her on a massive squarebuilt throne was a man he was dressed in archaiclooking armor but it was very rich goldchased and engraved he wore a crown and carried the traditional emblems of rule the orb and scepter as he looked down at eleanor from his throne she understood why the books called the emperor a ditticult card so she began her trial of the emperor by showing her own temper and determination not tonight i think she impudently announced to that stern face and turning away summoned true sleep with a wave of her heavily perfumed rose june broom warwickshire im not going to bother with trying to teach you anything now sarah said as eleanor finished recounting her latest dreamconquest the tarot card of the lovers she had conquered the emperor far more easily than she had thought she would but then he was an easy card to understand not an easy card to handle but easy to understand secular power intensely masculine warlike patriarchal the embodiment in a way of all the traits that men found admirable and in the inverserigid bound by tradition unable to change territorial all the things that had turned the war into a disaster his element was fire a fire so fierce that nothing grew on his plain so in his way he was as much an embodiment even in proper position of sterility as the empress was of fertility a curious pairing she hadnt had much difficulty with the hierophant eitherwho was to spirituality what the emperor was to the secular world both ruled by law by conformity by order both concentrated on the obvious sources of control and power ignoring the ones withinthe male counterparts to the high priestess and the empress with all that this implied law infallibility presumed or actual an intolerance for the heretical and the rebellious it had occurred to eleanor that the world had been run by men of that stamp for some time now and look where it had gotten everyone and it had also occurred to her that both the emperor and the hierophant would expect softness and conciliation out of a female not confrontation the emperor given his empress would expect manipulation the hierophant would expect submission so confrontation was what she had given them she had stood her ground and told them both the truth about what their traits taken to extreme had done to the worldtruly conquering the cards instead of merging with themwith their own weapons of order law and logic unable to face her logic they had faded away leaving behind the heady taste of secular and sacred power but the loversthat was another uncomfortable card not the least of which because eleanor had gone through the hierophants rigidly designed mathematically precise temple to find herself in the garden behind it and there she discovered she was facing the originaland stark nakedadam and eve it was quite a shock to her senses and her sensibilities she had never seen anyone else naked before much less a man she had literally leapt back with a yelp and averted her eyes from the two figures who appeared not at all uncomfortable with their nude state which was oddbecause hadnt the fruit of the tree made them ashamed these two were not at all embarrassed and yet there was nothing remotely sexual about them the empress had had more sensuality and erotic attraction fully clothed than both of the lovers put together nevertheless eleanor hadnt known where to look and her face had been flaming as red the roses in the empresss garden she should have known this was coming after all she had seen the card in sarahs deck but somehow it had come as a complete surprise and shock and she had been so dumbstruck she hadnt known what to do the archangel of the card had stepped in to save her from dying of embarrassment shooing the two away they had gone off to sit under the tree with the serpent in it to immediately begin to quarrel about who had tempted whom and whose fault it was that everything had gone wrong they sounded like a couple of children and that was when eleanor understood why they were so devoid of eroticism they were children children without the innocence of the fool for they had already learned how to lay blame to lie and quarrel the archangel sighed and shook his head sadly it was odd he looked exactly like the archangel portrayed on the cardwhich meant at least to eleanors eyes he didnt look all that much like an angel at all more like an androgynous man with wings there was none of the glow of the majesty that she would have thought would be the hallmarks of a real angel hes an image a reflectionthe symbol for something rather than the actual thing she decided and an image created by someone who hasnt ever seen the real thing or even taken much thought of what one should look like it had always seemed to her that there ought to be a reason why the first thing an angel said when it appeared was fear not presumably the mere sight of one was enough to strike fear into the hearts of those who saw him this angel looked as if he was more likely to say welcome to the garden have a seat than fear not it wasnt so much that they tasted the fruit the angel said to the empty air carefully not looking at eleanor he sounded exasperated like a teacher with two dunces for pupils it was that they lied about it and then tried and keep trying to blame each other he forgives everything you know so long as you admit you did it and are properly sorry for it he glanced at eleanor and now he looked sorrowful they began with such promise and yet one small thing has kept them from fulfilling that promise responsibility eleanor said instantly before the angel could get in another word theyre not taking responsibility for what they did so thats the reversed position for this card isnt it this card represents responsibility and choices and temptation and balance between male and female the words kept tumbling out of her as if she had turned on a spigot youre part of it too since youyou arent michael are you he shook his head raphael she nodded raphael whose sign is mercury and whose element is air the positive of air is freedom and an unbounded imagination and the negative aspect of air is carelessness and lightmindedness it seemed as if some of the magicians knowledge was with her now and couldnt wait to get out the more she babbled the more symbols she saw heretemptation in the form of the tree and the serpent but more knowledge too there was another tree without a serpent twined around it it balanced the other what did that tree represent if the first one is the tree of knowledge of good and evil what is the other one it seemed to be covered with little flames rather than leaves or fruit was it a sort of burning bush that was another kind of knowledge and fire the archangel said helpfully dont forget thats there too he nodded at the tree there was something about that tree that should be ticking off memories and wasnt as if the back of her mind recognized the symbolism but wouldnt talk to the front of her mind about it she nodded fixing her eyes on the angels face so she wouldnt have to look at the two naked people sprawled inelegantly beneath the tree if they werent physically upsidedown their position was close enough to make them look reversed of coursepassion again but it has to be passion in balance with everything else and of course theres the serpent and the tree from the gardenthats earth but she wasnt quite grasping it ah but what is the thing that you must take from them the symbol of the power thats here the archangel asked shrewdly it was the cup from the magician the scroll from the high priestess the empresss rose the emperors orb the hierophants crown knowledge wisdom passion power law she said aloud thinking very hard there was a problem here the lovers were both stark naked and had nothing in their hands balance responsibilitywhat represents that choicesmaking good ones and bad ones there was no symbol of any of these things anywhere about there were still the apples on the tree of the knowledge of good and evil but but ive already had knowledge and anyway i dont think thats the answer she looked at the archangel sharply its nothing i have he replied with one perfect eyebrow raised at the exact angle required to convey admonition and dont even think about pulling out one of my feathers do that and youll find me treating you like something other than a lady well whatever these tarot creatures wereone thing that they were not was to actually be what they appeared to be this one might wear the outer semblance of an angel but she didnt think even a minor one of the cherubim would talk like that much less an archangel which she had to admit was something of a relief she really didnt want to have anything to do with a real angel adam and eve were looking bored and had even given up on their quarrel while they waited for her to come up with the symbol of what she must take from them what could it be wait what if it wasnt something material this card was about balances and there couldnt be anything more heavily weighted in favor of the earthly as a symbol than everything that stood in front of her except that the dominating element of this card was air sodid it follow that what she was to take was the opposite immaterial balancing earthly the kiss of peace she said sure now of herself from both of them oh well done the archangel applauded as adam and even came towards them at a wave of his hand eleanor tried not to look but it wasnt easy when the two of them bracketed her and leaned forward to kiss her cheeks at the same time she closed her eyes but she could still feel them there and as their lips brushed her cheeks she felt her face flaming and that was the moment that was the moment eleanor said swallowing hard i have gotten something from every one of the cards i passed throughsomething that stayed with me that is but from the lovers she shivered and looked up at sarah responsibility sarah it all came to me then just before i fell into sleep responsibility the burden of making the right choices ii she couldnt put into words what she had felt at the moment it was just very big and very heavy and she was only beginning to see the edges of it but part of it was that she wasnt just responsible for herself she was responsible for however she affected everyone she came into contact with im not going to bother with trying to teach you anything now sarah said gravely for the life of me i cannot think what i could offer you that you arent already getting in your dreams and before eleanor could protest she held up her hand i am not saying not to come here anymore but i think you have a new teacherthough i dont know who or what it could be that can work through dreams she shook her head ive heard of that but no one i know has actually gotten that sort of teaching eleanor went very still not even mother she asked softly sarah shook her head not even your mother eleanor slipped back into the house well ahead of the return of her stepmother and the girls they had gone to longacre park for a tea partythe expected company had arrived and with it an invitation to tea and while it sickened eleanor to hear the girls try to outdo each other in their boasting about how reggie had been attracted to them she wanted to hear what had happened so she sat by the hearth with mending in her hands and waited for them to come back the motorcar rattled and chugged its way into the old stable and the three came chattering up the walk and in through the door or rather the girls were chattering alison was silent rather to eleanors surprise they were not chattering about reggie instead they were talking about his aunt dotty lauralee laughed absolutely dotty why she couldnt even keep track of which of us was which and if i heard one more story about her cat i think i should have begun screaming mother if thats all we have to worry about i dont believe you are in any danger of being discovered carolyn said sounding complacent on the whole i am inclined to agree with you alison replied her voice plummy with satisfaction calling that silly old woman an elemental mage is beyond being charitable she hasnt any more power than a village witch they moved into the sittingroom eleanor did not need to work magic to hear them they spoke as if they were unaware that she was still sitting there in the kitchen arent we doing anything tonight mother carolyn continued its midsummer evei thought youd decline the invitation to the card party tonight and not a time when we should be stirring anything alison said warningly no not on the shortest night of the year it is true that the boundaries between the seen and the unseen weaken on this night but it is not in our favor we will leave the work we performed on may eve to strengthenwhich it will so long as nothing interferes with it our revenants will draw sustenance through the weakened boundaries on their ownand trust me they have no wish to pass on to the unseen world revenants what does she mean by that eleanor heard alisons footsteps on the floor coming towards the kitchen and bent studiously over her mending it was one of carolyns tennis dresses shed caught the hem and it needed putting up again so it was a legitimate task what are you doing ellie eleanor looked up and held out her hands it was obvious that she was holding a garment that wasnt her ownshe didnt own anything white only those with leisure whose work was all done by servants could have white clothing it was a fact of poverty that eleanor had come to learn ah alison nodded in satisfaction yes that will be needed tomorrow i trust you have dinner well in hand eleanor nodded she didthanks to cleverly putting together things that could be made well in advance the only things left were the new peas and new potatoes on the stove well be eating early then well be going up to longacre park for the evening alison smirked put supper forward to six i trust you can keep yourself out of mischief while were gone yes maam eleanor mumbled dropping her head so that alison wouldnt see her expression if the girls had had their way theyd have gone up to the manor in ballgowns and eleanor would happily have let them make that faux pasbut their mother was watching and chose their gowns herself slightly more elegant than your fine afternoon gowns my dears but not evening dress if we had been invited to dinner instead of a cardparty it would have been appropriate but otherwise no they looked stunning lauralee in mauve silk carolyn in blue if eleanor had dared to look up she knew they would have seen the hatred and anger blazing in her eyes so as she fastened hooks and tied lacings she kept her gaze on her own hands or on the floor alison shooed her back down to the kitchen so that her own maid could see to the girls hair eleanor was glad enough to go and she could scarcely wait for them to get out of the house she sat next to the fire in the kitchen trembling with anger the anger actually surprised her a little it had welled up the moment alison called her ellie that name seemed to embody everything that alison had done to her she had never been ellie to her father or anyone else servants were called ellie and girl and i am a servant in my own house but the moment i show any signs of rebellion alison is going to look for what inspired the rebellion so she busied her hands waited impatiently for them to go and tried to remember where she had heard or read anything about revenants whatever they were alison was using them for something and if alison was using them it couldnt be for any good purpose for some reason the word was making her think of ghostsand she was sure her recollection was of something that sarah had said not anything that she had read that would make things difficult since sarah was out tonight doing whatever it was that witches did on the solar and seasonal holidays finally the three of them left and once again the house was still eleanor expected to hear the sound of the motorcar starting up but instead she heard one approaching the arrows and in fact she didnt think anything at all of this until it pulled up to the front door and stopped the sound of a car door opening and closing echoed over area and eleanor had a sudden vision of reggie himself come to pick them up but no no she realized even as the thought crossed her mind that it wouldnt be at all proper not the done thing no hed have sent his chauffeur but it made her angrier still that they were getting all this fuss made over them would it have hurt reggie just once to have offered her a lift back to the village after all he was always coming there himself to go to the broom pubwhich was just across the street from the arrows of course it wouldnt have inconvenienced him in any way but she was hardly in his social class now was she he would scarcely wish to be seen with the likes of her in the back of her mind a small voice protested that if reginald fenyx were seen giving a ride in his automobile to a young serving girl people would assume the worstand that he wasnt being snobbish he was protecting her reputation but that voice was swiftly drowned in the clamor from the rest of her mind which bristled with envy of her stepsisters anger at her own situation and bitterness she kept her head down and her hands steady in case anyone should look in on herbut no one did with a soft swish of silk and laughter as light as their gowns all three of the robinsons hurried out the door the sound of two automobile doors slamming echoed in the street then the chugging of the engine faded away in the distance eleanor counted to fifty before she got up and went into the library extravagant as ever alison had left a lamp burning there in the section where eleanor had found the alchemy books was one she had passed over as irrelevant a book that purported to describe various supernatural creatures and how to be rid of them now she took it out because she thought she remembered something about revenants in there what she found was a brief and vague reference and she put the book back with a feeling of discontent ghosts but not ghosts at least that seemed to be the definition or else some were ghosts actual spirits unwilling or unable to move on but others were memories mechanically playing out whatever tragedy had created them she sat there nibbling on the rough edge of her thumbnail while she considered her options for learning anything sarah was unavailable as she had been on may eve she was off doing something that had to do with being a witch there was nothing in her alchemy books and she didnt recall anything from her mothers notebook but what had sarah said that she eleanor was getting direct teaching in dreams she was using the tarot to guide her after a suggestion in one of the alchemy books and she was concentrating on the cards whenever she fell asleep assuming that she would find her way into the tarot realm so if she was being taken up by some sort of teacher or teachers perhaps they were using what she was thinking about as the structure to their lessons well what if she went to bed and concentrated on a question instead of the cards would she get an answer to it only one way to find out she went up the stairs to her own roomit was unlikely the girls would come up here to wake her when they returned since it was less work to get out of their dresses alone than it was to climb the stairs to find her and wake heror if alison was feeling generous she would send her own maid to help them howse would be waiting in alisons rooms until the robinsons returnednot that this was any hardship there was a lounge there and a stack of the latest magazines howse didnt lack for anything truth to be told though if more truth were to be told except for the extra place at dinner eleanor scarcely knew howse was in the house she hardly spoke at all she might have been a clockwork for all the notice she took of anything then again it was probably that howse considered eleanor to be so far beneath her that she would sooner turn desperado than acknowledge eleanors presence if the hierarchy between lower class and upper was rigid it was even more so among servants eleanor had never really understood that until she had been made into a servant herself but it was the truth upper servants spoke to lower only to give orders and would never even think of socializing with them so it was no great surprise that she heard nothing from howse as she closed the door of her little garret room once settled into bed she closed her eyes and concentrated what are revenants and what has alison to do with them she could not have told the moment when she slipped from waking into sleeping but she found herselfstrangely enoughwalking down the road heading to the meadow where she met reggie it was dark with hardly any moonlight at all and yet the whole landscape seemed as bright as day to her it was deserted of course anyone in the farms along here was already in bed dawn came early and with it the demands of livestock and crops she wasnt so much walking she quickly discovered as she was being walked her bodyif indeed this was her body and not the sort of other self she inhabited when she was in the world of the tarot moved along of its own volition and under the control of someone other than herself she didnt fight it there was no reason to as near as she could tell she was going to be given the answer to her questionor why else take her outside the magical protections that sarah had placed around the village the revenants could not pass those therefore to see them she must go outside them finally she came to the boundary of longacre park and there along the fence she sawthem the moment she did she felt a shock of pure terror the like of which she had never felt in all her life the nasty little creatures that she had driven away in the meadow had frightened her but not like this this was pure atavistic fear the fear that said to the gut these things can do worse than kill you shed have screamed if her instincts hadnt caught the scream in her throat before it began they didnt know she was there yet and there was no reason to do something that would certainly attract their attention transparent glowing there was no mistaking them for living creatures for one thing they were in a variety of costumesbut for another they werent all whole at least half of them were missing pieces of themselves arms legs and in at least one case a head and most of the rest were rather gruesomely the worse for wear and time she was very very glad that they all had their backs to her if they faced her she didnt think she would be able to hold back a scream there were a great many of them all pressing against some invisible boundary at the edge of longacre park lands the oldest were dressed in some sort of outlandish robes and animal skins the newest in the uniform of the british infantry all of them wanted in all of them were consumed with rage why she thought irrelevantly why them what could anyone up at longacre park have possibly done to anger a druid that is she assumed the ones in the robes were druids she couldnt think what else they could be well whatever it was alison had given their anger a form and a force of will and now they were ready to press that advantage as far into the enemy territory as they could she held quite still knowing even if she knew nothing else that she did not want to attract their attention but she also did not want those things prowling about after dark maybe ordinary people couldnt see them and know them to be as dangerous as an unexploded shell but she could and did and she often went out at night maybe they couldnt get past the protections that kept the village safebut maybe they could she wasnt taking any chances i have to get away and tell sarah about this as soon as i can she has to know these things are still out here and dangerous but before she could make up her mind any further she heard faint and muffled the sound of another motorcar approaching eleanor shivered as she realized that the motor was also nearly transparent and as for driver and passenger they were utterly weirdly silent were they some other kind of revenant or were they something else the motor chugged to a full stop alongside the fencewhich strangely enough was not transparent and as the passenger stepped down from the motorcar she became more real and more solid with each step it was like a vanishingtrick in reverse as she became more real and solid she also began to glowbut it was as if she had brought sunlight into the midnight world not the sort of sickly foxfire that the revenants radiated just looking at her made eleanor feel more confident and less afraid but the figure that stood there straightbacked and imperious was no one that eleanor recognized she was dressed in the most outlandish costume eleanor had ever seen outside of a play or a fancydress partyquite literally draped grecian robes of a brilliant blue in her graying hair which had been braided and wrapped around her head in the style favored by grecian matrons was a laurel wreath she had a staff a little taller than she was in one hand but she didnt lean on it as if she needed its support she surveyed the scene before her looking down her nose at the revenants who were only just now realizing that she was there and frowned provide an anchor smith just in case the very feminine voice saidsounding as if she was speaking from the bottom of a well a pale blue ray of light lanced from the man behind the wheel to the old woman now the revenants were beginning to notice that they were not alone they turned towards the woman snarling and sneering and one or two advanced towards her in a threatening manner she didnt seem to care in the least in fact she regarded them with the calm disapproval of someone who has found schoolboys meddling in something they should have known better than to touch you she said sternly have been very naughty and whoever sent you was naughtier still and with that she rapped the butt of her staff three times on the ground and made a gesture as of one scattering a handful of grain and suddenly eleanor found herself at the heart of a tempest june broom warwickshire quicker than thought the tempest descended silent invisible winds ripped through the countryside practically picking eleanor right up off her feet and slamming her into the trunk of a tree to which she clung for dear life the winds tore at her hair sending it whipping around her hauled at her clothingbut what they did to her was nothing to what they were doing to the revenants the revenants wereliterallybeing shredded by the winds that spun cyclonelike in a vortex with the old woman at their still heart there was a clean blue glow about the old woman and her helper now and though the revenants huddled howling together trying to hide themselves nothing they did was any protection against the power that was ripping them apart as if they were nothing but tissuepaper and whirling the tiny pieces upwards in a reverse snowfall of glowing bits eleanor looked up involuntarily to see that the bits were being carried up into a bottomless black hole in the sky rimmed with glowing blue and yetand there was the strangest thing of allso far as the trees and the rest of the real world was concerned there were no winds the leaves rustled only a little the grasses scarcely moved at all there was no sound but the keening wail of the revenants themselves the hair went up on the back of eleanors neck even as she clung even tighter to the treetrunk or was she clinging to the trunk there seemed to be two trees there a kind of faintly luminescent shadowtree which was tossing its branches in the tempest and the real tree which was undisturbed and her arms were wrapped tightly around the former not the latter a thin cry of despair arose from the revenants and if they had been hideous before now with half of their substance eaten away by the terrible cyclone they were horrible to look at they tried to snatch at the bits of themselves being ripped off and blown away only to see their fingers bits of their hands torn off too eleanor felt herself sickening and couldnt help herself she couldnt bear the sight any longer she squeezed her eyes shut and tried to will herself awake for surely this was a dream it must be a dream she would make it a dream oh please let this just be a nightmare dont let it be real and with a start and a jolting she felt in her heart she did awaken she was in her own bed crickets singing outside her window her heart pounded so hard she thought the bed might be shaking with the force of it and she was terribly terribly cold and a moment later she began to shiver so violently that the bed did start shaking after all she tried to move and couldnt and her shivering grew worse it was as if the cold itself held her prisoner in bonds of ice she had never been so cold her teeth chattered with it and her fingers and toes were numb with it and she wanted a blanket desperately but before she could make a second attempt to lurch out of bed to get one something else came to her rescue flowing out of the brickwork of the chimney came her salamanders three of them they raced across the floor and slithered up into the bed where one coiled itself against the small of her back one wrapped itself around her shoulders and one curled up just at the hollow of her stomach warmth spread from them driving the numbing cold out of her and after a moment her shivering stopped and she began to relax as soon as she began to feel warm again exhaustion hit her as if she had been working beyond her strength and when the last of remnants of her fear ebbed away replaced by a weary lassitude she gave in to it and let sleep claim her again this time carefully not thinking of any questions nor the tarot shed had enough lessons for one night june longacre park warwickshire the card party that had begun so tediously had ended last night as a different sort of party altogether reggie could not have been more grateful his aunts good friendand his own godmotherlady virginia de marce had turned up in her own motorcar with her chauffeur and though only he and his aunt knew this arcane assistant smith in attendance smith had efficiently organized the servants and gotten the formidable pile of lady virginias belongings upstairs while her ladyship tidied herself and returned to take control of the company her ladyship could not help but take control of whatever company she was in she had an air about her of absolute authority she dressed like a queen in her own unique style based roughly on the enormous hats trumpetskirts and highnecked gowns of twenty years before which somehow made her look tunelessly fashionable rather than outdated while every powerful master that reggie had ever met tended to exude that aura of authority lady virginia had honed hers into a weapon when she entered a room she took charge of it and everyone in it with smiths help she had come downstairs again in less than a third of the time it would have taken any other woman changed miraculously from her duster goggles veiled hat and travelingensemble to an exquisite gown of mauve lace smith be it said was also lady virginias ladys maidbecause smith chauffeur arcane assistant was a woman as lady virginia often said i am old enough to be able to hire whom i wish and rich enough to be considered eccentric rather than mad when i do it was difficult to know whether one liked smith the curiously sexless servant was a past mistress of being inscrutable and virtually invisible but there was no doubt that smith was as efficient and formidable in her own quiet way as her mistress reggie had more than once wondered if smith was even human it was possible that she was not lady virginia after all was a formidable master of air and it was just within the bounds of the possible that smith was actually an air elemental of some arcane sort not likely but possible as for appearances smith had gray eyes curiously colorless hair kept cropped short and invariably wore gray either as a mannishly tailored suit or a chauffeurs uniform and somehow perhaps because she looked so androgynous no one was scandalized by a woman in trousers she was always correct always precise and seldom spoke unless addressed directly and in fact her name wasnt smith at all it was melanie lynn when hed first learned this he had been stupid enough and arrogant enough to take lady virginia to task for calling her servant smith rather than lynnfor there were people in his circle that couldnt be bothered to learn their servants names instead they had a habit of calling them whatever was convenient so that they would never have to learn a new name for the old position when one servant was replaced by another he should have known better this was lady virginia after all who marched in the suffragists parades chained herself to the railing of number downing street and helped doctor maya in her charity clinic are you mad boy lady virginia had said sternly its not for my convenience smith wants me to call her smith and im not fool enough to gainsay her names are power smith had said from behind him startling him into a yelp for he hadnt realized she had come in smith is a cipher when you are a cipher boy you can be anything standing out isnt always an advantage he often wondered where exactly lady virginia had found smith but after that day hed never dared to ask the game of bridge that had been taking place was utterly abandoned as soon as lady virginia descended tidied into elegance again her personality dominated the gathering without anyone other than reggie really noticing within moments she had smoothly and effortlessly redirected the conversation into a discussion of the remarkable achievements of young t e lawrence in the arabian campaign it was a reasonably safe topic an exotic enough locale that no one at the tables truly connected it with the war and even if they had lawrence was leading an allarab army of resistance no british livesother than his ownwere involved he was the darling of the american as well as the british press he was trailed about by an audacious american reporter it was painless to find him interesting but there was something about the significant looks that she kept casting at reggie that made him certain she was only biding her time until she could get him alone though why that should be he couldnt guess unless it had something to do with taking up magic again surely not nevertheless he was glad enough when his aunt april lady williams declared that if she was tired lady virginia must be shattered and the local guests who had come from outside longacre park elected to take themselves back to their homes he was able to slip away unobtrusively and take to his own bed not that he had expected to sleep his dreamsnightmares reallyhad been so terrifying since the beginning of may that if he got three undisturbed hours in a night it was a good nights rest only doctor mayas drugs kept the nightmares at bay and he was beginning to feel uneasy about how much of that stuff he was taking he lay down in his bed expecting to stare at the ceiling for hours and had just begun to think about what lady virginia could want with him that was when he actually fell asleep due to exhaustion most nights of the last month he had lain awake for hours staring up at the ceiling aware of a feeling of lurking hostility and menace unable to determine where it came from so it was all the more surprising when he fell asleep immediately and did not dream it was even more surprising that the next time he opened his eyes it was morning real morning not two or three past midnight nor even predawn the sun was coming up filling his room with lightas with most air masters he preferred to have his bedroom facing east a cool breeze fluttered the curtains and a lark saluted the day he felt better than he hadin an age actually rested for once and even if his knee gave him the usual amount of trouble when he rose it was worth it to look out his window at the sun streaming over the lawns without feeling as if he would have given his soul for a single night of undisturbed rest he was even whistling when he came down to breakfast to find his aunt and lady virginia just beginning their own meal good morning my lady aunt april he said cheerfully as he went to the sideboard to help himselfnoting with a sigh that it was a darkbread day if there was one thing he missed more than anything else since rationing had begun it was good white bread your dear mother is up and out as usual his aunt told him after presenting her cheek for him to kiss and where she gets that energy from at this hour of the day i could not tell you certainly not from my side of the family positively indecent no one should be that awake at six well excepting milkmen i suppose and farmers and ones maid but they shouldnt be so cheerful about it and your dear mother should know better it troubles the servants when the mistress is up as early as they are lady virginia said nothing neatly and economically disposing of grilled tomatoes while aunt april talked and buttered toast without shedding a crumb this was aunt aprils usual sort of chatter if there was a silence she moved to fill it with whatever came into her head which made for some interesting social moments now and again reggie could still remember the time at a dinner party in this very house during his first year at oxford when she had asked an eminent member of the the house of lords just as he was filling his lungs to pontificate if there was a reason why his shirtfront popped every time he took a deep breath since the poor man hadup until that moment at least clearly been unaware that his shirtfront did any such thing he had been left gaping at her like a stranded fish and had completely lost his train of thought nor was that the end of it he had been so selfconscious for the rest of the evening that he never spoke more than a sentence or two as this had the result at least according to his father of preventing at least three arguments any one of which might have erupted into a major disagreement if not a diplomatic incident aunt april had earned the undying gratitude of the rest of the guests and standing invitations to more events than she could ever possibly attend and if she had a reputation as being more than a bit dotty every hostess worth her saltcellar knew aunt april could be counted on to defuse potential disasters with an unfocused laugh and a disingenuous remark at precisely the right moment and if a stuffedshirt or two was left embarrassed and wondering how it had happened at least it was nothing he could take exception to mothers been an early riser for as long as i can remember aunt april reggie said sitting down with his own plate of grilled tomatoes and eggs and i doubt that the servants even notice this is the countryside people get up earlier than they do in town and i cant think why aunt april responded waving her knife for emphasis her brows furrowed what is there to get up early for its not as if there was shooting at this time of year and anyway by the time its shooting season getting up early isnt early anymore its properly late reggie didnt even try to wrap his mind around that statement it made sense to aunt april so that was all that counted you do rattle on april said lady virginia without rancor reginald i want to speak with you as soon as you have finished your breakfast privately oh good aunt april said looking suddenly cheerful well get that over with then and it wont be hanging over our heads like a rock of sophocles or was it the sword of thucydides whichever it was it was a terribly uncomfortable object to have hanging over your head and i would hate to have it hanging over ours spoiling the entire visit damocles lady virginia said interrupting it was the sword of damocles dear as if you didnt know since i know very well you were making better use of your brothers classics tutor than your brother did now if you could take your tea to the terrace oh im finished virginia and ill run off and find nothing to do aunt april said with a gay little wave of her hand as she rose in a flutter of lace flounces do get him to come around to taking up his powers again will you dear of course you will if he doesnt want to youll threaten him with smith she trotted off without waiting for a word from either of them leaving him staring at lady virginia across the breakfast table nervously crumbling toast and wishing hed sent down for a tray instead of coming to the table this morning reginald lady virginia said raising her chin a little this nonsense of avoiding magic must stop now she couldnt have been more direct and she left him with no graceful way out of the conversation he clenched his teeth and replied just as directly lady virginiaforgive me but you cant possibly know why i am she did something she had never done before in all of his acquaintance with her she interrupted him actually she said tartly i do know i know exactly why in excruciating detail i have not been idle these three years i am a vad a working vad though admittedly a parttime vad since my old bones are hardly up to the long hours the young ones put in and i have no intention of living in some squalid little dormitory with a pack of girls i have been spending many long hours at the bedsides of young enlisted men and i wasnt simply mopping their brows as you should by now be aware furthermore they talk to me reginald i induce them to talk to me because it is sometimes the only way to purge them of their horrors reggie felt his eyes widen with shock it had never occurred to him that aristocratic lady virginia would have volunteered to do nursingaide work butshe was continuing and as for what happened specifically to you not only did i get the gist of the experience from maya one of my workingclass proteges a clever earth magician that i sponsored through nurses training was privy to some of your experience in the trenches as you rather unambiguously shared it with whoever was sensitive at the time he stared at her appalled that he had done any such thing granted hed been out of his senses but still who lady virginia shrugged you werent conscious so you wont recognize the name a nurse at the first fieldhospital you came to if you must know an earthworker as i told youthey cant seem to stay away from pursuing healing at the front you nearly gave her a breakdown and she had to come home to me for a month fortunately maya sorted her out unfortunately maya does not seem to have been as successful with you he blinked at her there didnt seem to be anything he could say im sorry about your protegee he began she waved his apology away she knew that she was going to encounter things like that before she volunteered and the experience has given her better shields and you could learn from her example as soon as she could she was back using what power she has for the greatest good he flushed she saw the flush correctly assumed it was embarrassment and shook her head you mistake me i am not going to act like your idiotic grandfather and call you a coward because i know you arent that leg of yours cantaccording to doctor mayabe more than half healed and i know that you think that you have taken the best steps you can to protect yourself but reginald walling yourself off from magic is not going to solve your problem in fact it is only going to make things worse nettled now he narrowed his eyes i cant see how lady virginia sighed naturally you cant see how you havent looked she eyed him shrewdly youve forgotten that building walls instead of shields blinds you to what is going on around you i dont suppose youd have the effrontery to tell me youve been sleeping the sleep of the just lately would you last night he began but she interrupted him again oh last night of course but what about for the last month she stared at him daring him to lie with her eyes and he couldnt he gave in feeling his fragile defenses crumple under the pressure of the knowledge she had in her eyes he didnt know how she knew but she clearly did no ive gotten no more than a few hours of rest at most over the past few weeks most nights are as bad as they were when i was in hospital im not surprised lady virginia replied with satisfaction considering that until last night you had a small army of revenants breathing down your neck even walled and shielded you would have sensed them and had they gained in power you would have been at their mercy revenants are not subject to the same laws as elementals as you should well know and if they had been able to break through to you they would have shredded your mind at the least and possibly worse than that that took him completely by surprise revenants but what could he possibly have done to arouse revenants and here there hadnt been a haunt anywhere near longacre for generations buthaunted described exactly how he had been feeling for the last month or so revenants the mere thought made him dizzy no revenants were not subject to the same laws as elementals they could even make themselves seen and felt by ordinary mortals really powerful ones could kill smith and i encountered them clawing at the shields around the grounds last night as we came in lady virginia continued ruthlessly we dispelled them of course but if you had been properly doing your job instead of relying on your late fathers defenseswhich are eroding may i addyou would have known they were there and done something about them weeks ago but his head was whirling at this point but me no buts i will accept no excuses think will you she demanded there are surely at least a handful of sensitives down in that village of yours if not a real practitioner what if one of them had been caught by the revenants instead of smith and me ill build better shields he said grimly getting his metaphorical feet under him again ill put myself behind magical walls too thick for anything to sense me or find me and i wont attract any more trouble reginald david alexander tiberius fenyx you have tried that and it did not work lady virginia exploded losing her temper as she had seldom ever done in his presence he shrank back involuntarily as she slapped the table three times with an open palm emphasizing her last three words by the archangel raphael i swear if your father was alive to hear this he wouldwell i dont know what he would do but i know what he would be and that is bitterly disappointed i expect the idiots in the war office to fail to learn from their mistakes but i thought better of you but he protested feebly you were behind shieldsyour own and your fathersand those revenants still found you and i cannot for the life of me imagine what you could have done that would attract the attention of a renegade druid a couple of romanbritish louts in armor an assortment of regency highwaymen and a spread of nasty cutthroats stretching back to hidewearing hengebuilders now what about that makes you suspicious she stared at him demanding that he think and he did though he didnt want to admit what he was thinking they were sent she sniffed better i was beginning to wonder if you had left some of your wits back there on the front yes they were sent i do not know by whom or why but they were certainly carefully called up invoked bound and sent probably beltane night which would account for your disturbed sleep since then and with them dispelled which their master will most certainly know the next things that are purposed to attack you will be stronger he just stared at her numbly he couldnt for the life of him imagine why anyone would set revenants on him it doesnt actually matter who did this or why lady virginia continued the point is that renouncing magic is not going to make this person go away i dont believe that whoever this is has any plans to leave you alone until you are dead or mad her eyes glittered at him he hadnt truly understood how hard she could be when she felt the need at that moment it came home to him that she had been an air mastera combative magician on a front of her ownfor most of her life she was as mentally tough as any soldier if not more so she might not have been a part of the council but he knew quite well that she was part of some other white lodge and had been just as active as any of alderscrofts masters perhaps the only difference between her and those now in the trenches was that her experience of combat had not left her disillusioned and bitter nor are you my primary concern at this moment she said stabbing her finger down at the tablecloth for emphasis you might be able to protect yourself behind your shields and your walls but what about others what about the sensitives down in your village can they when whoever this is levels barrage after barrage of magical attacks against you who do you think is going to pay the price as those attacks reflect off your defenses he gulped i hadnt but in his minds eye he saw the shattered remains of the villages of belgium and france wreckage that proved it didnt matter how innocent you were once you were in the way he dropped his gaze to his own hands they were shaking did you see or sense anything that might give you an idea who was behind the attack he asked instead trying to put off the moment of decision for a little while longer all that i sensed was a momentary hint of someonea fire magician i thought halftrained at best it wasnt there for long and i dont believe the fire magician had anything to do with the revenants i think it was just someone caught up accidentally possibly one of your sensitive villagers or someone dreaming and coming to investigate the flares of power the aura suggested someone walking in an astral projection he looked up at that but she shook her head at him and at any rate revenants are far more likely to be sent by an earth magician they dont respond well to fire a fire magician in an astral projection could it have been one of the london fire masters responding to the presence of the revenants he hazarded possibly more likely one of their students the brief impression i got was of someone still in apprenticeship so to speak she frowned there isnt anyone in your village who would match that description is there i never heard of any fire mages there he shrugged helplessly mind you i was not here most of the time if i wasnt at school i was in london father never even told me who the other masters were around here he always said there would be plenty of time when i was finished at oxford he frowned as he concentrated on a fugitive memory i think theres a witch down thereearth of courseor at least there was i dont know if shes still alive or if shes taken on students of her own but lady virginia if someone is strong enough to call up revenants and set them on me shouldnt we inform lord alderscroft hope that he might yet evade lady virginias demands sprang up in him surely this is a task for alderscroft and the council he persisted an attack on a council member first there would have to be a council left to do something lady virginia replied caustically whats left now that all the young lions are at the front dead or incapacitated has their hands full with arcane demands from the almsleys branch of the war office her lips tightened into a thin line but that still isnt the point reginald the point is that even if you are safe for the moment there are innocents around you who are not she stared him in the face and would not let him look away so the question is what are you going to do to protect them he wanted badly to say that he wasnt going to do anything that their protection was none of his business he wanted to protest that he was the injured party here that he had taken wounds to the spirit as well as the flesh in defence of his own country and that it was past time that someone protected him for a change but he couldnt as his father had once told him there was an obligation that came with power that obligation left him with a very clear code of conduct an officer and a gentleman ill do what i must lady virginia he said even though his hands shook with fear and his skin crawled it seems i have no choice june broom warwickshire alison was furious and everyone was staying out of her way she had every right to be furious bad enough that the cardparty last night had been invaded and taken over by that dreadful old cow in her outmoded dresses so that the careful work being done on reggie by the girls was utterly disrupted as he went to dance attendance on the creature worse that she was reggies godmother and a particular friend of the family but worst of allthis lady virginia was an air master a crony of alderscrofts and someone it would be very very dangerous to cross any sort of covert magical work in reggies direction would have to stop alison could not take the risk of being uncovered alison had been forced to sit there and smile and make polite noises while her ladyship monopolized the conversation with tales of that fellow whod gone native with the arabs as if he or a lot of unwashed camelherders mattered by the time she was able to make her excuses and escape the greater part of the evening had been wasted and reggie wasnt even looking at the girls anymore it had been his mother whod sent for the chauffeur and the car to take them home but that wasnt the end of the evenings disasters oh no because she had tried to call in her army of revenants to increase their strengthexcept when she tried to find them they were gone vanished dispelled in fact they had been dispelled so thoroughly that there wasnt a trace of them leftalthough the signs of the magic that had destroyed them were clear enough and the signature of an air master who didnt care who knew what she had done was clear enough for anyone to read who had the eyes to see it it hadnt been reggie it certainly wasnt the broom village witch that left only the newly arrived lady virginia alison had been so angry last night that she had called up and torn to bits several of her own kobolds just to relieve her temper shed have dragged ellie out of bed and beaten herand in fact she was tempted tobut if she started she had known she wouldnt be able to stop and the complications of hurting or killing the fool began with the mere inconvenience of not having someone to cook or clean in the morning and ended with losing the robinson fortune so instead she made an example of three of the dullest of her minions smashed a couple of china ornaments and still went to bed in a temper she had awakened feeling no less angry but by midmorning her temper had cooled sufficiently to allow her to think clearly the girls knew better than to trifle with her in her current mood when she summoned them to her room after howse had finished her work they came immediately and quietly we have a problem she told them grimly that woman that arrived last night is an air master and reggies godmother the girls exchanged a look of apprehension does that mean no magic around her carolyn asked nothing directed at reggie at least alison said sourly alderscroft knows im an earth masterafter all he was the one who sent me but mother i thought you said your job here was to be kept secret lauralee protested why should lord alderscroft have told lady virginia about you of all of the things that had been running through her mind this morning that hadnt been one of them she sucked on her lower lip a moment in fact he probably didnt come to think of it shes not on his council as far as i know and i cant believe he would have told an outsider war office business so its not as bad as you thought carolyn said brightening no carolyn it is as bad as i thought alison corrected caustically it is simply not as dire as it could be shes gotten rid of my revenants and she will certainly be able to trace any active earth magic used against her godson straight back to meor to you which means we can do nothing directly hmm mother we can still use charms against our rivals lauralee pointed out shrewdly as long as we do so away from longacre park she wont bother to look for magics being worked in that way alison turned a surprisedand pleasedgaze on her elder that was two good thoughts in as many minutes now that is certainly a plan she agreed and a good one i approve and as for meyou know i do think it unlikely that lady virginia will even consider watching over lady devlin i will redouble my efforts and become lady devlins best most trusted friend she felt her lips curving into a slight smile yes i could do that its the sort of exercise of earth magic that an air master is usually blind toslow deliberate and subtle playing on the emotions then i can play on her fears reggie will certainly have to go back to the front hes the only male left in the fenyx line he must marry and do his duty for the fenyx name before he goes off again and who better to wed than one of the daughters of her very good friend carolyn put in coquettishly lauralee laughed pretty polite presentable were no worse than any of the other girls shes been trying to interest him in perhaps not as blueblooded but if shes growing desperate she may overlook that she cocked her head to one side do you think we could get away with some small seductive magics if we were careful to make them lookaccidental possibly possibly alison thought hard it suddenly occurs to me that the reason lady virginia might be here is to urge reggie back into the practice of magic he has been walled against your charms until nowbut if she succeeds hell be vulnerable to such things again her smile widened a trifle now theres a fine thought if that is indeed the case lady virginia might be doing us a favor a delicious irony though i doubt she would appreciate it herself all i care about is that she not interfere lauralee countered nothing else matters quite right her mother declared with satisfaction for her daughters practicality so we need to put together our new plans i want you two to decide what magic you are going to use on your rivals when you have your course of action come to me so i can be sure it is something that wont alert lady virginia i will intensify my campaign to win lady devlin and the three of us will work out what sort of seductions you can use against reggie and how to make them look like the innocent work of untrained sensitives yes mother they chorused looking maliciously cheerful as she shooed them out alison went to the window of her bedroom and looked down onto the garden below ellie was hanging out bedlinen and it occurred to her that there was yet another loose end that needed tidying she still had not made up her mind what to do about the girl for all that her emotional self enjoyed the idea of putting lockes plan into motion her logical self warned that there were far too many loopholes in itnot to mention pitfalls the problem with adding outsiders into a plan was that you could never be sure of their loyaltynor their discretion no the more she thought of lockes plan the less she liked it still the basic notion of driving the girl madthat was a good one she resolved to put more thought into it time was not on her side in this but there must be a better answer and she was just the person to find it july broom warwickshire all was darkness save only a tiny pool of yellow light from the lantern that the old man held he looked like a monk the sort that wore simple hooded robes he wasnt of course he was something altogether different with no more than a nodding acquaintance with christianity eleanor had expected someone hard and ascetic and possibly unfriendly instead she looked up into the face of a man who looked down on her with kind warm eyes he looked like a grandfatherly wizard and was the most real of all of the tarot creatures she had yet met and now said the hermit you come to me do you know me yet eleanor shook her head oh she knew what he was and even what he represented but to know him understand him as deeply as that simple question impliedno she did not know him yet she knew only enough to know that this was someone who had spent all his life looking for wisdom and had learned to distill things down to their simplest who would unlike gaffer clark use the fewest words possible to cut to the heart of something it was night here in the world of the tarot cards and the hermit held the lantern that was the only source of light for as far as she could see it was that lantern that had led her to him in fact tonight for the very first time since she had begun this quest through the major arcana she had not passed through the stages she had already been tested in that had come as something of a shock she had gone to bed early since alison and the girls were at longacre parkagainand she was boneweary with all the work they had put her through they went through as many clothingchanges in a day as lady devlin did now and it wasnt howse who picked up the discarded items laundered them hung them to dry starched and ironed them oh noit was eleanor up and down the stairs three times a day with extra demand on her because the tennis dress discarded in the afternoon would be wanted in the morning alison was getting very familiar with lady devlin and eleanor didnt think it was all namedropping there was something going on up there at the big great house somehow alison had managed to worm her way into lady devlins regard eleanor was trying very hard not to care after all alisons machinations were giving her the freedom to gain in knowledge and control of her magic and her element her hands and body might be busy but her mind was free to think to reason to analyze every tiny bit of information she got from the alchemy books and her mothers notes and when the others werent about she could practice some of the smaller magics sharpening her skills fire magic was quite good for keeping the iron hot for instance and if her hands werent nearly as smooth and lovely as her stepsisters the salamanders had healed the cracked skin shrunk the joints made the nails stronger and neater besides as sarah had said more than once the manors the manor and the village is the village and the less we have to do with each other the better there was no point in even thinking about reginald fenyx and his mother the gulf between them was just too wide to bridge but if there was one thing that all this delving through the paths of the cards was teaching her it was to look inside herself and be honest about what was there never mind that her little passion for reginald fenyx hadnt the chance of a rose in midwinter it was certainly there it didnt take having her mind slip off on a daydream of what hed looked like asleep in the meadow to tell her that and how not really when you came down to it he was handsome he was a war hero and he was vulnerable put the three traits together and how could any girl not fall a little in love with him and he had been kind to hercarelessly kind but kind nevertheless never mind that he had most likely forgotten her entirely by now between his own concerns and the round of entertainments his mother was contriving he probably hadnt given her a single thought in weeks which was just as well it allowed her to have her secret passion without embarrassing herself there was safety in distance if grown women can be in love with some actor on the london stage she told herself helplessly i can be in love with reggie fenyx surely wheres the harm so long as i dont delude myself into thinking hed ever look twice at me in public some of that was going through her mind before she went to sleep tonight knowing that if she dreamed she would be facing the hermit the embodiment of know thyself she was afraid to tell the truth not of the cardcreature himself but of failing to pass whatever tests he set her the more she thought about the hermit the less confident she was how could she even begin to meet him mindtomind she really didnt think she was ready for this cardsurely he should have come at the end of the major arcana not barely halfway through surely the end of the journey that began with the fool should end with the hermit she had hoped to gain a bit more courage by passing through all the stages she had won through before facing the hermitbut instead when she woke in the tarot realm she woke to darkness a darkness broken only by a single pinpoint of light in the distance a light that she stumblingly made her way towards i dont know you she said slowly admitting her ignorance i mean i know you are the hermit butbut thats not just some misanthropic old man in a desert i dont know really know what you are i am an eternal seeker the hermit said and smiled i am merlin taliesin apollonius of tyanna i am anyone who has ever sought for wisdom knowing that it is the search that is important and not the end because becausethere never will be an end because you never actually find wisdom she hazarded feeling as if she was groping in the dark without the benefit of the hermits lantern because if you think youve found it you havent because looking for wisdom is a process and not something with an actual goal and he prompted think what you have learned from the other cards thus far people who actually are something dont need to make a show no it was more than that wasnt there a quote toknow you know nothingis the beginning of wisdom she faltered and the wisest man does not claim wisdom for himself though others may account him as wise the hermit said gently and with what she recognized with astonishment was true humility but that is not why you are here now you will seek for wisdom your whole life long little firemage and sometimes it will be through pain and trouble and sometimes with joy and pleasure you cannot cease from learning especially you whose element is fire for fire changes all it touches and everything it touches changes fire is the transmuter of all earth becomes ash and glass water becomes vapor air is consumed in alchemy only through tempering and trial in the crucible through fire can base become noble fire is a bad master but a good servant and for it to serve you you must be more clever than it is she nodded earnestly not that she was entirely comfortable with all this business of master and servantbut some of what she had read in her mothers notes had made it clear that while there were some elementals who were well people the vast majority of them were no brighter than a cat or a dog but all of them had a dangerous side well look at her salamanders for instance sweetnatured with her but shed seen them go after those nasty little gnomes fierce as ferrets and the fire elementals were terribly dangerous when they werent controlled look what had happened in san francisco in the united states after that terrible earthquake so you arent to grant me wisdom she said looking up at him for he was very tall even stooped over as he was bowed with the weight of his knowledge and years because obviously wisdom is only earned with experience and i havent got much but i can give you knowledge and i have he nodded at her and to her astonishment continued and you have shown yourself ready to proceed by admitting that you lack wisdom and knowledge both sometimes little one the answer is to give no answer sometimes it is better for the fool to ask not what is that cup but to say with an open heart i do not know can you help me and now i am to take you to justice who marks the halfway point in your journey she stared at him unable to believe that she had passed his tests had won her way to the next card surely not but he was walking away as if he fully expected her to follow so follow she did through the darkness that was illuminated only by his lantern a thick darkness that closed in around them until they came to another of those marble halls with classical pillars that seemed to be everywhere here there he stood aside and waited for her to go inside im not ready she exclaimed feeling a rising panic no one ever is he said and to her immense relief she woke she realized instantly what had awakened her it was the sound of voices coming up through the floor alison and her daughters were back and carolyn and lauralees voices were unusually shrill with excitement i cant believe it carolyn exclaimed a real weekend party and a real society ball mother how did you persuade her good gad what are they up to now i have my ways alison purred by the sound of things they must be in lauralees room directly beneath eleanors i pointed out that reggie certainly knew any number of officers who were on injuredleave as well as being able to extend invitations to the pilots in training at oxford and suggested that a proper weekend party the kind we all remember from before the war could be just the thing to shake him out of his gloomy spirits and of course i used my influence on her alison laughed i must admit the presence of the other guests has helped in this far past my expectations i do believe that lady devlin has woken up to the fact that shes buried herself in that old place for two years and that she misses polite society one can hardly call her father either polite or society carolyn giggled if hed been my father she said boldly id have sent him packing months ago im glad hes gone and if reggie marries me im going to see to it that he stays where he belongs hmph lauralee replied if reggie marries me and that horrible old man turns up he just might climb into bed one night and find himself sharing it with kobolds and if that doesnt frighten him into heart failure i dont know what will better to find a way to be rid of him permanently carolyn he has a fortune of his own and his daughter will inherit all of it waste not want not i always say dont bicker girls alison said absently we need to plan for this weekend party carefully the difficulty however is that we must go into london for several days if we are to get proper costumes for this occasion it will be a fancydress ball after all now are you quite certain your magics are firmly in place on your rivals we cannot afford any slippage absolutely lauralee said in a voice that allowed for no doubt our spells are working flawlessly and they are so subtle i doubt that anyone has noticed any changes in the other girls no matter what they sound like to anyone else the moment they are in reggies presence they will be irritating their conversation will be inane theyll talk too much and their voices will be shrill it isnt much of a change just half an octave or so but it does grate on his nerves whereas we make sure to pitch our voices low when we speak to him carolyn said smugly we dont talk too much we get him to talk about things he likes and we try to be soothing the contrast alone has endeared us to him good and after a week of nothing but highpitched irritation around him he will be all the happier to see you back alison said gaily well off to bed girls we have a journey to make in the morning the sound of footsteps below marked the departure of carolyn and her mother from lauralees room now fully awake eleanor listened to the sounds of her stepsister preparing for bed in the room below so they were going to be gone for a full week she could scarcely believe her luck a week without the extra chores the extra laundry there would be so much more she could get accomplished if there was the slightest chance that she could get through all of the rest of the major arcana cards in their absence well perhaps not all of them but surely one each day wasnt too much to try for she caught herself just in time just be glad you have the peace to work in she told herself dont try to jump ahead of yourself still she would have a week alone and after that this ball couldnt possibly take place terribly soon she vaguely remembered what she knew about the big country weekends at the homes of the wealthy and titled these things took time a great deal of time to organize there were orders for food to be given substitutions for things that couldnt be obtained would have to be made rooms prepared invitations sent so while that was going on everyone in this household would be distracted too surely if alison was now lady devlins especial friend her ladyship would ask alison to help with the preparations even if not there would be so much concentration on the weekend that no one would pay a lot of attention to eleanor especially if she kept herself quite quiet and unobtrusive perhaps the end of july would be the earliest that this weekend could take place by then it was possible just possible that she would have enough understanding of magic and her element to break free she was coming nearer to it she could sense it she could see the bonds of alisons spells now and they were weakening like a prisoner rasping her bonds against the stone wall of her prison she was wearing away at them but she needed more power she needed greater understanding of her element and the ability to call up an elemental who would be more than a helpful little pet or something that mostly would not offer advice like the salamanders one step at a time she warned herself first you have to learn and you have to practice remember what the hermit told you fire must respect you before it will serve with you she would see how much time during the next week that sarah could spare and spend every free moment practicing reading and finding her way into the realm of the tarot to learn still more and somehow keep alison from finding out about any of it july longacre park warwickshire my mother has gone insane reggie said flatly this business of holding a weekend and a fancydress ball is absolute folly he stared across the breakfast table at lady virginia daring her to disagree breakfast was as usual at longacre a matter of helping ones self from the sideboard so the only people present were himself lady virginia and the brigadier lady virginia sighed and looked meditatively at a grilled tomato resting in lone splendor on her plate i would not put it quite so strongly but for the most part i admit i do find this plan of a weekend party and fancydress ball to be somewhat illadvised illadvised he shook his head my lady have you any idea how much work the staff is already doing a staff that is adequate for a few visitors but is seriously undermanned for something like this hed been fielding plaintive pleas already mostly from the cook and her staff who were trying to find a way to provide four fancy dinners under rationing not to mention the afternoon teas the buffet breakfasts and the luncheons for the guests who would be spending the entire weekend he was going to have to do some foraging among the neighbors and his friends and scour the home farms for produce fortunately i have some contacts among the yanks who seem to be overburdened with provisions he didnt want to think about what this weekend was going to mean in terms of being personally besieged by marriageminded maidens and mamas theyd be coming from miles around for the ball lady virginia sighed nevertheless reggie i understand completely what is motivating her and it is not entirely the urge to see you bound up in wedlock he gritted his teeth and studiously buttered a piece of dark toast notentirely you say the thought of fielding all those women made his head ache or maybe his head was aching because of the way his jaw was clenched nevertheless it was not something he could contemplate quietly the brigadier wisely was keeping silent pretending a polite deafness no his godmother looked up at the ceiling for a moment as if searching for inspiration in the intricately carved plaster i think she has finally gotten over your fathers death i think she has realized that the world still goes on outside the gates of longacre park and i think this is her first rather rash step towards rejoining that world your aunt and i have both been attempting to coax her back out of her retired state i should hate to see this fail to come off i fear it might send her back into seclusion again reggie stopped buttering his toast and stared at lady virginia struck dumb with first astonishment then guilt if that were true he needed another opinion on this quickly he turned to the second of his breakfast companions brigadier what do you think youve known mater for as long as anyone you should be some sort of judge here the brigadier still erect still fit and still every inch the soldier despite his years and gray hair coughed once politely i wouldnt be so discourteous as to contradict a lady but i also wouldnt even make an attempt at guessing what is going through any ladys mind no matter how long ive known her these are mysteries that a man dares to plumb at his peril he raised one bushy eyebrow and nodded at lady virginia i leave that to the members of their own sex lady virginia smiled slightly i never thought you were a coward brigadier he lifted his hand to interrupt herpolitely i was in my time considered a good strategist my lady he said with a twinkle in his eye and a good strategist never attacks a fortified stronghold ever he spread his empty hands in a gesture of conciliation besides i am at a disadvantage my daughterinlaw and granddaughter will be invited for the ball if they were to discover that i dared to be against it however briefly i will have to watch for arsenic in my brandy reggie swallowed his groan if it was indeed the case that this was the sign his mother was ready to move back into her old circles again then how could he possibly object to something that would get his mother to do what he had been praying she would ever since his fathers untimely death she couldnt keep trying to lock the world outside away it wasnt healthy shed turn into a miss havisham if she werent careful but there was no denying the fact that this weekend party was a thinly disguised attempt to force him to make some sort of choice of fiancee and announce an engagement if not announce an engagement and a weddingat this point in the war there had been so many hasty marriages that virtually any young man who wanted or needed a special license could get one on a moments notice not that he entirely blamed her on that score he was the only heir and he was going back to the front when his leg healed when his mind healed but dash it all there wasnt one of these society fillies that he could stand being in the same room with for the course of a cardparty how was he to tolerate one day in day out for the rest of his life the mere thought took away his appetite and he excused himself from the table going out onto the terrace to stare unseeing down into the gardens he had made some progress towards the goal that lady virginia had set for him his shields were far more transparent now and he had been making some small tentative attempts at reading the currents of magic around him as a result he sensed it was her coming up behind him long before she spoke she stood beside him looking out onto the vista that had cost his distant ancestor a pretty penny to produce sometimes i wonder if you hate me reggie she said in a voice that sounded tired he turned towards her with surprise hate you no why should i hate you because i tell you all the uncomfortable truths you would rather not hear its a privilege of age but that doesnt make it less painful to hear them im sure she made a little annoyed sound in the back of her throat not that im going to stop telling them to you not that i expect you to he countered he leaned on the marble balustrade and looked out into the garden mater wants me married she wants it with a desperation that frightens me i dont want a wife or a fiance or anything like one i wont insult you by claiming some noble motives my lady or pretending i want to spare some unknown girl grief when i go back to the front the simple fact is that i have not met one single young woman who would be suitable in maters eyes who was not a dead bore an emptyheaded mannequin suited only for displaying expensive clothing or he almost said or a hardeyed chit who would wait just long enough for me to get onto the train to the channelferry before collecting her lovers to populate my house at my expense but decided that discretion was the better part there besides lady virginia would want to know who he was talking about and he didnt want to tell her or an opportunist more interested in my title and social connections than myself he concluded instead ah said her ladyship nodding wisely the robinson girls among others he laughed without humor they arent the only ones by a stretch but they are the most persistent at the moment i think even their mother would be casting her cap at me if she thought she could slip herself past maters eye lady virginia sighed i almost wish she would try it might shake your mothers friendship with the creature i know this is unreasonable of me and i know that i should be happy for her to have a friend but there is something about that woman and her girls that puts my back up reggie knew what it was even if lady virginia didnt she would never admit it never recognize it in herself but lady virginia was a snob the idea of someone whose money came from trade marrying into the aristocracy secretly outraged her well it probably wouldnt outrage her if the girl was also a masterbut mastery was another sort of aristocracy or perhaps as long as its someone elses blueblooded family and not hers nor that of her friends it wouldnt matter so much it was hardly her fault it was the way shed been raised and he probably would not have noticed if it hadnt been for that stupid notquitequarrel hed had with eleanor he sighed he missed those conversations he missed her company her wit her intelligence and how she was kind without making him feel as if he owed her something for her kindness hed been down to the meadow several times but shed never again appeared either he had offended her so much that she was shunning his company or else his timing was so exquisitely bad that she thought he was avoiding herand as a result she had stopped coming or else and this was the likeliest she was kept too busy for frivolous visits in the middle of the day to the meadow it was summer after all and there were probably a thousand chores she was being made to do oh it made him depressed to think about it that fine keen mind shackled to some sort of menial work it was like seeing a derby winner hitched to a plow if only he could do something for her without insulting her further if only some of those emptyheaded dolls his mother kept dragging about could have a fraction of her intelligence and personality there will be young women youve never even seen at this weekend reggie lady virginia said breaking into his melancholy thoughts perhaps or perhaps not he said more harshly than he had intended and tried to soften it with a sheepish smile ill keep an open mind my lady i wont promise more than that there was one saving grace in all of this with the weekend looming up and all of the preparations that even lady virginia would have to help with she wouldnt be pressuring him so much to take up his magic quickly a silver lining of sons these days he would take whatever sliver of silver he could get exactly what sort of girl interests you reggie she asked out of the blue ive never been able to make you out i must suppose you had your little flings quite enough with my debts honorably discharged he replied flippantly there is one thing to be said in favor of a girl who only expects money and presents from one you always know where you are with her and she always has someone waiting in the wings when you tire of her lady virginia winced is that the prevailing attitude now she asked soberly in my day there was at least a pretense of romance we havent time to waste on romance my lady he said flatly not when he didnt say it but it was there hanging in the air between them not when in a week or two or three you can be just another grave in flanders she brooded down on the roses i expect there is a great deal to be said for knowing that if theworsthappens your current inamorata will simply shrug and move on to another when she sees your name in the papers but those of your generation that live through this hideousness are coming out with scars of the heart and soul as well as the body and i do not know what that will mean in the long run neither do i he replied truthfully but you asked what sort of girl i find attractive involuntarily the image of eleanor independent clever intelligent entirely unsuitable eleanor flashed through his mind someone i can talk to about anything he said finally someone who has the brains not only to understand what im talking about but to hold up her side of the conversation when you have the wherewithal to buy as much beauty as you want it isnt as important mind im not saying that i dont like a girl to be pretty but he shrugged helplessly never mind its hardly relevant surely at some point lady virginia began you must have encountered it was time to put an end to this so he put up the one argument he knew there would be no getting around my lady theres another condition and its one i cannot tell mater i watched how father struggled to keep mater ignorant of his elemental work the difficulties and even heartache it caused for both of them and i decided a long time ago that i wont marry anyone who isnt an elemental master in her own right i must have someone i dont have to keep that sort of secret from and how likely is that there that will silence her he actually had sworn thatbefore the warso he wasnt lying not that he ever expected to take up the wand of an air master again merely dropping some of his shields had been shudderingly difficult he could not even think about working real magic again without bringing on an attack of panic lady virginia looked at him out of the corners of her eyes perhaps more likely than you think he snorted theyre not exactly thick on the ground was all he said he tried not to think of peter scott with raw envy curse the manhe had the perfect partner a woman who was an elemental master brilliant selfsufficient and a stunning exotic beauty not that mater wouldnt drop dead on the spot if i brought home a halfbreed hindu she was the one woman he had ever met who could actually understand really and truly what the war did to a man did to his soul maybe that was the biggest problem with the girls of his set they didnt and couldnt none of them had volunteered as nurses or vad girls in france or belgium none of them had the least idea of the things that lay inside his mind none of them would ever want to know they preferred to think of the war the way those first volunteers had as a chance for glory and if one must die to die nobly they didnt know and couldnt understand that there was nothing noble or glorious about those churnedover fields the dead zones of mud and razorwire and if he tried to tell them they would turn away in horror doctor maya knew and didnt flinch from it but how many like her were there it has been my experience limited though it is that if you are really determined in that direction the partner will find you when you are both ready she said gravely but i am sure that makes me sound like some sort of mystic so i will keep my opinions to myself just keep an open mind as you promisedand open eyes as well she retreated to the house leaving him staring down at the garden wondering bitterly if anyone who hadnt experienced the front could ever understand what it did to someone inside we look act and talk like our old selves but weve been damaged each and every one of us he thought were scarred inside like rosebuds with cankerworms at their hearts we look the same but even if we live well never blossom and there is nothing that will change that nothing at all july broom warwickshire sunshine and fresh air flooded the kitchen and the arrows was very peaceful without the robinsons and howse present so peaceful that eleanor wondered what it would be like to live here like this foreverif somehow the robinsons would just never return ive thought and ive reasoned and ive looked sarah said aloud startling eleanor as she concentrated on a particularly obtuse paragraph about the hanged man card and much as i hate to admit that im wrongwell im wrong eleanor blinked and stared at her mentor sarah was sitting crosslegged on the floor of the kitchen staring down at a pile of stones with markings on them runestones she called them and she used them not only to try and give her some direction for the future but to try and learn what was going on around her that might be hidden from her if for instance someone was sick enough that he needed to see the medical doctor and not just depend on her herbal remedies there were many country folk who still were suspicious of the doctor and veterinarian and sometimes it took sarah a deal of convincing to get them to go to either gentleman wrong about what eleanor asked it took a lot to get sarah to admit she was wrong about anything she was dreadfully stubborn that way then again she had every right to be ive always said that the big house and the village havent got much of anything to say to each other sarah replied sourly still staring down at her stones still i knew it was an air master that chased off the revenants i knew it couldnt be a local witch no matter how powerful when you told me about it and i was right it turns out shes a guest up there at longacre though and it seems that shes staying the summer and that changes everything an air master eleanor said catching her breath oh granted it wasnt her element but any master could help her more to the point unlike say a constable or any other authority figure any elemental master would know she was telling the truth about alison and what alison had done to her she wouldnt have to try and convince an elemental master that she wasnt mad because she was talking about magic thats what weve needed what youve needed to see if you cant get cut free of your stepmother and her wicked magic and now ive asked the cards the bones and the stones and theyre all saying you need to go up there and meet with that air master in fact they say if you dont well she shook her head itll be bad thats all not just bad for you either the stones reckon alisons got some wicked mischief going thats going to be a trouble no matter what steps are taken to stop her but horrible bad if she isnt stopped sarah looked up her face full of fear i cant tell what it is but at a guess shes let loose some kind of sickness shes earth and thats the sort of thing they do when they go to the bad pestilence and plague sarah bit her lip well the stones say that if you work with that air master and get yourself cut free alison will fall but if you dont shell use you somehow and put more power into whatever it is shes done and the stones dont say how much worse it will be but theyre all showing their bad sides she felt as if hope and fear were at war inside her hope because here was exactly what she needed fear because how could she ever get what she needed with alisons hearthbinding still holding her buti cant get as far as longacre she protested and even if i could i cant just stroll up to even the tradesmans entrance and ask to be introduced to the air master even if she knew the air masters real name especially not looking like a servant she knew better than to go to the front doorshed be turned away in a heartbeat well now thats not necessarily true because you only need to get inside those walls once and talk to her after that if shes worth anything and the stones say she is shell come to you sarah gathered up the stones and poured them into a little leather bag and there is one night coming up when you can walk in the front door and be presented like you were to the manor born provided youre wearing a fancy dress she tilted her head to one side think about it the night of that fancy dress ball if your stepsisters are good enough to be invited you surely are as well eleanors hand flew to her mouth good gad she cried youre right youre exactly right but as quickly as her hopes rose they dropped again where am i going to get an invitation or a costume especially one that will look as if it belongs among people like that ah now what about that attic of yours sarah replied with a lift of her brow i think we ought to take a look up there first before we think about any other possibilities as for the invitation you leave that up to me ill find a way to get you invited eleanor wanted to protest that shed been through all of the chests and had salvaged the only usable garments up there but sarah was already on her feet and marching towards the steps with a sigh of resignation eleanor followed it was easier to move the chests with two of them but it was rather disheartening to see what the moths and time had done to some of the oncebeautiful gowns that had been inside them silk shattered and tore like wet tissue as they lifted gowns out the satins had mostly discolored beadwork fell off the bodices but just as eleanor turned away even though there were older chests and clothespresses waiting certain that they had completely eliminated any possibility of finding anything sarah let out an exclamation of satisfaction what eleanor blurted turning back sarah held up a froth of flounces and lace i knew there should be one of these still good she exclaimed with satisfaction its still a tale in the village how the three girls from broom went up to london and were the belles of the ball the fellow who owned the arrows before your father bought it was just as welloff the wooltrade dye see that and the arrows had been in his family since great harrys day this is a ballgown from the time of victorias coronation all three of the daughters here went down to london on account of some aunt married a title got them all manner of invitations she got them into all the right circles and chaperoned them about for three weeks it must have worked since two of them got husbands out of the journey and but the third never could settle on anyone and ended up back here taking care of her parents when they got old thats who your father bought the house of the daughter who never married curious now eleanor made her way back to where sarah was unpacking the petticoats that went with the gown they remarkably were also still sound the gown was stupefying to one used to the current narrow skirts and minimal or in eleanors case nonexistent corseting she couldnt imagine how much venice lace had gone into trimming the row after row of flounces on the skirt twenty yards thirty the neckline was low enough to make her blush the puffy little flounced sleeves were as tiny as the skirt was huge it was made of some sort of flounces of netting or gauzy stuff in a dark ivory tone over a slightly heavier skirt maybe it had once been pure white and had aged to this color but if so it had done so uniformly youll look a rare treat sarah said giving the gown a good shake this is indian cotton from back in the day when it was dearer than silk ill look a rare guy eleanor retorted but she reached out to touch the delicate lace anyway wondering wistfully if she really could fit into it a moment later she found out at sarahs insistence she was surprised to find that it fit her very well indeed a good thing that they didnt reckon young girls should wear much but flowers or feathers back in the day sarah said looking very pleased cause how i should manage jewels i havent a clue well say youre little princess victoria herself here ive got a nice rosecolored sash off that silk that went to bits thatll take the place of the old one thats gone a bit of cleaning some flowers and a dominomaskyou leave it to me put your hair up and a bit of glamourie even alison wont recognize you eleanor looked down at herself feeling a thrill of excitement and it wasnt because she would finally find a possible mentor or because this might be the chance to plead her case to an elemental master no there was only one thought in her head at the moment reggie will be there and hell see me like thisnot shabby but how am i going to get there she asked as it occurred to her that trying to walk up to longacre in that dress was going to be in impossible proposition ill borrow a cart and horse and put a glamorie on them too sarah said dismissively make them look like a carriage wouldnt pass in daylight but this will be after dark ill be your coachman ill hand you out so nobody gets close enough to see through the glamorie buti still cant get as far as the manor she objected weakly alisons bindingsive tried stretching them and they still only go as far as the meadow you will be able to alison will have her hands full with her girls shell be trying to hide her nature from that air master you can count on it shell be distracted by the ball for an hour or two and working together well be able to stretch those bindings just far enough that night sarah sounded quite sure of herself and eleanor just gave in she had to be right this was eleanors only chance to get some outside help she wanted to see reggie even if he didnt recognize her maybe because he wouldnt recognize her just once she wanted to talk to him and see him look at her the way he would look at any other girl that was his social equal she wanteda memory no matter what happened to her after that night she wanted to have a memory of being a princess at a ball dancing with a handsome knight and allow herself to be just that little bit in love with him youre right she said with a nod if we dont seize this opportunity there may never be another one we have to make it work july london thanks to her friendship with lady devlin the savoy had put the robinsons up in a better suite than usual the girls didnt even have to share a room which made for a little more peace and quiet it certainly impressed warrick locke when he arrived on alisons summons alison saw no need to trouble herself with secrecy today what could be more natural than a meeting with her solicitor since they both happened to be in london the girls were at fittings for their costumes nothing could be more respectable than having him come to her hotel suite in broad daylight with a briefcase full of papers howse was right in the next room though she could have been in this one if alison had wished and neither seen nor heard anything but her book it had taken more than a year but now howse was nicely obedient to alisons will and directions yet still had enough freedom of thought that she performed all of her duties properly just for the sake of verisimilitude locke had a stack of papers on the table the fact that none of those papers concerned her was something no one else would ever find out some of them however concerned eleanor who was the central topic of their conversation eleanor was a loose end that alison very much wanted tidied up before there was a wedding in the offing it would be harder to dispose of her quietly when one was connected to the fenyxes of longacre park but locke still had no better plan than the old one even though hed had weeks to think of alternatives alison was extremely disappointed in him normally he was full of ideas but he seemed terribly fixated on this one perhaps it was because of his own personal obsessions but if that was indeed the case the sooner he got them under control the better i tell you warrick no matter how much you like your plan to break that wretched girls mind it is too complicated alison objected whats more it relies too much on that man of yours as well as bringing in possible confederates i know you trust him but every time you add a person to a plan you double the chances of something being said or done at the wrong time and either ruining the whole thing or giving the plan away or worse still youve added the danger of having your confederate decide to betray you warrick locke frowned robbie has been working with me for a very long time now frankly if you are concerned about him doing something other than what he has been ordered to do i can tell you that in all the time that i have known him he has never once had an original idea for himself its too complicated a plan alison countered throttling down her rising irritation with him there are too many things that can go wrong including that the wretched child just might be tougherminded than you think the closer i come to reaching my goals the less i like complicated plans i find that the more i have to lose the less inclined i am to take chances on something that might work and the whole house of cards you wish to construct has far too many points of possible failure for my comfort its the only idea that has any chance at all of giving you the results you want he replied with ill grace if she dies you lose because the inheritance goes to the cousin if she disappears you lose because until shes proven dead you cant touch her money and when shes proven dead the inheritance goes to the cousin if she stays sane and attains her majority you lose because sooner or later the trustees are going to want to see her to turn her fortune over to her and then theres no telling what will happen if you injure her physically to the point that she cant care for herself you still lose because doctors will be involved and someone will find out that youve been making a slave of her and making free with her inheritance the only way you win is if you keep her alive and drive her so completely mad that she withdraws into herself and never comes out again that means breaking her will her spirit and her mind and theres only one way that i know for certain to do that after all its not as if you can drop her down a hole and be done with her wait a moment she said with a sudden surge of interest and a jolt of euphoria as his words caused an interesting image to flash across her mind she caught and held that image quickly extrapolated something from it and then smiled slowly you just might have something warrick you might just have solved the conundrum pardon he blinked at her caught offguard by her words you said something very interesting you said that i couldnt just drop her down a hole and be done with it her smile broadened but that just might be exactly what we want to do with her theres more than one way to get the results we want from her now he was completely confused that much was very plain i thought the best plan was to break her mind be patient with me what was the first spell i put on her to bind her to the hearth correct she nodded as he frowned so this has kept her confined to the house and grounds she cant go off on her own that binding was intended to keep her from looking for help but that same binding spell may serve us in another way if she were to be taken away from the hearth carried off somewhere she would have to try and make her way back no matter what obstacles were in her path or do you remember how i constructed the bindings because i certainly do im not sure i see where this is going but i believe the geas you put on her forces her to try and keep trying to make her way back to the arrows and the longer shes away the more of her mind becomes obsessed with the need to return until she cant even eat or sleep shes so driven by and consumed with that need now his frown looked as if he was beginning to see the shape of something but hadnt yet deciphered the puzzle she had set him she helped him out with some clues warwickshire is full of abandoned coal mines lady devlin was just complaining about one of them last weekits collapsing evidently and causing subsidence on the property of one of her friends spoiling a good meadow now suppose just suppose that we were to drop her down one of those then report that she has gone missing as we always intended to do the first thing and only thing she would try to do is return to the hearth driven by her growing obsession and if we took care to drop her into one where she couldnt climb out where the tunnels run from the entrance towards broom can you see what would happen his frown deepened ithink so alison sat forward in her chair leaning towards him she will have to follow the pull of the geas which means she would be forced to penetrate deeper into the mine until she could go no further without lights without anything to help her she nodded as his eyes widened with understanding think of that alone in the dark and possibly injured she comes to a dead end she cant retrace her steps because the spell wont let her go back she cant go on because shes at a dead end shes hungry thirsty and more and more of her mind is taken up with the obsession to return now just to add something to ensure that we get the results we want a mine is in the earth and whats more its in violated earth which means the elementals associated with it are all of my sort so if trying to claw her way through coalbearing rock with her bare hands isnt enough to drive her mad my little friends can take care of that problem by pushing her over the edge of sanity little monsters with glowing eyes appearing and vanishing in the dark things gibbering and drooling on her cold hands clutching at her plucking at her clothing it would take a stronger mind than she has to come out of that intact but you need to have her in your custody in order to keep control of her inheritance locke objected she was already prepared for the objection and i can do that i merely wait a day or so then nudge a rescue party to the right coal mine and allow them to find her fear thirst hunger constant attack by gnomes and kobolds and the geasif she has any mind left after fortyeight hours of that i will be shocked and amazed by that time i imagine the only thing well need to worry about is replacing her with a servant she did sigh at that it was getting impossible to find servants that werent thieves drunks or both with so many women getting much better wages and shorter hours by taking the places of men than they could ever obtain as servants only the dregs were left on the other hand once the business of eleanor is settled perhaps the answer would be simply to use magical coercions on whatever i can get i pity any thief that tries to purloin anything from my house or perhaps she could take someone feebleminded from the workhouse the same coercions that kept eleanor scrubbing and tending should work on the feebleminded locke gazed at her with astonishment my hat is off to you i would not have thought of any of that i hesitate to call anything a perfect plan but this one is as close to perfect as a reasonable person could wish i assume youll put her to sleep to make her easier to handle probably alison agreed i wouldnt even need to use a spell if i didnt want to a little chloroform on a sponge would do the trick more reliably renewable than a spell too locke murmured admiringly and costs nothing in power you could even do it with your daughters simply wait until the girl has gone to sleep go up to her room administer the sponge and there will not even be a struggle she did not ask how he knew that presumably he had some experience in such matters as i told you i prefer simple plans she replied feeling so pleased with her own ideas that she was willing to be very pleasant to the man and it does occur to me that when this works ill be needing to find some place safe and secure to put the afflicted child i scarcely intend to keep her at home the present servant problem is bad enough without trying to find someone to care for and stand guard over a madwoman i presume that youve been looking into such things discreetly i assure you and mentioning no names he responded immediately and dug into his case for a file and here are the best places i foundquite discreet very understanding about the need to keep someone alive and healthy but once a patient is checked in they dont ever emerge she smiled and leaned over the table to examine the tastefully subdued brochures on his own ground locke was knowledgeable and immensely helpful she would definitely keep him around a while longer especially now that he realized she didnt need him to come up with better plans than he could it would make him a little on edge and anxious not to get on her bad side because she was after all a most generous client july longacre park warwickshire lady devlin was a very oldfashioned hostess and that meant she believed in doing things the oldfashioned way she was writing out every one of the invitations for the ball herself since she no longer had a secretary to tend to such things for her the estate manager could probably have done it for her but she claimed that she was enjoying it after a while out of sheer guilt reggie elected to help her his onceneat copperplate handwriting was gone all to hell of course with lack of practice but it was good enough to address envelopes which was tedious but saved his mother the effort of writing out the addresses and allowed her to concentrate on the aesthetics of producing the invitations they couldnt be printed alas perhaps the middleclass found invitations where one filled in missing names and dates acceptable but no one of lady devlins stature would even consider resorting to such a stratagem besides many of them required a certain level of personalization in the form of a note it did allow him to sit down without looking like a malingerer it also gave him a chance to find out who the girls were that would be pursuing him at this little hunt disguised as a party roberta and leva cygnet not much of a surprise there they were already coming to teas and tennisparties mrs regina towner thoughregina towner he asked casually do i know the towners an old friend from school his mother replied just as casually right enough mothers age which means her daughter is probably my age mr robert and mrs tansy esq and daughter so ginger will be in the howling pack good gad i hope some of my lads come through i need all the distractions i can muster and ginger likes to dance some of the next few were innocuous enough then lt commander matthew mann the hon mrs matthew mann miss mann ah good gad the brigadiers granddaughter and mama is an hon ive never seen an hon that wasnt on the hunt for a title for the family well the brigadier warned me vicountess arabella reed one of lady virginias friends she was a chatterbox but at least she didnt have any daughters then at last the run of invitations that he hoped would save himpilotsintraining at the school headquartered at oxford and lads he knew either were on leave or could get it even a cadet was a second lieutenant and while mamas were on the hunt for titles daughters were easily distracted by officers dressuniforms second lt michael freed second lt david jackson at reading lt vincent paul mills good gad i hope he doesnt get shot to bits before this thing comes off that handsome face will be even more of a distraction than his uniform captain michael dolbeare good thing hes training the lads at oxford hes a got enough medals at this point to sink him if he fell in the river and the girls cant resist the shiny lt allen mcbain arm in a sling but even if he cant dance hes another handsome devil that scots burr though the girls will giggle over it and make him blush which is entertaining as well as a distraction now the oxford lot second lt john oliver second lt charles goddard second lt lyman evansat least they arent losing a flyingstudent a day the way they were at the start of the war or half my invitations would never get answered of course turner had made sure that the names he had given reggie were of the better students who had less chance of cracking up that was a concern ambulances were stationed at the students fields because they were by heaven needed the accident rate was appalling the deathrate even more so the rumpetys killed more lads than combat did thank cod for the gosport system things had changed since he was a cadet now there was a logical system in place for training still back in his day there were always several dozen crashes a day when the weather permitted and the planes were up usually one cadet died a day and several more were injured not so bad now though cant afford to lose that many in training i suppose took those old men long enough to figure that out he shook off the shakes that threatened him as he remembered some of those crashes fortunately his sojourn at the school as a cadet had been mercifully short he already knew how to fly and didnt take long to prove it captain william robert howe cant do without him hes bringing the band thanks to the brigadier this was a regular infantry band though they had played for the rfc that would give some of the fbi a thrill coming up to a country house to play captain howe was the officer in charge and the bandleader all in one and the brigadier claimed single another alternate target for the husbandhunters fbi he might be and less glamorous than a pilot but he was a captain captain steven stewart and hed damned well better get leave steve had pledged on his life hed come tommy had sworn hed see to it tommy had incentive was getting a case of whiskey from the longacre cellars if steve did make it lt commander geoffrey cockburn and if he puts his auto in the pond again ill make him go in after it captain christopher whitmore and he had better not bring all that photographic paraphernalia with him both had been chums of his at college geoff was a tearaway chris studious both still single and not at all unhandsome yet more fodder for the husbandhunters with luck hed get a word with them ahead of time so they could help keep the harpies off heres the uniformed lot mater he said with relief putting his stack beside the rest of the finished envelopes ah good she replied absently here theres just a few more of the local people be a dear and do them would you mrs and mrs donald hinshaw the vicar and his wife doctor and mrs robert sutherland and then mrs alison robinson miss danbridge miss carolyn danbridge miss eleanor robinson eleanor for a moment his mind went blank then it refocused again eleanor robinson his eleanor she was thatwomans daughter but how was that possible mater whos this eleanor robinson he asked casually or at least as casually as he could manage oh shes just dear alisons stepdaughter his mother said indifferently the vicar reminded me about her or at least i think it was the vicar someone did anyway shes supposed to be at oxford so i suppose shes a terrible bluestocking not to come home for the summer but it wouldnt do not to invite her even if she doesnt come shes supposed to be at oxford but he felt as if hed been poleaxed he was so stunned there was certainly no monetary reason why she shouldnt be at universitythat woman spent money as freely as his own mother did and it was common knowledge she was welloff so there should be no trouble with the fees for that matter given how alison robinson spent lavishly why was eleanor always so shabbylooking why did she have hands like a charwoman what was going on there and the next question how do i find out if i cant get near eleanor in the first place july longacre park warwickshire reggie had decided on carolyn as the most likely to let something about eleanor dropshe clearly was not the more intelligent of the sisters though neither of them were a match for their mother but he still was going to tread very cautiously around her he didnt want to alert any of the three to the fact that he knew their stepsister was somewhere in broom in fact he didnt want to alert them to the fact that he had met her more than once it had taken a great deal of willpower not to limp down to his motor and take it right to the door of the arrows that day when he had addressed an invitation to her and only the fact that so very much was ringing false had kept him from doing so there was a great deal more than met the eye going on he had a notion that he might eventually want lady virginias help on this but not until he had investigated all other courses of action himself a tennis match presented the best opportunity his mother was playing against hers and he brought her a lemonade as a pretext for sitting next to her after some noncommittal chat he managed to steer the conversation towards oxford and asked as if in afterthought ohdont you have a sister there she jerked as if shed been stung by a bee and stared at him wideeyed if he hadnt known there was something wrong before this he would have by her reaction he knew guilt when he saw it a sister eleanor he prompted it occurred to me that the only robinsons in broom had a daughter named eleanor before the war i remember talking to her about going to oxfordshe had her heart set on it and was taking the examinations in order to qualify oheleanor her brittle laugh rang entirely false shes only my stepsister not a real sister i scarcely think of her at all actually were practically strangers her smile was too bright and she looked very nervous to him he fancied that eleanor was nowhere near as much of a stranger as she was pretending he smiled slightly or rather stretched his lips in something like a smile i suppose for forms sake we ought to invite her to the ball too it isnt done to leave out one sister of three people might talk again that brittle laugh oh you can if you like but i shouldnt trouble myself shed never come shes a dreadful bluestocking and she never even comes home on the vacs i dont think she knows such things as balls exist she certainly doesnt know how to dress shed never leave herstudiesfor anything that frivolous he leaned back in his chair he hadnt missed that moment of hesitation when she had sought for a word to describe what eleanor was doing he yawned oh well in that case if you think she wont feel slighted the vicar suggested to mater that she ought to be included on the guest list is all oh the girls voice grew hard and just a touch cold the vicar was it no i really shouldnt bother if i were you ill make sure mother reminds the vicar of how much eleanor dislikes leaving oxford i suppose shell be a don once they allow such things he made a sound like a laugh its not as if there wont be a surfeit of young ladies to dance with too many of them are likely to be wallflowers as it is unless i can bring some more cadets from the rfc up to scratch i think we can do without her so do i she swiftly turned the subject to costumes and whether he thought it would be too warm for eighteenthcentury court dress wouldnt an empire gown be cooler she asked i should think so he replied and besides itd be deuced difficult to dance in those sidethings that stick outwhatyoucallems panniers she said with immense satisfaction lauralee wouldnt hear of anything but being madame pompadour but i thought empress josephine would be far more elegant and cooler well there i agree with you but dont tell her that he said in a confidential tone of voice id rather dance with a girl who can move about in her costume than have to steer some wire contraption around the floor she giggled and agreed he thought he had effectively distracted her from the subject of her sister as he continued talking with her to make sure she had forgotten his question in her flutter of excitement about his attentions he digested what he had learned well now he knew this much at least he knew that eleanor was alisons stepdaughter and he knew that they were for some reason keeping alive a fiction that she was at oxford it was clear that she wasntbut the question was what was she doing in broom his assumption that she had fallen on hard times was obviously wrong but why was she dressed like an inferior servant and clearly doing menial labor he worried at the problem for the rest of the day through tea while he dressed for dinner and all through dinner it made for a quiet meal but his aunt more than made up for his silence and his mother was so full of her entertainment plans that they didnt really notice that he wasnt talking much how was it that neither the vicar nor the doctor were aware that eleanor is at oxford was a complete fiction surely if she had been strolling around broom someone would have noticed and said something and she certainly wasnt transporting herself to their meadow by magic carpet none of this was making much sense after dinner he went out on the terrace with a drink the brigadier joined him as they watched the sun set the sky ablaze with red gold and purple the last rays of the setting sun making streaks across the horizon it looked like a turner painting you would never know there was a war from here the old man said at last and reggie thought he sounded wistful must admit i was dubious about this brouhaha your mother set her heart on butit wont be bad to forget for a little while and pretend like children playing truant from school reggie replied with bitter longing but it wont go away but we can rest our minds from it for a little surely without feeling guilty the brigadier sipped his brandy well all put on our dominoes and pretend that outside the walls of longacre it is we can even persuade ourselves for a little that our lost and absent friends are out there in the crowd too and as long as the masks are being worn we can hold to the illusion is that so wrong yes he wanted to say yes because the ones that havent been killed by the idiotic strategies of old men fighting a war with last centurys tactics are out there putting their lives at risk because those same old men are so certain that what they want is gods will that they wont admit they are wrong or that what they are doing is a hideous horrible mistake but he didnt say it in part because he knew that although the brigadier agreed with him in his heart he could never admit it aloud and in part because it would only hurt that good old man further sometimesone needs illusions he said carefully and left it at that illusions so much of what was going on here was an illusion not just this country weekend and the ball but everything on this side of the channel no one wanted to talk about the war anymore or think about it even except those who had been in it the topics that seemed to obsess most people had nothing whatsoever to do with the war except as the war had caused the problems and that drove him mad sometimes he wanted to wake them up drag them forcibly down to the hospitals and show them the shellshocked and the maimed to make them care force them to understand what this war was doing was he in the wrong then to want to break into the comfortable illusions and shout at them all that their petty little concerns over their comforts the shortage of servants the rationed food were selfish selfcentered and disgusting to him that over there in france that sound like thunder that came over the channel when the wind was right was the sound of people dying and it was time they woke up and acknowledged it but he wanted to forget it toopart of him was so tired of it all that he was sick with longing for it to just stop to go away and take all his memories with it he turned his mind back to the problem of eleanor with a feeling almost of relief it was something to think about that was not the war and part of him deeply sympathized with the brigadier like those nights when he would lie in his bed at the hospital and recite poem after poem in his head to keep from thinking about what was out there in the dark waiting for him to fall asleep because you could only think about the war and what it was doing to you and your mates for so long before you started going mad eleanor robinson should have been at oxford and was not and it was not for lack of money in her family and in fact from all appearances she was working as a servant why oh why had she not told him herself what was wrong pride for that matter why had her father married a scheming creature like alison she vamped him i suppose like her daughters are trying to vamp me i suppose if youve never been vamped before it would be easy to succumb when would that have been he tried to reckon up the last time he had seen her it was before the war before he joined the rfc so at some point between then and the start of the war her father had remarried hed done some checking and her father had died at some time around the first christmas of the war so why had his daughter not been at oxford at that point had alison persuaded the besotted new husband that it was unnecessary to give a girl a university education or had she pled the war as an excuse claiming she needed eleanor at home just how besotted had he been to deny his only child her one dream he must have been caught like a salmon in a net and then just as the last of the sun sank below the horizon it struck him what if her father had altered his will in favor of the new wife before he went off to the war it was just the sort of thing that alison would have insisted on he was sure of it manipulative creature that she was she would have promised ever so sweetly that she would take as good care of eleanor as of her own daughters so why shouldnt her dear new husband not change his will to make her sole inheritor after all leaving flighty young girls anything directly was generally a bad idea who could guess what they would do with their inheritance and of course there were always cads who would romance them for their money then waste it and leave them penniless and deserted he stared into the growing darkness as beside him the brigadier lit up a cigarette the end of it glowed as he pursued that line of thought to its logical conclusion so assume that was precisely what had happened then her father had died in the first months of the war leaving her entirely at the mercy of her stepmother a woman who clearly despised her then what what was she doing here dressed like a servant well what were her choices to leaveand do what she wasnt suited to anything but marriage and if shed had a sweetheart in the village he doubted that she would have been so keen to go to university there was a sad truth to her condition she had no skills with which to support herself she hadnt enough education to become a governess she hadnt the money to train as a nurse and although she could have gone as a vad no one could really live on the tiny stipend that was allotted to the volunteers in the beginning she wouldnt have had the stamina for a factory job and the land girls hadnt been formed until later that would have left her with only one option to remain at home at the mercy of her stepmother who must have seen her as a ready source of free labor and put her to work as a servant which explained why she was dressed like one now her own pride would have kept her hidden from the village and her stepmother would never have admitted she had treated her own stepdaughter so shabbily and so the fiction of eleanor is at oxford was born with both sides of the situation eager to maintain it his left hand clutched at the stone balustrade and he downed the last of his drink and set the glass down lest he inadvertently shatter it in his sudden fit of anger perhaps it was absurd to be so angry over what was essentially a teacup tragedy when there were so many greater tragedies in the wake of this war she wasnt dead after all merely illused she hadnt been struck by a stray bullet and paralyzed not blown to pieces by a shell but feelings he reminded himself were not rational and this shabby treatment of a girl whod done nothing to earn it made him very very angry he could see how it was that no one noticed that she was still here especially if she herself took pains to conceal the fact and no one ever really looked at anyone in servants clothing especially not someone dressed as shabbily as eleanor was so on the rare occasions when she escaped her work for a little so long as she kept her head down which everyone would expect anyway out of a lower servantno one would recognize her he didnt recall that she had socialized much with the girls her age anyway it had been the boys that had congregated around his aeroplane that knew her best boys who were all long gone in the first weeks of the war perhaps the adultsthe adult women anywaymight have noticed but in those first weeks and months they had more than enough cares of their own to preoccupy them the longer the charade went on the less likely it would be that anyone would see the face of the clever schoolgirl in the visage of the workhardened young woman that had to be it the question now waswhat could he do about it and to that question he had no ready answer for a start how could he even get to her to talk to her helping her would mean prying her out of her imprisoning shell the walls of the arrows and at the moment he had no good idea of how to do that once he did that he also had no good idea of how to offer help without it seeming like charity and pity and he had a fairly good idea of what she would think about charity and pity at least he thought he did penny for your thoughts the brigadier said out of the darkness startling him from his concentration id have to give you hapence change brigadier he replied mendaciously i wasnt thinking about much the old man chuckled lets go in then he suggested the damp isnt doing either of us any good probably not he agreed i was thinking of going down to the village anyway and im for my book and bed the brigadier replied its peaceful out here i shall take my rest while i can get it they parted company on the terrace reggie limping his way down to the stable to get his motorcar he decided that he would see what he could learn by steering the conversation in the broom around to the robinsons it would be natural enough what with the arrows being almost directly across the street and that would be a good place to start july broom warwickshire sarah looked so triumphant when eleanor arrived just before midnight that eleanor could not in good conscience deny her the pleasure of revealing whatever it was that had put that smug smile on her face she hoped it was good news because today had been particularly brutal the amount of work that shed been laden with would have laid her out four years ago shed almost been too tired to come here tonight and really all that had gotten her out the door was the promise of eventual freedom it is a very good thing that no one would ever entrust you with a state secret because you could never conceal the fact that you had a secret in the first place she told her mentor as she picked up her mothers notebook to begin her exercises took a deep breath and concentrated on getting her second wind she and sarah were focusing on one thing now to extend the length of her leash so that she could attend the fancydress ballthough how she was going to get inside the doors of the manor at longacre park without an invitation she had no notion there was no chance that one would come for her now lauralee carolyn and alison had long since gotten theirs and the girls took every chance they could get to take out the precious piece of creamlaid vellum and flourish it about their acquaintancesone could hardly call them friends anymorein the village were eaten up with envy the only other villagers who had gotten invitations were the vicar and his wife and the doctor and his with this alone alison had made it wordlessly clear how much higher her social stature was in the tiny circle of broom that in fact she had escaped the social circle of broom for another more rarified atmosphere she had of course cleverly feigned confusion to discover that no one else had achieved similar invitations and unlike her daughters who might be excused such behavior on the grounds of their callow youth she did not make much of it after that initial flurry of exquisitely acted discomfiture in this way even though she had without doubt made some real enemies among the village elite none of them would dare come out actively and openly against her the ladies still came to her teas and her wareffort gatheringsthough with all of the invitations up to the manor those were becoming infrequent but she presided over them with the absent air of a queen who has other concerns than the petty ones of her subjects eleanor had hoped that somehow someone would remember her existence and include her in the joint invitation but no one had it had read mrs alison robinson miss danbridge and miss carolyn danbridge not even a hint of eleanor she had almost given up at that moment but it did occur to her that sarah might know a way of slipping her in somehowor perhaps even was planning to forge an invitation granted she wouldnt be on the guest list but perhaps no one would check that or if they did she could claim she was part of alison robinson and daughters or perhaps sarah meant for her to slip in through the gardens though how she was to do that in an enormous ballgown eluded her she settled herself at sarahs old agedarkened kitchen table her brazier in front of her a salamander already lying coiled in the coals without needing to be summoned here you are just as i promised sarah said handing over a plain envelope that contained a creamlaid vellum one thatno mistake was identical to the one in alisons middle deskdrawer the outer one was addressed to sarah but the inner to eleanor herself at an oxford address somerville college to be exact she gazed at it in blank astonishment she already knew what it contained of course her invitation to the ball but how was all she could manage sarah actually winked i have my ways she said a little word tosomeonewho kindly reminded her ladyship that miss robinson was away at oxford as the invitations were picked up to be given to the postman so she rewrote the robinson invitations on the spot and then afellow follower of the ancient ways not an elemental master who is she hesitated well ill only say this she has every reason to be at somerville and she chose somerville because it is the womens college that has no religious requirements that might conflict with her own faith eleanor gaped at her feeling her eyes going rounder with every passing moment oh dont look at me like that sarah laughed i told you there were more of us than youd ever guess at any rate she intercepted your invitation and reposted it to me thats all you are on the guest list and you have a genuine invitation so if i were you i would stop staring and get back to my exercises or on the day you wont be able to get as far as the front gate she plucked the invitation from eleanors nerveless fingers and ill keep that safe here no point in risking having it found and youll have to come to me to dress anyway now its time to work not daydream it was difficult to concentrate on the tedious mechanics of a spell which amounted to telling something very stupid and slow over and over that a boundary wasnt where it had been originally set doing so when your arms and shoulders ached from all the fetching and carrying youd done and your legs from all the trips up and down the stairs was even harder magic she had come to understand was largely a means by which the magician imposed her will on the world and made the world conform to it that sounded very simple and in theory it wasor would be if there was a simple world to deal with and only one magician in it the problem was that there were a great many other things a few of them also magical in nature that were also imposing their will on the world ways had to be found to get the results one wanted with the least interference with everything else some interference was inevitable meddling with things made ripples and disturbed other things it wasnt just that one didnt want to disrupt other things that were going on out of courtesyor fear of reprisal it was that when one did interfere unduly there were consequences everything one did magically had a cascading effect like the little pebble that starts an avalanche sometimes of course one could stop the cascade before things became serious but you had to be aware of consequences to do that you had to look for the things you might change and include them in your plan you had to try and think of things that werent obvious consequences and responsibilities that called to mind the purview of the high priest the magician most of all the hermit who moved slowly and only after studying all the possible ramifications of his actions one of those ramifications was that when things were jarred into new patterns there were sometimesthingsthat took notice different creatures for each element the ones for earth were the trolls and giants for fire the wyverns and firedrakes entirely different species than true dragons for water it was the leviathans and for air the wendigo they were not very bright but they were very powerful very dangerous and always always hungry what they ate was the lifeforce of magicians one did not want to attract their notice even alison moved cautiously to avoid attracting trolls and giants so the smaller ones footprint of influence was the better alison had gotten away with as much use of magic as she had because she had confined it mostly to one single personeleanor hedging one person in with spells did not make much of an effect on the rest of the world now it was eleanors turn and the best course of action now seemed to be to work on the spells already in existence that meant at the moment persuading the spell that kept pulling her back to the hearth that it had never been meant to call her back when she went beyond the grounds of the arrowsthat instead its boundary was much farther it would return to its previous state when she took her attention off it of course but that didnt happen at once and in fact the more she worked at this the longer she had before it reverted the village was very quiet at this time of night a dog barked out in the distance and nearer at hand the trees rustled as a breeze tumbled among their leaves inside there was only the pop and crackle of the small fire in the fireplace and the sound of their breathing i think sarah said when she had been working at her spellcasting for the better part of an hour that if we could just find a way to dig up your finger and destroy it that would break the spell eleanor slowly released the spell she had been manipulating she could see it in her head like a cats cradle of lines of magical power it remained as she had left it and she turned her attention to sarah who was watching her with solemn eyes theyd had this discussion before but youre still not sure eleanor said flatly she looked across the table into sarahs eyes and saw what she expected to see once again sarah had attempted to unravel the complexities of the spells around eleanor and once again she had not been able to decipher them sarah shook her head im not powerful enough to read all those spells shes tangled up around you i just cant keep them separate in my mind i think destroying the finger would break them all but theres a chance that destroying the finger would make them bind more tightly im not willing to take that risk she replied with a frown if i can achieve the sun thats the card of freedom and problems solved and its a fire card ill have the knowledge the wisdom and the power to use justices sword and i can cut myself free of the spellbindings she paused a moment and added they say its a simple card if i can pass through it soon she didnt specify what she meant by soon she had eight more cards to pass through before she reached the sun she had yet to face death or even the hanged man truth to be told she didnt want to face either but it had to be done the hermit had not been as frightening or as difficult as she had thought but the wheel of fortune had been terrifying one wouldnt think that an abstract concept like that would be frightening but but it hadnt been abstract it had been the whole world up there looming in a sky that was half storm and half calm with terrible energies crackling through it all and the realization that a single turn of the wheel could set random factors into motion that could doom all her plans and even as she had gazed up at it in awefor it had looked nothing at all like the card except in that it was a wheel or at least wheelshapedshe had felt herself and all the world coming apart then returning together again in what she came to understand was a cycle of creation and destruction of death and rebirth and she had grasped things for that moment that she couldnt even begin to articulate now but evidently she had grasped them correctly for the huge looming wheel settled and a little more knowledge and power settled into her mind and she was given to understand that she had passed this test too so it was understandable that at this moment she really didnt want to think what the death card was going to be like it would have been easier on her nerves if the card had been called transfiguration or something of the sort sarah gave her an odd look this isnt the path i would have seen you taking she said at last your mother was always so impatient the fire in her wanting to take things quickly which isnt always a good idea i think perhaps this business of using the tarot to teach me was the best thing that could have happened to me eleanor grimaced and rubbed the joint of her right thumb with her left hand easing a little ache there much though i would like to make things happen faster im learning about the strengths and weaknesses of the other three elements as i go and i hope that means i wont be as vulnerable she didnt have to say aloud what she was thinkingthat if her mother had known more about the strengths and weaknesses of the antagonistic element of water she might not have died she knew sarah was thinking the same thing by the faint expression of regret mixed with other emotions too fleeting to catch but one of them was pridepride in the daughter who was perhaps a little wiser than her mother youre learning was all sarah said i bloody well hope sol eleanor snapped with a little show of fire temperament quickly throttled before it could have any other effect and before you say it i will say it for you back to work we have only a fortnight and i have a lot of progress to make before then sarah only nodded ill do it because i have to theres no going back now august longacre park warwickshire on july the th the british had begun a major offensive at ypres like most of britain reggie only got wind that something was afoot when the regrets began to come in and he hadnt thought much of it at first until today today the post was full of them one or two officers canceling would have been a flukeall of them at once meant a big push when even the band canceled by the morning post momentarily throwing his mother into a state of despair until lady virginia came to the rescue promising a small orchestra made up entirely of women he had known that there was something truly major going on he and his old college chums steve and geoff had a sort of unwritten code by the afternoon post when both of them sent brief notes referring to caesars campaigns in gaul along with their apologies he had all the information he needed and far more than he wanted the brigadier and his mother had tried to keep it from him of course but by late afternoon it had been in all the papers hed managed to keep himself together long enough to send a hasty telegram to michael dolbeare to recruit more rfc cadets to make up the difference pledging to cover their train fare if need be which considerably calmed his mother down about the holes in her guest list that had been going through the motions actually because if he had thought about it he might have lost his temper with her how could she be in such a state over a mere absence of male guests when across the channel all hell was breaking loose bad enough that other people were being so callous but this was his own mother and hed been all right until just before dinner until it hit him until it really sank in then the shakes had started he kept himself together until he managed to reach the safe haven of his rooms he even managed to pull his own curtains closed and shut and lock the door then the fear got hold of him by the throat and shook him like a dog sending him to his knees making him crawl into the darkest corner of the room where he shivered and wept and choked back moans of terror he couldnt even put two ideas together into a whole he didnt even know what he was afraid of he only knew that this vast insensate and ravenous beast that was the war was loose and it was going to devour the entire world and there was nothing he could do to stop it he had vaguely heard someone pacing outside his rooms rattling the knob once or twice but they left him alone for which he was both grateful and felt betrayed at the same time grateful because he could not bear anyone seeing him like this betrayed because they were leaving him alone with this fear this mindkilling soulshriveling fear and all he could do was huddle and shake as wave after wave of the terror engulfed him then ebbed only to return how long he was in there he couldnt have told only that some time after darkness fell there was the sound of a key in the lock and the unmistakable presence in the room of lady virginia she closed the door behind her he heard the scratch of a match and smelled the sharp sulfur as she lit candles reggie she said quite as calmly as if he was not huddled in a ball in the corner i am not doctor maya but i am very old and i have seen a very great deal in my time and if you can manage to bring yourself here i may be able to offer you some little comfort i should come down there on the floor next to you but my bones are not so young that they permit any such thing anymore somehow he managed to crawl out of that corner somehow he managed to get to her and put his head on her knee like a spaniel and croak out a few words he wasnt even sure what he was saying only that he was giving some shape to the fear that was devouring him alive i cannot tell you that it will be all right reggie she said gravely because we both know that it will not but if the brigadier is correct and i believe he is then the enemy is as battleweary and worn as we and he has no flood of energetic americans coming at last to help it will not end soonbut it will end and she offered silence at the right moment and a few more words of her own at the right moment and slowly he stopped shaking the fear lost its grip on him and the fog lifted from his mind until he could think again only then did she call his man in and he took his drugs and went into a mercifully dreamless sleep and they did not come for him in the night he sensed no malign presence on the other side of his barrier of slumber nor did he hear evil mutterings nor feel the suffocating weight on him of the darker creatures of earth trying to smother him in his sleep it might have been the drugs it might have been his new defenses it might all have been due to lady virginia when he struggled up out of sleep late the next morning it was with no sense of victory though and not even anything he could call hope it was if anything a feeling that he might actually live through the despair he still wasnt entirely sure he wanted to but he felt as if he would regardless of his current preferences it was the brigadier who was with him the next time the fit took him later that afternoon they were outside on the terrace and his knees just gave out the brigadier got him to a seat saying nothing although he could not have missed how hard reggie was shaking nor the blank drymouthed stare reggie knew he must have and the good old man stayed with him as he closed his eyes and fought the fear as best he couldwhich was about as effective as trying to fight the sea after the first wave ebbed a little the brigadier cleared his throat apologetically and began talking sounding a bit selfconscious but determined nevertheless he didnt actually talk to reggie instead he rambled on about commonplace things hed been down to broom and met some of the lads at the broom pub and they were good fellows to be sure he thought there might be something in the manner of work he could put in the way of one or two of them that were at loose ends it was a fine little village and hed also been to the estate village of arrow which was a credit to him and his mother the estate manager wanted him to know that the crops were looking very good this year and that someone wanted to bring in another gasworks like the one that supplied longacre and broom but this time on manor property filthy things gasworks but there was plenty of coal near here and that would mean there could be gas piped in to the village of arrow as well which might be worth the mess perhaps one of the clever rfc fellows could find a way to make a gasworks less filthy we have gas laid on the brigadier rumbled at my bungalow deuced convenient for cook thinking about electricity they electrified my club in london last year and its better than gas you ought to consider having the telephone brought up here reggie good for your mother keep her connected to the rest of us have to go forward my boy cant live in the past and if you try and stick in one spot the future will run over the top of you not a word about the war not a word about how he looked and under the paralysis of fear that made his guts go to water he knew he must look hellish not one word of reproach though the poor old man must surely wonder or perhaps not lady virginia had said hed been to the front itself to the hospitals where men were brought in filthy screaming their wounds crawling with maggots their minds as shattered as their bodies maybe he did understand but it was the commonplaces that were anchoring him little by little back in the simple present the count of new calves the state of the orchards thoughts of gasworks and electricity the talk down at the broom it dragged him back out of the pit though he could not have said how or why it let him get his breath back let him unclench his fists and his jaw let him sit in the wake of what proved to be the last wave of fear and turned his shaking into the mere trembling of exhaustion and when he was finally able to think again let him turn back to the brigadier with eyes that held sanity again the old man paused in his rambling gave him a long hard look and sighed ah there you are her ladyship said you might get taken like that yes reggie said thank you sir only three words but he put a world of gratitude in them and the brigadier flushed a little and coughed selfdeprecatingly think i can leave you now he asked reggie nodded work to do sir you reminded me of it yourself just now the brigadier nodded with evident relief work theres the ticket he said with a shade too much enthusiasm so much so that reggie felt sorry for him you concentrate on work my boy its the best thing for you keep your mind set on solid things the brigadiers determinedly cheerful expression made reggie attempt a feeble smile of his own at least he doesnt think im feigning or malingering he thought as the brigadier retired to the house that meant a great dealmore in fact than he had expected the brigadier did not think less of him because he was shellshocked that helped enough that he did muster enough strength to get to his own feet again and go in search of his estate manager maybe the brigadier was right after all maybe keeping himself occupied would work it wasnt as if there wasnt a lot to be done guests would be arriving in two days there was only one way to find out august broom warwickshire poor howses hair was coming down from its careful arrangement on the top of her head bits of it were straggling down in front of her ears and her face was red and damp with exertion she looked as if she was going to wilt at any moment and eleanor felt ready to scream between the two of them lauralee and carolyn could have used a dozen maids to get them into their costumes instead of only two lauralee in her madame pompadour garb had petticoats and panniers underskirts and overskirts a corset that pushed her breasts up until they looked like a pair of hard little apples and a bodice cut so low that they were threatening to pop out at any moment alison had taken one look at that particular part of the display and ordered that a fichu of lace be inserted and tacked in place to prevent a disaster which meant more work as lauralee fidgeted and shrieked every time she thought a needle was passing too close to her skin and when all that was taken care of came the white powdered wig the patches to be pasted on and all the rest of it carolyns guise of empress josephine looked deceptively simple and at least it didnt require a winch to pull the lacings of her corset tight but the requisite hairstyle with its grecianinspired diadem and tiny tightcurled ringlets done up in imitation of ancient statues had howse nearly in despair she had two burns on her hands from the curling tongs already and there had been one accident that had caused carolyn to slap the hapless maid and which had left the bedroom reeking of scorched hair fortunately only the very ends had been scorched howse had been able to trim out the ruined bit to carolyns satisfaction alison had elected to wear the strangest costume of all so far as eleanor was concernedand it gave her the most peculiar and uneasy feeling when she saw it alisons costume was a hooded black velvet gown something like a monks robe but lined in scarlet satin there was something embroidered on it in black silknot a discernable pattern more like symbols of some sort but the blackonblack of the silk made it nearly impossible to tell what it was around her waist she wore a very odd belt for all the world like a hangmans rope but made of silk a floorlength black veil edged in jet beads went over everything and an odd tiara of stars held the veil in place when howse asked timidly who alison was portraying alison had just smiled and said lightly the queen of the night of course from mozarts opera the magic flute i doubt anyone else will think of it and theres value in novelty at least the costume didnt require any special wigs or hairstyles nor did it require a full hour to put on even if she did look like lady death though it did make eleanor wonder was this alisons ritual robe some people liked to wear such things although they werent necessary and didnt contribute any to the efficacy of a spell unless the wearer had put spells or protections into the robes before she put them on if so eleanor could hardly imagine the cheek to wear such a thing to a fancydress ball when the three of them finally sailed out the door it was a distinct relief they were motored away by alisons escort warrick locke who himself was costumed as some sort of wizard when they were safely in the automobile howse closed the door behind them i have a headache she declared staring at eleanor i am going to wait in madames room eleanor shrugged i think that would be a good idea she said in a neutral voice they wont be back for hours and youll need to be ready when they return she of course knew exactly what howse was going to do she was going to nap on alisons bedmuch more comfortable than her own since this was exactly what eleanor wanted her to do she simply waited until she couldnt hear any more movement overhead then went to the kitchen and knelt beside the hearthstone the flames of the fire flared up as she breathed the first words of her spell and a half dozen salamanders burst out of the heart of the fire to slither up her arms and entwine themselves around her neck slowly carefully eleanor insinuated herself into the complex weave of the binding spell with a word here and a tweak there she stretched it rearranged it suggested to it that its territory was not merely this house and grounds but the entire county she felt the spell respond sluggishly but by no means as slowly as it had the first time she had done this make this your boundary until midnight she suggested to it with a shake like a reluctant dog the spell grumbled stretched and settled into its new configurations with a final word to hold the new shape in place she came out of her halftrance and got to her feet with a feeling of distinct triumph a spell properly speaking was a process and not a thingbut the ones that alison had set on her certainly felt like thingsthings with lives of their own and rudimentary personalities unpleasant personalities but that was only to be expected she cocked an ear to the rooms overhead and heard nothing eagerness took over and unwilling to wait another moment she slipped the latch of the kitchen door and closed it behind herself then flew out of the garden gate and down the street to sarahs cottage other than a couple of men entering the broom pub there wasnt anyone else about however much excitement the ball had generated in the robinson household for the rest of the village this were no differences between tonight and any other saturday which was just as well since the last thing she wanted was a lot of coming and going that might disturb miss howses slumber feeling excitement and anticipation rising in her and threatening to boil over she ran for all she was worth she had not dared until this moment truly to believe that she was going to be able to do this so many things in her life had been taken or thwarted that she had been afraid to put too much hope into this moment this moment when she would live for a few hours the life she should have had when she would be herself miss eleanor robinson not ellie the maidofallwork with nothing to look forward to but a lifetime of drudgery in the house that should have been hers she managed to control herself when she reached sarahs door enough so that she paused caught her breath and after a preliminary tap and the expected response of come she opened the door quite demurely only to gasp with shock surprise and delight at the vision that met her widening eyes like it do you sarah asked a twinkle in her eyes and a pardonably smug expression on her face not a bad job if i do say so myself and i do arrayed on an improvised dressmakersform made of a broomstick and a stuffed sack was every little girls dream of a fairy dress the sort of thing that bedazzled young eyes believe in when they see the fairy princess at the christmas pantomine only this gown was real and not cheap muslin and machinelace it had been a sort of ivory the last time eleanor saw itnow it was a soft rose pink how did you change the color she stammered sarah rubbed the side of her nose and looked suitably smug do you know theres an old spell in my grimoire that does just that temporary of course but temporary is all you need and after i took some thought about it it seemed to me that a fairy princess was a better costume choice than princess victoria the wings i made you know what i always tell youits easier to change whats there than make new i expect there wont be another fairy princess in the lot those girls have forgotten magic by now and think theyre too old for fairies youll look nothing like yourself little bouquets of rosebuds ornamented the skirt here and there and a garland of them ran from the right shoulder to the left hip a pair of tiny pink gauze wings sprang from the shoulders in the back waiting on the table was a wreath of rosebuds to wear in her hair and a pair of pink silk opera gloves to cover her workroughened hands the left of course had only three fingers what am i going to do for shoes she asked suddenly aware that her clumsy and wellworn walking shoes would ruin the entire effect of this exquisite gown and stockings ah thats where a little more magic and illusion come in sarah replied with a sly wink strip to your shift my girl i have some work to do yet sarah was as good as her word a handful of rosepetals pressed against each shoe a breath of magic and a muttered charmand the squaretoed worn brown leather was magically transmuted to a pair of the most delicate silk slippers eleanor had ever seen with pink stockings that matched the gown taking the place of the muchdarned cotton stockings she had been wearing she couldnt see any flaw in the illusion though if she closed her eyes she knew very well she was still wearing her old stockings and shoes which was not at all a bad thing they might be worn nearly to bits but they were comfortable which was more than could be said of most fashionable shoes with that transformation complete the dressing began though it didnt take more than a fraction of the time it had taken to dress her stepsisters petticoats and gown went on over her old underclothing sarah reattached the garland of roses and then with practiced fingers put up her hair and pinned the wreath to it she pulled on the glovesand it was done well if i were a little girl or a young man i would be half in love with you sarah exclaimed as she shed her skirt and apron to don a pair of antique breeches and a rusty woolen uniform coat she brushed her hands over herself from the top of her head to the soles of her feet and eleanor felt another breath of power flit by her and in sarahs place was a solemn faced grayhaired man in rosered livery sporting more braid and gold buttons than any general could boast theres your invitation said sarahs voice coming from the mans moutha distinctly disorienting proposition he pointed at the mantelpiece where the precious envelope was held securely between two jamjars full of water and rosebuds you get that invitation take a look in the mirror in the corner there to make sure i havent forgotten anything while i get your carriage milady and dont forget midnight is as late as you can go because thats the longest i can hold the illusions a careful check of as much of herself as she could see in sarahs tiny mirror that hung over her washstand seemed to indicate that sarah had been her usual efficient self there was nothing to strike a false note and eleanor began to feel quite shivery with anticipation when she heard the sound of a horses hooves and a low whistle just outside sarahs door she seized the invitation and hurried outside she hesitated a moment at the door itself since she was wider than the doorway now but the wide skirt wasnt as difficult to maneuver as she had feared it would be she got through without even catching the lace on her flounces and there to her absolutely astonished gaze was the sort of open carriage thataccording to the pictures she had seenthe king used on state occasions only a bit smaller in the light coming from the two little lamps on either side of the drivers box she could tell that it was rosered in color with gilded ornamentation sarah sat on the drivers box and expertly handled the reins of the snowwhite horse that was harnessed to this confection by rosered and gilded traces its an old ponycart and plowhorse i borrowed from a friend sarah said laughing at eleanors expression be careful getting in its nowhere near as padded as it looks to be she was careful getting in feeling the old worn wood under the glove on her hand where her eyes told her there was bright gilding and slick paint the lines of the carriage conformed to the shape of the old ponycart beneath the illusionshe knew from her studies that the less a magician had to create the better an illusion was and here was the proof of that sarah chirruped to the horse who moved out with brisk dignity eleanor kept her hands tightly folded in her lap with her hands atop the precious invitation she wished it werent dark she really felt like a fairy princess she wished that she could see and yes be seen in this guise she would be like a sort of pantomime character herself and it would have been a great deal of fun to act that way but no one came out of or went into the pub or the inn as they passed and no little face peered down out of a bedroom window to gape in surprise probably sarah was using a little more magic to make sure no one saw themunderstandable if disappointing what would i have thought as a little girl if i had looked out a window and seen a fairy princess passing by in her carriage id have believed in fairies so firmly that nothing could have dissuaded me perhaps then it was just as wellbecause little girls now were facing the loss of fathers brothers uncles and were in dire need of magic that she could not supply to send one looking for a fairy to conjure back her lost papa or brother would have been intolerably cruel the horse broke into a trot once they were out of the village where an old horse got that kind of energy eleanor couldnt guess more magic or was the old fellow just feeling frisky in the cool of the evening whichever it was the carriage rattled merrily down the road to longacre park and in a much shorter time than eleanor would have guessed it turned in through the huge wroughtiron gates and rolled onto a smooth graveled driveway the manor loomed up at the top of a shallow rise ahead of them all lit up for the grand occasion with lanterns set out along the staircase to light the way up eleanor felt her stomach clench as she gazed up at the enormous structure feeling suddenly altogether out of her class how on earth did the fenyxes keep that enormous barn of a building up did they have an army of servants was all of that truly just to support two people reggie and his mother you have every right to be here she told herself sternly as the carriage drew nearer and nearer to the broad double staircases leading down to the drive each one curving down from the side you have an invitation and whats more you have more right to be here than alison and her brats by repeating this to herself over and over by the time they reached the bottom of the staircases she had some of her composure back or at least the illusion of composure there was a liveried footmanor footboy would probably be more accuratewaiting beneath the twin lamps at the foot of the stairs he didnt even blink when sarah brought the carriage to a halt even though most guests were arriving by motorcar he simply waited while sarah got down opened the carriage door and handed her out then he took eleanors hand and directed her to the bottom of the stairs as if he had been doing this sort of thing all his life well given how entire families in broom and arrow tended to go into service and stay in service to the fenyx household perhaps he had but the fact that he was so very young told her something else no matter how sheltered the great house was from the real world the real world could still affect it profoundly longacre park was as subject to compulsory conscription as any other place in this country reggie might have been the first to go to the war but it seemed that every other ablebodied man here had followed sarah drove the carriage away before the illusion could waver at all leaving eleanor alone on the paved landing at the bottom of the stairs she looked up uncertain as to what she should do she seemed to be the only person arriving alone which made her feel very selfconscious the big doors at the top were both flung open wide there was another man in livery at the top and an older gentlemen in a black swallowtail coat and stiff white shirt another footman and the butler she expected all right its now or never escorted or not i have an invitation and i belong she put on her pink silk domino mask tying the ribbons behind her head then carefully picked up the sides of her gown and began the long climb towards those huge doors and whatever fate held for her inside them august longacre park warwickshire she handed over her invitation to the butler who inspected it and to her relief merely nodded she had been afraid he would announce her and if alison was anywhere within hearing distance instead she stepped intowell she wasnt entirely sure what to call this room there could easily have been a second floor to this room and there wasnt the ceiling was somewhere up a full two storieseasily forty feet it was surely another forty feet wide and twice that in length there were enough candles burning in candelabra all around the walls to have supplied an entire chandlers shop supplementing the gaslights there was only one name that suited this spacethe great hall and it was full in one corner a small orchestra composed entirely of blackgowned women most of them not young played what sounded suspiciously like ragtime four years ago either circumstance would have caused a scandal but as eleanor eased herself into the room she overheard almost immediately the end of a conversation and even the band called up my dear so fortunate that lady virginia was here they seem a bitmodern came the doubtful reply the first speaker laughed but of course theyre modern theyre virginias pet suffragette band but if i had to choose between holding a ball with a suffragette orchestra or holding one with a gramophone i know which one i would take at least when one engages women there is no danger of seeing them called over to france the second woman turned her masked face in the direction of the orchestra with ever evidence of interest i have a hunt ball in the autumni wonder if eleanor was never to hear what the speaker wondered for the eddies and swirls around the edge of the area of the dancing carried the speakers away if this had been a fairy tale the moment that eleanor had entered the great hall all conversation would have ceased and every head would have turned her way the butler would have announced her which would have been a disaster but this was not a fairy tale and although she did excite a few admiring or unreadable glances for the most part people looked at her did not recognize her and dismissed her from their minds within a few moments while her gown was certainly passable it was neither so very different nor so very outstanding as to excite interest she was indeed the only fairy princess but other girls had wide pink dresses and the deeper she went into the room the more obvious it was that she was in an entirely different strata of society than she had ever been before and so were her stepsisters though they might not yet realize it this was society old money old titles and though whatever dressmaker alison went to might be able to counterfeit the look of these garments there was a subtle difference between these costumes and the ones she had just aided lauralee and carolyn into she suspected that a close examination would prove they did not hold up to the sort of careful scrutiny that maids who tended these clothes would bring to bear and while ladies maids did not precisely gossip to their mistresses they did have subtle ways of making things known alison and her progeny might be in for a rude awakening if they ever were invited to someone elses country weekend and she insisted on maintaining the fiction that she too was a member of their class but in the meantime eleanors costume did not mark her out as anything unusual she was by no means vivacious enough to attract attention by herself the real beauties here were identifiable even behind their little domino masks this suited eleanor very well her goal after all was to find the elemental master and no one here was likely to make her task any easier by identifying that worthy for her she only knew that the master was female and that only because she herself had seen the woman at work the night that the revenants were dispersed she worked her way towards the wall and realized with a certain dismay that there was another room behind this one nearly as large that had been thrown open to the ballattendees this was not going to make her task any easier she resigned herself with a pang of disappointment to the realization that she was unlikely to see reggie after all the young women substantially outnumbered the young men here and it was unlikely that he was going to have a single minute free and her own much more pressing task must take precedence if she was going to get herself free of her stepmother somewhere in this swirling chaos of people she had to find the traces of air magic that would inevitably be hovering about such a master and now she was very grateful that her study of magic had required her to understand the other three elements as well as her own she might not be able to use air magic but she could definitely sniff it out she was nearly at the doorway in the righthand wall of the great hall when she caught the first scent of air magic just a hint of blue at the corner of her vision an unexpected breath of cold and a touch of sharp clean scent like juniper or rosemary but she was on it like a hound and followed it into a drawing room this too was evidently open to the guests older ladies and gentlemen who were so engrossed in their card games that they didnt even take any notice of her she scanned the area for that hint of magic but her quarry was none of themthen she got another hint of it through another doorway which led her into a hall not so brightly lit and quite probably not supposed to be open to the guests but the air master was a friend of the family and according to sarah a longterm visitor here and probably had the run of the place she would be allowed to go places where ordinary guests at the ball would be unwelcome better and better she must be on the right track and the breath of air magic was stronger now she followed the scent down the darkened shadowhaunted hall and into the library here for the first time since she had entered these doors she found herself consumed with envy of the people who lived here the great hall excited her not at all she could only think of how it dwarfed everyone who set foot in it that drawing room had been far too rich and opulent for her to feel comfortable in it and besides that the furnishings were antique probably fragile and without a doubt irreplaceable but this room with its floortoceiling bookshelves crammed with volumesthis she desired and in fact as she took a few hesitant steps into the dimly lit room she forgot for a moment why she was here in the sudden surge of acquisitive desire i beg your pardon miss but the party is she started then froze at the sound of the familiar drawl and the exclamation was startled out of her reggie there was a creak of leather as the figure rose out of the depths of an armchair to her left and limped towards her eleanor came the incredulous reply is that you she jerked at the ends of the ribbon of her mask and pulled it off of course its me i have an invitation she replied now full of indignation what did he think she was so far beneath him that she shouldnt be here of course you do i addressed it myself was his answer as he limped out of the shadows with both hands outstretched while most of the young men here were in their uniforms he was not he had donned a costume for the occasion with a feeling of shock she recognized the magician from the tarot deck but the colors were blue silver and white rather than red white and gold i waited in the reception line for what seemed like hours but you never came and i thoughtyour stepmother she doesnt know im here eleanor said her growing anger erased by the surge of irrational joy she felt at his words shed have stopped me if shed known i was coming she felt the coercion of alisons spells suddenly uncoil sealing her lips over anything else she might have said i thought it was something like that was reggies only reply as he took both her hands in his and gazed down into her eyes look lets not talk about your dreadful stepmother nor your conniving stepsisters nor anything else unpleasant mater has put on a firstrate show so lets enjoy it together he smiled at her with something of the charm of the old reggie so long as im with a girl even if mater doesnt know who she is shell leave me alone if she does so will everyone else and it has not yet become the fashion thank the good lord for ladies to cut in on men while dancing do you dance she was so caught in those earnest eyes that all she could do was stammer ihavent not fora long time good because my knee is a torture well go revolve a little for forms sake thenhow about the garden capability brown you know and all lit up with fairylanterns for the occasion appropriate for a fairy princess she hardly knew what to say this was the sort of thing out of her wildest dreams the ones she knew better than to believe in hes just using me as a defense against the girls like carolyn and lauralee cautioned a bitter voice from her head but her heart replied then why is he looking at me like that because those pale eyes were warm with an emotion she did not yet dare to believe in and he looked very much as if he would like to do more than simply look at her and sheer instinct made her nod which evidently was answer enough for him he took the domino from her nerveless hands tied it back on and tucked her right hand into the crook of his arm lets go brave the throng this time when they passed through the drawing room the play stopped head turned in their direction and as they crossed into the great hall she sensed the whispers begin behind them and as if this had suddenly turned into a fairy tale as they walked into the great hall they were surrounded by a zone of silence and all eyes turned towards them reggie ignored it she felt her cheeks flushing but held her head high and tried to walk with dignity he led her to the exact center of the room as the musicians in the corner brought their current number to a swift conclusion once there he swung her to face him and the next thing she knew she was turning in his arms around the floor to the strains of a waltz ravaged knee or not he was light on his feet not a brilliant dancer but a competent one and the gown she was wearing was practically made for waltzing in with a heady feeling of euphoria she surrendered to the moment and let him guide her three times around the floor while the musicians kept the tempo a little slower than usual after all wasnt this the sort of thing she had dreamed of doing it felt like a dream it had all the perfect unreality of a dream the musicians must have had a fine sense of just how long reggie could dance about the time she felt his steps faltering slightly they brought the waltz to a close with a flourish under cover of the polite applause to the orchestra he bent and whispered if thats enough for you would you like to see the gardens all she could do was nod once again as the orchestra began a new piece he tucked her hand into the crook of his elbow and escorted her out of the great hall into the room behind itshe got a glimpse of a long table set with huge arrangements of flowers and punchbowls and then out onto a terrace the view down into the gardens was breathtaking but he didnt give her much chance to look at it he drew her down the stairs into the gardens themselves which had as he had told her been lit up with fairylanterns the wave of perfume that washed over her told her that the roses for which longacre was famous were in full bloom he took her down one of the paths to a stone benchstill within sight of the terrace but not a straight lineofsight she carefully arranged her skirt and gingerly took a seat with a sigh of relief he sat beside her i was horribly afraid i had offended you past forgiveness were the first words out of his mouth i never meant to when you didnt come back you went to the meadow she interrupted hit again by one of those surges of irrational pleasure he nodded as soon as i could and you didnt come back so i thought you were angry with me i couldnt that was all she could manage before alisons coercions clamed down on her because you had work to doi hoped that was all it was but i was afraid i had been a boor he sighed i am neither fish nor fowl eleanor on the one hand i was raised by my parents and the nannies they chose for me who are of the opinion that education beyond reading writing and a little figuring is bad for females on the other i am heavily influenced by my godmother who is an unrepentant suffragist and by what i learned myself at oxford sometimes when i am not thinking things escape from me that are parrotings of mater and i am always sorry when they do i plead forgiveness i never meant to slight the intelligence of women and least of all yours she took off her domino and looked up at him gravely as long as you promise to remember that she said and i hope how do i warn him about alison and the girls she couldnt say anything directly but i hope youre also remember that intelligence is a weapon of sorts and it isnt always used to good ends and that signifies for women just as well as men maybe more she added thoughtfully since women dont have a great many weapons at their disposal and they are inclined to use the ones they have with skill and precision he blinked for a moment as if taken aback by her words then nodded ah i think i know what you are hinting at the charming alison robinson and her two lovely daughters his mouth tightened eleanor what hold have they over you i cannot believe that they can come up here to tea and tennis on a daily basis in gowns of the latest mode while you clearly are working at manual labor and kept as shabbily as a tweenie in a misers house unless they have some power over you oh how she wanted to tell him she fought the constraints of the spell but all she could manage to get out through gritted teeth was shes my guardian i have no rights and no say in my life until you come of age and that cant be long he replied his eyes icy for a moment and thenyou can depend on me eleanor you can she felt her hands starting to tremble and she clasped them together to hide it he reached over and took her hands eleanor he said as she stiffened i would like to be more than just your friend a great deal more she went hot then cold then hot again you dont mean that she said half begging half accusing you cant mean that i dont fit in with all this she took her hands out of his and waved vaguely at the manor behind her and i dont fit in with your people cant you see that she shook her head violently you and iits impossible surely you understand he made a little sound of mingled amusement and disgust there is one thing that mad ross is right about all this is going to change in the next few years eleanor and change drastically and most of those people back there havent a clue this war is putting an end to their world as they know it though it was starting to crumble around the edges before that he sniffed a bloodline isnt worth much if you cant keep the roof over your head patched and i can name you a dozen men in my circle men who are contemporaries of my father whove married chorus beauties actresses their childrens governesseseven their housekeepers there will be more of thatand there will be women who had no men in their families survive this war who will marry policemen gardeners tradesmenor never marry or remarry at all and as for the people my age he shook his head weve seen too much weve learned too much and most of it was bitter ive been thinking about this a very great deal ever since that big push at ypres started he took a very deep breath i came to the conclusion that if mater was going to insist that i do my family duty it was going to be on my terms with a woman i could respect with intelligence someone who could talk with me her hands were sweating nervously to save her silk gloves she pulled them off he recaptured her hands these hands no matter what they work at are not all of you eleanornot even most of what you are you are intelligent kind forgivingi could go on for the next half hour and still not come to the end of your good points no perhaps you dont fit in with all of that behind me but all that is going to have to change if it is going to survive at all in the coming years i am going to have to change i dont see any reason why that change shouldnt come in a way that accommodates you and your own changes now she was shaking but it wasnt only because of what he was saying no for no reason that she could understand alisons coercions were lightening around her and so were the spells binding her to the hearthstone this had come without real warning granted she had spent too long searching for the air master and now they were pulling on her insistently but she couldnt understand why she hadnt had some sign before this she felt them like a corset laced too tight squeezing off breath and making it hard to think soon they would become uncomfortable then painful then maddening i wont ask you for any kind of a decision now eleanor he was saying as she felt her hands growing cold but i would like you to consider the possibility of seeing me as more than your friend i would like to know that there is a chance for me in your future she wanted to pay attention to his words but she couldnt she felt the spells closing in on her it was becoming hard to breathe the tugging at her mind and body were growing intolerable and she couldnt help herself she began to shake and she pulled her hands out of his and sprang to her feet in a single convulsive movement eleanor he exclaimed as she whirled to face him hoping he could see something of her inner struggle in her expression eleanor whats wrong please i havent offended you again she shook her head frantically and wrapped her own hands around her throat trying to force some last words out of it before she had to run but the words that came were not the ones she had expected reggie she heard herself gasping i love you and then she turned and ran leaving him calling after her she couldnt even understand what he was saying at that point the spells were tightening on her so painfully he had no hope of catching her lame as he was of course sarah would be waiting but she could not stop for sarah no she could not stop for anything all she could do was run for as long as she was running in the right direction the bands of pain around her body around her mind would ease just enough to allow her to continue running but if she stopped even for a moment she did not take the road the road was too long she fled headlong and heedless through the grounds across the long empty lawn and into the wilderness which was no wilderness at all of course only a carefully cultivated illusion of one she couldnt think not clearly anyway only fragments of thought lanced across the allencompassing demand of alisons spells why was this happening she stumbled across a bridlepath that went in the right direction and turned down it her rosewreath and garland were gone and her hair was down all one side her sides ached but the coercions were not letting up a branch tangled with her skirt and she yanked it free without missing a step how had the coercions suddenly snapped into place there was a low stone wall in the way she scrambled over it and found herself in a meadow full of sheep that scattered before her bleating indignation she kept going at least here there was enough light to see why were the coercions so strong suddenly another low stone wall she left more of her gown on one of the stones dimly she recognized the top of the round meadow where she had met reggie so often the upper end where she normally couldnt go at least she knew the way from here if the pain in her side and her head would let her her world narrowed to the pain and the next step each step bringing her closer to the arrows closer to the end of the pain the end of the pain run her breath rasped in her lungs sending sharp icy stabs into her chest her vision blurred and darkened she felt branches lashing at her as she passed but all she could think of was that she must must get to the arrows run she felt hard bare dirt and hardpacked gravel under her feet she was in the road to broom she didnt remember getting over the fence run run run she stumbled into the side of one of the houses on high street caught herself pushed herself off and kept running there was sarahs cottage just ahead then past she tripped and fell bruising hands and knees at the corner shoved herself up and kept running here was the broom tavern almost there she stumbled again and fell into the fence around the garden of the arrows she caught herself and ran the last few yards completely blind shoving open the garden gate and falling inside down onto the path as the gate swung shut again behind her and the pain stopped the mental pain anyway as she lay on the ground gasping for breath in great aching lungfuls she discovered an entirely new source of very physical pain her palms and knees burned her side felt as if someone had stuck a knife in her and whenever she moved she could feel deep scratches and bruises everywhere and all she could do was to lie there and try to get her breath back because she couldnt move in her current state if her life depended on it but she could think at leastthough not coherently whole thoughts rather than fragments but they came to her in no particular order as she lay on her back with her eyes closed gasping freed from the coercions her mind raced i have to get cleaned up and changed alison and the girls will be coming home i cant look like thismaybe i can disguise some of the scratches and bruises with kitchen ash at least they wont be expecting me to still be awake sarah would she hoped surely know when the coercions had suddenly tightened around her and would take the cart and horse back to its owners surely she wouldnt sit there all night another thought a bleak one this time i failed i didnt find the air master why had there been that breath of air magic around reggie oh heavenswhat did i say to reggie did i really tell him i loved him how could i have done that what on earth possessed me i dont but there the thought came to an abrupt halt because she could not in all truth have finished it with i dont love him because it wasnt true what was he saying to me it had all gotten jumbled up in the coercions in the headlong flight across the countryside she couldnt remember any of it clearly except she knew very well he hadnt said that he loved her but had he implied it hed asked if he could be more than a friend to her she remembered that much the pain in her side ebbed a little and with a groan she pushed herself up off the ground her hands were tough and little more than bruised but her kneeswell her stockings were surely ruined and the way they stuck to her knees argued for a bleeding scrape there i need to start a fire the salamanders can help heal this enough that it doesnt look fresh i should sleep in the kitchen in fact she had a good idea that she was going to have to sleep in the kitchen whether she wanted to or not she didnt think she could get up the stairs right now it was just a good thing that there was still some clean clothing laundered and dried just yesterday that was still waiting downstairs to be taken to her room everything that wasnt connected to the ball had been given short shrift in the last few days and her own business had been last on the list of things to be done she got herself to her feet and stumbled into the kitchen shoving open the door with an effort the fire leapt up to answer her unspoken call and she put another log on it while she stripped off the rags that were all that was left of that wonderful gown and with intense regret threw them on the fire there was no point in leaving any evidence for anyone to find she drew a basin of water from the kitchen pump and cleaned off the dirt and the dried blood with soap and a wet towel both her knees were a mess and there were scratches all over her body she could hide her knees but not the scratches on her face and arms something had to be done about that when the fire was burning brightly she called a swarm of salamanders to wreath around her injuries theyd only have burned someone who wasnt a fire magician and they couldnt heal things up completely but what they could do was minimize the appearance of the scrapes and deep scratches so that they looked days rather than hours old finally she put on the clean clothing spread out the palletbed and fell onto it she felt as if she wanted to weep all that workand for nothing all she had done was to allow herself to be distracted by reggie and betrayed by her emotions she hadnt found the air master she was no nearer to freeing herself than she had been this morning as for reggieif he dared to come looking for her herealison would want to know why and then unbidden the image of the wheel of fortune card rose in her mind a few hours ago she had been up up upnow the wheel had turned and she had tumbled down down down the wheel would turn again she had to believe that she had to exhaustion mental and physical overcame her while she was trying to convince herself of that and she slept only to be jolted awake by the impact of a delicately pointed toe on her own sore ribs she started out of sleep and looked up dumbly to find that alison her daughters and the odious warrick locke were all gazing down at her with expressions on their faces that made her heart turn to stone and a scrap of lace and a single rosebud dangled from alisons fingertips take care of her alison said to locke before eleanor could say a word and before she could move he had swooped down on her like a hawk on a mouse a rag in one hand that he clamped over her nose and mouth there was a sicklysweet smell and then nothing august broom warwickshire alison looked down at the unconscious and muchbattered form of her stepdaughter sprawled on top of the heap of ragged blankets that was her bed and seethed with rage that she carefully kept from her expression there was no point in letting everyone know how close she was to unleashing that rage in fact she was quite sure that it was her control and not her anger that frightened locke i am very glad you were clever enough to see past her costume at the ball lauralee she said keeping her voice level and gladder still that you kept her from seeing you she very nearly undid everything we have accomplished so far who could have guessed that idiot boy would have been attracted to her carolyn pouted what i want to know is where did she get that dress her expression as well as her voice was raw with envy that would have been moderately interesting under other circumstances as her mother would never have guessed she had a passion for pink lace and rosebuds it was an exceedingly misplaced concern given the situation light the lamp carolyn was all alison said she was not entirely in charity with her younger daughter at the moment carolyn continued to pout but did as she was ordered and how did she get in the door lauralee added her own voice hard with the same anger her mother was feeling more to the point how did she get out the doorthis door alison retorted gesturing at the exit from the kitchen there are explanations for the restshe could have found the dress in the attic for instance and she could have told the butler that she was with us in order to get into the ball didnt you say reggie had asked about her carolyn carolyn blinked as if the question caught her by surprise well she admitted reluctantly yes but so she could easily have been on the guest list and all she had to do was claim she misplaced her invitation but how did she manipulate my coercive spells alison glared down at the wretched girl thats what i want to know you have been concentrating on reggie warrick locke reminded her and youve been quite careful about working magic anywhere around lady virginia since her ladyship arrived between the two your coercive spells may have weakened its just a very good thing for all of us that lauralee spotted her and that the rest of us were at the ball too if you hadnt had warrick along he wouldnt have been able to shield lady virginia from sensing magic lauralee reminded her mother so you were able to redouble your coercions and force her back here she didnt fight that so possibly as mr locke says its only that your binding spells were weakening over time because you havent been renewing them or possibly the girl is coming into her powers alison gritted her teeth that was the one possibility that simply hadnt occurred to her up until this moment and it was the one possibility that made her the angriest if thats the case then theres no time to waste well have to take her out to the nearest mine the one closest to the hoar stones and dump her there now instead of later if she is becoming a fire mageher powers wont do her any good in there not underground and not when my creatures are finished with her oh the miserable chit she was forcing everythingand ruining what she hadnt forced alison locke said warningly pulling out his watch and showing the face to her its nearly five in the morning we cant take her now someone will see us for one moment alison deeply regretted her rise in social status because it would have been very relieving of her frustrations to curse like a fishwife right now locke was right of course none of the motors had anywhere to hide a bundledup body and the sun would be up by the time they got everything packed up and into the automobiles it would have to wait until dark how do you want to keep her unconscious locke continued now looking nervous i hate to advise against more chloroform because it is dangerous and theres an equal chance that id kill her or shed come out of itand you dont want her dead that will do you no good at all i have something alison interrupted him its a bit more precise she went upstairs to her room and came back down with the morphia kit in both hands it amused her slightly to see lockes eyes bulge a little when he realized what it was she readied the needle pleased that she had learned to do all of this a long time ago one of the few benefits of caring for the aged you surprise me locke said finally as she pulled a measured dose of the fluid into the chamber this is not something i would have expected you to possess the look of shock still on his face made her raise an eyebrow dont be an idiot warrick lauralee snapped mothers not an addict she just believes in being prepared she got that from our doctor in london ages ago she told him it was because eleanor had fits and i pay him well enough to be incurious alison said kneeling down at the girls side turning her arm over and probing for a vein he noted it in his records as being for eleanor and it cost me a pretty penny too but you never know when youre going to need to keep someone quiet she injected the fluid and stood up there that should keep her for quite some time and it has the added benefit that if she is coming into her powers it will throw her right out of her body for a while which should thoroughly disorient her she waved at locke who was just standing there gaping at her take the little wretch and bundle her out of sight somewhere where he asked and she turned a furious face towards him i dont care you know this house well enough to find some place i dont want anyone coming in here and stumbling over her thats all she suppressed the urge to stamp her foot did she have to think of everything the washhouse suggested lauralee sweetly no one would look in there and it will be handy for taking her out to the autos when we leave tonight they all looked to alison who nodded carolyn she noted was looking more and more calflike stupid and sulky well it was clear which of her daughters was the more useful alison watched lips pressed tightly together as locke picked up the girl heaved her over his shoulder and followed lauralee out the kitchen door and into the dark and shadowy yard there was a creak as the washhouse door opened a soft thud and the creak of the door again then a rattle as lauralee shot home the bolt locking eleanor in wise little lauralee who was also taking no chances lauralee led the way back in through the kitchen door yawning and in spite of the tension alison found herself yawning as well mother i am shattered we all are alison said cutting her off grimly this has been a less than successful night and we are going to have to act quickly and resolutely to minimize the damage we cant do that without sleep she will keep warrick you can take one of the spare bedrooms at this point with as much as we have at stake i am willing to risk a little gossip lauralee nodded looking relieved carolyn walked up the first few stairs and her sister followed more slowly burdened as she was by her elaborate costume i did come to the ball with you locke pointed out meekly and it would only be hospitable to offer a place for me for the night after such a late return do you think reggie will come looking for her here lauralee asked suddenly turning back to look down at them with an expression of worry what with everything else that was going wrongprobably he might alison replied and we need to be prepared for that she thought about it for a moment our best bet may be to try and convince him that the girl he met was not eleanor butlauralee lauralee carolyn exclaimed angrily jealousy sharpening her tone why lauralee shes the nearest in size he didnt set eyes on her once all evening and the difference in haircolor can be explained with a wig alison replied consigning carolyns hopes to the dustbin without a twinge whereas you dear he danced with twice so he knows very well that you werent in the fairy princess costume he cant possibly have known who eleanor is when would he ever have met her it might work and if it does well have saved the situation you can explain running away somehow i leave it up to you to think of something i will lauralee promised and she turned to go back up the stairs her sister led the way bristling and pouting at the same time that ones going to be trouble locke warned shes going to let jealousy of her sister take precedence over everything else alison sniffed shes the least of my worries shell behave herself now because this situation will fall to pieces if we dont all work together and shell behave herself laterbecause she knows what will happen if she doesnt oh locke replied looking skeptical she dropped the mask she habitually wore and let him see the true alison robinson just for a moment he shrank back as she reinforced the revelation with her next words i only need one daughter she said icily and i periodically remind them of that she smiled as he nodded trembling and all but scrambled up the stairs to a guest room august elsewhere at one moment eleanor had been surrounded by the last people on earth she wanted to see she had started to get up but warrick locke had pounced on her with a rag in one hand he had covered her nose and mouth with it she had been forced to breathe through it tasting a sicklysweet unbearably thick aroma and the next thing she knew she had been thrust into blackness she seemed to fall forever then there was a kind of electric jolt now she was here the tarotworld with its flat blue sky and its flat green lawns but this was a part of it she had never seen before she stood inside a square of grass that was surrounded by hedges whose tops were well above her head it all looked very measured and regular too regular to be real where am i she said aloud though she really only thought she was talking to herself but she wasnt alone she heard something behind her and turned you are in the center of a maze said the hermit pushing back his cowl and setting his lantern down he frowned but at the hedges not at her his bushy gray brows knitting together you are in great danger this is merely a reflection in this world of another reality that surrounds you at the moment she didnt care what the maze was for i know i dont belong here she said urgently and i know im in dangerbut i didnt come here by myself and i dont know how to get out is there any way you can help me he looked directly into her eyes and she saw a personality there something she had not ever really seen with any of the other tarot cards the perfect fool asks the unasked questions he said aloud then he changed he becamefire fire incarnate a sexless creature of insubstantial flame gazing at her with penetrating blue eyes eyes the color of a hot gas flame his voice remained the same however i think we can dispense with this child he said and with a casual gesture the maze the flat blue sky the flat green earth were all gone in their placea world of fire fire which not only did not burn her but which when it touched her felt like a cool caress you are not a master not yeti am not compelled to obey you nor required by mutual bargain she shook her head i know that she replied swallowing and i know ill be studying all my life to really understand my powers i was foolish to think i could master all the cards in a few days butbut i think i could have gotten enough to have broken free of alison you are in great danger the fire elemental repeated and the maze we were in is nothing to the maze that holds you tight in tangles of magic yes i am she agreed shivering i dont think i can escape from this by myself i need help will you can you help me that depends the elemental said measuringly you must show by your intelligence that you deserve help firemost difficult of the elements dangerous to try and control more dangerous to lie to but win its loyalty i have to break the coercions she said flatly and i have to break free of here and get back to the real world again but the elemental simply regarded her gravely finally or he prompted fire is the hardest to hold most difficult to understand likeliest to rebel and is impressed only byintellect this elemental was showing remarkable patience by those standards she pummeled her brain what could she do to get out of the coercions if she broke them alison would know shed already tried stretching them what else was there if she looked around herself a certain way she could actually see them here tangling around her in a rats nest of bindings like she blinked and looked again likeamazejust as he told me she took a deep breath she couldnt solve the thing in the real world buthere what happens if i thread my way out of the coercions she asked the fire elemental he grinned broadly and nodded the flames that were his hair brightening then her spells will no longer hold you and yet they will not be broken so she will not be aware that her spells no longer hold you but do you think you can solve this i have to she replied grimly ill see if wallfollowing will do it it might take longer but its the surest she focused her concentration until the tangles of the spells that confined her became clear concentrated further willing the tangles to take on the tangible form of walls and passageways the magician imposes his will his way of seeing on the plane of magic and the plane reflects what he wills she couldnt will herself out of this because the mind and will that had set the spells was stronger than she was but she could force it to take on a semblance of something she could deal with she found herself at the heart of another maze she didnt like the look of the walls that surrounded her either they were dark and repellent and she didnt want to touch them but wallfollowing meant keeping one hand on either the left or the righthand wall and following it no matter what and after a moment of thought she put her hand on the lefthand wall and stepped into the shadowy intimidating darkness of the maze itself the fire elemental came with her which surprised her a little though it was heartening to have company she hadnt expected it and since he brought light with him this meant she could actually see where she was going that was an advantage seeing the walls that made up the maze clearly was not an advantage they felt like something alivebut not pleasant faintly warm pulsing a touch slimy but worse than the feel was the look a suggestion effaces there and not nice faces either she didnt ask if the walls were alive that was fairly obvious can they feel she asked instead oh yes came the reply grim and with a dangerous edge to it are they in pain she continued not that she wanted to know except that she did oh yes softly yet somehow grimmer still she made another two turnings the faces in the walls were set in frozen expressions of despair can i free them she asked not that she wanted to but but nothing should suffer if it doesnt have to the fire elemental stopped looking at her with an expression of utter astonishment why would you desire to do that he asked because if i can i should she replied knowing that this was the right answer not the most expedient and perhaps not the wisest but the right answer thisthis is wrong if i can make it right then its my duty to i have power and power begets responsibility and the walls began to murmur she shivered at the sound which carried something of the tone of those revenants in it but the fire elemental straightened and spread his arms wide the little flamelets that danced over him rising from his outstretched limbs hear my lesser brothers of earth do you hear this child of flame you are in thrall to a dark master of earth she is not bound to you she has no responsibility to you and yetshe would free you a single enormous face formed on the wall immediately in front of her the eyes were closed and remained closed she was just as glad she had the feeling that if those eyes opened and looked at her shed be sick with fear it wasnt an ugly or deformed face in fact the features were quite regular but there was something about it that made her wish she wasnt looking at it something dark and cruel something that loved pain and was bargaining with her only because it had no choice we hear said the chorus of voices which now came from the single face although the lips didnt move why because the fire elemental replied with pride welling in every word she is better than your mistress the face in the wall did not react one way or another to this statement how can i free you she asked her voice trembling yet determined break her defenses and you will free us came the reply in a low and ugly rumble swear that you will be very careful what you promise came the thought this is the elemental world and words have more weight here than in the real world if she promisedand failedthere would be a different sort of price to pay and there was no telling what that price would be only that it could be very expensive and you do not want to owe an unknown penalty to a negative elemental i promise i will try she said instead if you will give me the key to this place that holds me the face became very still for a moment as if all of the creatures speaking through it were consulting with one another then it spoke again follow the tree it said the countertree the tree of death and it faded back into the wall again but eleanor knew exactly what it meantit was a riddle probably given to her in that form because she had not promised to do anything but try but not a very clever one she was to trace the opposite path of the tree of life fortunately the tree of life happened to be one of the major tarot layouts as well as the key to the kabala or she wouldnt have known what the face in the wall meant mentally she retraced her steps from the center of the maze and realized with relief that she would only have to go back and change her last turning why are you here with me she asked as she set out on the new pattern greatly relieved that she was no longer going to have to touch those walls because although i cannot help you directly i have a function i can perform for you he said and tilted his head to the side expectantly a function he can perform for me abruptly she realized that he already had youyou are an intermediary she exclaimed stopping dead in her tracks you can negotiate with the other elements he nodded gravely that is my function and if you can make your way from this place i will she replied fiercely and when i doi have some ideas a faint smile flickered over the beings face i rather thought as much he said and gestured lead on she did and something else occurred to her as she followed the path of the antitree alison had made a very grave mistake by throwing her into this place this state she probably thought that she was imprisoning eleanor further and it must have been that alison had drugged her the opiates had a long history of being used to access occult states which was why people who had no business being in such a state used them as easy ways to attain knowledge maybe alison had assumed being drugged was going to make her easier to handle and that would have been true if she had not been learning discipline and control all this time and if she had not already been traveling in the tarot realm and alison was accustomed to thinking only in terms of commanding and coercing the creatures of her element it must not have even crossed her mind that eleanor might find alliesor at least something willing to bargain with herhere alison would have done better to have bound and gagged her if eleanor got her way alison would live to regret that error but first she still had to escape from the spellmaze before alison delivered her physical body to whatever fate the earth master had in mind august longacre park warwickshire by the time reggie reacted to eleanors flight it was too late she was out of sight before he could get to his feet and in the end all he could find of her was the gloves she had left on the bench beside him he could not hope to find her not now he had no idea where she had run toand even if he left the ball and went straight to the arrows what was he to do there force his way inside demand that they produce her if her stepmother had gone to such lengths to hide her there was no reason on earth why she should conjure the girl up simply because he demanded it slowly and cautiously reg the first one over the barricades is the first one shot with light and music and laughter spilling out of the doors and windows above him he returned to the garden bench to try and make some sense of what had just happened one moment she had been talking with him perfectly sensiblythe next she was fleeing as if pursued by demons and yet it couldnt have been what he said that sent her running away could it hadnt she managed to choke out that she loved him before she ran surely her stepmothers hold over her could not control her here in the privacy of longacres gardens unless he shook his head at the thought no surely not surely it was not possible that alison robinson was a magician was it he was completely unwilling to drop his barricades now if alison robinson was a magicianheaven alone only knew what she had set in motion to try and ensnare him for one of her daughters there might be a spell just waiting for a break in his defenses by the time he found lady virginia just paying her farewells to her cronies as the guests began to depart and got her to come down into the garden with him the traces ofyesmagic were almost too faint for her to read all she could say for certain was that both earth magic of the darker sort and fire magic had left a hint of scent behind back inside please his godmother said when shed finished its altogether too damp and chilly for my bones lets adjourn to the library there should still be a fire there somewhat reluctantly he agreed he still wanted to go tearing after eleanor but he knew that would be the wrong thing to do he had no plan of action and to go into this without a plan was asking for trouble the earthwell dark magic of some sorthe had expected but who was the fire the only mages here were air unlesseleanor when he spoke his thoughts aloud incredulously lady virginia only shrugged as she extended her toes towards the library fire magicians are always more vulnerable to magic than other folk she pointed out if the girl is an elemental mage then her stepmother would have an easier time of it in trying to control her the hardest creature to affect by magic is someone who has none of it at all he fidgeted with the cane he had taken from the stand near the door and longed to be able to pace as he used to at times like these to think of poor eleanor down there in that repellent womans hands she looked at him sharply reginald she said very slowly are you in love with this girl he would have thought it was obvious to a far less astute person than his godmother but he replied yes yes i am your mother wont like it lady virginia cautioned shes common so are the americans that keep marrying into the peerage he snapped feeling an entirely irrational surge of irritation and so are the other two girls and mater would have no trouble at all throwing me to one of them ah but the americans have fortuneslarge fortunes his godmother retorted even if the girl inherited and theres no guarantee of that shes prosperous but no heiress and alison robinson is in burkes so presumably so are her daughters is she he replied someone with the name shes claiming is but anyone can claim to be a member of a family one is never going to encounter and i didnt find any mention of carolyn lauralee or either of alisons marriages in burkes if she is who she claims to be she was vetted by alderscroft lady virginia began and before she could continue her jaw tightened alderscroft who would swear his secondbest hunter was a member of the peerage if he thought it would serve the cause i begin to smell a rat reginald alderscroft may have used her before and certainly knows she lives in broom so he might have told her to keep an eye on you without bothering to tell me about it may i add but it is as certain as the sun rising in the east that she decided to aggrandize herself as soon as she saw the situation i knew there was something about that woman that i did not like i may very well discover more you wont like before im through reggie said grimly it wouldnt surprise me lady virginia reached out and took his hand please promise me that you will not go tearing down there this instant in your motor i would like tobut i feel that would be a very bad notion he replied with feeling i will go down there tomorrow i might actually catch the girl myself in which case i will bundle her up here and put her in your hands if there are coercions on heryou can deal with them against a creature like alison robinson i should think so his godmother told him in a tone that would have been arrogant in anyone but a mage of her ability ill open up your fathers workroom and prepare it heaven knows ive used it often enough in the past on our home ground reginald it would take an army of mages to defeat us if i cant find her immediately ill have to try subterfuge and fortunately i have an excuse he smiled thinly i have these and i will be looking for the girl who fits them he held up the pink silk gloves lady virginia raised an eyebrow forgive my skepticism reginald but virtually any girl whose hands arent completely ruined could fit into a pair of silk gloves oh no not these he retorted and spread out the fingers of the lefthand glove the three fingers lady virginia blinked ah she said well that puts a different complexion on things doesnt it rather like anne boleyns set of five rather like he folded the gloves carefully and tucked them inside his tunic id like very much to see either carolyn or lauralee fit that glove hmm lady virginia stared into the fire be careful what you wish for if the girls are like the mother they might find a way at whatever cost august elsewhere these wallsthey represent something it wasnt just spells that alison put to tie me to the hearth was it she asked her companion when the silence within the maze became unbearable no she has actually tied minor elementals into the spells so that she did not have to renew them so often the fire creature replied this is why the maze appears to be a living thing it actually is more than one ugh she shuddered and glanced at the walls around them colored a sad brown suggestions of faces continued to come and go is that as nasty as i think it is surely the fire creature regarded her soberly as certainly as you have been imprisoned by them they have been imprisoned by alison they may be creatures of darkness but they have spent the years as the bars of your cage the more she learned about alison the more she wanted to be free of her if ever there was someone evil iam not really here she reminded herself this is like the tarot world my body iswell wherever alison put it perhaps the cellar i must escape the maze and thenthen wake up from whatever she did to me but she had to wonder what would happen to the real eleanor if hercall it spiritselfwas hurt her mothers notebooks hadnt covered that possibility and what would happen if she didnt get back to herself in a few hours how long could her untenanted body sleep before life began to fade so strangeher body here felt real felt solid solid enough that her insides twisted with tension when she realized that she might be fighting against time as well as alison she didnt really expect to be able to leave the maze unopposed just because she had managed to strike some kind of bargain with the maze itself it did not follow that there were not more elemental earth creatures here to block her passage probably they would try to intimidate her first though above hervague darkness they walked on a surface that was very like dead grass and the only light here came from her companion if ever there was a place of stagnation this was it the air was dry and acrid with a faint scent of corruption and the maze walls did not get any better the deeper she went and just as she had expected once they were by her accounting roughly halfway through she sensed something up ahead of her when she turned the cornerthere it was she might have mistaken it for a brownie if she hadnt known better it looked like exactly like a childs picturebook illustration of a brownie in a red capbut it was the cap that gave it away this was a redcap a vicious little gnome with an insatiable appetite for murder it soaked its cap in the blood of its victims hence the name there was no point in even trying to negotiate with something like this it was completely evil and absolutely treacherous and if she had not been studying all four elements instead of just her own she would never have known that she felt her eyes narrow as she stepped threateningly towards the redcap there was power welling up in her she felt it rising inside and she knew that if she had to strike at this thing the power would answer her there were only two ways to deal with a redcap make it run or destroy it turning your back on it would be fatal hello daughter of adam the recap said wheedlingly looking up at her with an entreating gaze i am lost trapped here like you wont you help me find the way out of this maze i think not redcap she replied before the fire elemental could warn her i think you know the way out already dont you the redcaps face underwent a frightening transformation its eyes turned red with a greenish glow to the pupils it hunched over hands fumbling at its belt for the knife it probably had hidden there and it snarled showing sharp pointed teeth look out the fire creature called but she was already calling up fire herself in the shape of her salamanders they appeared out of nowhere as large as bloodhounds and fierce as lions two of them planting themselves between her and the redcap hissing the redcap leapt back with a curse it shook its fist at her and ran off into the depths of the maze since it wasnt going the way she planned she kept the salamanders from chasing it when it was gone they fawned around her like affectionate cats rubbing up against her and butting their heads into her hands the fire creature regarded them with amusement under other circumstances it said i would say that you have a remarkable way with animals i am glad that you have won their loyalty so am i she replied fervently should i keep them with us definitely i have no idea what might lie ahead of us except that i cannot imagine that there will not be more trouble she just nodded she doubted very much that the next obstacle they encountered would be so obliging as to run away august longacre park warwickshire reggie didnt sleep very muchbut then he hadnt expected to and he had flown and fought on less rest than hed gotten last night he had gone over his plan so many times it was engraved in his mind not that he really expected to find the robinsons following his plan no he would just have to keep his wits about him and try to find a way to get to eleanor once they were together he didnt think that even alison would try to oppose him taking her out she could summon a constable he supposedbut he doubted that the broom constable old as he was would do more than make a token effort to stop him and once eleanor was freed from whatever holds alison had placed on her the shoe would almost certainly be on the other foot he suspected that she had some ugly tales to tell it was very hard though to have to rise breakfast as usualand wait wait because if he went down at any time before say noonno one would let him in certainly eleanor was not permitted to answer the door she hadnt before when hed called and that was probably to keep her from being recognized by a visitor or from blurting out a plea for help if he arrived too early no one would be awake and he could hardly pound on the door and bellow at them to let him in not unless he wanted to tip his hand no above all he didnt want anyone to know what he was up to until it was too late to do anything about it the robinsons had left about threeso they would not be receiving visitors until noon at the earliest so he would have to wait exceptif he was going to go into a confrontation with an earth master his simple barricades were not going to suffice so after breakfast with a feeling of fear that would have paralyzed him had he not been eaten alive with worry for eleanor he took a certain back staircase that his mother was not even aware existed up to a room on the same floor as the servants quarters except that this room connected with no other chamber in the house and the door to the staircase was carved with sigils that would allow only an elemental master to see it it took a terrible effort for him to take each step upwardsbecause each step brought him nearer to the moment when he must give up his defenses and accept the power back into his handsand with that power open himself to attack he was sweating by the time he reached the landing it was his fathers old workroom a corner room with tall windows on two sides lined with books and cabinets for supplies on the other two and with a floor of white marble inlaid with a magic circle in silver and lady virginia was already there she was dressed for the occasion in a loose skyblue robe of silk with her icewhite hair in a single plait down her back curiously enough this made her look younger rather than older i thought you might turn up she said as he closed the door to the staircase behind him so i didnt put up the wards yet he shivered involuntarily if you had any idea how frightened i am then he steeled himself before the panic could rise up and choke him but i dont have a choice do i not if alison robinson is a masterand all of the preliminary work i have done tells me she is lady virginia replied grimly i believethough i am not yet surethat she is the one responsible for that plague of revenants outside your fathers old shields i cant imagine why she would set them on you but im not very good at deciphering the plans of individuals with the kind of twisted soul capable of summoning something like that up in the first place reggie nodded then he spoke the hardest words he had ever said in his life tell me what to do godmother he begged help me please i need my powers back and we dont have a great deal of time before i face her then i will need to force your shields open she replied jaw set and it wont be easy on you he bowed his head with the feeling that he was baring his neck to the axe i never thought it would he said with miserable determination august elsewhere the end of the maze was very near and eleanor had routed a good halfdozen nasty creatures that had tried to ambush her on the way the worst had been the nightmare at least so far a truly dreadful black thing it was with far too many legs all of them ending in talons rather than hooves and long white fangs the salamanders had not been able to attack it and it had come charging straight at her and she had found herself with a flaming sword in her hands she had no more idea of how to use it than how to flybut slashing wildly at the nightmare had made it shy sideways to avoid the attack aborting its charge it had stared at her with evil red eyes for a moment then like the redcap it had retreated into the depths of the maze interesting her companion said as she let the sword go only to have it vanish into thin air the moment she loosed her hold on the hilt it appears that however alison is controlling or coercing these creatures it is not enough to make them face any sort of serious opposition i believe she has completely underestimated you i hope sol eleanor replied as her salamanders pressed up against her legs one on either side of her now she was one turn away from the exit to the maze or so she thought when she rounded this last corner she should be free of the spells that bound her to the hearth of the arrows but of course alison was not likely to let her go without a fight she turned the corner and found herself facing every creature she had encountered thus far and some new ones all lined up across the exitpoint to the maze august longacre park warwickshire reggie emerged from the workroom feelingunnerved unsettled no far too mild a word severely rattled and definitely drained those hardbuilt barricades were gone but he had yet to test the strength of his powers as an air master because he did not want to alert alison to the fact that those powers were back and neither did lady virginia psychologically he was a wreck for he had in the space of a few hours lived through and endured the sharpfocused memory of his ordeal after being shot down the difference was this time he had his godmother to guide him through it this time he had come out the other side still sane or at least relatively so but his nerves were raw and fear surged and ebbed unexpectedly making him wonder just how much control he could keep but they had run out of time it was midafternoon by the time lady virginia allowed him to go and some instinct warned him that alison robinson was going to do whatever she had planned for eleanor very soon he had to get down there nowor he suspected he would lose her forever his auto was waiting for him at the door as he had requested before he went up to the workroom he thanked heaven that she wasnt a temperamental beast in fact she might have been sensitive to his urgency for she fired up at the first spark all cylinders roaring like uncaged lions he threw the auto down the drive at a reckless pace and kept it up right to the outskirts of broombut the moment he was within sight of the place he throttled the racing engine down and proceeded at what seemed to his raw nerves to be a crawl this was not just to avoid knocking people down it was because things had to seem normal if alison suspected anything she could and probably would refuse him entrance it made him want to scream with impatience as he dawdled down the main street smiling tightly and waving at some of his cronies from the pub only one thought kept him steady alison did not know how much eleanor had said to him nor did she know they already knew each other so there should be no real reason in her mind to suspect how much reggie already knew or guessed she should not have felt the need to rush into a solution to the problem of eleanors escape or so he hoped and prayed there had been one good sign anywaylady virginia had been assiduously monitoring the area for signs of powerful magic ever since last night and there had been nothing at long last he pulled up to the edge of the street beside the arrows he parked the beast right there took out his cane and limped to the front doorway to ring the bell it was answered by carolyn who looked startled and confused the moment she set eyes on him reggie she exclaimed pushing a lock of hair out of her eyes what a delightful surprise we didnt expect you i know he said stretching his mouth in what he hoped was a genuinelooking smile but i had to come down here today i know how clever you all are and how you know just about everyone for miles around and i was hoping you girls could help me solve a mystery butof course please come in i cant think what im doing leaving you standing in the door like this she laughed was it his imagination or did it ring false were sending formal thankyou letters of course but since you are here i must tell you that your ball was wonderful i dont know when ive had a better time actually thats why im here he said seizing the opportunity with both hands as he stepped into the parlor at her direction the arrows was at least as old as the broom real genuine tudor construction the place betrayed its age with blackened beams whiteplaster walls and very low ceilings that made him want to duck his head you see i encountered someone at the ball but she left before i got a chance to find out who she was and i hoped you could help me with that me carolyn turned towards him as he took a seat beside the fire and he was sure he was not mistaken there was a flush of guilt on her cheeks he felt his gut tighten how could i help indeed as eager as we are to assist you in any way reggie i dont know what we could do in this case said alison robinson gliding into the room soundlessly he didnt jump but she had startled him moving so quietly there was something altogether snakelike about the way she moved if hed had hackles theyd have been up there were dozens of young women at your ball and all of them were masked for most of the evening ah he said brightly but i think you might know this girl and she has one very distinctive characteristic you see she wore these gloves he held out the pink silk gloves to alison who examined them with a faint frown on her face right until the moment when she realized that the lefthand glove had only three fingers then she started and paled for a moment and he felt his heart leap in triumph so they were up to something and they hadnt known eleanor had left anything of herself behind actually i believe you are correct she said recovering quickly and turning a bland face towards him i do know something about the girl who wore this glove if youll wait a moment i would wait a year if you could bring her to me reggie replied his heartbeat quickening with nervous tension should he not have presented the gloves to alison now she knew something was up but did she guess how much he knew about eleanor or ratherhow little she cant be going to bring eleanor theres some trickery going on here but before he could think of anything else to say alison had carried the gloves away with her and carolyn was babbling at him about the delights of the ball he tried unsuccessfully to get her onto any other subject or at least to slow down the torrent of words to no avail it was clear that she was babbling out of sheer panic now and nothing he said was going to penetrate the wall of fear she had around her he sat on the edge of his seat alive with tension trying to listen past carolyns wall of words to what was going on in the next rooms was there the creak of a door something slamming a muffled exclamation was there the sound of a struggle here we are alison said brightly making him jump here is your mysterious girl reggiei am afraid that my lauralee was playing a bit of a prank on you pretending to be a stranger to you girlish high spirits and all she smiled thinly of course she didnt want to spoil the joke by allowing you to guess who she was so she tells me she ran away from you in the garden sure enough behind alison came lauraleebut a very pale lauralee with her teeth clenched though she tried to feign that she was completely normal and she was wearing both gloves he stood as they both entered the room lauralee he said immediately on his guard but hoping he wasnt showing it how could i not have recognized you i wore a wig she said her voice strained her mouth stretched in something that looked nothing like a smile and i took care to disguise my voice as he neared her he saw that her pupils were very large and heard a faint slur to her words as if she was drugged yes there was no trickery she wore the gloves but he knew very well that the last time he had seen her she had owned the usual number of fingers which must mean the thought made him sick the girl must be mad or her mother or both probably both he might have spared a moment to pity her if such an act had not simply shown him that she was as ruthless as her mother and fear of what they might be doing to eleanor made him act in a way he probably wouldnt have otherwise he reached out and seized both her hands before she could prevent it and gave the left one a squeeze she nearly fainted and seeping blood stained the side of the glove where she must have only now cut off the little finger of her left hand he looked up at alisons face and saw that it was suffused with rage he had them i think he began and pain and blackness descended on him from behind august broom warwickshire well carolyn you have redeemed yourself in my eyes alison said as reggie crumpled to the floor carolyn stared first at him then at her mother wideeyed the poker she had used to hit him with still clutched in her nerveless fingers oh dont look at me like that you havent the strength to kill him you have merely rendered him unconscious go and get my kit i fear we will have two bundles to smuggle out after dark not one she turned to lauralee who had reeled against the wall whimpering with pain cradling her injured left hand in her right i warned you to be sure that you had cauterized the wound properly and that the laudanum had taken effect before you came out of the kitchen i couldnt help it he squeezed my hand mother lauralee replied her voice faint and full of agony he broke open the wound so he knew all along he came here looking for eleanor and he knew it was eleanor behind the mask this is worse than i thought she stood rigid rooted in thought arms crossed over her chest tapping one finger against her forearm thats it the only hope we have is to take him to the hoar stones and make him forget her lauralee blinked up at her mother through tears of pain can you do that well i can make him forget a great deal and her with it alison admitted i can erase in general every memory he has had since he came home then when he wakes it will be up to you to convince him that he proposed marriage to you last night in the garden and that he has been in love with you all along carolyn who had not yet moved put the poker aside but wont that be a problem with his mother she faltered she wants him to marry within the peerage thats what everyone was saying last night and how do we explain that he was injured and his loss of memory alison shrugged well say we found him wandering and brought him back it isnt as if there havent been rumors about the steadiness of his mind she frowned this was getting more complicated by the moment and dangerous too well have to be quick though if he doesnt come back by morning his motorcar is here lauralee pointed out people will know that by now everyone in the village knows that alison gave vent to her feelings with a curse carolyn flinched then one of usme i supposewill have to drive our auto and one of us will have to drive his ill drive it warrick locke said from the stairs heres your kit alison it was still on the hall table he handed her the morphia kit and looked down at the prone form of reggie fenyx with a lifted brow i hope you didnt damage him carolyn things could be cursed difficult if you have so what if she did alison retorted filling a syringe and kneeling beside her victim it will make my job easier bloody hell i hate complications then lets plan this very carefully locke said grimly because this isnt just complications alison youve physically assaulted a man and not just any man but a peer and not just any peer but a genuine hero of the war if he remembers what he came for and what happened to him the law is going to come into it and i very much doubt i can get you out of it she turned to stare at him as she removed the needle from the vein in reggies arm you assume i havent been in this position before if you have that was in london in a part of london where people know better than to be curious he said coldly and you must have dealt with someone who was a nonentity this is a tiny village where everyone knows everyone elses business and this is captain reginald fenyx baron have a care alison this is dangerous she took a deep breath and held it to prevent herself from snapping at him he was right she needed his help the trouble was it was going to cost her men like warrick locke could wait decades for an opportunity to get their hooks set in a targetand once they did it was impossible to shake them off so what do you suggest she asked with feigned meekness after dark i pull reggies motor around to the old stable you bundle him up in a blanket and bring him out ill put him in the passengers side and wear his coat goggles and cap myself dont try to hide him i want people to see that there is someone with the driver though not who ill take him straight to the hoar stones leave him there and drive his motor back along the route youll be coming where ill abandon it in a ditch lockes eyes glittered as he spoke there was no mistake he enjoyed the part he was now playing and he was going to get his pound of flesh out of it youll bring the girl along and pick me up well all go back to the hoar stones drop the girl down the mineshaft either before you do your work with reggie or afterwards depending on how things work out you will work your spell on his memories while i damage his clothing to make it look like he was in an accident everyone around here knows how he likes to drive like a demon that will explain the crack on the head and the amnesia afterwards she had to admit it was a brilliant plan do we leave him with the motor she asked reluctantly she really didnt want him out of her sight but yes but well drive to that coachinginn we stayed at and one of us will go rushing in there to report the accident locke replied while people are milling about well slip away and there will be no connection between us and his condition and as for eleanor she figures into the plan too well leave eleanors old coat and perhaps a bundle of belongings in his auto and once hes identified no doubt someone will come around to ask why he was here well say we never saw him then identify the coat and the clothing that will give us the excuse to send a searchparty back in that area to look for her once youre sure shes gone quite mad everyone will assume she eloped with him or he persuaded her to go away with him and without a doubt everyone will assume the worst of her she ground her teeth but smiled at him damn the man it was a good plan making the best possible use of all of the disasters that fate had thrown at them it will work she conceded it will do more than merely work locke said raising his chin arrogantly its the way to guarantee that one of your girls marries the boy dont you see if lady devlin thinks that he and eleanor were off together unchaperoned perhaps on their way to a wedding at the worst or a clandestine liaison at the best shell be terrified that you will demand he marry eleanor bad enough to tie her precious boy to a commoner but one whos gone mad and if instead hes fixated on lauralee and you give your consent shell be so relieved that you arent making a fuss about the stepdaughter that youll have no trouble getting her to agree to the wedding herself she thinks youre gentrypoor but blue blood by the time she finds out differently it will be too late especially if you hasten the wedding on the grounds of scandal the war or both he was right curse him well of course he was right he was used to thinking in terms of blackmail she hadnt much practice in that particular art she had always dealt with her enemies in much more direct waysand with those from whom she wanted favors by means much more arcane what about me carolyn mewed plaintively if reggies going to marry lauralee what about me at that moment alison caught a glimpse of something avid in lockes eyes and knew what he was going to demand as his payment for all of this after all she would now control the robinson fortune outright once she was appointed guardian to a madwoman carolyn would stand to inherit all that lauralee wouldnt need it once she was lady devlin carolyn was pretty soon to be wealthy nonetooclever and just as ruthless as locke she was a good match for him by his way of thinking he would not have to hide things from her and she would be just as eager to cover up irregularities as he was oh youll have your wedding too carolyn she replied with a little nod to locke just as splendid as lauralees ill see to that and she would see to it that the girl found locke acceptable too after all it was a great deal easier to put a deathcurse on a man whose wife would do anything her mother said because the clever warrick locke was getting too clever and alison robinson had not gotten where she was now by allowing anyone to have a hold over her august elsewhere eleanor stared at the small army of earth elementals facing them and put one hand on the back of a salamander to steady herself there was no way that she could battle all of themtheyd overwhelm her by sheer numbers was it possible that she could call for more help well what do i lose by trying she didnt close her eyes but she did turn her focus inward calling up from memory the glyphs and sigils that would bring one of the great elementals many of whom had been worshipped as gods at this point she didnt particularly care which one either the only thing that she did stipulate in her mind was that she really didnt want to fight not even these things as she traced the last sigil in her mind the whole diagram suddenly flared in the air between her and the earth creatures hanging there like a fantastical fireworks display and beside her she heard a swift intake of breath her companion began to grow his nimbus of flame flared out engulfing herbut she felt nothing but a cool breeze on her skin and smelled nothing but the faint scent of cinnamon and clove he sprouted wings too and his head became birdlikeno hawklike and when he stopped growing at roughly twelve feet tall she recognized him or at least what he represented horus the egyptian god of the rising sun the son of osiris and isis she stared at him of all creatures the least likely or perhaps not she had been working through a tarot pack which employed many symbols out of ancient egypt horus was as likely as any other given that influence the earth creatures stared at him as well dumbfounded as the flaming sigils faded away he looked down at them then turned his head to stare at eleanor wings flaring do you still want to negotiate with them came his mild voice i think youre in a better position now the salamanders romped about his ankles as she looked up at him id rather not hurt anyone she said though a bit doubtfully if i can help it that is thats wise here he conceded theres no point in making more enemies than you have to they have long memories and hold grudges forever he turned to the earth creatures let us pass he said his voice taking on trumpetlike tones we would rather not harm you but we will fight to escape if we must you do not wish to fight us there was uneasy stirring from the line of earth creatures but no one moved finally the redcap spoke up sullenly all right for you to say but what about us what happens when the earth master discovers youve slipped the trap shell have us then for certainsure horus clacked his beak impatiently and if we break her protections first shell be yours then there were startled looks then the creatures began talking urgently among themselves eleanor couldnt even begin to recognize what they all were a good half of them hadnt been in any of her reading yet they all looked like things out of nightmare including of course the nightmare horus waited patiently until the murmuring stopped but if he had expected a direct answer he didnt get one instead the assembled creatures merely faded away into the shadows and the depths of the maze leaving the path open eleanor looked up at her protector and he down at her that is as direct an answer as you will ever have from the likes of them horus said the way is open for nowuntil they change their minds that was all she needed she ran forward out of the maze and into darkness she realized after a moment of lightheaded giddiness that at least part of the darkness was because there was a blanket over her head it was stifling and she could hardly think because she felt soso intoxicated thatsbecausei am alison had drugged her as she had suspected and there was still plenty of the stuff in her veins she jounced along lying on her side two sets of feet poking into her and the roar of an automobile engine near at hand it was hard so hard to thinkeven the fear that sat cold and primal in the pit of her soul was sluggish and her companion was gone now that she was in the real world again there was no one to advise her she fought her way through the glue that clogged her mind fire burning she was outside alisons spells and in control of her own powers now there must be something fire could do cancan i burn this stuffout of me there had been some hints of that in her mothers notes of a kind of healing that fire masters could do that literally burned out disease and poison this drug was poison in and of itself what did she have to lose alison was taking her away somewhere and it was just lucky shed broken free of the spell because otherwise shed be feeling the compulsions right now and at that thought she felt a cold certainty steal over her and with it the fear woke out of its sluggish sleep to seize her heart alison knew that so alison was planning on it why she had to clear this poison out of her veins so she could think clearly she had only one thing to try if she waited for the drug to wear off it might be too late she had to burn it out before alison expected it to wear off because alison certainly had locke with her still and perhaps lockes brutish manservant and there was no way she could escape them all once again she turned within concentrating on another sigil this time a simple one just as well because it kept slipping away from her as she felt herself floating away ateh malkuth geteth she had traced this thing a thousand times each name from her mothers notes attached to a particular stroke in the air with finger or wand but now she traced it in her mind instead of the air and muzzily tried to hold the image burning there it nearly escaped from her three times before she completed it and tried to put purpose to it its intention was to purify could it purify her blood only one way to find out it seemed to flutter in her mind like a bird impatient to fly it at least thought it had a purpose she set it free and let go if it didnt do what she wanted there wouldnt be a second chance august the hoar stones what did you do with him alison asked as locke made his way up the path to the hoar stones behind her with eleanor slung over his shoulder like a bag of coal she was impressed in spite of herself she was accustomed to seeing locke leave all of the work to his servant but it appeared he could manage quite a bit by himself hed certainly managed to bring reggie fenyx here on his own and he was carrying eleanor as if her weight was inconsequential hes in the lee of the rocks just outside the chamber locke replied hes still out cold i thought youd want to keep the chamber itself clear so you can work very wise leave the girl there as well alison said absentmindedly they were still a good thirty yards from the hoar stones yet already she could feel its power drawing her had the work shed done here last spring woken some ancient source of magic from a long slumber well if that was so all the better she reached out to the source of the power greedily and felt her lips stretching in a grin as it responded to her lovely lovely earthborn power whatever purpose the hoar stones had been originally meant to serve over the centuries there had been enough who had used it as a place of sacrifice that the ground here was as bloodsoaked as the fields of flanders blood spilled called power and this sort of power was the kind that answered her hand the best she felt like a child in a sweetshop told to take what she wanted finally she was going to have it all the power filled her thick and intoxicating with the hint of corruption she found so irresistible and she moved into the chamber as if in a trance as locke dumped eleanor beside another bundle of blanket and clothing just outside it it occurred to her then that locke was probably stronger than he looked reggie fenyx was no small man and locke had somehow manhandled him from the motor all the way up here then againlocke might have managed to rouse reggie enough to get him to walk even unconscious a clever use of magic could have gotten reggie to stumble along in lockes wake or in front of him and if he damaged himself somewhat well so much the better hed look like someone who had been staggering about after an accident she put them both temporarily from her mind as locke and the girls joined her in the chamber this was going to be a difficult piece of work and she needed to concentrate on it reggie lay quite still as alisons henchman dumped someone beside him the last thing he wanted any of them to know was that he was awake and aware and prepared to actif feeling nauseous and halfcrippled counted as being prepared to act little did any of them know that hed been using his painmedications for so long that he had built up a tolerance for opiates the air moving around his face when the auto was in motion had served to arouse him and the drive out into the country had given him long enough to get his brain moreorless working again when the man had mumbled some sort of halflearned charm over him hed felt the intent of it through the very minimal shields he had put up and had acted the part of an automaton staggering up the shadowshrouded path in the mans wake unfortunately he was without a cane and the ground was anything but even he didnt even want to think about the damage he had done to himself trying to walk he thought hed felt something tear loose around his kneecap once the pain of his knee had burned what was left of the drug out of him altogether and he must have stumbled and fallen a dozen times evidently the man had expected that because locke just stopped whenever that happened waited for reggie to pick himself up then led him on reggie had been perfectly ready to fall over where the man pointed by that time his head was perfectly clear but it ached so much from what he presumed was a blow and his knee was in such agony that by the time he realized that he was alone among these ancient stones it was too late to do anything about it he could already hear someone coming up the same path all he could do was feign unconsciousness and wait to see what happened next what happened was that locke dumped someone else practically on top of him someone small and very warm eleanor he continued to lie quietly as the sound of the others moved off a little the way he was positioned he couldnt see anything anyway his face was turned towards the megalithic stone and the other person had been dropped behind him but he was sure it was eleanor it wasnt just the sense that it was her or instinct logic said that was the likeliestbut why what was alison planning it was nothing good for either of them but it was eleanor he was worried about the most he represented the means to a very large fortune as well as a kind of life she clearly aspired to if she got rid of him she lost her access to that life lady virginia would see to that no it made more sense far more sense for her to try and work some bedazzlement on his mind to make him pliant and willing to marry one of her wretched daughters it was eleanor that he was concerned about he still didnt know how eleanor factored into all thisexcept that she was now clearly an obstacle in the path to alisons goals he couldnt dismiss the idea that they meant to murder herafter all who would notice no one in broom even gave her existence a second thought now even more chilling was the thought that alison might murder eleanor in order to get the power she needed to control him and he was patently in no shape to take them on in a straighton physical contest he wasnt even sure he could manage a successful escape the longer this situation dragged on the less confident he became and on top of that as bad as his physical condition already was he knew it was rapidly deteriorating lying here on the ground was making his muscles stiffen and there was no point in pretending otherwise he had a concussion that wasnt getting any better either his head pounded and though he tried to think through the pain and the nausea it was getting harder to put two coherent thoughts together with every passing moment his mouth was dry and a slow serpent of fear had begun crawling up his spine making him feel weak and helpless he could sense power rising very near byearth power and even though it only brushed by him in passing the moment it touched him he felt panic stifling him he knew that sort of powerborn of blood and death he had met its like before when he had been buried in that trench alison began chanting somewhere on the other side of the stones her voice echoing strangely and he sensed the power awakening and answering her call he felt a whimper rising in his throat and a small warm hand clamped itself over his mouth shh eleanor breathed in his ear its all right try not to make a sound alison and the rest are busy right now if were very careful we might be able to get away before they realize were gone and go where he thought wildly but he knew she was right whatever alison was up to there was a point shed be so preoccupied with controlling what she was raising that she should be oblivious to anything but what she was doing the only question was could he even walk much less run its not as if i have a choice he reminded himself its runsomehowor lie here and let her do whatever shes going to do even though fear was welling up inside him and making him want nothing more than to curl up where he was and hide inside himself trying to huddle inside himself was not an option now even if he had felt willing to let them do whatever they wanted to him what were their plans for eleanor if he gave up to the fear he would be abandoning her but the fear had a mind of its own where he was concerned despite his efforts to resist it and all the work that lady virginia had done with him he felt it taking him over paralyzing him flooding his heart with chill until there was nothing real for him except that fear his control slipped to the edge of loss and tremors shook his body and then the miracle occurred eleanors hand moved down from his mouth to rest over his heart and warmth began to spread from it not just physical warmth eithera psychic warmth that stopped his shaking and drove the fear back a wonderfully fierce passion that had no time for creeping terror it was like magic no it was magic it was fire magic the complement and perfect partner to airfire magic being directed by the sure hand of someone who if she was not yet a master would certainly one day become one before he could wonder where she had suddenly gotten that skill a set of shields grew up around both of them slowly so slowly that at first he thought the perimeter of warming around him was some sideeffect of the magic she was working on him the he realized that she was building shieldsnot as he would have expected out of a fire mage with a showy rush of upwelling vibrant power but slowly as if beginning from the barest glowing coals and building a fire by patiently feeding those coals a little air a little fuel straw by straw by that time he was no longer shaking though his head still ached and he felt sick his mind was clear again not that he wasnt afraid and so was she he sensed it in the rigidity of her body where it lay wedged against his and the way she was tremblingbut fear was no longer paralyzing him i need to help herand it has to be just as subtle so that we dont alert alison to what were doing first he needed to help her with those shields thencould he call a sylph and sent it for help would one even come so near the poisonous dark earth power that alison was raising he had to try the nearest help was lady virginia and the only way to get word to her was via an air elemental but it would be the first time he had called one since the crash would they even come to him anymore hes awake that was more than eleanor had hoped for she hadnt even cared that he was shaking hard enough to rattle both of them shed been hearing bits about this shellshock business from sarah and it didnt surprise her at all that reggie suffered from itfine so he was overwhelmed by fear well she had the counter to fear the weapon to drive it back fear couldnt stand against the fire of passion but one thing did surprise her before it had been as if he was surrounded by an impenetrable wall that allowed nothing arcane to get in at himbut which was also opaque to his senses so that he never knew that she was a fire mage nownow he was open open enough that she responded to his fear completely on instinct she put her hand over his heart and willed her power into him fire passion courage heart fire was all of these things and more but these were the ones that were important now to shore up his crumbling emotions and give him strength to find his feet again she sensed it she knew it that was all he needed just a little helphe wanted to fight his own fear but he was so worn by it that he hadnt the strength very well he should have some of hers and when she sensed he was no longer shaking she went to work building shields around the two of them starting with the merest trace of power layering them up slowly so thatshe hopedalison wouldnt notice what was happening until it was too late it was after the first three or four layers had been constructed that she sensed another power joining hers she had never felt air magic before but even if her inner sight hadnt shown her the soft blue glow of it she had no doubt of what it was there was a lightness to it the coolness of intellect and a liveliness even as he layered in his own subtle shields interleaving them with hers she felt his magic feeding hers fire and air mingling until the blending was far more powerful than the mere sum of both and at that moment she felt her own courage rise she was terribly glad that he had joined her in creating the shields that surrounded them both because when she finally threw off the blanket they had bundled her in and sat up trusting that by this time alison was so deeply involved in her own magics that she wouldnt notice anything else going on what she saw made her lose her hardwon courage for a moment the very stones of this neolithic monument were glowing a muddy ugly yellow with alisons newly raised power oh not glowing to ordinary sight but to the trained inner eye of a magician there was no mistake none at all this was an old old power and it answered to alison slowly but it was answering and it was as dark a power as alison could have wished she pulled the blanket off reggies head and tugged at his shoulder as he sat up much more slowly than she had she didnt have to direct his attention to the stones he saw it on his own he pulled her head towards his face and put his mouth right up to her ear to whisper thats not good she nodded we have to get out of here now he continued urgently can help me get to my feet she nodded harder she got to her feetslowly and with a great care for making sure she didnt break a twig or dislodge any rattling stones but there was one thing that she she knew she had to do if they were going to walk out of here she had to find him some sort of support a stick he could use as a cane his knee could not possibly be in good shape right now except of course that she couldnt actually see in the shadowshrouded woodlot in the dark of night to find any such thing all right i need someoneor somethingthat can see with infinite care she pushed out the shields on the forestside of their protections until they extended well into the undergrowth then she called a salamander she stipulated that it was to be a very very small salamander the kind that had first come to her scarcely bigger than a tiny kitten alison hadnt noticed the little creatures when they were under her own roof with luck she wouldnt notice one now she had no fire for it and this was far far too close to inimical power she wasnt sure any fire elemental would answer her here but her heart leapt when without so much as a spark of real fire to feed fromit still camel it wreathed apprehensively around her wrists and through her fingers every movement of it telling her that it was not happy to be near so much dark power she soothed it as best she could and tried to impress on its mind what she neededa good stout stick sound and strong and not too short it hesitated for a moment regarding her with glowing yellow eyes then darted off into the brush coursing back and forth like a beagle on a scent but staying within the protection of the shields she knew when it had found what she had asked for by the way that it darted out of the brush towards her then back in again it wasnt going to talk to her not here wise alison might well hear such a thing she followed it treading very carefully never putting her full weight on her foot until she knew there was nothing beneath it to make a sound that would betray them for the first time she was glad of her worn shoes the soles were so thin she could easily feel what was under her feet pushing carefully through the undergrowth she found the salamander running up and down the length of the stick which was a bit longer than the canes reggie normally usedmore like a quarterstaff well that was not such a bad thing it might make a better weapon at need and the longer it was the less likely it would be that reggie would need to lean on her she dismissed the salamander with her thanksit was clearly growing terrified at the feel of the terrible earth power outside the shields and she didnt blame it with infinite care she pulled the stick out from the undergrowth little by little until with a sigh of relief she got it free she turned around with it in her grip in time to see something wispy sinuous and pale blue streaking away from reggies hands she hadnt gotten a good enough look at it to tell what it was but she hoped he was sending for help she tiptoed back to him and handed him the stick with a look of relief he took it gladly and used it to get himselfwith her helpto his feet now which way he whispered she shook her head i dont know she whispered back i never saw anything she might not have been unconscious when she was brought here but she had been bundled in a blanket truth to tell she hadnt a clue which direction to go in reggie clung to the rough staff eleanor had found for him and tried to think had the path into this place been between those two flat stones he was facing now or mother shrieked a young female voice behind him theyre awake theyre trying to sneak away too late a soundless explosion of sickly yellow light impacted against their shields he felt eleanor react just in time to strengthen them and a second later he was reinforcing her fire magic was better for shields anyway you couldnt wear away at fire shields the fire just ate everything you threw at it even nasty stuff of the sort that alison was throwing at them now fire just purified it then consumed it you could smother them drown them or blast through them if you were powerful enough but you needed either to be extremely powerful in the first place or to make an allornothing commitment to the attack to do so and alison hadnt yet made that kind of attack following directly on her attack came alison herself her face a mask of fury with her solicitor warrick locke right beside her he seemed to be unarmed but she had a wickedlooking knife in one handa ritual blade maybe but it was also a real weapon and he and eleanor were unarmed he gripped his stick like a quarterstaff but he knew that he wouldnt be of much help with his leg ready to give out at any moment real fire physical fire suddenly sprang up in a circle around them following the line of the shields and setting fire to the undergrowth it was a waisthigh perimeter of flame that kept alison and her minions from getting at her victims physically reggie couldnt do exactly the same thingbut he could call a stormwind to lash at their adversaries with the branches of trees and bushesand he did carolyn shrieked with indignation and warrick locke ducked get them alison shouted furiously over the howling wind as her hair escaped from its pins and whipped in tendrils around her head like the snakes of a medusa reggie expected another attack on their shields and indeed one came a dull blow that actually drove the shields back a little it didnt matter the elemental fire devoured the rest of the attack and the line of physical fire simply followed the shields and locke shook his head when alison gestured furiously at him and the glow of power faded a bit from the megaliths he felt his heart leapeither she was losing control of it and it was sliding back into quiescence or else she was draining it with her attacks in either case unless she found another source of power soon she would be reduced to her own resources that was the moment when she seized warrick lockes wrist shouted something incomprehensible and locke screamed in fear and pain falling to his knees as he aged fifty years in a handful of seconds a few seconds more and alison dropped his wrist and the lifeless withered hulk of what had been a man fell to the side no longer moving where did she get that he knew what it was in theory earth masters healedand so could harm they grewand so knew how to destroy they could give lifeand take it it was what made them so dangerous when they went to the bad shocked to the core reggie just stared both her daughters were equally shocked and as a consequence didnt react quickly enough when their mother seized both of their wrists no he shoutednot that he cared for them and they had certainly been ready to consign him to whatever fate alison had prepared for him but no one should die like that but alison was evidently not ready to kill her own flesh and blood quite though the creatures she cast aside first carolyn then lauralee were never going to attract anyones attention again except as objects of pity alison turned towards them again her eyes glowing with rage and power her hands crooked into claws and all around her the stones were incandescent with terrible power she gestured with a crooked finger and the earth rose in a wave and crushed out the physical fire over half of the periphery of the shields leaving behind only the shields of elemental fire and air themselves as protection eleanor swallowed down fear and nausea and tried to think their shields werent going to hold not for long since they were feeding off nothing but her own strength there had to be a way to stop her she held onto reggies arm and backed up a step so that he did the same a slow terrible smile stretched alisons lips in a dreadful mockery of pleasure she gestured again and this time it was a horde of those horrible gnomethings that rose up out of the raw earth and flung themselves at the shields eleanor gathered her wits and called her salamanders once again faithful and protective they came leaping out of the flames of the dying fires dashing towards alisons gnomes but they were joined by something eleanor had never seen before slender sinuous things like legless dragons they didnt seem to have much in the way of attacking ability but whenever they whipped themselves around a salamander the fire elemental grew markedly larger or brighteror both the salamanders reached the line of gnomes and this time the gnomes didnt run there were more of them than there were salamanders and they swarmed the fire elementals threatening to pull them down but whatever the salamanders came into contact with burst into flame the salamanders werent getting off unscathed however the gnomes had heavy clubs and spears and they were perfectly prepared to use them then a dozen of them got through and reggie lurched forwards to interpose himself between them and her two frantic salamanders raced towards them and a sylph a delicate winged creature suddenly popped into existence hovering in midair the salamanders got one each and the fairylike being might have looked delicate but she accounted for the other four with her bow and arrows but not before two of the got to reggie and while he was fending one off with his staff the second ducked under a blow and smashed into reggies bad knee with his club reggie toppled over with a chokedoff cry of agony as the winged girl filled the evil creature with three swift arrows in succession with a wordless cry of fury eleanor reached for more powerin what might have been an unexpected place not to the physical fires being extinguished by more gnomes but downdown past the layer of earth where alisons power lay down past the planets stony skin down into the place where the earth itself gave way to fire and the molten rock showed which of the powers was stronger no it was alisons turn to shout as she concentrated all of her anger and fury on eleanor the fury began to take shape rising out of the earth before them a giant not the sort that jack had met at the top of his beanstalk that giant uncouth as he had been was a paragon of intelligence and sophistication next to this thing it was made of the earth that it rose from nearshapeless it had a blob of rancid clay for a head with two holes gouged out for eyes at the bottom of each of which glowed the same sicklyyellow light as suffused the stones a misshapen lump defined a nose and beneath that was an empty yawn of a mouth it had no neck to speak of the head seemed to grow directly from the mosscovered massive shoulders and as yet it had no discernable arms or legs that changed in a moment a clublike arm with undifferentiated mittenhands reached out snatched up a battling gnome and salamander together and tossed them both into its gaping maw devouring them both with a single gulp it grew a trifle and reached out for another pair of fighters horrified eleanor looked away for a momentand caught sight of alison her stepmother was transfixed by the battle partly because she was pouring everything she had into her creation and partly in mesmerized pleasure at the carnage but she had forgotten something she had dropped her additional protections relying only on her old unaugmented shields and eleanor now knew how to unweave thoseshe had used the same key on her shields as she had on the spells binding eleanor to the hearthstone reggie had struggled to his good knee and was staring in horror at the giant shaking in every limb his eyes wide she grabbed his arm and shook it he wrenched his gaze away from the giant and looked up at her his face was so pale he looked like a corpse we have one chancel she shouted over the bass growls of the giant help me from somewhere he dragged up the final dregs of his courage life came back into his eyes her shields she cried forget about the giantdrop our shields then come in air and fire together and follow my lead he nodded he dropped the staff and she crouched beside him they clasped hands and let their own shields go alison howled in triumph the giant echoed it and wrenched himself up further out of the earth alisons shields flickered as she let the last of her concentration slip from them and together a single melded lance of fire and air struck at the weakest point blasting it awayand the shields unraveled alison faltered and took a single step back the loss of her shields confused her for one vital moment and the giant turned wrenching its body completely out of the ground it stared at her for several long seconds her eyes widened as she realized in that instant that she was unprotected and that all around her were creatures she had forced to obey her with whatever weapon came to hand creatures who saw her momentarily unprotected like the giant that she had just created out of earth and blood and pain she looked up at it with her mouth open it looked down at her and then it fell upon her burying her alive in a mound of freshlyturned soil before she could make a sound the last of the gnomes swarmed over the mound burying themselves into the ground where she had been and suddenly there was silenceexcept for the mindless whimpering of the two creatures that had once been carolyn and lauralee reggie sank slowly to the ground his teeth gritted against the agony of his ruined kneeslowly only because eleanor caught him as he fell and eased him down that took the last of her strength and all she could do was to hold him as the remaining salamanders curled around them both keeping them warm and protected and wait for dawn help or both epilogue november somerville college oxford university some of the girls thought the little studies in somerville college were cramped and shabby then again some of the girls were accustomed to the kind of accommodation one found at longacre park for eleanor even if the study had been the size and bleakness of her garret room at the arrows it still would have been paradise a raw november wind rattled the windows but she had a fine fire going and before long someone with less access to wood or a more slender budget for coal would be around to borrow a log or two one of the scouts had managed tea and toast eleanor had jam and butter from sarah by parcel this morning all was right with the world eleanor poured her visitor another cup of tea with a feeling of unreality it still seemed an impossibility that she was here settled in oxford a student at last in somerville college so asked doctor maya stirring honey from the longacre hives into her tea in lieu of unobtainable sugar how are you enjoying life as a student of literature its incredible eleanor replied i keep thinking im going to wake up in my bed in the garret and it will all have been a dream and the studies maya persisted giving her a penetrating look theyre going well eleanor laughed she knew what maya was thinking that reggies proximity would be a powerful distraction little did she know that he was harder on her than her tutor and she was harder on herself than both of them put together i think my generation is going to be a trial to those who follow us she told the doctor those of us who are here are determined to prove that we can be as valuable as the ones who left to become vads or do some other sort of warwork and when oxford grants us degreeswhich they willwe are going to be among the first in line to demand ours compared to what alison kept me at this is light duty she sighed but it was with content and compared to how ive been living at the arrows this place is a delight reggie keeps us both supplied with wood for the fireplaces from longacre and with other things too i find i can get a lot of help when i need it in trade for an egg or a jar of honey maya tskedwryly youre a regular blackmarketeer ill have to demand a bribe of some of those eggs to keep quiet im afraid they cant be had for any price in london eleanor laughed she was doing a lot of that these days she didnt remember much past alisons demise shed been drained almost to fainting and reggie was unconscious when lady virginia appeared like an avenging angel and carried them both off to longacre lady devlin hadnt known what to thinkat first she had with some bewilderment tentatively welcomed eleanor as the hithertounknown stepdaughter of her friend alison robinson then the situation rapidly unraveled it had been decided to say nothing about alison warrick locke and the girls the farmer upon whose land the hoar stones stood had found the autos the body of locke and the two nearwitless sisters constables digging in the churnedup earth had turned up the body of alison but other than that no one could make heads or tails of why the four were out there in the first place nor what had turned two young women into withered hags nor what had destroyed locke and once peter almsley intervened on behalf of the war office country constables being what they were it was decided that it was best not to ask too many more questions that couldnt be answered it was all written up that locke had murdered alison and buried her body and that the shock had prematurely aged her daughters who had killed locke in a fit of insanity this was more than scandal this was sensation and eleanor suddenly found herself unwelcome at longacre park however she was well on her feet by this time and the arrows was hers rightfully hers as she found out when the lawyers came to see her she didnt even need to lift a finger to do anything to help carolyn and lauralee if she chose not but she was not hardhearted enough to throw them onto the state since they were clearly not fit to stand trial they were currently being cared for in an institution for the criminally insanecomfortably at eleanors insistence and expense reggies knee was shattered past all hope eleanor had met maya when lady virginia had insisted that only maya could or should tend to reggies injuries and she and the doctor had hit it off immediately doctor maya had done her best but it was clear to her and to the army surgeon who came to examine him that he would never fly in combat again flying an aeroplaneat least the current modelsrequired having two good arms and legs so he as soon as he had gotten a cast on the leg he had put in for a transfer to the oxford branch of the royal flying corps training school hed been accepted of course with a record like his theyd have been insane not to accept him so he was here when eleanor had enrolled for her first year as a university student reading literature here there was no lady devlin to have to placate and they could meet as often as they liked which was generally every day you havent announced an engagement maya asked eleanor shook her head twisting the ring that reggie had unofficially given her i want to have finished my studies and passed my vivas even if they wont give me a degree yet and by then maybe lady devlin will have come around to the idea of having me as a daughterinlaw maya grimaced im sorry to hear that shes being an obstruction fortunately that was not a problem in my case but eleanor only shrugged she cant help how she was brought up she pointed out and besides we have an ally or two actually maya raised her eyebrows as eleanor carefully buttered a piece of toast i knew about lady virginia she was fairly obvious because if nothing else she would want reggie to marry another master who else the brigadier she blushed the old fellow had been amazingly kind to her and for the life of her she didnt know why maybe it was just because he was fond of reggie and reggie was clearly as blissfully happy in her presence as she was in his hes on our side too and i think he haswell a kind of secret weapon i think hes started to court lady devlin and if he is shell find it hard to be against something that hes for really doctor maya laughed well the sly old fox he knew about devlin being a master you knowone of the few people who arent mages who ever do find out about us i dont think he ever let reggie know that he knew but hes an old crony of alderscroft and thats where it all started and it was partly his doing that devlin met reggies mother in the first place i dont know the details but he introduced them at some point ah eleanor replied thoughtfully that explains a great deal she took a sip of her tea at any rate my magical studies are coming along well too my tutor thinks that the tarot approach is a good one so were keeping on with it and reggie says thats another reason not to rush into a marriage he says that before we even think about settling down i need to have a firm control on my powers because children with masters on both sides tend to be precocious when it comes to magic she flushed a little maya pretended not to notice talking about children already is he she said nodding in that case i dont think i need to go and interrogate him about his intentions eleanor flushed deeper oh no hes sound definitely sound she said laughing and fanning her cheeks in fact hes my best help aside from my official tutor we have special permission to work at the bodleian the viceprincipal doesnt like it but since the principal is another elemental master she doesnt say much she just glares at us when she sees us in public together she shrugged she means well and so i dont care ive only been here for this term and she has no idea what kind of student i am she may think im here only so i can be near reggie as soon as she realizes im serious about my studies shell probably stop acting like a mother superior maya looked at her watch well i should love to make a longer visit but i cant if im to catch the train no dont get up she urged when eleanor started to rise i can find my own way out and the weather is hideous you get back to your books and keep that lad out of trouble i had to scold him for trying to do too much again when maya was gone eleanor settled back in her chair with hamlet wedged open in front of her and a salamander wrapped around her feet keeping them warm if someone had waved a magic wand and given her three wishes this was exactly where she would have wished to be the only flaw in life was lady devlins opposition to having a commoner as her daughterinlaw which is next to no problem at all she thought warming the tea again by asking another salamander to pop out of the fireplace and wrap himself around the pot compared to unweaving alisons spells besides she wanted time she and reggie had scarcely known each other not that she didnt love him but love was not entirely rational she was not going to be lady devlin all over again either this was going to be a marriage of partners whether reggie entirely understood this yet or not and she said aloud whether hes comfortable with it or not a movement in the fireplace made her glance at it to see two bright blue eyes looking back at her just remember daughter of eve said the phoenyx who was her chief magical tutor and evidently a friend of horus if you need a negotiator you always have one at your disposal eleanor burst into laughter that she could not stop until her irritated neighbor knocked on the wall to make her quiet down
